'''Aban Abdel Malek Mahmoud Elias''' is an [[Iraqi American]] [[civil engineer]] who was born in Iraq, lived in [[Denver, Colorado]], then returned to Iraq. He was kidnapped on May 3, 2004, near his home in [[Baghdad]]. He was shown being held hostage in a video on [[Al Arabiya]] television station. While, blindfolded and posed against a stone wall, he was shown pleading for help. A transcript provided by Al Arabiya quoted him as saying in English:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“My name is Aban Elias from Denver, Colorado. I am a civil engineer working in Baghdad ... and we are working with the Pentagon. ... I was kidnapped, and I call upon Muslim organizations to interfere to release me.”''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He has not been seen or heard from since.

The Ahsani family control [[shell company|shell companies]] in the tax havens of the [[Channel Islands]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]], through which Unaoil's business is conducted. In March 2016 ''[[The Age]]'' described Unaoil as "the unseen intermediary in massive deals between the world's biggest energy companies and notoriously corrupt governments in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa."&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt; The family’s portfolio of real estate includes German nursing homes, and properties in multiple countries.&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt;

==Family members==

==Description==
Hundreds of thousands of emails sent within Unaoil and between members of the Ahsani family from 2001 to 2012 were leaked to investigative journalists and formed the basis for a series of stories in [[Fairfax Media]]'s ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper and the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in March 2016. ''The Age'' described Cyrus as "...in charge of day to day operations, though he often defers to his father for big decisions and important interactions" and described his character as "intelligent and good humoured: a man who inspires loyalty".&lt;ref name=MelAgeWho/&gt;

'''Al Wifaq''' ({{lang-ar|'''الوفاق'''}}) was a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[Jew]]ish [[nationalist]] organization promoting coexistence between Jews and [[Muslim]] communities in [[Morocco]].

Al Wifaq was established in February 1956 and stopped its activities the same year following the removal of the Jewish minister of Telegraphs ([[Benzaquen|Dr. Benzaquen]]) and the sudden prohibition on [[Aliya|Jewish emigration]] to [[Israel]].

His books discuss various contemporary subjects and themes, emphasizing philosophy's relevance to everyday life. He published ''Essays in Love'' (1993), which went on to sell two million copies. Other bestsellers include ''How Proust Can Change Your Life'' (1997), ''Status Anxiety'' (2004) and ''[[The Architecture of Happiness]]'' (2006).

In 1997 he published his first non-fiction book, ''How Proust Can Change Your Life'', based on the life and works of [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.identitytheory.com/people/birnbaum60.html "Author of ''The Art of Travel'' talks with Robert Birnbaum"], ''identitytheory.com''&lt;/ref&gt; It was a bestseller in both the US and UK.&lt;ref name="writerspace"&gt;[http://www.writerspace.com/interviews/botton1002.html "Interview with Alain de Botton"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105110007/http://www.writerspace.com/interviews/botton1002.html |date=5 January 2016 }}, writerspace.com; accessed 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by ''[[The Consolations of Philosophy]]'' in 2000. The title of the book is a reference to [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', in which philosophy appears as an [[allegory|allegorical]] figure to Boethius to console him in the period leading up to his impending execution. In ''The Consolations of Philosophy'', de Botton attempts to demonstrate how the teachings of philosophers such as [[Epicurus]], [[Montaigne]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and [[Socrates]] can be applied to modern everyday woes. The book has been both praised and criticized for its therapeutic approach to philosophy.

In 2004, he published ''[[Status Anxiety]]''.

In ''[[The Architecture of Happiness]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestyle.aol.ca/article/does-your-house-make-you-happy/256268/ "AOL interviews Alain de Botton about ''The Architecture of Happiness''"], ''lifestyle.aol.ca''&lt;/ref&gt; (2006), he discusses the nature of beauty in architecture and how it is related to the well-being and general contentment of the individual and society. He describes how architecture affects people every day, though people rarely pay particular attention to it. A good portion of the book discusses how human personality traits are reflected in architecture. He defends [[Modern architecture|Modernist architecture]], and chastises the [[vernacular architecture|pseudo-vernacular architecture]] of housing, especially in the UK. "The best modern architecture," he argues, "doesn't hold a mirror up to nature, though it may borrow a pleasing shape or expressive line from nature's copybook. It gives voice to aspirations and suggests possibilities. The question isn't whether you'd actually like to live in a [[Le Corbusier]] home, but whether you'd like to be the kind of person who'd like to live in one." {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In ''[[The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work]]'' (2009),&lt;ref name="OfficialBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaindebotton.com|title=Official Bio|publisher=Alain de Botton}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Botton produced a survey of ten different jobs, including accountancy, rocket science and biscuit manufacture. The book, a piece of narrative non-fiction, includes two hundred original images and aims to unlock the beauty, interest and occasional horror of the modern world of work. After a negative review of the book by ''New York Times'' critic [[Caleb Crain]], de Botton posted a scathing ad hominem attack against Crain.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Stephen |date=1 July 2009 |title=Alain de Botton tells New York Times reviewer: 'I will hate you until I die' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/5712899/Alain-de-Botton-tells-New-York-Times-reviewer-I-will-hate-you-until-I-die.html |newspaper=Telegraph |location=London |access-date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized for his remarks.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news |last=Neyfakh |first=Leon |date=1 July 2009 |title=Is Alain de Botton Sorry About Angry Comment Left On Critic’s Blog? |url=http://observer.com/2009/06/is-alain-de-botton-sorry-about-angry-comment-left-on-critics-blog/ |newspaper=Observer |location=London |access-date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, de Botton applied to a competition advertised among British literary agents by [[BAA Limited|BAA]], the airport management company, for the post of "writer-in-residence" at [[Heathrow Airport]]. The post involved being seated at a desk in Terminal 5, and writing about the comings and goings of passengers over a week. De Botton was duly appointed to the position. The result was the book, ''[[A Week at the Airport]]'', published by Profile Books in September 2009. The book features photographs by the documentary photographer Richard Baker, with whom de Botton also worked on ''The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work'', Page 328&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, de Botton published ''[[Religion for Atheists]]'', about the benefits of religions for those who do not believe in them. De Botton put it: "It's clear to me that religions are in the end too complex, interesting and on occasion wise to be abandoned simply to those who believe in them".&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophers Magazine ISSUE # 57 Page 26&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, he  published ''[[How to Think More about Sex]]'', one in a series of six books on topics of emotional life published by his enterprise, ''[[The School of Life]]''. {{Clarify|date=February 2014}}

In October 2013, he published ''[[Art as Therapy]]'', co-written with the Australian-Scottish art historian, John Armstrong. ''Art as Therapy'' argues that certain great works of art "offer clues on managing the tensions and confusions of everyday life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cooper.edu/events-and-exhibitions/events/free-lecture-alain-de-botton-art-therapy "Art as Therapy"], cooper.edu; accessed 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, de Botton published his fourteenth book, a title called "[[The News: A User's Manual]]", a study of the effects of the news on modern mentality, viewed through the prism of 25 news stories, culled from a variety of sources, which de Botton analyses in detail. The book delved with more rigour into de Botton's analyses of the modern media which appeared in ''[[Status Anxiety]]''.

===Newspapers, lecturing and television===
De Botton used to write articles for several English newspapers, and from 1998 to 2000, wrote a regular column for ''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]''. He travels extensively to lecture and has his own production company, Seneca Productions, which makes television documentaries based upon his works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaindebotton.com/pages/about/index.asp?PageID=110 The Architecture of Happiness], ''Official Website''&lt;/ref&gt; He has given lectures at [[TED (conference)|TED conferences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ted.com/speakers/alain_de_botton |title= Alain de Botton: Philosopher |year=2011 |website=TED: Ideas Worth Spreading |publisher=TED Conferences, LLC |location=TED Conferences, LLC, 330 Hudson St. 11th Floor, New York, NY 10013 |access-date=26 February 2018 |quote=Through his witty and literate books, and his new School of Life, Alain de Botton helps others find fulfillment in the everyday}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, he spoke in [[Edinburgh]] about "Atheism 2.0", an idea of [[atheism]] that also incorporates our human need for connection, ritual and transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_atheism_2_0.html Ted.com], ''TED Talks|Alain De Botton: Atheism 2.0''&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, he spoke at [[Oxford University]] about the philosophy of failure and success, and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success.html Ted.com], ''TED Talks|Alain de Botton: A kinder, gentler philosophy of success''; accessed 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception of his writing ==

De Botton has written in a variety of formats to mixed response. Positive reviews of his books attest that he has made literature, philosophy and art more accessible to a wider audience.&lt;ref name="www.complete-review.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/debotton/consofp.htm|title=The Consolations of Philosophy|publisher=www.complete-review.com|accessdate=23 March 2010|quote=De Botton's idea of bringing philosophy to the masses and presenting it in an unthreatening manner (and showing how it might be useful in anyone's life), is admirable; the way he has gone about it is less so.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416040053/http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/debotton/consofp.htm| archivedate=16 April 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indep"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/philosophy-for-a-night-out-at-the-dog-and-duck-625497.html|title=Philosophy for a night out at the Dog and Duck|accessdate=11 July 2009|publisher=The Independent|location=London, UK|date=3 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kobak"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/incomingFeeds/article759884.ece|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505075707/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/incomingFeeds/article759884.ece|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-05-05|title=Financial alarm under the palms|accessdate=11 July 2009|publisher=Times Literary Supplement|date=March 2002|quote=All de Botton's books, fiction and non-fiction, deal with how thought and specifically philosophy might help us deal better with the challenges of quotidian life, returning philosophy to its simple, sound origins.|location=London, UK|first1=Fiona|last1=Hamilton |first2=Sam|last2=Coates|first3=Michael|last3=Savage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mgrath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-85896002.html|title=Why it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive|accessdate=11 July 2009|publisher=Evening Standard|date=May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/09/philosophy|title=When Nietzsche meets Delia Smith|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=23 March 2010|location=London, UK|first=Peter|last=Conrad|date=9 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a question about whether he felt "pulled" to be a writer, de Botton responded:&lt;blockquote&gt;So I think where people tend to end up results from a combination of encouragement, accident, and lucky break, etc. etc. Like many others, my career happened like it did because certain doors opened and certain doors closed. You know, at a certain point I thought it would be great to make film documentaries. Well, in fact, I found that to be incredibly hard and very expensive to do and I didn’t really have the courage to keep battling away at that. In another age, I might have been an academic in a university, if the university system had been different. So it's all about trying to find the best fit between your talents and what the world can offer at that point in time.&lt;ref&gt;Nagy, Kim.

==Other projects==

===The School of Life===
In 2008, Alain de Botton founded [[The School of Life]]. Based in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Seoul, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, São Paulo, Berlin, Zurich and Melbourne, The School of Life offers an emotional education focusing in particular on the issues of Work and Relationships. In an interview with Metkere.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://metkere.com/en Metkere.com]&lt;/ref&gt; de Botton said:&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea is to challenge traditional universities and reorganise knowledge, directing it towards life, and away from knowledge for its own sake. In a modest way, it’s an institution that is trying to give people what universities should I think always give them: a sense of direction and wisdom for their lives with the help of culture.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://metkere.com/en/2008/08/alain-de-botton.html|title=Alain de Botton: I would advise a friend to travel alone (metkere.com/en)|publisher=metkere.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Living Architecture===
In May 2009, de Botton launched a project called "[[Living Architecture]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.living-architecture.co.uk|title=Living Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which builds holiday rental houses in the UK using leading contemporary architects. These include [[Peter Zumthor]], [[MVRDV]], JVA, NORD and Michael and Patti Hopkins. The most recent house to be announced is a collaboration between the Turner-prize winning artist [[Grayson Perry]], and the architecture firm [[Fashion Architecture Taste|FAT]]. The houses are rented out to the general public. De Botton, the creative director and chairman of Living Architecture, aims to improve the appreciation of good contemporary architecture – a task which is the practical continuation of his theoretical work on architecture in his book ''The Architecture of Happiness''. In October 2009, he was appointed an honorary fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), in recognition of his services to architecture.&lt;ref name="Buildingdesign.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=428&amp;storycode=3140884&amp;channel=783&amp;c=2&amp;encCode=0000000001991a0a|title=Alain de Botton's Living Architecture Project|publisher=Buildingdesign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum displays===
In 2014, de Botton was invited by three museums – the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne and the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in Toronto – to contribute content to special exhibitions based on his work, ''Art as Therapy''. De Botton and his colleague John Armstrong inserted captions, arranged on large [[Post-it]]-style labels designed by the Dutch Graphic artist, [[Irma Boom]], bearing slogans and commentary on exhibits throughout the Rijksmuseum.&lt;ref name=Guard&gt;{{cite web|last=Searle|first=Adrian|title=Art Is Therapy review – de Botton as doorstepping self-help evangelist|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/25/art-is-therapy-alain-de-botton-rijksmuseum-amsterdam-review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
De Botton has described his relationship with his father as difficult, stating: "When I sold my first bestseller (and a million dollars was peanuts for my father) he was not impressed and wondered what I was going to do with myself."&lt;ref&gt;שלומציון קינן, ראיון עם אלן דה בוטון, "הארץ", 2007&lt;/ref&gt; When his father died, his family was left a large [[trust fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article3767865.ece|title=Janet de Botton and family|date=27 April 2008|publisher=The London Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; although de Botton says his income is derived solely from his own activities (book sales, speaking engagements, business consulting, The School of Life).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/philosopher-king-alain-de-botton-finds-glamour-and-drama-in-the-world-of-work-1654777.html "Philosopher king: Alain de Botton finds glamour and drama in the world of work," Katy Guest, ''The Independent''], 27 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/22/alain-de-botton-interview "Office affairs", Lynn Barber], ''The Guardian'', 22 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/innovation/2009/0406/1224243950456.html|title=On De Botton|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]|date=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alain's stepmother [[Janet de Botton]] is a prominent patron of the arts and competition bridge player.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/bridges-deep-pockets/article1773095 Janet de Botton profile], theglobeandmail.com; accessed 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; De Botton lives in London with his wife, Charlotte, and their two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/22/alain-de-botton-interview|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian|first=Lynn|last=Barber|title=Office affairs|date=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |last=Patalay |first=Ajesh |date= 16 Dec 2006 |title=My Life|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3657198/My-life.html |newspaper= Telegraph|access-date=16 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, de Botton was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' opposing [[Scottish independence]] in the run-up to September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-08-07 |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anita Manning''' (born 1 December 1947) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[antiques]] expert and television personality from [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=sundayhongkong&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sundaypost.com/in10/antiques-road-trip-expert-anita-manning-reckons-theres-no-beating-hectic-hong-kong/ |title=Antiques Road Trip expert Anita Manning reckons there’s no beating hectic Hong Kong |date=25 January 2015 |work=[[Sunday Post]] |place=[[Dundee]] |accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is well known for her appearances as an expert and presenter on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Bargain Hunt]]'', ''[[Flog It!]]'' and the ''[[Antiques Road Trip]]''. She is claimed to be the first female auctioneer in Scotland.&lt;ref name=sundayhongkong /&gt;

==Career==
Manning's father used to take her to auctions on [[Sauchiehall Street]], in [[Glasgow]] and she grew to love antiques. She first got into the antiques business in the 1970s after buying a bed from an Irish dealer. He offered her a job as a buyer.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

After studying [[physical education]] and specialising in dance at [[Aberdeen]] and [[Edinburgh]], Manning was a teacher before she got married and had children. As a young mother, she developed a knowledge of antiques by buying furniture from auctions. After her first visit to Glasgow as a buyer, she bought and sold furniture in England and [[Ireland]] for about three years, driving all around the country in a truck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mk0g/profiles/anita-manning BBC One - Flog It! - Anita Manning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with her daughter Lala, Manning has run the Glasgow auction house, Great Western Auctions, since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatwesternauctions.com/about_us.php About Us], The Great Western Auctions. Retrieved 8 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Manning's son lives in [[Hong Kong]], while her mother lived in [[Australia]] for the last 35 years of her life.&lt;ref name=sundayhongkong /&gt;

In 2016 Manning set a new record for the largest profit on a single item on the ''Antiques Road Trip''. A [[Buddharupa|Buddha statue]] she had purchased for £50 sold for £3,800, a 7,500% profit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1727745/lucky-dealer-makes-7500-profit-after-selling-buddha-statue-for-3800-on-new-antiques-road-trip-series/ GOOD KARMA Lucky dealer makes 7,500% profit after selling Buddha statue for £3,800 on new Antiques Road Trip series], The Sun, 5 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A lawyer and firearm enthusiast, Charles (Chas.) Newton's experiments with cartridge design led to the creation of the [[5.6x52mmR|.22 Savage Hi-Power]] rifle cartridge which was adopted by the [[Savage Arms|Savage Arms Corporation]] as a commercial firearm cartridge. This success was soon followed by the design of the [[.250-3000 Savage]]. At this period in time, Charles also experimented with wildcats based on the [[.30-06 Springfield]] case, most notably creating a forerunner of the [[.25-06 Remington]]. This cartridge was first introduced as the [[.25 Newton Special]]. There were probably no firearms produced in this caliber by Netwon. It soon evolved into the [[.256 Newton]] designed to use, at first, a 123 grain bullet followed by later upgrades to 129 grain and 140 grain bullets. Newton's premise was to use a large case for each caliber he developed in order for the larger powder charge to propel the bullet at high velocity resulting in effective terminal ballistics. Newton developed several calibers. The best known are the [[.22 Newton]] (90 grain bullet), .256 Newton, [[.30 Newton]] (180 grain bullet), [[.33 Newton]] (200 grain bullet), [[.35 Newton]] (250 grain bullet) and [[.40 Newton]] (300 grain bullet). From 1914 until the late 1920s, he entered into various endeavours to promote and sell rifles in his proprietary calibers.

==Companies involved in the production and sales of Newton rifles==
To promote his proprietary cartridges and ensure a supply of high-quality rifles capable of safely withstanding the high chamber pressure developed by them, Charles incorporated the Newton Arms Co. Inc. in 1914. The earliest of many catalogs issued by Newton offered Mauser and Sauer- Mauser rifles converted, probably by Fred Adolph, to Adolph and Newton calibers. Fred Adolph was a gunsmith in Genoa, New York. He and Newton worked together to design some of the early calibers. These cartridges were initially named Adolph calibers and later named using Newton in place of Adolph. In 1914, Charles Newton made arrangements with Mauser to import rifles in 6.5 caliber in order to convert them in the US to .256 Newton. One order of 24 rifles arrived in August 1914 and three more orders were never received due to the start of World War I. The outbreak of World War I led Charles to manufacture his own rifles. With the employment of noted barrel-maker and gunsmith [[Harry Pope]], Newton assured his rifles would be of the highest quality. These First Model 1916 rifles were made in Buffalo, New York. Due to financial difficulties and the inability to make ammunition because of the war efforts, the company produced rifles under Newton for 16 months. In this time, about 2,400 rifles were manufactured. Newton Arms Co. Inc. went into receivership for the next 98 days. The receiver then sold out to a dealer in used factory equipment who in turn sold the equipment and left over rifles to the Newton Arms Corporation based in New York, New York. They were also in business about 16 months, were sued by Newton and sold the remaining rifles to Kirkland Bros. Hardware. Approximately 1,600 rifles were sold by Newton's successors making the total number of Model 1916s produced equal 4000 rifles.
Newton started the Chas. Newton Rifle Co. in 1919 and imported about 100 German made Sauer-Mauser rifles, all in .256 Newton caliber. This model is known as the Model 1922 Newton.
The Buffalo Newton Rifle Co. was organized in 1923 for the purpose of manufacturing a newly designed rifle. The first rifles were made in 1924 and became the Second Model 1924 Buffalo Newton rifle. The factory was in New Haven, Connecticut. Only about 1,000 of this model Newton rifle were produced.
Charles Newton's last attempt at rifle manufacture was the LeverBolt rifle which never reached production status and only prototypes were made.  
Newton's innovative rifle and cartridge designs contributed much to the firearms industry and some of his developments are used today by rifle makers.

'''Cornelius Stirk''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
He first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #592 (November 1988) and was created by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Norm Breyfogle]].

==Fictional character biography==
Stirk is a supervillain who, like [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], uses fear to get to his victims. Stirk has the ability to make other people see him as someone else, allowing him to get close to his victims. He operates under the [[delusion]] that he requires the [[nutrient]]s and [[hormone]]s from peoples' hearts in order to stay alive, and these are best prepared with [[norepinephrine]] by inducing fear in the victim prior to death.

In his first appearance, Stirk is released from [[Arkham Asylum]] after being certified as [[sanity|sane]]. He had been confined since the age of 16 for trying to kill a classmate. After his release, Stirk subsequently stops taking his medication and begins his escalation into a [[serial killer]].

Despite his many murders, Stirk professes to dislike violence. He also dislikes light and therefore operates almost exclusively at night. Oddly, he refers to almost everyone as "sir".

===''The Last Arkham''===
Stirk makes a brief cameo in the beginning of the four-part storyline ''[[Batman: The Last Arkham|The Last Arkham]]'', where Jeremiah Arkham, Arkham Asylum's new director, utilizes more barbaric methods to "cure" him. When Stirk refuses to take his medication, for instance, Jeremiah has two orderlies brutally beat him with billy clubs and forces the medication down his throat.

===Knightfall===
During the "[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]" storyline, Stirk works with the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in an attempt to kidnap [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]. However, Stirk tries to kill Gordon rather than kidnap him, much to Joker's dismay. Gordon hallucinates that Stirk is actually Batman as Stirk tried to kill Gordon with a knife. Batman stops Stirk, but Gordon is still screaming in fear. In order to capture Stirk, Batman is forced to leave a terrified Gordon with [[Sarah Essen Gordon|his wife]], who brings him to a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #494&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirk later appears during the "Madmen Across the Water" storyline, taking place after his capture but before Arkham Asylum (destroyed by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] beforehand) is rebuilt. He, along with the likes of [[Riddler]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Ivy]], and [[Amygdala (comics)|Amygdala]], are instead incarcerated in Blackgate Penitentiary, and involve themselves in a [[softball]] game with the prison's "normal" criminals. During the game, Stirk is revealed to be an excellent pitcher, because the ball feels "just like a human heart".&lt;ref&gt;''Showcase '94'' #3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road to No Man's Land===
Stirk makes several more cameos in the "Waxman and the Clown" story arc (''Shadow of the Bat'' #80–82), itself part of the "Road to No Man's Land" crossover, the prequel to "No Man's Land". He is seen in the story arc offering to eat human hearts to save medication (as Arkham Asylum, in post-earthquake lockdown after the "Cataclysm" storyline, is running short of supplies). He later watches the gladiatorial match between fellow inmates [[Killer Croc]] and Pinhead, and is released with all the other inmates under Jeremiah's demand that none of them return to Gotham.

===''The Widening Gyre''===
Stirk returns in [[Kevin Smith]]'s storyline, ''[[Batman: The Widening Gyre]]''. Stirk gets the drop on a distracted Batman but [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] manages to save Batman.

==Powers and abilities==
Cornelius Stirk is able to cast a hypnotic aura which allows him to take on any face he chooses, generally a face that people will trust.

==In other media==
Cornelius Stirk appears in the ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' episode "Wrath of the Villains: A Legion of Horribles," portrayed by [[Kameron Omidian]]. Just like the comics, he has a cannibalistic personality. He appears as [[Riddler|Edward Nygma]]'s cellmate at Arkham Asylum after his breakout attempt failed. Both of them are chained up in the same cell. To evade Stirk from breaking out and eating him, Nygma asked Ethel Peabody to contact [[Hugo Strange]] about a deal to stop James Gordon.

'''Dieter Grau''' (April 24, 1913 – December 17, 2014) was an aerospace engineer and member of the "[[Wernher von Braun|von Braun]] rocket group", at [[Peenemünde]] (1939–1945) working on the [[V-2]] rockets in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="astro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/grau.htm|title=Grau|year=2004|work=Astronautix|accessdate=December 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019042456/http://astronautix.com/astros/grau.htm|archivedate=October 19, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was among the engineers who surrendered to the United States and traveled there, providing rocketry expertise via [[Operation Paperclip]], which took them first to [[Fort Bliss]], [[Texas]]. Grau was sent by the [[U.S. Army]] to [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands]] in 1946 to work on the assemblage (with parts shipped from Germany) and testing of the V-2. His wife joined him there in 1947 (Grau's son was born in Texas in 1949). While von Braun was on standby at Fort Bliss, Grau and other German aerospace engineers busily launched V-2s for U.S. scientists to analyze. A total of 67 V-2s were launched at White Sands.

He continued his work with the team when they moved to the [[Redstone Arsenal]] (Alabama), and then joined the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] to work for [[NASA]] in 1950. Grau served as the director of quality in all of those assignments, including the [[Saturn V]] program which took mankind to the moon.&lt;ref name="reunion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2010/07/02/41792-german-reunion-highlights-two-anniversaries/ |title=German Reunion Highlights Two Anniversaries |author=Kari Hawkins, USAG Redstone |date=2010-07-02 |work= |publisher=US Army |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grau said that von Braun worked closely with then-Colonel Holger Toftoy to develop the kind of team he wanted in the U.S.&lt;ref name="reunion"/&gt;

"One of my main jobs at that time was to get information to the scientists and see what kind of projects they would like to have and then, of course, we had to accommodate them," Grau recalled. "Even though we were busy, we were more used to much overtime. But that was not the case (at White Sands). There we had a normal workday."&lt;ref name="reunion"/&gt;

[[File:VonBraunTeam1961.jpg|thumb|left|Von Braun's rocket team managers, Grau just right of center, meet to discuss [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]]-rocket configurations in 1961.]]
Things changed with their arrival in Huntsville. In many ways the Germans felt like they were coming home. Gone were the dry, desert conditions of Fort Bliss and White Sands, replaced with a green, mountainous agricultural area reminiscent of Germany.&lt;ref name="reunion"/&gt; Grau noted:

: "Coming to Huntsville was our coming back to the green country. We were used to green country and out there at Fort Bliss and White Sands there was just desert. We liked this so much better. This was more the landscape we were used to. For us, it was kind of a relief to come to the green country."&lt;ref name="reunion"/&gt;

"The new [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone rocket]]  had to go somewhat further. It had to be bigger and it had to be made with American parts," Grau said.
: "Industry came in and worked with us to build and develop new stuff. The engine had to be redesigned. It had to be bigger. At that time, industry came really onboard."&lt;ref name="reunion"/&gt;

Grau, along with von Braun's team, moved from the Army to NASA to develop the first rockets designed expressly for exploration.  Grau oversaw quality assurance for the development of the [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn V]] rockets. Ed Buckbee, formerly of MSFC public affairs, said of this time, "When Dieter spoke, everybody in the room listened."&lt;ref name="hsvt141217"/&gt;

"We had wonderful experiences going into space. We had wonderful cooperation to accomplish something never done before," Grau said.
: "See how well it all worked out? We had no idea how things would work out. We took a tremendous risk to come here. We never thought we would be able to stay so long. I have real good fortune that I have had a fulfilled life and I remember so much."&lt;ref name="reunion"/&gt;

On his marathon debut he won the 2013 [[Hamburg Marathon]] in a course record time. His first victory at a [[World Marathon Major]] came at the [[Chicago Marathon]] in 2014. He was a three-time winner at both the [[London Marathon]] and [[Berlin Marathon]] between 2015 and 2018. Described as "the greatest marathoner of the modern era",&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt; Kipchoge has won 11 of the 12 marathons he has entered, his only loss being to [[Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich]] at the [[2013 Berlin Marathon]] (Kipchoge placed second), where Kipsang broke the world record.&lt;ref name="BBC Sport"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/24322574|title=Berlin marathon: Wilson Kipsang sets new world record|date=2013-09-29|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2008 Olympics held in Beijing, China, Kipchoge won a silver medal in the 5000m event with a time of 13:02.80; although better than the previous Olympic record of 13:05.59, it was not enough to match Kenenisa Bekele's pace, who won the gold medal for this race.&lt;ref&gt;2008 Olympics, {{cite web|url=http://2008olympics.runnersworld.com/2008/08/mens-5000m-fina.html |title=5000m results |publisher=[[Runner's World]] |accessdate=24 August 2008 |archivedate=25 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825022924/http://2008olympics.runnersworld.com/2008/08/mens-5000m-fina.html |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to reach the podium at the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics]], finishing in fifth place and he also finished ninth in the 3000&amp;nbsp;m at the [[2009 IAAF World Athletics Final]].

'''Emiliano Zapata Salazar''' ({{IPA-es|emiˈljano saˈpata}}; 8 August 1879 – 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the [[Mexican Revolution]], the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of [[Morelos]], and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called ''[[Zapatismo]]''.

Zapata was born in the rural village of [[Anenecuilco]] in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for [[sugar cane]] production with the support of dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]]. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning ''hacendados'', and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the [[Liberation Army of the South]], of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Zapata's forces contributed to the fall of Díaz, defeating the [[Federal Army]] in the [[Battle of Cuautla]], but when the revolutionary leader [[Francisco I. Madero]] became president he disavowed the role of the Zapatistas, denouncing them as simple bandits. In November 1911, Zapata promulgated the [[Plan de Ayala]] which called for substantial land reforms, redistributing lands to the peasants. Madero sent the Federal Army to root out the Zapatistas in Morelos. Madero's generals employed a [[scorched earth]] policy, burning villages and forcibly removing their inhabitants, and drafting many men into the Army or sending them to forced labor camps in southern Mexico. This strengthened Zapata's standing among the peasants, and Zapata was able to drive the forces of Madero led by [[Victoriano Huerta]] out of Morelos. In a coup against Madero in February 1913, Huerta took power in Mexico, but a coalition of Constitutionalist forces in northern Mexico led by [[Venustiano Carranza]], [[Álvaro Obregón]] and [[Francisco "Pancho" Villa]] ousted him in July 1914 with the support of Zapata's troops. Zapata did not recognize the authority that Carranza asserted as leader of the revolutionary movement, continuing his adherence to the Plan de Ayala.

In the aftermath of the revolutionaries' victory over Huerta, they attempted to sort out power relations in the [[Convention of Aguascalientes]]. Zapata and Villa broke with Carranza, and Mexico descended into [[civil war]] among the winners. Dismayed with the alliance with Villa, Zapata focused his energies on rebuilding society in Morelos which he now controlled, instituting the land reforms of the Plan de Ayala. As Carranza consolidated his power and defeated Villa in 1915, Zapata initiated [[guerrilla warfare]] against the Carrancistas, who in turn invaded Morelos, employing once again scorched-earth tactics to oust the Zapatista rebels. Zapata once again retook Morelos in 1917 and held most of the state against Carranza's troops until he was killed in an ambush in April 1919. Article 27 of the 1917 [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution]] was drafted in response to his agrarian demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Centeno |first=Ramón I. |date=2018-02-01 |title=Zapata reactivado: una visión žižekiana del Centenario de la Constitución |url=http://msem.ucpress.edu/content/34/1/36 |journal=Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos |language=en |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=36–62 |doi=10.1525/msem.2018.34.1.36 |issn=0742-9797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, Zapatista generals aligned with Obregón against Carranza and helped drive Carranza from power. In 1920, Zapatistas managed to obtain powerful posts in the governance of Morelos after Carranza's fall. They instituted many of the land reforms envisioned by Zapata in Morelos.

Zapata remains an iconic figure in Mexico, used both as a nationalist symbol as well as a symbol of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|neo-Zapatista movement]].

Emiliano Zapata was born to Gabriel Zapata and Cleofas Jertrudiz Salazar of [[Anenecuilco]], [[Morelos]], a well-known local family; Emiliano's godfather was the manager of a large local [[hacienda]], and his godmother was the manager's wife.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution, vol. 1. Porfirians, Liberals, and Peasants''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Zapata's family were [[mestizo]]s, Mexicans of [[Nahuas|Nahua]] and Spanish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Indian in Latin American History: Resistance, Resilience, and Acculturation |author=John E. Kicza |publisher=Scholarly Resources |page=203 |year=1993 |isbn=0-8420-2421-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emiliano was the ninth of ten children; his older brother [[Eufemio Zapata]] is also a figure in Morelos history. From a family of farmers, Emiliano Zapata had insight into the severe difficulties of the countryside and his village's long struggle to regain land taken by expanding haciendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Diccionario Porrúa de Historia, Biografía y Geografía de México |publisher= [[Librería Hermanos Porrúa (Porrúa Brothers Bookstore)|Editorial Porrúa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a limited education from his teacher, Emilio Vara, but it included "the rudiments of bookkeeping".&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', New York: Harper Collins 1997, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16 or 17, Zapata had to care for his family following his father's death. Emiliano was entrepreneurial, buying a team of mules to haul [[maize]] from farms to town, as well as bricks to the Hacienda of Chinameca; he was also a successful farmer, growing watermelons as a cash crop.&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 279"&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a skilled horseman and competed in rodeos and races, as well as bullfighting from horseback.&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 279"/&gt; These skills as a horseman brought him work as a horse trainer for Porfirio Díaz's son-in-law, who had a hacienda nearby,&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 279"/&gt; and served Zapata well as a revolutionary leader. He had a striking appearance, with a large mustache in which he took pride, and good quality clothing described by a comrade: "General Zapata's dress until his death was a [[Charro outfit|''charro'' outfit]]: tight-fitting black cashmere pants with silver buttons, a broad charro hat, a fine linen shirt or jacket, a scarf around his neck, boots of a single piece, Amozoqueña-style spurs, and a pistol at his belt."&lt;ref&gt;Serafín Robles quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In an undated studio photo, Zapata is dressed in a standard business suit and tie, projecting an image of a man of means.

Around the turn of the 20th century, Anenecuilco was a mixed Spanish-speaking mestizo and indigenous [[Nahuatl]]-speaking [[pueblo]]. It had a long history of protesting the local haciendas taking community members' land, and its leaders gathered colonial-era documentation of their land titles to prove their claims.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 275-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the colonial documentation was in Nahuatl,&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 277. He states without citation that Zapata used a translator for the Nahuatl documents.&lt;/ref&gt; with contemporary translations to Spanish for use in legal cases in the Spanish courts. One eyewitness account by [[Luz Jiménez]] of [[Milpa Alta]] states that Emiliano Zapata spoke Nahuatl fluently when his forces arrived in her community.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Leon-Portilla, Earl Shorris. 2002. ''In the Language of Kings: An Anthology of Mesoamerican Literature, Pre-Columbian to the Present''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. p. 374 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QF5VgTGrTGEC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;lpg=PA374#v=onepage&amp;q=Zapata%20also%20spoke%20Nahuatl (Testimony of Doña [[Luz Jiménez]]] originally published in Horcasitas, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{External Timeline|Template:Timeline of the Mexican Revolution|Timeline of the Mexican Revolution}}

After [[Porfirio Díaz]] came to the presidency of Mexico by a [[coup]] in 1876, the Mexican social and economic system was dominated by large estates ''([[hacienda]]s)'' controlling much of the land and squeezing the holdings of independent communities. Many peasants were subsequently forced into debt peonage (''[[peon]]aje'') on the ''haciendas''. Díaz ran local elections to give the semblance of democracy; however, his close confidants and associates were given offices in districts throughout Mexico. These officials became enforcers of changes in land tenure that favored the concentration of land progressively into the hands of fewer and wealthier landowners.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Community members in Anenecuilco, including Zapata, sought redress against land seizures. In 1892, a delegation had an audience with Díaz, who with the intervention of a lawyer, agreed to hear them. Although promising them to deal favorably with their petition, Díaz had them arrested and Zapata was conscripted into the [[Federal Army]].&lt;ref&gt;John Mason Hart, ''Revolutionary Mexico'', Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1987, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Díaz, conscription into the Federal Army was much feared by ordinary Mexican men and their families. Zapata was one of many rebel leaders who were conscripted at some point.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution, vol. 1. Porfirians, Liberals and Peasants''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, an important meeting was called by the elders of Anenecuilco, whose chief elder was José Merino. He announced "my intention to resign from my position due to my old age and limited abilities to continue the fight for the land rights of the village." The meeting was used as a time for discussion and nomination of individuals as a replacement for Merino as the president of the village council. The elders on the council were so well respected by the village men that no one would dare to override their nominations or vote for an individual against the advice of the current council at that time. The nominations made were Modesto González, Bartolo Parral, and Emiliano Zapata. After the nominations were closed, a vote was taken and Zapata became the new council president without contest.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"&gt;Womack, J. (1969, [c1968]). ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution''. New York,: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Zapata had turned 30 only a month before, voters knew that it was necessary to elect someone respected by the community who would be responsible for the village. Even though he was relatively young, Anenecuilco was ready to hand over the leadership to him without any worry of failure. Before he was elected he had shown the village his nature by helping to head up a campaign in opposition to the candidate Díaz had chosen governor. Even though Zapata's efforts failed, he was able to create and cultivate relationships with political authority figures that would prove useful for him.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt;

Zapata became a leading figure in the village of Anenecuilco, where his family had lived for many generations, and he became involved in struggles for the rights of the ''campesinos'' of [[Morelos]]. He was able to oversee the redistribution of the land from some ''haciendas'' peacefully but had problems with others. He observed numerous conflicts between villagers and ''hacendados'', or landowners, over the constant theft of village land, and in one instance, saw the ''hacendados'' torch an entire villa.

For many years, he campaigned steadfastly for the rights of the villagers, first establishing via ancient [[Title (property)|title deeds]] their claims to disputed land, and then pressing the recalcitrant governor of Morelos into action. Finally, disgusted with the slow response from the government and the overt bias towards the wealthy plantation owners, Zapata began making use of armed force, simply taking over the land in dispute.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==The 1910 Revolution==

The flawed 1910 elections were a major reason for the outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910. Porfirio Díaz was being threatened by the candidacy of [[Francisco I. Madero]]. Zapata, seeing an opportunity to promote land reform in Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/themexicanrevolution/a/08zapataprerev.htm |title=Emiliano Zapata: Life Before the Mexican Revolution |publisher=Latinamericanhistory.about.com |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; made quiet alliances with Madero, whom he perceived to be the best chance for genuine change in the country.&lt;ref name=opqz /&gt; Although he was wary about Madero,&lt;ref name=opqz /&gt; Zapata cooperated with him when Madero made vague promises about land reform in his [[Plan of San Luis Potosí]].&lt;ref name=opqz /&gt; Land reform was the central feature of Zapata's political vision.&lt;ref name=opqz /&gt;. He also fought the Mexican Revolution with Pancho Villa. These two people fought to help the peasants get their land back until they both got killed by the government. At the end of the Mexican revolution, the government passed down the Mexican Constitution which it basically gave the land back to the peasants, universal suffrage, supported public education, the minimum wage for Mexicans, and maximum hours restrictions.    

Zapata joined Madero's campaign against President Diaz.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; When Zapata's army [[Battle of Cuautla (1911)|captured Cuautla after a six-day battle]] on May 19, 1911,&lt;ref name=opqz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/themexicanrevolution/a/08zapatamad.htm |title=The Mexican Revolution: Zapata, Diaz and Madero |publisher=Latinamericanhistory.about.com |date=May 13, 1911 |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became clear that Diaz would not hold on to power for long.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; With the support of [[Pancho Villa]], [[Pascual Orozco]], Emiliano Zapata, and rebellious peasants, Madero overthrew Díaz in May 1911 at the [[Battle of Ciudad Juárez (1911)|Battle of Ciudad Juárez]]. A provisional government was formed under [[Francisco León de la Barra]]. Under Madero, some new land reforms were carried out and elections were to be ensured. However, Zapata was dissatisfied with Madero's stance on land reform, which Madero did not really believe in,&lt;ref name=kpkap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/themexicanrevolution/p/08zapatabio.htm |title=Biography of Emiliano Zapata |publisher=Latinamericanhistory.about.com |date=April 10, 1919 |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was unable, despite repeated efforts, to make him understand the importance of the issue or to get him to act on it.

Madero was not ready to create a radical change in the manner that agrarian relations operated during this time. Some other individuals,{{Who|date=February 2011}} called "anarcho-syndicalist agitators",{{By whom|date=May 2011}} had made promises to take things back to the way that they had been done previously. The major method of agrarian relations had been that of communal lands, called ''ejidos''. Although some {{Who|date=February 2011}} believed that this could be the best course of action, Madero simply demanded that "Public servants act 'morally' in enforcing the law&amp;nbsp;...". Upon seeing the response by villagers, Madero offered formal justice in courts to individuals who had been wronged by others with regard to [[agrarianism|agrarian]] politics. Zapata decided that on the surface it seemed as though Madero was doing good things for the people of Mexico, but Zapata did not know the level of sincerity in Madero's actions and thus did not know if he should support him completely.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, J. (1969, [c1968]). ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution''. New York,: Knopf. S.71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pancho Villa, el presidente provisional Eulalio Gutiérrez y Emiliano Zapata.jpg|left|thumb|[[Francisco Villa]] (left), [[Eulalio Gutiérrez]] (center), and Emiliano Zapata (right) at the Mexican National Palace (1914)]]

Madero and Zapata's relations worsened during the summer of 1911 as Madero appointed a governor who supported plantation owners and refused to meet Zapata's agrarian demands. Compromises between the two failed in November 1911, days after Madero was elected President. Zapata and [[Otilio Montaño Sánchez]], a former school teacher, fled to the mountains of southwest [[Puebla]]. There they formed the most radical reform plan in Mexico; the [[Plan de Ayala]] (Plan of Ayala). The plan declared Madero a traitor,&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; named [[Pascual Orozco]] head of the Revolution,&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; and outlined a plan for true land reform.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt;

The Plan of Ayala called for all lands stolen under Díaz to be immediately returned;&lt;ref name=kpkapza&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/thehistoryofmexico/p/planofayala.htm |title=Emiliano Zapata and the Plan of Ayala |publisher=Latinamericanhistory.about.com |date=April 10, 1919 |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; there had been considerable land fraud under the old dictator, so a great deal of territory was involved.&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt; It also stated that large plantations owned by a single person or family should have one-third of their land nationalized, which would then be required to be given to poor farmers.&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt; It also argued that if any large plantation owner resisted this action,&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt; they should have the other two-thirds confiscated as well.&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt; The Plan of Ayala also invoked the name of [[Benito Juárez]],&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt; one of Mexico's great leaders,&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt; and compared the taking of land from the wealthy to Juarez's actions when he took land from the church in the 1860s.&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt;

Zapata was partly influenced by an [[anarchism|anarchist]] from [[Oaxaca]] named [[Ricardo Flores Magón]]. The influence of Flores Magón on Zapata can be seen in the Zapatistas' [[Plan de Ayala]], but even more noticeably in their slogan (this slogan was never used by Zapata){{citation needed|date=August 2015}} "''Tierra y libertad''" ("land and liberty"), the title and maxim of Flores Magón's most famous work. Zapata's introduction to anarchism came via Montaño Sánchez – later a general in Zapata's army, executed on May 17, 1917 (by order of Zapata) – who exposed Zapata to the works of [[Peter Kropotkin]] and Flores Magón at the same time as Zapata was observing and beginning to participate in the struggles of the peasants for the land.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The plan proclaimed the Zapatista demands for "Reforma, Libertad, Ley y Justicia" (Reform, Freedom, Law and Justice). Zapata also declared the Maderistas as a counter-revolution and denounced Madero. Zapata mobilized his [[Liberation Army of the South|Liberation Army]] and allied with former Maderistas [[Pascual Orozco]] and Emiliano Vázquez Gómez. Orozco was from [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], near the U.S. border, and thus was able to aid the Zapatistas with a supply of arms.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the following weeks, the development of military operations "betray(ed) good evidence of clear and intelligent planning."&lt;ref&gt;Womack, J. (1969, [c1968]). ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution''. New York,: Knopf. P. 76&lt;/ref&gt; During Orozco's rebellion, Zapata fought Mexican troops in the south near [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; In the original design of the armed force, Zapata was a mere colonel among several others; however, the true plan that came about through this organization lent itself to Zapata. Zapata believed that the best route of attack would be to center the fighting and action in [[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]]. If this political location could be overthrown, the army would have enough power to "veto anyone else's control of the state, negotiate for [[Cuernavaca]] or attack it directly, and maintain independent access to Mexico City as well as escape routes to the southern hills."&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969, P.76"&gt;Womack, J. (1969, [c1968]). ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution''. New York,: Knopf. P.76&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order to gain this great success, Zapata realized that his men needed to be better armed and trained.

The first line of action demanded that Zapata and his men "control the area behind and below a line from [[Jojutla]] to [[Yecapixtla]]."&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969, P.76"/&gt; When this was accomplished it gave the army the ability to complete raids as well as wait. As the opposition of the Federal Army and police detachments slowly dissipated, the army would be able to eventually gain powerful control over key locations on the [[Interoceanic Railway]] from [[Puebla City]] to Cuautla. If these feats could be completed, it would gain access to Cuautla directly and the city would fall.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt;

The plan of action was carried out successfully in Jojutla. However, [[Pablo Torres Burgos]], the commander of the operation, was disappointed that the army disobeyed his orders against [[looting]] and ransacking. The army took complete control of the area, and it seemed as though Torres Burgos had lost any type of control that he believed he had over his forces prior to this event. Shortly after, Torres Burgos called a meeting and resigned from his position. Upon leaving Jojutla with his two sons, he was surprised by a federal police patrol who subsequently shot all three of the men on the spot.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt; This seemed to some to be an ending blow to the movement, because Torres Burgos had not selected a successor for his position; however, Zapata was ready to take up where Torres Burgos had left off.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt;

Shortly after Torres Burgos' death, a party of rebels elected Zapata as "Supreme Chief of the Revolutionary Movement of the South" (Womack, p.&amp;nbsp;78). This seemed to be the fix to all of the problems that had just arisen, but other individuals wanted to replace Zapata as well. Due to this new conflict, the individual who would come out on top would have to do so by "convincing his peers he deserved their backing."&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969, P.79"&gt;Womack, J. (1969, [c1968]). ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution''. New York,: Knopf. P.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapata finally did gain the support necessary by his peers and was considered a "singularly qualified candidate".&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969, P.79"/&gt; This decision to make Zapata the true leader of the revolution did not occur all at once, nor did it ever reach a true definitive level of recognition. In order to succeed, Zapata needed a strong financial backing for the battles to come. This came in the form of 10,000 pesos delivered by Rodolfo from the [[Tacubaya]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, J. (1969, [c1968]). ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution''. New York,: Knopf. P.80&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this amazing sum of money Zapata's group of rebels became one of the strongest in the state financially.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt;

After some time Zapata became the leader of his "strategic zone".&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt; This gave him tremendous power and control over the actions of many more individual rebel groups and thus increased his margin of success greatly. "Among revolutionaries in other districts of the state, however, Zapata's authority was more tenuous."&lt;ref&gt;Womack, J. (1969, [c1968]). ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution''. New York,: Knopf. P.82&lt;/ref&gt; After a meeting with Zapata and [[Ambrosio Figueroa]] in [[Jolalpan]], it was decided that Zapata would have joint power with Figueroa with regard to operations in Morelos.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt; This was a turning point in the level of authority and influence that Zapata had gained and proved useful in the direct overthrow of Morelos.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt;

Zapata immediately began to use his newly found power and began to overthrow city after city with gaining momentum. Madero, alarmed, asked Zapata to disarm and demobilize. Zapata responded that, if the people could not win their rights now, when they were armed, they would have no chance once they were unarmed and helpless. Madero sent several generals in an attempt to deal with Zapata, but these efforts had little success. It seemed as though Zapata would shortly be able to overthrow Madero. Before he could overthrow Madero,&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt;  General [[Victoriano Huerta]] beat him to it in February 1913,&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; ordering Madero arrested and executed.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; This officially and formally ended the civil war.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt;

Although this may have caused individuals to believe that the revolution was over, it was not. The battle continued for years to come over the fact that Mexican individuals did not have agrarian rights that were fair, nor did they have the protection necessary to fight against those who pushed such exploitation upon them.&lt;ref name="Womack, J. 1969"/&gt;

If there was anyone that Zapata hated more than Díaz and Madero,&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; it was Victoriano Huerta, the bitter, violent [[alcoholic]] who had been responsible for many atrocities in southern Mexico while trying to end the rebellion.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; Zapata was not alone: in the north, [[Pancho Villa]], who had supported Madero,&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; immediately took to the field against Huerta.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; Zapata revised the Plan of Ayala and named himself the leader of his revolution.&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt; He was joined by two newcomers to the Revolution, [[Venustiano Carranza]] and [[Alvaro Obregón]],&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; who raised large armies in [[Coahuila]] and [[Sonora]] respectively.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; Together they made short work of Huerta, who resigned and fled in June 1914 after repeated military losses to the "Big Four".&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt;

[[File:Pancho Villa y Emiliano Zapata2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Zapata and Villa with their joint forces enter Mexico City on December 6, 1914.]]
On April 21, 1914, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent a contingent of troops to occupy the port city of [[Veracruz]]. This sudden threat caused Huerta to withdraw his troops from Morelos and Puebla, leaving only Jojutla and Cuernavaca under federal control. Zapatistas quickly assumed control of eastern Morelos, taking Cuautla and [[Jonacatepec]] with no resistance. In spite of being faced with a possible foreign invasion, Zapata refused to unite with Huerta in defense of the nation. He stated that if need be he would defend Mexico alone as chief of the Ayalan forces.{{sfn|Womack|1968|p=186}} In May the Zapatistas took Jojutla from the federales, many of whom joined the rebels, and captured guns and ammunition. They also laid siege to Cuernavaca where a small contingent of federal troops were holed up.{{sfn|Womack|1968|p=187}} By the summer of 1915 Zapata's forces had taken the southern edge of the [[Mexico City#Federal District|Federal District]], occupying [[Milpa Alta]] and [[Xochimilco]], poised to move into the capital. Nonetheless in mid July, Huerta was forced to flee as a Constitutionalist force under Carranza, Obregón and Villa took the Federal District.{{sfn|Womack|1968|p=188}} The constitutionalists established a peace treaty inserting Carranza as First Authority of the nation. In spite of having contributed decisively to the fall of Huerta, the Zapatistas were left out of the peace treaties, probably because of Carranza's intense dislike for the Zapatistas whom he saw as uncultured savages.{{sfn|Womack|1968|p=190}} Through 1915 there was a tentative peace in Morelos and the rest of the country.

Villa is sitting in the presidential chair in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]].]]
As the constitutionalist forces began to split, with [[Pancho Villa|Francisco "Pancho" Villa]] posing a popular front against Carranza's constitutionalism, Carranza worked diplomatically to get the Zapatistas to recognize his rule. He sent [[Dr. Atl]] as an envoy to propose a compromise with Zapata. Zapata nonetheless refused to recognize Carranza's leadership, stating that the only acceptable result was following the [[Plan de Ayala]], which would make him supreme chief of an interim government.{{sfn|Womack|1968|p=195}}

Finally, Zapata decided to side with Villa against Carranza and Obregon.{{sfn|Womack|1968|pp=196-99}} Villa and the other anti-Carrancista leaders of the North established the [[Convention of Aguascalientes]] against Carranza. Zapata and his envoys managed to get the convention to adopt some of the agrarian principles of the Plan de Ayala.{{sfn|Womack|1968|pp=214-219}} Zapata and Villa met in Xochimilco to negotiate an alliance and divide the responsibility for ridding Mexico of the remaining Carrancistas. The meeting was awkward but amiable, and was widely publicized. It was decided that Zapata should work on securing the area east of Morelos from Puebla towards Veracruz. Nonetheless, during the ensuing campaign in Puebla, Zapata was disappointed by Villa's lack of support. He did not initially provide the Zapatistas with the weaponry they had agreed on and, when he did, he did not provide adequate transportation. There were also a series of abuses by Villistas against Zapatista soldiers and chiefs. These experiences led Zapata to grow unsatisfied with the alliance, turning instead his efforts to reorganizing the state of Morelos that had been left in shambles by the onslaught of Huerta and Robles. Having taken Puebla, Zapata left a couple of [[garrison]]s there but did not support Villa further against Obregón and Carranza. The Carrancistas saw that the [[Convention of Aguascalientes|convention]] was divided and decided to concentrate on beating Villa, which left the Zapatistas to their own devices for a while.{{sfn|Womack|1968|pp=220-223}}

==Zapata rebuilds Morelos==
[[File:Fuerzas surianas a las ordenes de Emiliano Zapata.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The armed forces of Zapata assembled in Morelos, date not known]]
Through 1915, Zapata began reshaping Morelos after the Plan de Ayala, redistributing ''hacienda'' lands to the peasants, and largely letting village councils run their own local affairs. Most peasants did not turn to [[cash crop]]s, instead growing [[subsistence crops]] such as corn, beans, and vegetables. The result was that as the capital was starving, Morelos peasants had more to eat than they had had in 1910 and at lower prices. The only official event in Morelos during this entire year was a [[bullfight]] in which Zapata himself and his nephew Amador Salazar participated. 1915 was a short period of peace and prosperity for the farmers of Morelos, in between the massacres of the Huerta era and the civil war of the winners to come.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution'', pp. 240-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guerrilla warfare against Carranza==
[[File:117.- MIX-3.2.557.0001 - Emiliano Zapata.tif|left|250px|thumb|Emiliano Zapata in 1915]]
Even when Villa was retreating, having lost the [[Battle of Celaya]] in 1915, and when Obregón took the capital from the Conventionists who retreated to [[Toluca]], Zapata did not open a second front.

When Carranza's forces were poised to move into Morelos, Zapata took action. He attacked Carrancista positions with large forces trying to harry the Carrancistas in the rear as they were occupied with routing Villa throughout the Northwest. Though Zapata managed to take many important sites such as the [[Necaxa River|Necaxa]] power plant that supplied Mexico City, he was unable to hold them. The Convention was finally routed from Toluca, and Carranza was recognized by US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] as the head of state of Mexico in October.&lt;ref&gt;Womack 245-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 1916 Zapata raided federal forces from [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] to Oaxaca, and [[Genovevo de la O]] fought the Carrancistas in [[Guerrero]]. The Zapatistas attempted to amass support for their cause by promulgating new manifestos against the ''hacendados'', but this had little effect since the ''hacendados'' had already lost power throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Womack 250-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carranza consolidates power==
In 1916, Carranza sent a force under General [[Pablo González Garza]] to attack Morelos from the northwest. The Zapatista generals Pachecho and Genovevo de la O who believed the former to be a traitor, struggled against each other, and Zapatista positions began to fall. First Cuernavaca, then Cuautla and then [[Tlaltizapán]]. In Tlaltizapan Gonzalez executed 289 civilians, including minors of both sexes. Throughout Morelos thousands of civilian prisoners were stuffed on [[boxcar]]s and carried to Mexico City, and further to the Henequen plantations of [[Yucatán]] as forced laborers. Zapata fled into the hills as his headquarters were raided, returning after a few months later to organize guerrilla resistance throughout Morelos. The brutality of the nationalist forces further drove the Morelos peasantry towards Zapata, who mounted guerrilla warfare throughout the state and into the Federal District, blowing up trains between Cuernavaca and the capital.
 
Having been put in charge of the efforts to root out Zapatismo in Morelos, Gonzalez was humiliated by Zapata's attacks, and enforced increasingly draconian measures against the locals. He received no reinforcements, as Obregón, the Minister of War, needed all his forces against Villa in the north and against Felix Diaz in Oaxaca. Through low-scale attacks on Gonzalez's positions, Zapata had driven Gonzalez out of Morelos by the end of 1916.{{sfn|Womack|1968|pp=269-271}}
 
Nonetheless, outside of Morelos the revolutionary forces started disbanding. Some joined the constitutionalists such as Domingo Arena, or lapsed into banditry. In Morelos, Zapata once more reorganized the Zapatista state, continuing with democratic reforms and legislation meant to keep the civil population safe from abuses by soldiers. Though his advisers urged him to mount a concerted campaign against the Carrancistas across southern Mexico, again he concentrated entirely on stabilizing Morelos and making life tolerable for the peasants.{{sfn|Womack|1968|pp=281-2}} Meanwhile, Carranza mounted national elections in all state capitals except [[Cuernavaca]], and promulgated the 1917 Constitution which incorporated elements of the Plan de Ayala.

==Zapata under pressure==
Meanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas turned over to the constitutionalists, he secured peace for his region and remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montaño moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montaño tried for [[treason]] and executed.{{sfn|Womack|1968|pp=1983-86}}

Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magaña as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec.

Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the [[Spanish flu]] decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914.{{sfn|Womack|1968|p=311}} Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the [[World War I|World War]], the United States would turn its attention to Mexico, forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico.

In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did.{{sfn|Womack|1968|pp=313-14}}

Zapata released statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans.{{sfn|Womack|1968|p=315}} In March Zapata finally sent an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gómez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement.{{sfn|Womack|1968|pp=319-20}} Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magaña and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lie low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front.{{sfn|Womack|1968|pp=320-22}}

==Death==
[[File:El cadáver de Emiliano Zapata, exhibido en Cuautla, Morelos.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Zapata's corpse, photographed in Cuautla, April 10, 1919 (Archivo General de la Nación, Mexico City, Archivo Fotográfico, Delgado y García)]]
In mid-March 1919, Gen. Pablo González ordered his subordinate Col. [[:es:Jesús Guajardo|Jesús Guajardo]] to commence operations against the Zapatistas in the mountains around [[Huautla, Morelos|Huautla]]. But when González later discovered Guajardo carousing in a ''[[cantina]]'', he had him arrested, and a public scandal ensued. On March 21, Zapata attempted to smuggle in a note to Guajardo, inviting him to switch sides. The note, however, never reached Guajardo but instead wound up on González's desk. González devised a plan to use this note to his advantage. He accused Guajardo of not only being a drunk, but of being a traitor. After reducing Guajardo to tears, González explained to him that he could recover from this disgrace if he feigned a defection to Zapata. So Guajardo wrote to Zapata telling him that he would bring over his men and supplies if certain guarantees were promised.{{sfn|Womack|1969|pp=322-323}} Zapata answered Guajardo's letter on April 1, 1919, agreeing to all of Guajardo's terms. Zapata suggested a [[mutiny]] on April 4. Guajardo replied that his defection should wait until a new shipment of arms and ammunition arrived sometime between the 6th and the 10th. By the 7th, the plans were set: Zapata ordered Guajardo to attack the Federal garrison at [[Jonacatepec]] because the garrison included troops who had defected from Zapata. Pablo González and Guajardo notified the Jonacatepec garrison ahead of time, and a mock battle was staged on April 9. At the conclusion of the mock battle, the former Zapatistas were arrested and shot. Convinced that Guajardo was sincere, Zapata agreed to a final meeting where Guajardo would defect.{{sfn|Womack|1969|pp=323-324}}

On April 10, 1919, Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, intimating that he intended to defect to the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; However, when Zapata arrived at the Hacienda de San Juan, in Chinameca, [[Ciudad Ayala|Ayala municipality]], Guajardo's men riddled him with bullets.

After he was gunned down, they then took his body to [[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]] to claim the bounty, where they are reputed to have been given only half of what was promised.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}} Zapata's body was photographed, displayed for 24 hours, and then buried in Cuautla.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Brunk, ''The Posthumous Career of Emiliano Zapata''. Austin: University of Texas Press 2008, pp. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Pablo González wanted the body photographed, so that there would be no doubt that Zapata was dead: "it was an actual fact that the famous ''jefe'' of the southern region had died."&lt;ref&gt;González quoted in Brunk, ''The Posthumous Career of Emiliano Zapata'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mexico City newspapers had called for Zapata's body to be brought to the capital, Carranza did not do so. However, Zapata's clothing was displayed outside a newspaper's office across from the Alameda Park in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Brunk, ''The Posthumous Career of Emiliano Zapata'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immediate aftermath of the assassination ==
Although for Carranza the death of Zapata was the removal of an ongoing threat, for many Zapata's assassination undermined "worker and peasant support for Carranza and [Pablo] González."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Brunk, ''The Posthumous Career of Emiliano Zapata''. Austin: University of Texas Press, 2008, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Obregón seized on the opportunity to attack Carranza and González, Obregón's rival candidate for the presidency, by saying "this crime reveals a lack of ethics in some members of the government and also of political sense, since peasant votes in the upcoming election will now go to whoever runs against Pablo González."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Brunk, ''The Posthumous Career of Emiliano Zapata'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of González's attempts to sully the name of Zapata and the Plan de Ayala during his 1920 campaign for the presidency,&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Brunk, ''The Posthumous Career of Emiliano Zapata''pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; the people of Morelos continued to support Zapatista generals, providing them with weapons, supplies and protection. Carranza was wary of the threat of a U.S. intervention, and Zapatista generals decided to take a conciliatory approach. Bands of Zapatistas started surrendering in exchange for amnesties, and many Zapatista generals went on to become local authorities, such as Fortino Ayaquica who became municipal president of [[Tochimilco]].&lt;ref&gt;Womack, page number needed&lt;/ref&gt; Other generals such as Genovevo de la O remained active in small-scale guerrilla warfare.

As Venustiano Carranza moved to curb his former allies and now rivals in 1920 to impose a civilian, [[Ignacio Bonillas]], as his successor in the presidency, Obregón sought to align himself with the Zapatista movement against that of Carranza. Genovevo de la O and Magaña supported him in the coup by former Constitutionalists, fighting in Morelos against Carranza and helping prompt Carranza to flee Mexico City toward Veracruz in May 1920. "Obregón and Genovevo de la O entered Mexico City in triumph."&lt;ref&gt;Brunk, ''The Posthumous Career of Emiliano Zapata'', pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Zapatistas were given important posts in the interim government of [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] and the administration of Álvaro Obregón, following his election to the presidency after the coup. Zapatistas had almost total control of the state of Morelos, where they carried out a program of agrarian reform and land redistribution based on the provisions of the Plan de Ayala and with the support of the government.

After Zapata's assassination, according to ''La Demócrata'', Zapata "had taken in the consciousness of the natives the proportions of a myth" because he had "given them a formula of vindication against old offenses."&lt;ref&gt;Womack, ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythmaking would continue for decades after Zapata was gunned down.

Zapata's influence continues to this day, particularly in revolutionary tendencies in southern Mexico. In the long run, he has done more for his ideals in death than he did in life.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; Like many charismatic idealists, Zapata became a [[martyr]] after his murder.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt; Even though Mexico still has not implemented the sort of land reform he wanted, he is remembered as a visionary who fought for his countrymen.&lt;ref name=kpkap /&gt;

Zapata's Plan of Ayala influenced Article 27 of the progressive 1917 [[Constitution of Mexico]] that codified an agrarian reform program.&lt;ref name=iupqz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Emiliano_Zapata.aspx |title=Emiliano Zapata Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about Emiliano Zapata |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Mexican Revolution did restore some land that had been taken under Diaz,&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt; the land reform on the scale imagined by Zapata was never enacted.&lt;ref name=kpkapza /&gt; However, a great deal of the significant land distribution which Zapata sought would later be enacted after Mexican President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] took office in 1934.&lt;ref name=iupqz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/itvs/storm-that-swept-mexico/the-revolution/faces-revolution/lazaro-cardenas/ |title=Lazaro Cardenas: Faces of the Revolution: The Storm That Swept Mexico |publisher=PBS |date=April 9, 1936 |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cárdenas would fulfill not only the land distribution policies written in Article 27, but other reforms written in the Mexican Constitution as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-25-4-land-liberty-and-the-mexican-revolution.html |title=BRIA 25 4 Land Liberty and the Mexican Revolution | publisher=Constitutional Rights Foundation |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are controversies about the portrayal of Emiliano Zapata and his followers, whether they were bandits or revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Brunk, "The Sad Situation of Civilians and Soldiers: The Banditry of Zapatismo in the Mexican", ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 101, No. 2 (Apr., 1996), pp. 331–353&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the Revolution, "Zapata's agrarian revolt was soon construed as a 'caste war' [race war], in which members of an 'inferior race' were captained by a 'modern Attila'".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Knight, ''The Mexican Revolution, vol. 1. Porfirians, Liberals, and Peasants''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cuernavaca 6117b o.jpg|thumb|left|Equestrian statue of Emiliano Zapata, dedicated by President [[José López Portillo]] in Cuernavaca, Morelos, 1978, showing General Zapata with a [[machete]] rather than a military sword]]
Zapata is now one of the most revered national heroes of Mexico. To many Mexicans, especially the peasant and indigenous citizens, Zapata was a practical revolutionary who sought the implementation of liberties and agrarian rights outlined in the [[Plan of Ayala]]. He was a realist with the goal of achieving political and economic emancipation of the peasants in southern Mexico and leading them out of severe poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Zapata and the Mexican Revolution |last=Womack |first=John Jr. |publisher=Knopf |year=1969|isbn=0394708539 |location=New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular organizations take their name from Zapata, most notably the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] ''(Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional'' or EZLN in Spanish), the initially [[Marxist]] guerrilla group that emerged in the state of [[Chiapas]] in 1983 and precipitated the 1994 indigenous Zapatista uprising which still continues in Chiapas. Towns, streets, and housing developments called "Emiliano Zapata" are common across the country and he has, at times, been depicted on [[Mexican peso|Mexican banknotes]].&lt;ref name="MexMoney"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maztravel.com/maz/money.html|title=Mexican Money}} Retrieved July 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Metro Zapata.JPG|thumb|right|[[Metro Zapata]] in Mexico City. The icon shows a stylized, eyeless Zapata.]]

Modern activists in Mexico frequently make reference to Zapata in their campaigns; his image is commonly seen on banners, and many chants invoke his name: ''Si Zapata viviera con nosotros anduviera'' ("If Zapata lived, he would walk with us"), and ''Zapata vive, la lucha sigue'' ("Zapata lives; the struggle continues"). Along with this, great-great-granddaughter Antonieta Hensley shares his story and message through her poetry. {{Citation needed|date = April 2012}}

His daughter, [[Paulina Ana María Zapata Portillo]], was aware of her father's legacy from a very early age. She continued his work of dedication to agrarian rights, serving as treasurer of the ''[[ejido]]'' of Cuautla, as ''ejidataria'' of Cuautla, as municipal councilor and municipal trustee.&lt;ref name="Obit La Jornada Morelos"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baltazar |first1=Fernando |title=Murió Ana María Zapata Portillo, última sobreviviente reconocida por El Caudillo |url=http://www.lajornadamorelos.com/noticias/politica/84295?task=view |accessdate=1 August 2015 |publisher=La Jornada Morelos |date=1 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303144149/http://www.lajornadamorelos.com/noticias/politica/84295?task=view |archivedate=March 3, 2010 |location=Morelos, Mexico |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Emiliano Zapata}}
Zapata has been depicted in movies, comics, books, music, and clothing popular with teenagers and young adults. For example, there is a ''Zapata'' (1980), stage musical written by [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Perry Botkin, Jr.|Perry Botkin]], [[libretto]] by [[Allan Katz]], which ran for 16 weeks at the Goodspeed Opera House in [[East Haddam, Connecticut]]. A movie called ''[[Zapata: El sueño de un héroe]]'' (''Zapata: A Hero's Dream'') was produced in 2004, starring Mexican actors [[Alejandro Fernandez]], [[Jaime Camil]], and [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]].

[[Marlon Brando]] played Emiliano Zapata in the award-winning movie based on his life, ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'' in 1952. The film co-starred [[Anthony Quinn]], who won best supporting actor. The director was [[Elia Kazan]] and the writer was [[John Steinbeck]].

Emiliano Zapata is a major character in ''The Friends of Pancho Villa'' (1996), by ''[[James Carlos Blake]]''

'''Fauzi Bowo''' (born 10 April 1948 in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia) is an [[Indonesia]]n politician and diplomat who is the current Indonesian Ambassador to [[Germany]]. He was the governor of Jakarta between 2007 and 2012 and previously served as deputy governor.

He has worked for the Jakarta administration since 1987 and was treasurer of the [[Golkar]] organization from 1993 to 1997. On 8 August 2007 he was elected governor of Jakarta (2007–2012), beating his only rival Adang Daradjatun 57.9% to 42.1% in the first ever election for the post. He was inaugurated on 7 October 2007.&lt;ref name="KCM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kompas.co.id/ver1/Metropolitan/0710/07/162358.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223103730/http://www.kompas.co.id/ver1/Metropolitan/0710/07/162358.htm |archivedate=23 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having run for a second term as governor in the [[Jakarta gubernatorial election, 2012|2012 gubernatorial election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lewat Twitter, Anas Umumkan Pasangan Foke-Nachrowi|date=19 March 2012|publisher=Tempo|url=http://www.tempo.co/read/news/2012/03/19/228391272/Lewat-Twitter-Anas-Umumkan-Pasangan-Foke-Nachrowi|work=|accessdate=19 March 2012|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was defeated on 20 September 2012 after a second-round runoff by [[Joko Widodo]].

==Background and education==
Fauzi Bowo, known as "Foke" to many Jakartans, was born in Jakarta to a wealthy landowning family.&lt;ref name="KOMPAS020807"&gt;''Kompas'' newspaper 2 August 2007 p33&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Djohari bin Adiputro, was from [[Malang]], [[East Java]], and his mother, Nuraini binti Abdul Manaf, from [[Jakarta]]. After high school at [[Kanisius|Canisius College]] in Jakarta, Fauzi studied at the architecture faculty at the [[University of Indonesia]] from 1966 to 1967. There, he was involved in the Indonesian Students Action Front (KAMI), an organization established to  counter the communist-influenced Indonesian Student Union.&lt;ref name="SUNDHAUSSEN"&gt;Sundhaussen (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 he won a scholarship to study in [[West Germany]], where he was a student of town planning at the [[Technical University at Brunswick]], graduating in 1976. While in Germany he was active in the Indonesian Students Association. In 2000, he completed a doctoral degree ''Doktor Ingenieur'' from [[University of Kaiserslautern]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fauzibowo.com/profil.php 	 Pemimpin Jakarta yang Luwes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104201715/http://fauzibowo.com/profil.php |date=4 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Two years after graduating, in 1979 Fauzi was appointed acting head of the Jakarta Regional Bureau, eventually being promoted as regional secretary in 1998. He served as treasurer to the government [[Golkar]] organization from 1983 to 1997. In 2002 he expressed his intention to stand for the governor of Jakarta, which at the time was chosen by the regional administration. However, he was persuaded to stand aside and become deputy governor to [[Sutiyoso]].&lt;ref name="KOMPAS020807"/&gt;

In 2004 he began approaching political and religious organizations to support his bid for the governorship of Jakarta. With the support of 19 political parties, including Golkar, [[Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle|PDI-P]] and [[United Development Party|PPP]], he stood for the governorship in 2007 with Prijanto as his running mate. Fauzi defeated his opponent [[Adang Daradjatun]] (running with Dani Anwar as candidate for deputy governor) in Jakarta's first gubernatorial election on 8 August by 57.9% to 42.1% of the vote.

Fauzi was shortlisted for the 2008 [[World Mayor]] award but failed to finish in the top 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldmayor.com/contest_2008/world-mayor-2008-results.html worldmayor.com results]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he was appointed as Indonesia’s ambassador to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Markus Junianto |last = Sihaloho|title=House Approves 22 New Ambassadors|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/house-approves-22-new-ambassadors|accessdate=7 August 2017|work=[[The Jakarta Globe]]|date=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==
Under Fauzi Bowo, 5 new routes of TransJakarta (Jakarta's "busway") were added, however TransJakarta users have complained of long waiting time and worsening service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.vivanews.com/news/read/273529-transjakarta-services-considered-worsening 'TransJakarta Services Considered Worsening'] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120717044328/http://en.vivanews.com/news/read/273529-transjakarta-services-considered-worsening |date=17 July 2012 }}, ''VivaNews'', 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kabarpolitik.com/2012/03/29/ridwan-dan-sutiyoso-anggap-fauzi-bowo-gagal/ 'Ridwan dan Sutiyoso anggap Fauzi Bowo Gagal (In Indonesian)'], ''Kabar Politik'', 29 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There are constant complaints in the media about the worsening traffic situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/25/editorial-just-another-year-foke.html 'Just another year, Foke!'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 25 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jakartans argue that Governor Fauzi and the Jakarta regional government should have done more to invest in public transport facilities, and to enforce regulations, in order to improve traffic flows across Jakarta. One response to the problem was a plan (2011) to establish a Greater Jakarta Transportation Authority to coordinate the implementation of the numerous proposals that had been made to improve the traffic challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas D. Arditya, [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/24/govt-help-with-city-traffic.html 'Govt to help with city traffic'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 24 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a feasibility study for a [[Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT)system was published; it proposed integration of the  [[TransJakarta]] service and a railway service, and predicted construction of the rail lines to begin at end of 2012. After the project was pushed by Fauzi's successor, Joko Widodo, construction was in fact commenced in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/10/10/jokowi-leads-mrt-ground-breaking-ceremony.html Jokowi leads MRT ground-breaking ceremony'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 10 Oct 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the policies which Fauzi pursued is support for an anti-smoking campaign first introduced by his predecessor, former Governor [[Sutiyoso]]. The first tobacco legislation in Jakarta was introduced by Sutiyoso in 2005 when a by-law on air pollution control was issued. Several supporting regulations were subsequently introduced. Anti-smoking regulations introduced by Fauzi in 2011 banned people from smoking inside public buildings and certain other places. The regulations have had a noticeable impact in Jakarta. There has been a marked reduction in smoking in government offices and in places such as large modern hotels which are subject to the regulations.  In May 2011 the World Health Organization named Fauzi as one of the recipients of the World No Tobacco Day 2011 Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/30/anti-tobacco%E2%80%99s-award-fauzi.html 'Anti-Tobacco Award for Fauzi'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123025104/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/30/anti-tobacco%E2%80%99s-award-fauzi.html |date=23 January 2012 }}, ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grigory Petrovich Nikulin''' (Russian: Григо́рий Петро́вич Нику́лин; 10 January 1895 [O.S. 27 December 1894] - 22 September 1965) was a Russian [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary best known for taking part in killing of Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia]], his family and four others on the night of 16 July 1918.

== Early life ==
Nikulin was born and raised in [[Zvenyhorodka|Zvenigorodka]], Kiev province, Russian Empire. He came from a lower-class family. His father Pyotr Iossiffovich (Пётр Иосифович) was a bricklayer and mother Anna Ivanovna a housewife. At the age of 9 Grigory started attending parish school at Zvenigorod church, which he enjoyed immensely. Education was interrupted by his family's disastrous financial situation. After which he started working in a local blacksmith shop. In the spring of 1909 family sold their house in Zvenigorodka and moved to a nearby  small town of Uman. At the age of 16 Grigory moved out of parent's house and became a bricklayer. He joined a local social democratic club in Uman in 1913. Soon he was deported from Kiev province and moved to Kazan.

=== Joining Bolsheviks ===
January 1915 he was drafted into army, but due to congenital diseases was only fit for wartime militia units and not for regular service. Early 1916 Grigory moved to Tavatui near Yekaterinburg and started working in construction site of dynamite plant (Таватуйский динамитный завод). Very soon after moving he was drawn to local Bolsheviks and met Mikhail Kabanov who helped him become a devoted follower of Lenin. By the end of 1916 he was organizing a strike at dynamite plant. In March 1917 Nikulin became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) i.e. Communist party. Party number – 128185. 

As a result of financing problems with French joint-stock company, plant activists decided to stop all work with the construction of this facility early 1918. Nikulin was sent to Yekaterinburg along with all the party members of factory. He met Goloschekin, a member of the Ural Regional Committee of the RSDLP and joined Ural Cheka on his recommendation. Starting his service in Cheka Nikulin soon became acquainted with Yakov Yurovsky who noticed Nikulin's modesty, ability to get along with different people, honesty and absolute sobriety. The two became friends and formed a special relationship for years where Yurovsky simply called him "son". Nikulin was appointed Assistant to the Commandant of the House of Special Purpose on the recommendation of Yurovsky. The Commandant was Yurovsky himself.

== Yekaterinburg Cheka ==
Having begun work in Cheka Grigory got some serious cases to work. One of the first was discrete surveillance of Alexander Ivanovich Andogsky, the head of Military Academy of Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Nikulin was introduced as a domestic worker to Andogsky after the Academy was evacuated from Petrograd to Yekaterinburg in March 1918. Later same year Andogsky joined the White forces, was dismissed from the Military Academy and eventually was appointed as General in [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]]'s Army.

Nikulin was also in charge of soldiers selection for train convoy L-42, on 30 April 1918 where Tsar Nicholas II and part of his family were moved from Tyumen to Yekaterinburg.

=== Killing of Prince Dolgorukov ===
Execution of Prince [[Vasily Alexandrovich Dolgorukov]]. Dolgorukov was a close friend of Nicholas II as well as his advisor, Marshal of the Imperial Court (1914–1917) and Commander of the Imperial Guard cavalry regiment. Deeply devoted to the Tsar he voluntarily accompanied the Imperial family to imprisonment in Tobolsk. After arriving to Yekaterinburg at the end of May he was separated from the family and arrested. Executed 10 July 1918 in cold blood by Nikulin, a week before the killing of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Dolgorukov was taken to a field beyond city's Ivanovskoe Cemetery with Count Tatishchev and the two were shot in the head and thrown into a pit. Nikulin recalled the incident in his radio interview 1964: "Я вывез его в поле и проклял всё пока тащил чемоданы назад" (I took him out to the field and cursed everything while I was dragging his suitcases back). Dolgorukov was canonized later in 1981.  

Nikulin was also involved in death of Hermogenes, Bishop of Tobolsk and Siberia, who was drowned in Tura River by Bolsheviks.

=== Killing of Nicholas II and family ===
Grigory Nikulin is known for his participating in killing of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas]] II and his family. Nikulin was living in the House of Special Purpose ie [[Ipatiev House]] since his appointment as Assistant to the Commandant. He was also in charge of the house in absence of Yurovsky who lived in the "American Hotel". The Ural Regional Soviet agreed in a meeting on June 29th that the Romanov family should be executed. After getting the final approval from Central Executive Committee in Moscow Yurovsky organized a meeting in American Hotel. Participation in killing was voluntary and people who agreed to participate came to Yurovsky's room. It was agreed that to prevent unnecessary suffering executees were to be shot to the heart. 

On 17 July, right after midnight Yurovsky woke up Tsar, his family, doctor and servants, 11 persons altogether and guided them to an empty room at lower floor of the house. On demand of tsaritsa [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra]] Nikulin brought two chairs. One for her and one for [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Prince Alexei]]. Yurovsky announced the verdict: "Nikolai Alexandrovich, in view of the fact that your relatives are continuing their attack on Soviet Russia, the Ural Executive Committee has decided to execute you." Shooting started. It is controversial who actually shot the Tsar – Yurovsky, Medvedev, Ermakov, or all of them. Nikulin shot one bullet to Prince Alexei and left the room. Apparently Alexei didn't die from this shot. Yurovsky shot Alexei in the head killing him. Long after this event, in private conversation with son of Mikhail Medvedev Nikulin said that he couldn't bear sick boy looking at him and stopped shooting. 

Afterwards Nikulin controlled carrying of corpses to truck waiting outside. He had all the jewels and valuables that had been sewn into clothes of royal family removed. On 20 July, just few days before arrival of the White Army, Nikulin left Yekaterinburg. He personally carried 6,000 carats of Tsar's diamonds to State Bank in Moscow.

Interesting fact is that Nikulin was liked by Imperial family. He wasn't like others. He was well mannered and polite. From diary of Alexandra Feodorovna: "June 21st, Thursday. "..young assistant, who seems very nice person, compared to other ones that are vulgar and unpleasant.. Young man (Nikulin) enumerated jewelry items and did it thoroughly". From the diary of Nicholas II: "June 23th, Saturday. Yurovsky and his assistant (Nikulin) started to understand what sort of people was around, stealing from us and guarded us from them". 

== After Yekaterinburg ==
After completing the assignment in Yekaterinburg Nikulin joined the Red Army. He had several duties at 3rd Army of the Eastern front. He even took part in battles. Early 1919 he started working for political department of the division (politotdel) but contracted typhus and was taken to Moscow. There he met again Yurovsky, who worked for Moscow City Council at the time and offered him a job as head of the Moscow apartment houses. They continued their warm friendship meeting each other on and off duty.

Nikulin stayed in Moscow and worked in different jobs. First for City Council (MosSoviet). Later he was allocated to the position of Moscow prisons head. Four months after that the head of inspectorate department of Moscow police. He then worked as the head of [[Moscow Criminal Investigations Department|Moscow Criminal Investigation Department]] from March 1920 to 1922. In 1922 he was awarded with the [[Order of the Red Banner]].

== Later life ==
Between 1923 and 1938 Nikulin had several noteworthy positions. 1923–1924 Vice-head of Moscow Criminal Investigation Department. From 1925 member of MosGorIspolCom (Moscow Executive Committee). 1925 - 1930 The head of MosGubStrakh (Moscow Insurance State Company). 1930–1931 the head of MosGas (Moscow Gas trest). 1933–1935 he worked at MosSovet on a problem of building materials manufacturing. 1935–1938 the head of MosZhilOtdel (Moscow Housing Department).

He was often visited by his comrades from House Ipatiev who had also taken part in Tsar's killing – Rodzinsky and Medvedev. In 1927 Nikulin and Yurovsky made an application to USSR Revolution Museum and handed them two revolvers which were used in killing of Imperial Family.

Yurovsky died in 1938. Before dying he wrote a warm farewell letter to his dear friend Nikulin leaving him list of documents to be delivered to Revolution Museum. From 1938 to his retirement in 1960 Nikulin worked for Department of Water and Sewerage. He was awarded with four state orders, one of which was [[Order of the Patriotic War]] 1st class (1947). During his whole life Nikulin insisted on keeping low profile concerning the killing of imperial family. He even asked Medvedev not to mention his role in killing. One year before his death he was asked by high partie official to give an interview to radio. It resulted in 3 hour recording in which he talks about everything. "All was done consciously, without doubts. I did understand all responsibility. I welcomed the decision of Ural Regional Soviet.. And even more, if it is allowed to say, I considered it as an honor."

Grigory Nikulin died on 22 September 1965. He was buried on the site of the "old Bolsheviks" at [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow. Right across Nikulin's grave is the grave of [[Boris Yeltsin]], President of Russian Federation. Ipatiev house was demolished by order of Boris Yeltsin in 1977 while being leader of Sverdlovsk Executive Committee. Politburo had declared the house not to be of "sufficient historical significance".

'''Heinrich Wilhelm Brüssow''' (born 21 July 1986) is a South African [[rugby union]] player. His usual position is open-side [[Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]] and he currently plays for [[Northampton Saints]] in the [[Premiership Rugby|English Premiership]].

He played for the {{Rut Free State Cheetahs}} in domestic South African rugby between 2006 and 2014, for the {{Rut Cheetahs}} in [[Super Rugby]] between 2007 and 2015 and also represented {{nrut|South Africa}} between 2008 and 2011 and for the [[South Africa national rugby sevens team|South Africa Sevens]] team in 2006.

==Early career==

Born 21 July 1986 in [[Bloemfontein]], South Africa, Heinrich Brüssow attended [[Grey College, Bloemfontein|Grey College]] in Bloemfontein where he played in the First XV and was later selected for the Under-18 Free State [[Craven Week]] side. Brüssow was part of the [[Free State Cheetahs]] squad who shared the [[Currie Cup]] glory in [[2006 Currie Cup Premier Division|2006]] with the [[Blue Bulls]], before playing in the [[2007 Currie Cup Premier Division|2007 Currie Cup]] final against the [[Golden Lions]], scoring a crucial try and helping the team to a 20–18 win. In 2008 he was voted best open-side flanker in the [[Super Rugby|Super 14]] and [[Currie Cup]]. This earned him a call-up to the [[Springboks]] squad for the November 2008 tour to the [[British Isles]]. He only played the final 4 minutes in the end-of-tour test against [[England national rugby union team|England]].

==Professional career==
In 2009, Brüssow was again a flanker in the [[Super Rugby|Super 14]] competition. However, selectors excluded him from the Springboks squad. Soon afterwards he played for the [[Free State Cheetahs]] against the [[British and Irish Lions]] team; Brüssow was finally called up for [[Schalk Burger]], who failed to recover from an injury for the first test against the [[British and Irish Lions|Lions]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/8100972.stm BBC: Brüssow handed Springboks start&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/06/16/rugby.lions.springboks.test/index.html CNN: Springboks call for flanker Brüssow&lt;/ref&gt; He received the Man-of-the-Match award in the Springboks' win against the [[All Blacks]] on 25 July 2009.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2682188"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/international/2682188/Pocket-rocket-to-plague-All-Blacks |title=Pocket rocket to plague All Blacks |date=28 July 2009 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brüssow once again featured in a [[Currie Cup]] final in [[2009 Currie Cup Premier Division|2009]], but the [[Free State Cheetahs]] lost to a hungry [[Blue Bulls]] team.

Early March 2010 Brüssow's career took a blow when he injured his cruciate knee-ligament&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/08/heinrich-brussow-injury-south-africa Guardian.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Super Rugby|Super 14]] game against the [[Hurricanes (rugby union)|Hurricanes]], which kept him from international rugby till August 2011. For the Cheetahs in the 2011 super rugby season Brussow was part of the Cheetahs team that finished 11th in the table. The cheetahs won five and lost eleven games that season which showed that they were not at their best. However they produced some wonderful wins against the [[New South Wales Waratahs|Waratahs]] and the [[Brumbies]]. In the 2011 tri nations Brüssow only came in at the third game against eventual champions [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]]. South Africa lost the match 14–9. South Africa had nothing much to play for in final test against New Zealand but they could certainly spoil the party for the All Blacks. Brüssow put up a Man-of-the-Match winning performance and South Africa beat the All Blacks by 18–5.

He returned to international competition on 13 August 2011 against Australia: He played for a short stint from the bench where he showed he still had the full ability which made him so popular in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://sport.iafrica.com/rugby/news/747735.html iAfrica.com:Brussow to steal the show&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 August Heinrich Brüssow gave a Man-of-the-Match display of his skills as the [[Springboks]] managed to defeat their arch-enemies, the All Blacks in [[Port Elizabeth]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sport.iafrica.com/news/747805.html iAfrica.com:Boks come to the party&lt;/ref&gt;

Brüssow played the first game against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] which South Africa won 17–16 and against [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] which the boks also won 49–3. However against [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia]], Alberts was favoured to Brüssow in the starting line up which meant Brüssow had to drop to the bench. South Africa won the game and Brüssow restored his place in the starting line up against [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] which South Africa won to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup. In the quarter-finals Brussow started against Australia. South Africa lost the game 11–9 and were knocked out of the competition. In the summer internationals Brüssow was shockingly dropped from the team with new South Africa coach [[Heyneke Meyer]] preferring [[Marcell Coetzee]]. Even without Brüssow's commitment, South Africa won the series against England with a win in the first test 22–17, second test 36–27 but where held to a draw in the third test 14–14.

In 2013, it was announced that he would play for a team in the Japanese [[Top League]] for the 2013–2014 season – later revealed as [[NTT DoCoMo Red Hurricanes]]&lt;ref name="2013年度 新加入予定選手のお知らせ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docomo-rugby.jp/information/2013/0710_01.html | script-title=ja:2013年度 新加入予定選手のお知らせ | work=NTT Docomo Red Hurricanes | date=10 July 2013 | accessdate=11 July 2013 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but he would return to play for the {{Rut Cheetahs}} in the [[2014 Super Rugby season]].&lt;ref name="Brüssow heading for Japan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/Super15/Brussow-heading-for-Japan-20130620 | title=Brüssow heading for Japan | work=Sport24 | date=20 June 2013 | accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, he joined [[Premiership Rugby|English Premiership]] side [[Northampton Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/41254306|work=BBC Sport|title=Northampton Saints: South Africa flanker Heinrich Brussow to join Premiership club in January 2018|date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influential Games==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}

=== 2009 ===
* 20 June 2009 : South Africa vs British and Irish Lions I: Heinrich Brüssow replaces injured Schalk Burger in the starting line-up. His ball-stealing and recovering skills proved too much for the Lions. When he was replaced in the second half, the Lions managed to fight back, but not enough to win the game. Scored a try from the back of a maul and was outstanding as they went on to secure a 2–1 series victory.
* 27 June 2009 : South Africa vs Lions II: Brüssow came on in the 62nd minute and effected a few crucial turn-overs helping seal the 28–25 victory for the South Africans.
* 25 July 2009 : South Africa vs All Blacks I: Although being targeted, Brüssow battled competently against [[Richie McCaw]], who is widely considered the best open-side flanker in the world. He made a number of crucial turn-overs and tackles. He was named Man-of-the-Match in the 28–19 victory.
*1 August 2009 : South Africa vs All Blacks II: Continuing to build on his reputation, Brüssow again managed to compete with the All Black captain Richie McCaw at the breakdown. He once again made a number of crucial turnovers, tackles and powerful runs as the Boks won 31–19.
*8 August 2009 : South Africa vs [[Wallabies (rugby union)|Wallabies]] I: Brüssow was once again in outstanding form for the Springboks as his ruck work, brutal hits and ball-carrying led South Africa to victory over Australia. His opposite number [[George Smith (rugby union)|George Smith]], also considered one of the best in world rugby, could not cut it with Brüssow, and his frustration led to a yellow card.
*13 November 2009 : South Africa vs France: It was a grey evening for the men in green, as they were out-muscled by France 20–13. Brüssow, though, stood up and kept the Springboks in the match with several vital turnovers and tackles. Even though it was a defeat, the match in [[Toulouse]] was considered Brüssow's best in a test jersey up to that stage, and was named SA Rugby young player of the year.

=== 2011 ===
*20 August 2011: After a lengthy injury lay-off, Brüssow returned to the international stage in the [[Springboks]]' final two [[Tri Nations (rugby union)|Tri Nations]] matches of the 2011 season. After a short stint against Australia (13 August 2011), he played a full game against New Zealand All Blacks. With a first-off whitewash on the cards, Brüssow's fetching skills would be vital, in order for the Boks to gain some momentum before the ([[2011 Rugby World Cup|RWC World Cup 2011]]). Brüssow delivered a Man-of-the-Match winning performance. One that saw him make some fantastic and crucial turnovers, immense tackles and ball carries while going through an enormous amount of donkey work and taking a boot to the face for his efforts. Brüssow ended the game with a bloodied, pockmarked face and bandage, but most probably assured his place in [[Peter de Villiers]]' plans for rugby's greatest stage in New Zealand, the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].
*9 October 2011: After South Africa progress to the quarter finals of the Rugby World Cup they lose 11–9 in Wellington to be knocked out of the competition.

==Injury==

{{removed|reason=Outdated news article|date=21 May 2013}}
South Africa's flanker Heinrich Brussow has been ruled out for the rest of the season after suffering a cruciate knee-ligament injury during the Cheetahs' 28‑12 win over the Hurricanes in the Super 14 on Saturday.

The 23-year-old's injury, which is expected to keep him out for eight months, means he will miss the defence of the Tri-Nations title and is unlikely to make the end-of-year tour of Britain and Ireland.
The Cheetahs coach Naka Drotske said: "Its a big blow. Heinrich is irreplaceable; he is a once-in-a-lifetime-player who always gives 150%. It's very bad for Heinrich, but it's one position in which we have depth with players like Hendro Scholtz and Kabamba Floors able to deputise."

==Playing Style==

Heinrich Brüssow is well known in South Africa because of his immense and unstoppable work at the breakdowns and in the scrums. He was selected for the South African team due to his excellent work performances. He was also admired by many when he outfought [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] captain [[Richie McCaw]] in two of their duels, one which South Africa won 18–5.

==Transfer Rumours==
In January 2012 there was a rumour that Brüssow may join Ireland pro 12 team Ulster Rugby, but Brussow eventually stayed with the Cheetahs.

==Early years==

Kris Kaspersky was born on November 2, 1976 in the village of [[Uspenskoye, Krasnodar Krai]], and at birth was named Nikolay. Being just a few weeks old he suffered a brain stroke, which came as a result of injection of [[calcium chloride]], mistakenly made by a doctor. Brain tissue was partly damaged leading to minor [[autism]].&lt;ref name="example web reference" /&gt; At the age of seven he made his first working radio. While studying at the elementary school he owned his first computer – [[Pravetz computers|Pravetz 8D]], Bulgarian clone of British [[Oric| Oric Atmos]] with the documentation in [[Bulgarian language]]. The computer required connection to a tape recorder and a color TV set. His first computer game Kris developed for [[Pravetz computers|Pravetz 8D]].&lt;ref name="example web reference" /&gt;

{{quote|Zero mark and right brocket standing close to each other represented a fish. The fish was running across the screen back and forth. In the center of the screen, there was a question mark sign, which stood for fisherman. To catch the fish, player needed to press space bar.}}

His next computer, [[Electronika BK-0010]], helped Kris to master [[Assembly language|assembly]]. The third computer was [[ZX Spectrum]], the fourth one was [[Agat (computer)|Agat]]. Except for his birthday, Kris does not remember exact dates and chronology of events, he reconstructs them based on computer models he had at various periods of his life.&lt;ref name="example web reference" /&gt;

He graduated from high school with a silver medal. Kris was a good student, and there were only excellent marks in his certificate, however, according to Kris, to get a gold medal one needed to give bribes to local officials.&lt;ref name="example web reference" /&gt; He entered [[Taganrog]] University of Radio Engineering with a specialization in "Design of [[microcontroller]]s" without entrance exam. Although he went down without taking even first end-of-semester exams because "''students hardly had a possibility to program''" and returned to his native village. In the next year, he entered the university again "''to calm mom''" and again he went down. In those years Kris had [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] with 20 mb disk and color monitor. In cooperation with student Shurik, they organized a service of system administration in [[Taganrog]]. Some time later his companion absconded with the money. Kris Kaspersky had to give the remaining money and the computer to [[Racket (crime)|racketeers]] and returned to the native village to his parents.

Then Kris made attempts to reopen the business with a trader from [[Armavir, Russia|Armavir]], took trips to Krasnodar and Rostov. Finally, Kris ended up in the capital. 
{{quote|''"Once upon a time, in Moscow, at the stairwell, used by the staff as a place for smoking, the historical meeting of two Kasperskys happened. Kris came to [[Eugene Kaspersky]] [[Kaspersky Lab|Antivirus Lab.]] to suggest a couple of ideas, but the cooperation went wrong: "I do not know why, but as soon as it comes to my person in the lab, it brings them down. Now they spread rumors that I worked in the Lab. for three weeks, that they took me for fun, and then expelled. At present Kaspersky and me are in parallel planes, I do not interfere with his business, and he does not interfere with mine. Moreover, I specifically changed the letter in my nickname to avoid confusion. But he dislikes my anyway."”''&lt;ref name="example web reference" /&gt;}}

==Publications==

The first article written by Kris was published when he was still in school. It was published by "Astrologer” magazine, and the article itself was devoted to [[astronomy]]. In 1998 Kris began to contribute actively to conferences of [[FidoNet]] RU.HACKER. Dmitry Sadchenko noted his posts and arranged him a meeting with the representatives of publishing house "Solon-Press". In 1999 "Solon-Press" published the first book of Kris Kaspersky "Technique and philosophy of hacker attacks" with 50 000 rubles of author's fee. Desktop publisher specialist Sergey Tarasov recalls:

{{quote|''"First time he came accompanied by his father – afterwards we began to publish his electrical engineering handbooks too. Kris was a good writer and conversation partner, and what is most important, had no quirks and excessive self-importance. His head worked incredibly well – he literally programmed in mind."''}}

A total of 16 books had been published by 2008, including several translations into English. The books were dedicated to [[Information privacy|data protection]] and [[program optimization]], [[computer virus]] and disassembling. Among these books there's also "Weatherlore Encyclopedia". Kris's interest lies in the field of computers and [[astronomy]]. Some of his articles and forum topics concern [[telescope]]s and observation of the starry sky. Along with the books Kris contributes to such magazines as "System administrator", "Byte", "Astrologer", "Hacker". The chief editor of "Hacker" magazine Nikita Kislitsin said:&lt;ref name="example web reference" /&gt;

{{quote|''"Neither me nor anybody else from editorial staff have seen him alive. We communicate by mail and telephone. He is a maniacally enthusiastic person, one can always address him with a request: "We need to reverse compile WM Keeper, to understand what it's spying upon a PC, and write a 25 kilobytes article about it until tomorrow morning."”''}}

Recently Kris Kaspersky expressed the idea to leave Russia. And, in order to increase the audience, to start writing books originally in English. Besides Kris Kaspersky had started his English blog. In late October 2008 he made a presentation on a fundamentally new holes in [[Intel]] processors, suitable for remote capture of multiple servers at a conference Hack in the Box in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

==Endeavor Security and McAfee==

Until recently Kris Kaspersky lived an isolated way of life in his native village. Since June 2008, he worked remotely on Endeavor Security, engaged in security of computers and networks. In 2009, [[Intel Security|McAfee]] acquired Endeavor Security.

{{quote|''"Kris knows the answer to the main question concerning security – he knows the way it works, – says CEO of the company Christopher Jordan. – Besides, he can instantly give rise to a new idea." “His fame outside Russia is not exaggerated – says another Endeavor employee Alice Chang – he's a very well-known hacker, in the original sense of the word: a man who understands the very basics of how it works."''&lt;ref name="example web reference" /&gt;}}

Since 2008 Kris has been living and working in the United States.&lt;ref name="migration"&gt;[https://xakep.ru/2011/01/12/54475/?print=true «Migration of IT-specialists from midland: Where and how these people live abroad»], Article in "Hacker" magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for [[Check Point]] as a security expert.

==Some facts==

In order to avoid any confusion with antivirus creator [[Eugene Kaspersky]], he spells his penname differently in Russian. His penname "myschh" was chosen owing to the novel [[Dune (novel)|"Dune"]] which is a great favorite of his (Kris often used quotations from the novel, in particular, in his first book "Technique and philosophy of hacker attacks"&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{citebook|title=Technique and philosophy of hacker attacks|isbn=5-93455-015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The name of the protagonist of the novel is Muad'Dib, which stands for a desert mouse. Kris Kaspersky penname is not a derivative from any other word and it has no relevance to [[Eugene Kaspersky]]. Kris named himself after [[Casper the friendly ghost]] from his favorite cartoon and [[Kris Kelmi]],{{efn|Russian rock and pop musician}} whose music, nevertheless, myschh never listened to.&lt;ref name="example web reference"&gt;[http://bg.ru/society/dobryy_haker-7755 «Good hacker» — Kris’ biography in «Big city» magazine]. Kris is also known under the following pseudonyms: '''myschh''', '''nezumi''' ([[Japanese language|jap.]] 鼠, mouse), '''n2k''', '''elraton''', '''souriz''', '''tikus''', '''muss''', '''farah''', '''jardon''', '''KPNC'''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kris was very lean. He spoke with a southern accent, sometimes swallowed and distorted words, softened endings of the verbs. He wore long hair and beard. He was not fussed about clothing.&lt;ref name="example web reference"/&gt; 
Kaspersky described his native village this way: "''Dedicated ten megabits internet channel''".&lt;ref name="example web reference"/&gt;

== Injury and death ==
On February 10, 2017, Kris Kaspersky (Nikolay Likhachev) was critically injured in a hard landing after sky diving: "A sky diver who took a hard landing at Skydive DeLand remains in intensive care and is unable to communicate, a nurse at Halifax Health Medical Center said Monday. The sky diver, 40-year-old Nikolay Likhachev, suffered a compound fracture to his left leg and a head injury, an incident report released Monday by DeLand police states. The report states that Likhachev had completed 200 jumps, most of them at Skydive DeLand. Likhachev […] was injured Friday just before 9:15 a.m."&lt;ref name="Longa"/&gt;

Kris Kaspersky was taken off life support and died from his wounds a week later on February 18, 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Lamoni''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|m|oʊ|n|aɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «la-mō´nī»&lt;/ref&gt; believed to mean "Lamanite" or "of [[Laman]]") is a [[Lamanite]] king.  The missionary [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)|Ammon]] converts him back to the [[Torah|Law of Moses]].  After this, Lamoni becomes righteous.

Lamoni was a lesser king of one part of the larger Lamanite Kingdom, as recounted in the Book of Mormon.  Lamoni's father was king over all of the Lamanites, a people who traditionally had a visceral hatred of the Nephites.  After initially having the Nephite missionary Ammon imprisoned, Lamoni later allows him to be his servant.  Later still Ammon saves some of Lamoni's servants and animals in a seemingly miraculous way.  Lamoni then believes that Ammon is the [[Great Spirit]].  After being told by Ammon that he (Ammon) is only a servant of the Great Spirit (meant by context to mean ''God'') Lamoni is finally convinced that Ammon is not deity.  After his conversion Lamoni is traveling with Ammon when he encounters his father the high Lamanite king.  At the peril of his life Lamoni verbally defends Ammon.  Eventually Lamoni helps gain freedom for Ammon and his fellow Nephite missionaries to preach freely in the Lamanite areas.  Lamoni's people are generally considered to be the corp of a people that would be called the ''Anti-Nephi-Lehies'', or [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|Ammonites]]

'''Liath Luachra''', the "'''Gray of Luachair'''", is the name of two characters in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. Both appear in ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'', which details the young life and adventures of the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]].

The first Liath Luachra is one of Fionn's foster mothers who raise him after the death of his father [[Cumhal]] at the hands of [[Goll mac Morna]]. She is a great warrior and a companion of Fionn's aunt, the druidess [[Bodhmall]]; together they raise the boy in secret in the forest of [[Slieve Bloom Mountains|Sliabh Bladhma]]. Eventually Fionn's ever-spreading fame threatens to bring his father's killers to him, and his caretakers send him to find his own way. By this point they have taught him enough that he can survive on his own, and he goes into the king of [[Bantry]]'s service.

The second Liath Luachra is a tall, hideous warrior and a member of the [[Fianna]]. He had been an enemy of Cumhal, and even dealt him the first blow in the battle at which he died. Later Goll mac Morna gave him possession of Cumhal's treasures, and made him the Fianna's official treasurer. His ''corrbolg'' or ''crane bag'' is one of the warrior band's great treasures. Eventually he kills a young warrior named Glonda; Fionn sees the man's mother crying blood over the murder and decides to avenge him. He kills Liath easily and takes his treasure from him. This Liath has a son, [[Conán mac Lia]], who becomes lord of Luchair and a marauder against Fionn and the Fianna. He is eventually reconciled with the group and joins them.

'''Isaac Liev Schreiber''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|ɛ|v}}; born October 4, 1967) is an American actor, director, screenwriter, and producer. He became known during the late 1990s and early 2000s, having appeared in several [[independent film]]s, and later mainstream [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]], including the ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' trilogy of horror films, ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'' (1996), ''[[Phantoms (film)|Phantoms]]'' (1998), ''[[The Sum of All Fears (film)|The Sum of All Fears]]'' (2002), ''[[The Omen (2006 film)|The Omen]]'' (2006), ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' (2009), ''[[Taking Woodstock]]'' (2009), ''[[Salt (2010 film)|Salt]]'' (2010), ''[[Goon (film)|Goon]]'' (2011), ''[[Pawn Sacrifice]]'' (2014), and [[Spotlight (film)|''Spotlight'']] (2015).

Schreiber is also a stage actor, having performed in several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions. In 2005, he won the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] for his performance in the play ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]''. That year, he made his debut as a film director and writer with ''[[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]]'' (2005), based on the [[Everything Is Illuminated|novel of the same name]]. Schreiber has had further success in the television world, notably portraying the eponymous protagonist of the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] drama series ''[[Ray Donovan]]'' (2013–present); the role has earned him five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations and three [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations. He also narrates the [[HBO]] series ''24/7'', as well as various PBS programs.

==Early life==

Schreiber was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], the son of Heather (''née'' Milgram) and Tell Carroll Schreiber, a stage actor and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humphrysfamilytree.com/Royal/Notes/schreiber.pdf|title=Humphrys Family Tree|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father comes from a wealthy [[Protestant]] family, and his mother is [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/liev-schreiber-to-talk-life-career-and-identity-in-montreal|title=Liev Schreiber to talk life, career and identity in Montreal|date=15 November 2017|work=Montreal Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Rorke|url=https://nypost.com/2017/08/02/liev-schreiber-loves-the-sparkle-susan-sarandon-brings-to-ray-donovan/|title=Liev Schreiber loves the ‘sparkle’ Susan Sarandon brings to ‘Ray Donovan’|work=[[New York Post]]|date=August 2, 2017|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Max|last=Kalinowicz|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3873668/liev-schreiber-talks-jewish-heritage-at-federation-cjas-closing-event/|title=Liev Schreiber talks Jewish heritage at Federation CJA’s closing event|work=[[Global News]]|date=November 22, 2017|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nyjlife.com/2018/02/liev-schreiber-talks-filmmaking-tau/|title=Liev Schreiber Talks Filmmaking at TAU|work=New York Jewish Life|date=February 6, 2018|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather was a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Caroline|last=Westbrook|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/1648_liev_schreiber.htm|title=Liev Schreiber|work=SomethingJewish.co.uk|date=November 23, 2005|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Curt|last=Schleier|url=https://www.jta.org/2017/05/04/arts-entertainment/how-liev-schreibers-jewish-grandpa-inspired-him|title=How Liev Schreiber’s Jewish grandpa inspired him|work=JTA - Jewish news|date=May 4, 2017|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Simon|last=Round|url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/interviews/interview-liev-schreiber-1.7065|title=Interview: Liev Schreiber|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=January 8, 2009|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a firm knowledge of [[classical music]] and [[Russian literature]], Schreiber's mother has been described by Schreiber as a "far-out [[Socialist Labor Party]] [[hippie]] [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] [[freak]] who hung out with [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]]."&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamag.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lamag.com/article.aspx?id=12264|title=Knotty Pinings |last=Dougherty|first=Margot |date=January 2009 |work=LA Magazine |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bednářová, Veronika|title=Mining Cultural Identity and a Writer's Motives|url=http://www.iffkv.cz/download/daily/2004/070705mff.pdf|format=PDF|work=Festival Daily|date=2004-07-07|accessdate=2008-05-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529115043/http://www.iffkv.cz/download/daily/2004/070705mff.pdf|archivedate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Heather was 12, her mother (Schreiber's grandmother) was lobotomized.&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt;

His mother has said that she named him after her favorite Russian author, [[Leo Tolstoy]], while his father has stated that Schreiber was named after the doctor who saved his mother's life. His family nickname, adopted when Schreiber was a baby, is "Huggy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ariel|last=Leve|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a45937/liev-schreiber-ray-donovan-season-four/|title=LIEV SCHREIBER IS LOOKING FOR CLARITY|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite news|author=Lahr, chris|title=Fresh Prince: Why Liev Schreiber is Ready to Play Hamlet|work=The New Yorker|pages=46–52|date=1999-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Schreiber was one year old, his family moved to Canada, winding up in the [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated rural community]] of [[Winlaw]], in the southern interior of [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonstar.com/news/263328831.html|title=Winlaw-raised actor appears on Jimmy Kimmel Live!|work=Nelson Star|publisher=[[Black Press]]|date=June 17, 2014|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Ten years later, following the events explained below, Schreiber's half-brother, actor [[Pablo Schreiber]], was born in Winlaw.) Prior to this time, according to Schreiber's father, at the beginning of their marriage (in San Francisco), Schreiber's mother had a bad experience on [[LSD]]. Over the next four years, she was repeatedly admitted to hospitals and underwent therapy.&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt;

After Schreiber's father threatened to admit her to a [[mental institution]], she left with her son. With his father in pursuit, Schreiber and his mother were trailed by [[private detectives]] in various states; when he was three, his father kidnapped him from an upstate New York commune where Heather had gone to escape detection. By the time Schreiber was four, he was living with her on the fourth floor of a dilapidated walkup at [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]] and [[First Street (New York City)|First Street]] in New York City (his half brothers from her first marriage were with their father in a duplex on [[Central Park West]]), and he was the object of a fierce custody battle, which [[Bankruptcy|bankrupted]] his maternal grandfather, Alex Milgram. Milgram, who was the most significant male in Schreiber's youth, played the [[cello]] and owned [[Renoir]] etchings, and made his living by delivering meat to restaurants.&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt;

When Schreiber was five, his parents divorced; his mother won custody, and the two moved to a [[cold-water flat]] on the [[Lower East Side]] in Manhattan, where he was raised and first began his career in theater by enrolling in Joffrey Ballet School of NY.

His mother was "a highly cultured eccentric" who supported them by splitting her time between driving a cab and creating ''[[papier-mâché]]'' puppets." On Schreiber's 16th birthday, his mother bought him a [[motorcycle]] "to promote fearlessness."&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt; The critic [[John Lahr]] wrote in a 1999 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile that, "To a large extent, Schreiber's professional shape-shifting and his uncanny instinct for isolating the frightened, frail, goofy parts of his characters are a result of being forced to adapt to his mother's eccentricities.

As a result, his favorite actors were [[Charlie Chaplin]], Andrew Cartwright and [[Basil Rathbone]].

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Schreiber, known then as Shiva Das, lived at the [[Swami Satchidananda|Satchidananda]] [[Ashram]], [[Yogaville]] East, in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]]. He abided by his mother's [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet. In retrospect, Schreiber said in a 2008 interview that he appreciates his mother's influences, saying: "Since I've had Sasha, I've completely identified with everything my mother went through raising me... and I think her choices were inspired."&lt;ref name="wmag"&gt;{{cite news| author=Hong, Catherine|title=Liev Schreiber profile|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2008/10/liev_schreiber?currentPage=all| work=[[W (magazine)|W]]|date=October 2008|accessdate=2008-11-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425171344/http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2008/10/liev_schreiber?currentPage=all|archivedate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Schreiber attended [[Friends Seminary]] at the same time as future actress [[Amanda Peet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Blair, Cynthia |title=1984: Liev Schreiber Enrolls at Friends Seminary in NYC|url=http://www.newsday.com/about/ny-ihiny010405story,0,2208557.htmlstory|work=Newsday|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190028/http://www.newsday.com/about/ny-ihiny010405story%2C0%2C2208557.htmlstory|archivedate=October 16, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schreiber went on to [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], where he began his acting training at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], via the [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five Colleges]] consortium. In March 1989, {{Not a typo|Liev}} played Antonio in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' alongside [[Jeffrey Donovan]].  {{Not a typo|Liev}} graduated with a master's degree from the [[Yale School of Drama]] in 1992, where he starred in [[Charles Evered]]'s ''The Size of the World,'' directed by Walton Jones.

He originally wanted to be a screenwriter, but was steered toward acting.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Career==
===Early films===
Schreiber had several supporting roles in various independent films until his big break, as the accused murderer Cotton Weary in the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' trilogy of horror films. Though the success of the ''Scream'' trilogy  led Schreiber to roles in several big-budget studio pictures, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote in 2007 that "Schreiber is [still] best known for such indie gems as ''[[Walking and Talking]],'' ''[[The Daytrippers]],'' and ''[[Big Night]]''."&lt;ref name="eweekly"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rice, Lynette|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20008982,00.html|date=2007-01-26|title=Liev Among the Dead|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Scream,'' Schreiber was cast as the young [[Orson Welles]] in the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] original movie ''[[RKO 281]],'' for which he was nominated for [[Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe]] awards. He then played supporting roles in several studio films, including [[Ron Howard]]'s 1996 remake of ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'', ''[[The Hurricane (1999 film)|The Hurricane]]'', ''A Walk on the Moon'' (1999); the 2000 movie version of ''[[Hamlet (2000 film)|Hamlet]]'', and, as [[Tom Clancy]]'s fictional [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]] super spy and assassin [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]], in ''[[The Sum of All Fears (film)|The Sum of All Fears]]''.

The 2004 remake of ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', with Denzel Washington and [[Meryl Streep]], was another major film for Schreiber, stirring some controversy as it opened during a heated [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|presidential election]] cycle. Schreiber also played Robert Thorn with [[Julia Stiles]] in the 2006 film ''[[The Omen (2006 film)|The Omen]]'', a remake of the 1976 horror classic ''[[The Omen]]''. He played the time-traveling ex-boyfriend of Meg Ryan in ''[[Kate and Leopold]]'', also starring [[Hugh Jackman]].

===Shakespeare===
Along with his screen work, Schreiber is a well-respected classical actor; in a 1998 review of the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] play ''[[Cymbeline]],'' ''[[The New York Times]]'' called his performance "revelatory" and ended the article with the plea, "More Shakespeare, Mr. Schreiber."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marks, Peter | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E7DB1F3AF934A2575BC0A96E958260|date=1998-08-17|title=Theater Review: Fairy-Tale Plottings of a British Royal Family|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A year later, Schreiber played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]'' in a December 1999 revival at [[The Public Theater]], to similar raves. In 2000, he went on to play [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] in the film ''[[Hamlet (2000 film)|Hamlet]]'', a modern adaptation of the play.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

His performance in the title role of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' in a 2003 Central Park production of that play caused ''The New Yorker'' magazine critic John Lahr to expound upon his aptitude at playing Shakespeare.  "He has a swiftness of mind," Lahr wrote, "which convinces the audience that language is being coined in the moment.  His speech, unlike that of the merely adequate supporting cast, feels lived rather than learned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lahr, John|title=Time Trials|pages=88–91|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/07/28/030728crth_theatre|work=The New Yorker|date=2003-07-28|accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June to July 2006, he played the [[Macbeth (character)|title role]] in ''[[Macbeth]]'' opposite [[Jennifer Ehle]] at the [[Delacorte Theater]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Directing and 2000s work===
[[File:XMenOriginsWolverineCastConfettiPremiereApr09.jpg|thumb|Schreiber (in white) and other actors celebrating the world premiere of ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' in [[Tempe, Arizona]], April 27, 2009]]
Schreiber told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1999, "I don't know that I want to be an actor for the rest of my life." For a time in the late '90s, he hoped to produce and direct an adaptation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' starring [[Dustin Hoffman]].&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt;

During that time, Schreiber started writing a screenplay about his relationship with his [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] grandfather, a project he abandoned when, according to ''[[The New York Times]],'' "he read [[Jonathan Safran Foer]]'s hit novel, ''[[Everything Is Illuminated]],'' and decided Mr. Foer had done it better."&lt;ref name="mercy"&gt;{{cite news|author=Finn, Robin|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E1DD133EF93BA35752C0A9659C8B63|date=2003-01-08|title=A Role That's Hard to Shake Off: The 9/11 Antihero|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schreiber's [[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|film adaptation]] of the short story from which the novel originated, which he both wrote and directed, was released in 2005. The film, which starred [[Elijah Wood]], received lukewarm-to-positive reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/everything_is_illuminated/ | title=Everything is Illuminated | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Roger Ebert]] calling it "a film that grows in reflection."

In 2002, he starred in [[Neil LaBute]]'s play ''[[The Mercy Seat (play)|The Mercy Seat]]'' along with [[Sigourney Weaver]]  [[off-Broadway]] that was critically and commercially very successful. In the spring of 2005, Schreiber played the role of [[Richard Roma]] in the Broadway revival of [[David Mamet]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning play ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]''. As Roma, Schreiber won a [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play]]. In 2006, Schreiber was invited to join the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2006/06.07.01a.html|publisher=Academy Invites 120 to Membership|date=July 5, 2006|accessdate=2008-05-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706181947/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2006/06.07.01a.html|archivedate=July 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of that year, he directed and starred in the "2006 Join the Fight" [[AIDS]] [[Public service announcement|PSA]] campaign for Cable Positive and Kismet Films (others involved with the campaign included actress [[Naomi Watts]], fashion designer [[Calvin Klein]], and playwright [[Tony Kushner]]).

Schreiber played Charlie Townsend in the 2006 film ''[[The Painted Veil (2006 film)|The Painted Veil]],'' starring opposite Watts and [[Edward Norton]]. In the same year, Schreiber also appeared in ''[[The Omen (2006 film)|The Omen]]'', which was a remake of the 1976 film of [[The Omen (1976 film)|the same name]]. For television, the actor portrayed a character who temporarily replaces [[Gil Grissom]], played by [[William Petersen]] on ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' (2006–07 season) as Michael Keppler, a seasoned CSI with a strong reputation in various police departments across the nation, before joining the veteran Las Vegas team.

Schreiber joined the cast on January 18, 2007, and shot a four-episode arc.&lt;ref name="eweekly"/&gt; He appeared in the Broadway revival of [[Eric Bogosian]]'s ''[[Talk Radio (play)|Talk Radio]]''. The show began previews at the [[Longacre Theatre]] on February 15, 2007, in preparation for its March opening. On May 11, 2007, he won the [[Drama League Award]] for distinguished performance for his portrayal of [[shock jock]] "Barry Champlain" in ''Talk Radio,'' and has received Tony, [[Drama Desk Awards|Drama Desk]], and [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] nominations for the role. ''The New York Times''' Ben Brantley called his performance "the most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting."&lt;ref name="wmag"/&gt; Schreiber played the womanizing Lotario Thurgot in [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]]'s screen adaptation of ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]],'' released in 2007.

Rumors regarding his relationship with British-Australian actress [[Naomi Watts]] (with whom he appeared in ''[[The Painted Veil (2006 film)|The Painted Veil]]'') have questioned whether the couple are married. In January 2010, Watts was quoted saying that Schreiber had given her a ring (which she was not wearing at the time), but that neither of them wanted to rush into marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exposay.com/v/27058/naomi-watts-refuses-rush-marriage-liev-schreiber/ |title=Naomi Watts Refuses To Rush Into Marriage With Liev Schreiber |publisher=Exposay.com |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2010-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201054358/http://www.exposay.com/v/27058/naomi-watts-refuses-rush-marriage-liev-schreiber/ |archivedate=2009-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Tropfest]] on June 22, 2013, Schreiber referred to Watts as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Shyam Dodge, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2346706/Liev-Schreiber-gives-son-lesson-public-speaking-hosts-TropFest-New-York.html "Just like daddy!

[[Image:Lionel Brough.jpg|thumb|right|Lionel Brough]]
'''Lionel Brough''' (10 March 1836 – 9 November 1909) was a British actor and comedian.  After beginning a journalistic career and performing as an amateur, he became a professional actor, performing mostly in [[Liverpool]] during the mid-1860s.  He established his career in London as a member of the company at the new [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre]] in 1867, and he soon became known for his roles in Shakespeare, contemporary comedies, and classics, especially as [[Tony Lumpkin]] in ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]''.

In the 1870s and 1880s, Brough was one of the leading comic actors in London.  Although untrained musically, he also appeared in several successful [[operettas]] in the 1880s and 1890s.  He continued to contribute popular performances into the 20th century and ended his career in comedy roles with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Brough was born in [[Pontypool]], Wales, the son of [[Barnabas Brough]], a brewer, publican, wine merchant and later dramatist, and his wife Frances Whiteside, a poet and novelist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/11/25/101823111.pdf "Mrs. Barnabas Brough Dead",] ''The New York Times'', 25 November 1897, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  His brothers, [[William Brough (writer)|William]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Brough, William (1826-1870)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Barnabas Brough|Robert]] (father of actress [[Fanny Brough]]) were also playwrights, and his brother [[John Cargill Brough]] was a science writer.  His father was briefly kidnapped by the [[Chartists]] in 1839 and was a prosecution witness at the trial of the Chartist leader [[John Frost (Chartist)|John Frost]], which resulted in Frost's deportation to Australia.  The family was ostracised and ruined financially as a result, and they moved to [[Manchester]] in 1843.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Banerji, Nilanjana. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32100  "Brough, Lionel (1836–1909)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Brough's first job was as an office boy at ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''.  He was then employed as assistant publisher by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and for several years at ''[[The Morning Star (19th century U.K. newspaper)|The Morning Star]]''.  At the former, he introduced to England the American system of selling the newspaper in the streets using newsboys.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'' obituary notice, 9 November 1909, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Brough made his stage debut at age 18 with the company of [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] to play in an extravaganza written by his brother William.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;  In 1858, he was again at the Lyceum but then left the professional stage to work at ''The Morning Star''.&lt;ref name=Waddy&gt;Waddy, Frederick. [https://archive.org/details/cartoonportraits00wadduoft ''Cartoon Portraits and Biographical Sketches of Men of the Day''], Tinsley brothers: London (1873), pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;  He performed in amateur theatricals in the early 1860s.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/11/09/101748746.pdf "Lionel Brough Dead",] ''The New York Times'', 9 November 1909, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; As an amateur he appeared before Queen Victoria at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in 1860 with the Savage Club, in a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of the [[Ali Baba]] story called ''The Forty Thieves'', and was judged by the critic of ''The Times'' to have played like a practised professional.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 March 1860, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; This burlesque was presented as a fund-raiser for the Lancashire Famine Relief Fund.&lt;ref name=Int&gt;Undated interview with Lionel Brough, on file in Manchestre City Library, SC 920 BRO&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moonshine-Saker-Brough-Box-Cox-1883.jpg|upright|right|thumb|[[Edward Saker]] and Brough in ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]'']]

===Professional career===
Brough repeated ''The Forty Thieves'' in [[Liverpool]], where Alexander Henderson, manager of the Prince of Wales Theatre in that city, was impressed enough to engage Brough for his company.&lt;ref name=Int/&gt;  In his ''[[Who's Who]]'' entry, Brough recorded: "joined theatrical profession (permanently) at Prince of Wales's, Liverpool, 1863."&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U184135 "Brough, Lionel",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The company there included [[Squire Bancroft]] and [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; In 1864, he performed there as Iago in ''Ernani'' opposite [[Lydia Thompson]] and Lavinia in ''The Miller and His Men''. He also performed at other Liverpool theatres in the 1860s, including the Amphitheatre and the Alexandra, at the last of which he performed with [[Edward Saker]], with whom he also toured.&lt;ref name=Int/&gt;&lt;ref name=Liverpool&gt;Broadbent, R. J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mj05AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308&amp;dq=%22Lionel+Brough%22+%22Colleen+Bawn%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cesD2qr4IQ&amp;sig=lROLLF5hdRO89Ji5u1p-SY8eZK0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JzUcSrrvCpS0NYzAhY8P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 ''Annals of the Liverpool Stage''], pp. 274, 278, 308 and 316–17 Edward Howell: Liverpool (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dearer Than Life.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[H. J. Byron]]'s ''Dearer Than Life'', 1868, with [[Harriet Everard]] (left) and, seated, [[J. L. Toole]], Brough and [[Henry Irving]]]]
Brough made his London debut in 1865 in ''Prince Pretty Pet'' by his brother William at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; but continued mostly in Liverpool until 1867.&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt; In 1867, he joined the London company that opened the new [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre]], with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], [[Henry Irving]], [[J. L. Toole]], [[Ellen Terry]] and [[Henrietta Hodson]], in a production of [[Charles Reade]]'s ''The Double Marriage''.  ''The Times'' wrote of him, "Mr Lionel Brough, an accession from the Liverpool stage, in the small part of Dard, showed the right and rare quality of humour without gag or grimace.... His appearance in other characters will be looked for with interest."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 26 October 1867, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', he was cast as Grumio.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 29 December 1867, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  He then played the serious role of uncle Ben Garner in ''Dearer Than Life'', by [[H. J. Byron]] together with Toole, Irving and [[Harriet Everard]], in which he was praised for his "very great power", and in which role he frequently toured.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 12 January 1868, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'', [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s parody of ''[[La fille du régiment]]'', in which the same critic said that Brough "appears to understand thoroughly and remarkably for so young an actor the true principles of burlesque acting."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 26 January 1868, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The same company presented many adaptations of the novels of [[Charles Dickens]], including ''Oliver Twist'' in 1868, with Brough as Bumble the beadle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 12 April 1868, p. 7 and ''The Times'', 20 April 1868, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, at the [[St James's Theatre]]'s revival of ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', Brough played Tony Lumpkin for almost 200 nights. Thenceforth, in the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', "he was the accepted representative of the character, which he played in all 777 times."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', in its obituary notice, gives this figure as 7777, but that would be the approximate equivalent of playing the part six times every week for 25 years&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Tony Lumpkin and Ben Garner, according to Frederick Waddy, Brough's best-known early roles were Spotty in ''The Lancashire Lass'', Sampson Burr in ''The Porter's Knot'', Mark Meddle in ''London Assurance'' and Robin Wildbriar in ''Extremes''.  In 1873, Waddy wrote of Brough, "to his great natural humour and fun he adds a conscientious and careful study of the characters he undertakes.... He plays them with marked intelligence and appreciation, and a display of genuine humorous power and versatility not too frequently met with on the stage".&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt;

[[File:Lionel-brough-moonshine.jpg|thumb|right|1884 caricatures of Brough]]
In 1870, Brough was the title character in ''Paul Pry'' at the St. James's Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/whoswhointhethea008058mbp/whoswhointhethea008058mbp_djvu.txt ''Who's Who in the Theatre: A Biographical Record of the Contemporary Stage''], John Parker (ed.), Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1871, with [[Mrs. John Wood]], he performed in ''Milky White'' and ''Poll and Partner Joe''.&lt;ref name=Liverpool/&gt;  In 1872, he acted as stage manager for [[Dion Boucicault]] at the [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt;  Though not trained as a singer, Brough was recruited in 1872 to join Joseph Fell's company at the [[Holborn Theatre]] in leading roles in popular musical works including [[F. C. Burnand]]'s English version of ''[[La Vie parisienne (operetta)|La Vie parisienne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 21 April 1872, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In August of the same year he appeared at Covent Garden in [[Dion Boucicault]]'s fairy drama ''Babil and Bijou''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 31 August 1872, p. 8 and ''The Observer'', 1 September 1872, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1870s, Brough was resident comic lead at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]], Globe, Charing Cross and Imperial theatres. In the 1870s and 1880s he increasingly augmented his popular parts in modern works with more revivals of classic comic roles, including Tony Lumpkin again, Croaker in [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''The Good-Natured Man'', Dromio of Ephesus in ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' and Bob Acres in ''[[The Rivals]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  In 1878, he played opposite Lydia Thompson in burlesques at the [[Folly Theatre]], including as King Jingo in ''Stars and Garters''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText/20021123.html Footnote Lights 23 November 2002], accessed 21 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  He appeared as Valentine in ''[[Mefistofele]]'' (1880) with Lizzie St Quentin in the title role, [[Frederick Hobson Leslie|Fred Leslie]]  as [[Faust]] and [[Constance Loseby]] as Marguerite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://operetta-research-center.org/le-petit-faust-opera-bouffe-3-acts/ ''Mefistofele''], Operetta Research Center, accessed July 30, 2014; and [http://www.kent.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/theatre/r.php/31437/show.html ''Mefistofele''], Theatre Collection of the [[University of Kent]], accessed July 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Brough's popular characters was Constable Robert Roberts, "Policeman X24", an early example of the archetypical British bobby, which he presented at concerts and benefit performances.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The Era'', 25 April 1869, p. 9; ''Dundee Courier'', 24 May 1869, p. 1; and "Mr. G. W. Moore's Benefit", ''The Era'', 3 May 1874, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  The character was a vehicle for Brough to entertain an audience with banter and comic songs.  In contrast, Brough also played a serious role as a policeman in an 1884 one-act play, ''Off Duty'', as Sergeant Ben Bloss, in which, ''The Morning Post'' said, "Mr Lionel Brough has a pathetic part, which he plays with earnestness and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Post'', 11 September 1884, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Brough originated the role of Nick Vedder in the hit operetta ''[[Rip Van Winkle (operetta)|Rip Van Winkle]]'', in 1882, and played in another operetta, ''[[Nell Gwynne (operetta)|Nell Gwynne]]'', in 1884.  In 1885, he toured the United States with [[Violet Cameron]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  In 1888, he appeared in T. Edgar Pemberton's comedy, ''Steeple Jack''.&lt;ref name=Liverpool/&gt;  Brough played the comic lead, Pietro, in Gilbert and [[Alfred Cellier]]'s [[comic opera]] ''[[The Mountebanks]]'' (1892).&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_gilbert/mountebanks/iln.html Review of ''The Mountebanks''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001072052/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/mountebanks/iln.html |date= 1 October 2009 }} from ''The Illustrated London News'', 9 January 1892&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In the final phase of his career Brough was a regular member of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] from 1894 until his death, becoming famous for his comedy roles in Shakespeare, including Sir Toby Belch in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', Touchstone in ''[[As You Like It]]'', Trinculo in ''[[The Tempest]]'', and  the gardener in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt; His last appearances were in 1909 as the grave-digger in ''[[Hamlet]]'' (described by ''The Observer'' as "ideal"), Moses in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', and the host of the Garter Inn in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 4 July 1909, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Brough encouraged all his children to become actors. His elder daughter [[Mary Brough]] ("Polly") had a long and successful career.  His elder son "'Bobbie" (Sydney Brough, 1868–1911) was a popular leading man when he died of complications following a throat infection; he was married to Lizzie Webster, a granddaughter of [[Benjamin Nottingham Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Margaret Webster: A Life in the Theater|author=Barranger, Milly S.|year=2004|publisher=U. of Michigan Press|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0472113909}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lionel Brough's younger daughter "Daisy" (Margaret Brough, 1870–1901) died of peritonitis, and his younger son Percy Brough (1872–1904) toured with the Brough-Boucicault Comedy Company in Australia and New Zealand but died en route from England to China.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Webster Brough, Prompt Copy, Hutchinson, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

Brough died at his home, Percy Villa, in [[South Lambeth]] at the age of 73&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and was buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]].  ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' said of him in its obituary, "His power of holding his audience and obtaining his effects by the simplest means, and with an expert knowledge of their value, made his work delightful. ...  In private life, Mr Brough was universally popular with a fund of anecdote which often kept the members of the Eccentric and other clubs in roars of laughter till the early hours of the morning."&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 9 November 1909, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a partial list of confirmed '''famous people who were or are [[gay]], [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]]'''. Famous people who are simply rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed.

The historical concept and [[definition]] of [[sexual orientation]] varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the word "gay" wasn't used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term "sexual orientation" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shively |first=M.G. |author2=Jones, C. |author3=DeCecco, J.

Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. See homosexuality and [[bisexuality]] for criteria that have traditionally denoted lesbian, gay and bisexual ([[LGBT|LGB]]) people.

The high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to [[societal attitudes towards homosexuality]]. The [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that "[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East. Majorities in every Western European nation surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society, while most Russians, Poles and Ukrainians disagree. Americans are divided – a thin majority (51&amp;nbsp;percent) believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 42&amp;nbsp;percent disagree."&lt;ref name="pewreport"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pew Global Attitudes Project |title=Views of a Changing World |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=185 |format=.PDF |date=June 2003 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Pew Research Center For The People &amp; The Press | oclc=52547041 |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Dynamic list}}

The infectious disease [[hepatitis C]] is caused by the [[hepatitis C virus]] (HCV), which affects the [[liver]].&lt;ref name="sherris"&gt;{{cite book | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | pages=551–2 | isbn = 978-0-8385-8529-0 |veditors=Ryan KJ, Ray CG }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the initial infection, people often have mild or no symptoms, and there is typically no symptoms early during chronic infection.  This condition can progress to scarring of the liver ([[fibrosis]]), and advanced scarring ([[cirrhosis]]).  Over many years however, it often leads to [[liver disease]] and occasionally [[cirrhosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hepatitis C FAQs for Health Professionals|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm|website=CDC|accessdate=9 January 2018|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as [[liver failure]], [[hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]], or [[esophageal varices|dilated blood vessels in the esophagus]] and [[gastric varices|stomach]].&lt;ref name="sherris"/&gt;

'''Marina Tsvigun''' (Марина Цвигун), or '''Maria Devi Christos''' by assumed name, (born 1960) is a religious sect leader of the New Community of Enlightened Humanity, also known as "YUSMALOS" (YUS - Youann Swami [AKA Yuri Krivonogov, her co-founder], MA - Maria, and the word Logos, for Jesus)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abanes|first1=Richard|title=End-Time Visions: The Road to Armagedddon?|date=April 1998|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows|location=New York/London|isbn=1-56858-104-1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Great White Brotherhood|"The Great White Brotherhood"]]. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union it was one of the conspicuous New Age movements in the former republics, with about 80,000 members by official count.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasia Daugule, "White Brotherhood - 15 years later". "Glavnoe" Kharkiv Net Review, a1404&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Tsvigun&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Tikhomirov, "The Criminal Goddess". "Ogonyok" #42 October 17–23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 1960 in [[Donetsk|Stalino]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[USSR]]. She served as a functionary for the Young Communist League district committee, worked as a newspaper journalist and an editor for Donetsk textile factory radio network.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1990 she attended  lectures by Yuri Krivonogov, the "White Brotherhood" co-founder, who recognized Tsvigun as a new messiah and later received  the role of "Higher Priest" of the Great White Brotherhood.&lt;br /&gt;
The members were required to renounce their family ties and donate money and property to the Brotherhood. The Great White Brotherhood came into conflict with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

== Arrest and imprisonment ==
Tsvigun predicted&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Tereshchenko. "Great White Brotherhood Universal Church". Center for Apologetic Studies&lt;/ref&gt; the Time of Apocalypse and the coming of the Holy Spirit on November 10, 1993. The event was supposed to be accompanied by her sermons in the Sophia Cathedral. On the appointed day, the  members of the Brotherhood stormed the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and were arrested.

According to the report of the Orthodox Church, Kiev City Court found Tsvigun and Krivonogov guilty of violating citizens' health under the guise of religious ceremonies and seizing by force. They were sentenced to 4 and 7 years in prison. The White Brotherhood protested to the United Nations and the International Court. Six months later, in August 1997, Tsvigun was freed as a part of an amnesty on the 6th anniversary of the independence of Ukraine.

== After prison ==
After serving the term, Tsvigun changed her name and surname to Victoria Victorovna Preobrazhenskaya and married John-Peter II, a brotherhood member (real name Peter Kovalchuk). Under the name of Victoria, she started a new multidimensional project [http://www.victoriara.com "Cosmic Poliart of the Third Millennium of Victoria Preobrazhenskaya"] and tried to renew the Great White Brotherhood registration as a public organization, which was denied.

She continued her activities and organized "The Mystic College of [[Isis]] and Her Followers."

As of November 2008, she lives in Russia, where she runs an art gallery "Dom Solntsa".

She published doctrine pamphlets "The Science about Light and Its Transformation" (available in Russian) and "The Last Testament of the Mother of the World", both written by her in prison.

In 2011 she started a new magazine called “Victoria RA”, which is available on her website.

==Career==
From 1986 to 2006, Killias was a professor of Criminal Law, Criminal Procedural Law and Criminology at the [[University of Lausanne]] and Director of that University’s Institute of Criminology and Criminal Law.&lt;ref name=honorary/&gt; From 1984 to 2008, he was also a part-time judge at the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Swiss Federal Court]].&lt;ref name=honorary/&gt;

==Research==
One study conducted by Killias looked at 18 different countries and found a moderate correlation between gun ownership rates and homicide rates across these countries, as well as a much stronger correlation between gun ownership rates and suicide rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Killias|first1=M|title=International correlations between gun ownership and rates of homicide and suicide.|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=15 May 1993|volume=148|issue=10|pages=1721–5|pmid=8485675|pmc=1485564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/10/weekinreview/ideas-trends-guns-one-nation-bars-the-other-requires.html?pagewanted=all | title=Guns: One Nation Bars, The Other Requires | work=New York Times | date=10 March 1996 | accessdate=22 November 2015 | author=Kristof, Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by him found that gun ownership in Switzerland may have increased domestic crime rates in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/us-gun-control-debate-what-can-we-learn-switzerland-732104 | title=In The U.S. Gun Control Debate, What Can We Learn From Switzerland? | work=International Business Times | date=26 July 2012 | accessdate=22 November 2015 | author=Fortin, Jacey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on gun violence==
Killias has said that "the fewer guns there are in cellars, attics and armoires, then that would be helpful, because there is a strong correlation between guns kept in private homes and incidences occurring at home - like private disputes involving the husband shooting the wife and maybe the children, and then committing suicide."&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21379912 | title=Switzerland guns: Living with firearms the Swiss way | work=BBC News Magazine | date=11 February 2013 | accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also said that as the Swiss government reduced the size of its Army, gun violence rates in that country have dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/01/27/world-gun-rules/1869003/ | title=Around world, gun rules, and results, vary wildly | work=USA Today | date=27 January 2013 | accessdate=22 November 2015 | author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to those who cite Switzerland as evidence that guns deter violence, Killias has said that in Switzerland, "We have guns at home, but they are kept for peaceful purposes. There is no point taking the gun out of your home in Switzerland because it is illegal to carry a gun in the street. To shoot someone who just looks at you in a funny way - this is not Swiss culture!"&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Honors and awards==
In 2001, Killias received the Sellin-Glueck Award from the [[American Society of Criminology]]. In 2008, he received the G.O.W. Mueller Award for outstanding research in international criminal law from the [[Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences]]. In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Panteion University of Athens]].&lt;ref name=honorary/&gt; In 2017, he received the Beccaria Medal in Gold from the Deutsche Kriminologische Gesellschaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.unisg.ch/en/wissen/newsroom/aktuell/rssnews/leute/2017/oktober/beccaria-medaille-killias-4oktober2017 |title= University of St.Gallen {{!}} Knowledge {{!}} Martin Killias awarded the Beccaria Medal |website= University of St.Gallen |language=en |access-date= 2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Menehune''' are a mythological [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] people in [[Hawaiian religion|Hawaiian tradition]] who live in the deep forests and hidden valleys of the [[Hawaiian Islands]], hidden and far away from human settlements.

The Menehune are described as superb craftspeople. They built temples (''[[heiau]]''), [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]], roads, [[canoe]]s, and houses. Some of these structures that Hawaiian folklore attributed to the Menehune still exist. They are said to have lived in [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] before settlers arrived from [[Polynesia]] many centuries ago. Their favorite food is the ''mai{{okina}}a'' ([[banana]]), and they also like fish.

In [[Martha Warren Beckwith]]'s ''Hawaiian Mythology'', there are references to several other forest dwelling races: the ''[[Nawao]]'', who were large-sized wild hunters descended from [[Lua-nu'u|Lua-nu{{okina}}u]], the ''mu'' people, and the ''wa'' people.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith 1970, pp. 321-323&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early scholars theorized that there was a first settlement of Hawai{{okina}}i, by settlers from the [[Marquesas Islands]], and a second, from [[Tahiti]]. The Tahitian settlers oppressed the "commoners", the ''manahune'' in the [[Tahitian language]], who fled to the mountains and were called Menahune. Proponents of this theory point to an 1820 census of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] by [[Kaumualii|Kaumuali{{okina}}i]], the ruling ''[[Alii|ali{{okina}}i aimoku]]'' of the island, which listed 65 people as ''menehune''.&lt;ref&gt;Joesting 1987, pp. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklorist [[Katharine Luomala]] believes that the legends of the ''Menehune'' are a post-European contact mythology created by adaptation of the term ''manahune'' (which by the time of the colonizing of the Hawaiian Islands by Europeans had acquired a meaning of "lowly people" or "low social status" and not diminutive in stature) to European legends of [[brownie (elf)|brownie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luomala 1951&lt;/ref&gt; '"It is claimed that "Menehune" are not mentioned in pre-contact mythology, although this is unproven since it was clearly an oral mythology; the legendary "overnight" creation of the Alekoko fishpond, for example, finds its equivalent in the legend&lt;ref&gt;Nordhoff 1874&lt;/ref&gt; about the creation of a corresponding structure on [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], which was supposedly indeed completed in a single day — not by ''menehune'' but, as a show of power, by a local ''[[alii|ali{{okina}}i]]'' who demanded every one of his subjects to appear at the construction site and assist in building.

No physical evidence for the existence of a historical person that fits the description of the Menehune has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;p. 142, Pukui, Mary Kawena, Elbert, Samuel H., and Mookini, Esther T. Mookini.  ''Place Names of Hawaii: Revised &amp; Expanded Edition.''  Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nawaf Muhammed Salim al-Hazmi''' ({{lang-ar|نواف الحازمي}}, {{transl|ar|''Nawāf al-Ḥāzmī''}}; also known as ''Rabia al-Makki'')&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;[[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks]], [[9/11 Commission]], p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; (August 9, 1976 – September 11, 2001) was one of five [[Organizers of the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[American Airlines Flight 77]], which they crashed into the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States.

Hazmi and a longtime friend, [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], left their homes in Saudi Arabia in 1995 to fight for Muslims in the [[Bosnian War]]. Hazmi later traveled to [[Afghanistan]] to fight with the [[Taliban]] against the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]]. He returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999.

Already long time affiliates of [[al-Qaeda]] with extensive fighting experience, Hazmi and Mihdhar were chosen by [[Osama bin Laden]] for an ambitious terrorist plot to pilot commercial airlines into designated targets in the United States. Hazmi and Mihdhar both obtained [[B-1/B-2 Visa|US tourist visas]] in April 1999. Hazmi trained in an [[al-Qaeda]] training camp in the fall of 1999. He traveled to [[Malaysia]] for the [[Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit|2000 Al-Qaeda Summit]].

Hazmi arrived in [[Los Angeles]], California, from [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], on January 15, 2000, with [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]]. The two settled in [[San Diego]], staying at the Parkwood Apartments until May 2000. While in San Diego, they attended its mosque, led by [[Anwar al-Awlaki]]. The two took flying lessons during that month in San Diego. Due to Hazmi and Mihdhar's poor English skills, they did not perform well during their flight lessons and their flight instructor regarded them as suspicious.

Mihdhar left Hazmi in California for Yemen in June 2000. Hazmi stayed in [[California]] until he met up with [[Hani Hanjour]] in December 2000, and they both traveled to [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. They later moved to [[Falls Church, Virginia]], in April 2001, where the rest of the hijackers began to join them. Hazmi met frequently with [[Mohamed Atta]], the ringleader of the attacks, during the summer of 2001.

The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] reportedly received Hazmi's name on a list of 19 persons suspected of planning an attack in the near future. Hazmi was one of the four names on the list who were known for certain. A search for Hazmi and other suspected terrorists commenced, but they were not located until after the attacks.

On September 10, 2001, Hazmi, along with Mihdhar and Hanjour checked into a hotel in [[Herndon, Virginia]]. The next morning, Hazmi and four other terrorists, boarded [[American Airlines Flight 77]] at Dulles Airport and hijacked the plane so that [[Hani Hanjour]] could pilot and crash the plane into [[the Pentagon]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. The crash killed all 64 passengers aboard the aircraft and 125 in the Pentagon. Hazmi was initially dismissed as a "muscle hijacker" following the attacks, but was later revealed to have played a larger role in the operational planning than previously believed.&lt;ref name="lats"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/27/nation/na-intel27 "Document links al Qaeda paymaster, 9/11 plotter"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' 27 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother, [[Salem al-Hazmi]], was another of the hijackers aboard the same flight.

==Background==
{{Disputed|date=February 2011}}

Nawaf was born in [[Mecca]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] to Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, a grocer. He traveled to [[Afghanistan]] as a teenager in 1993.  [[CNN]]'s preliminary report following the attacks claimed that an unnamed acquaintance relayed ''"He told me once that his father had tried to kill him when he was a child. He never told me why, but he had a long knife scar on his forearm"'', and claimed that his older brother was a police chief in [[Jizan]].

In 1995, he and his childhood friend, [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], joined a group that went to fight alongside [[Bosnian Muslim]]s in the [[Bosnian War]].&lt;ref name="911-ch5"&gt;{{cite book |title=9/11 Commission Report |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm |chapter=Chapter 5.2 – The "Planes Operation" |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=September 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, Nawaf returned to Afghanistan along with his brother Salem, and Mihdhar.  In Afghanistan, they fought alongside the [[Taliban]] against the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]], and joined up with [[al-Qaeda]].  Nawaf al-Hazmi returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999.&lt;ref name="Atkins2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen E Atkins|title=The 9/11 Encyclopedia: Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDDIgWRN_HQC|date=2 June 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-921-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected for the 9/11 plot==
[[Osama bin Laden]] held Hazmi and Mihdhar in high respect, with their experience fighting during the 1990s in Bosnia and elsewhere. Al-Qaeda later referred to Hazmi as Mihdhar's "Second-in-command".&lt;ref name="willalOmari"&gt;Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others&lt;/ref&gt;  When bin Laden committed to the "planes operation" plot in spring 1999, he personally selected Hazmi and Mihdhar to be involved in the plot as pilot hijackers.  In addition to Hazmi and Mihdhar, two Yemenis were selected for a southeast Asia component of the plot, which was later scrapped for being too difficult to coordinate with the operations in the United States.  Known as ''Rabi'ah al-Makki'' during the preparations,&lt;ref name="willalOmari"/&gt; Hazmi had been so eager to participate in operations within the [[United States]], he already had a US visa when bin Laden selected him.&lt;ref name="911-ch5"/&gt;  Hazmi obtained a [[B-1/B-2 Visa|B-1/B-2 tourist visa]] on April 3, 1999, from the US consulate in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], using a new passport he acquired a few weeks earlier.  Hazmi's passport did have indicators of [[al-Qaeda]] association, but immigration inspectors were not trained to look for those.&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf |format=PDF|title=9/11 and Terrorist Travel |work=Staff Report |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |year=2004 |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1999, these four attended the [[Mes Aynak]] training camp in [[Afghanistan]], which provided advanced training.  Hazmi went with the two Yemenis, [[Tawfiq bin Attash]] (Khallad) and [[Abu Bara al Yemeni]], to [[Karachi, Pakistan]], where [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], the plot's coordinator, instructed him on western culture, travel, as well as taught some basic English phrases.  Mihdhar did not go with him to Karachi, but instead left for Yemen.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed then sent Hazmi and the other men to Malaysia for a meeting.  Before leaving for Malaysia, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed doctored Hazmi's Saudi passport in order to conceal his travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make it appear that Hazmi had come to Malaysia from Saudi Arabia via [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="911-ch5"/&gt;

After the attacks, the [[Associated Press]] would re-publish a "bizarre" story by the ''[[Cody, Wyoming#Media|Cody Enterprise]]'' that quoted witnesses stating that Nawaf entered the United States during the autumn of 1999, crossing along the Canada–US border as one of two men delivering skylights to the local [[High school (North America)|high school]] in [[Cody, Wyoming]].  Leaving the city 45 minutes later with the remaining cardboard boxes, the men allegedly asked "how to get to [[Florida]]."&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/2001/ap102301.html One Sept. 11 Terrorist in Cody Two Years Ago], The Associated Press, October 23, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia summit===
{{Main|Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit}}
Based on information uncovered by the FBI in the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] case, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) began tracking the communications of Mihdhar's father-in-law, Ahmad Muhammad Ali al-Hada, who was facilitating al-Qaeda communications, in 1999. Authorities also became aware of Hazmi, as a friend and associate of Mihdhar.  Saudi Intelligence was also aware that Hazmi was associated with al-Qaeda, and associated with the 1998 African embassy bombings and attempts to smuggle arms into the kingdom in 1997.  He also said that he revealed this to the CIA, saying "What we told them was these people were on our watch list from previous activities of al-Qaeda" The CIA strongly denies having received any such warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/10/18/saudis/index_np.html |title=Did the Saudis Know About 9/11? |publisher=Salon.com |date=October 18, 2003 |accessdate=September 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1999, the NSA informed the CIA of an upcoming meeting in [[Malaysia]], which Hada mentioned would involve "Khalid", "Nawaf", and "Salem".&lt;ref name="soufan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/07/10/060710fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all |author=Wright, Lawrence |title=Did the CIA Stop an FBI Detective from Preventing 9/11 |date=July 10, 2006 |publisher=''The New Yorker'' |accessdate=September 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 5, Hazmi arrived in [[Kuala Lumpur]], where he met up with Mihdhar, Attash, and Abu Bara.  The group was in Malaysia to meet with [[Hambali]] for the [[2000 Al Qaeda Summit]], during which key details of the attacks may have been arranged.  At this time, there was an East Asia component to the September 11 attacks plot, but bin Laden later canceled it for being too difficult to coordinate with operations in the United States.&lt;ref name="911-ch5"/&gt;  [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] was also at the summit, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed possibly attended the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/could/ |title=The Man Who Knew  – What If...|work=Frontline |publisher=PBS |accessdate=September 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fouda"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fouda, Yosri and Nick Fielding |title=Masterminds of Terror |publisher=Arcade Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=1-55970-708-9 |pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Malaysia, the group stayed with [[Yazid Sufaat]], a local member of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], who provided accommodations at request of Hambali.&lt;ref name="911-ch5"/&gt;  Both Mihdhar and Hazmi were secretly photographed at the meeting by Malaysian authorities, who provided surveillance at the request of the CIA.  Malaysian authorities reported that Mihdhar spoke at length with [[Tawfiq bin Attash]], one of the Yemenis, and others who were later involved in the [[USS Cole bombing]].&lt;ref name="soufan"/&gt;  Hazmi and Mihdhar also met with [[Fahd al-Quso]], who was later involved in the USS Cole bombing.&lt;ref name="fouda"/&gt;  After the meeting, Mihdhar and Hazmi traveled to [[Bangkok]] in [[Thailand]] on January 8, and left a week later on January 15 to travel to the United States.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

==In the United States==

===Enters the United States with Mihdhar===
[[Image:Parkwood apts.jpg|thumb|right|Between February and May 2000, Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi lived at the Parkwood Apartments complex in [[Clairemont, San Diego, California|Clairemont Mesa]], [[San Diego]].]]
On January 15, 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived together at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] from Bangkok, and were admitted for a six-month period.&lt;ref name="travel"/&gt;  Immediately after entering the country, Nawaf and Mihdhar met [[Omar al-Bayoumi]] in an airport restaurant. Bayoumi claims he was merely being charitable in helping the two seemingly out-of-place Muslims to move to [[San Diego]] where he helped them find an apartment near his own, co-signed their lease, and gave them $1,500 to help pay their rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/66665 |title=The Saudi Money Trail |date=December 2, 2002 |author=Iskioff, Michael and Evan Thomas |publisher=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in San Diego, witnesses told the FBI he and Mindhar had a close relationship with [[Anwar Al Awlaki]].&lt;ref name="Eckert"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/nation/terror/20030911-9999_1n11terror.html |last1=Eckert |first1=Toby |last2=Stern |first2=Marcus |title=9/11 investigators baffled FBI cleared 3 ex-San Diegans |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=September 11, 2003 |accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authorities say the two regularly attended the [[Masjid Ar-Ribat al-Islami]] mosque Awlaki led in San Diego, and Awlaki had many closed-door meetings with them.&lt;ref name="Eckert" /&gt; Hazmi got a part-time job through the mosque at a nearby car wash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-483004.html |last1=Goldstein |first1=Amy |last2=Booth |first2=William |title=Hijackers Found Welcome Mat on West Coast; San Diego Islamic Community Unwittingly Aided 2 Who Crashed Into Pentagon |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=December 29, 2001 |accessdate=August 3, 2015 |via=[[HighBeam]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of February 2000, Mihdhar and Hazmi rented an apartment at the Parkwood Apartments, a 175-unit complex in the [[Clairemont, San Diego, California|Clairemont Mesa]] section of San Diego, near the Balboa Drive Mosque.  In February, Mihdhar purchased a used 1988 [[Toyota Corolla]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Image:Hijackers_Timeline_OCR.pdf |title=Hijackers' Timeline |author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |publisher=9/11 Myths |date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803015816/http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Image%3AHijackers_Timeline_OCR.pdf |archivedate=August 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While living at the Parkwood Apartments, neighbors thought that Mihdhar and Hazmi were odd.  Months passed without them getting any furniture for the apartment.  Instead, the men slept on mattresses on the floor, yet they carried briefcases, were frequently on their mobile phones, and were occasionally picked up by a limousine.&lt;ref name="inside911"&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside 9-11 |author=Aust, Stefan and Der Spiegel |publisher=MacMillan |year=2002 |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the attacks, their neighbors told the media that the pair constantly played flight simulator games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010924/wplot.html |title=The New Breed of Terrorist |author=McGeary, Johanna and David Van Biema |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=September 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Residents said a total of four men spent time together at Parkwood, playing in the pool like children.

On April 4, 2000, Hazmi took a one-hour introductory flight lesson at the National Air College in San Diego.  Both Mihdhar and Hazmi took flight lessons in May 2000 at the Sorbi Flying Club, located at Montgomery Field in San Diego.  On May 5, Hazmi and Mihdhar took a lesson for one hour, and additional lessons on May 10 at the Sorbi Flying Club, with Hazmi flying an aircraft for 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;  However, their English skills were very poor, and they did not do well with flight lessons.&lt;ref name="inside911"/&gt;  The first day that they showed up, they told instructors that they wanted to learn how to fly Boeings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.10news.com/news/964031/detail.html |title=San Diego Man Arrested For Funding Hijackers |publisher=10 News (San Diego) |date=September 18, 2001 |accessdate=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mihdhar and Hazmi raised some suspicion when they offered extra money to their flight instructor, Richard Garza, if he would train them to fly jets.  Suspicious of the two men, Garza refused the offer but did not report them to authorities.&lt;ref name="inside911"/&gt;  Garza described the two men as "impatient students" who "wanted to learn to fly jets, specifically Boeings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/07/terrorism.afghanistan3 |title=Saudi hijacker 'was key link to bin Laden' |publisher=The Observer |author=Helmore, Edward and Ed Vulliamy |date=October 7, 2001 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adel Rafeea received a [[wire transfer]] of $5,000, on April 18, from [[Ali Abdul Aziz Ali (Guantanamo captive 10018)|Ali Abdul Aziz Ali]] in the [[UAE]], which he later claimed was money Nawaf had asked him to accept on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html |title=Statement for The Record FBI Director Robert S.

At the end of May 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar moved out of Parkwood Apartments, and moved to nearby [[Lemon Grove, California]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  At this time, Mihdhar transferred his vehicle's registration to Hazmi,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and he left San Diego on June 10, 2000.  Mihdhar returned to Yemen, which angered Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who did not want Hazmi to be left alone in California.

On July 12, 2000, Hazmi filed for an extension of his visa, which was due to expire.  His visa was extended until January 2001, though Hazmi never filed any further requests to extend it beyond that.&lt;ref name="travel" /&gt;

In September, Nawaf and Mihdhar both moved into the house of [[FBI]] [[informant]] [[Abdussattar Shaikh]], although he did not report the pair as suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2003/07/25/news/top_stories/7_25_035_34_23.txt |title=Report: San Diego represented best chance to foil Sept. 11 plot : North County Times – Californian |publisher=Nctimes.com |date=July 25, 2003&lt;!-- 6:32 AM PDT --&gt;|accessdate=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihdhar is believed to have left the apartment in early October, less than two weeks before the [[USS Cole Bombing]].  Nawaf continued living with Shaikh until December.

[[Hani Hanjour]] arrived in San Diego in early December 2000, joining Hazmi, but on December 10, they were seen leaving their Mount Vernon address leaving for [[Phoenix, Arizona]] where Hanjour could take refresher flight training.  On December 12, they arrived at [[Mesa, Arizona]] and stayed with Mourad Jdaaini and Mike Khalaf. On December 22, Hanjour and Hazmi signed a lease for an apartment in the Indian Springs Village complex in Mesa, moving in on January 9.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

===2001===

In March, al-Hazmi received a shipment of VHS videos including videos about Boeing 747 and 777 flight decks and "how an airline captain should look and act" and later a road atlas, map of New York City and a World aeronautical chart.

On March 30, al-Hazmi notified his utility company that he might be moving to another state or Saudi Arabia. He and Hanjour moved out before the apartment rental expired at the end of the month on their way to Virginia. 2 days later on April 1, 2001, [[Oklahoma]] police officer C. L. Parkins pulled Hazmi over for [[speeding]] in their Corolla along with an additional citation for failing to use a seatbelt together totaling $138. A routine inspection of his California [[drivers license]] turned up no warrants or alerts, although his name was known to both the NSA and the CIA as a suspected terrorist.&lt;ref name="badintel"&gt;{{cite web|author=AlterNet / By |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/68268/ |title=Bad Intelligence: America's History of Bungled Spying |publisher=Alternet.org |date=2007-11-19 |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--dead &lt;ref name="TheBulletin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/bulletin/eddesk.nsf/All/710930A347F9C31DCA256BCD00142568?OpenDocument |title=The Bulletin publishes for the last time |publisher=Bulletin.ninemsn.com.au |accessdate=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Anwar al-Awlaki had already headed east and served as Imam at the [[Dar al-Hijrah]] [[mosque]] in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Washington, DC area]] starting in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cageprisoners.com/campaigns.php?id=412 Imam Anwar Al Awlaki – A Leader in Need] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402074940/http://www.cageprisoners.com/campaigns.php?id=412 |date=2007-04-02 }}; Cageprisoners.com, November 8, 2006, accessed June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after this, his sermons were attended by three of the 9/11 hijackers (the new one being Hanjour).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6521758/Fort-Hood-shooting-Texas-army-killer-linked-to-September-11-terrorists.html Sherwell, Philip, and Spillius, Alex, "Fort Hood shooting: Texas army killer linked to September 11 terrorists; Major Nidal Malik Hasan worshiped at a mosque led by a radical imam said to be a "spiritual adviser" to three of the hijackers who attacked America on Sept 11, 2001," ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', November 7, 2009, accessed November 12, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cha "&gt;{{cite news| url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/terror/20030725-9999_1n25report.html|last=Thornton|first=Kelly|date= July 25, 2003 |title=Chance to Foil 9/11 Plot Lost Here, Report Finds|newspaper=[[San Diego Union Tribune]]|accessdate=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 3, he was likely with companion Hani Hanjour when he was recorded at an ATM in [[Front Royal, Virginia]], arriving in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], by April 4. They met a man believed to be a Jordanian named Eyad Alrababah at a 7-11 that day. The 9-11 commission wrote that Hazmi and Hanjour met Alrababah at the Dar al Hijra mosque who was computer technician who had moved from West Paterson, New Jersey and was there to ask imam Anwar al-Awlaki about finding a job. He helped the pair rent an apartment in Alexandria where they moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Spencer Ackerman |url=http://washingtonindependent.com/81582/are-anwar-al-awlakis-ties-to-911-strong-enough-for-the-government-to-kill-him |title=Are Anwar al-Awlaki's Ties to 9/11 Strong Enough for the Government to Kill Him?

The [[September 11 Commission]] concluded that two of the hijackers "reportedly respected Awlaki as a religious figure".&lt;ref name=rec&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/451/story/1585957.html |title=Is imam a terror recruiter or just an incendiary preacher? |last=Allam |first=Hannah |date=November 22, 2009 |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |accessdate=November 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124003856/http://www.kansascity.com/451/story/1585957.html |archivedate=November 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police found his telephone number in the contacts of [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] (the "20th hijacker") when they searched his Hamburg apartment while investigating the 9/11 attacks.&lt;ref name="wanted"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/u-s-imam-wanted-in-yemen-over-al-qaeda-suspicions-1.453376 |title=U.S. imam wanted in Yemen over al Qaeda suspicions |last1=Al-Haj|first1=Ahmed |last2=Abu-Nasr |first2=Donna |agency=Associated Press |date=November 11, 2009 |accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inf  "&gt;{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dw1mHo6zjKwC&amp;pg=PT351&amp;dq=awlaki++%22san+diego%22+mosque&amp;num=100&amp;ei=tqAVS6rqF4S-yQTo-4n7Aw#v=onepage&amp;q=aulaqi&amp;f=false|last=Sperry  |first=Paul E. |year=2005|title= Infiltration: how Muslim spies and subversives have penetrated Washington|work= Thomas Nelson Inc.| ISBN= 9781595550033|accessdate= December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2001, Hazmi reported to police that men tried to take his wallet outside his [[Fairfax, Virginia]], residence, but before the county officer left, Hazmi signed a "statement of release" indicating he did not want the incident investigated.

In May 2001, Nidal Hasan's mother's funeral was held at the Falls Church mosque, although it is not known if al-Hazmi attended the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125778227582138829 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Evan | last=Perez | title=Hasan, Radical Cleric Had Contact | date=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 2, two other hijackers, [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]] and [[Majed Moqed]], arrived in Virginia and moved in with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13120483/FBI-Summary-about-Alleged-Flight-77-Hijacker-Majed-Moqed |title=Scribd.com |publisher=Scribd.com |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 8, Alrababah suggested that al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar move with him to Fairfield, Connecticut, and helped all four hijackers move to a hotel there. They called area flight schools and after a few days Alrababah drove the four to Paterson, New Jersey, to show them around. Some FBI agents suspected that Awlaki gave Alrababah the job of helping Hazmi and Hanjour. Alrababah was later arrested as a witness convicted after 9/11 in a fraudulent driver's license scheme and deported to Jordan.

On May 21, al-Hazmi moved in with Hanjour into an apartment in Paterson New Jersey. Mohamed Atta was living in the same city at another location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13120414/-FBI-Summary-about-Alleged-Flight-77-Hijacker-Hani-Hanjour |title=FBI Summary Hani Hanjour |publisher=Scribd.com |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, al-Hazmi's car was involved in a minor traffic accident on the east-bound [[George Washington Bridge]].&lt;ref name="badintel"/&gt;
On June 25, 2001, al-Hazmi obtained a drivers' license in [[Florida]], providing an address in [[Delray Beach, Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/091601/State/Hijackers_got_state_I.shtml |author=Bousquet, Steve |title=Hijackers got state IDs legally |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |date=September 16, 2001 |accessdate=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he obtained a USA ID card on July 10.  On August 2, al-Hazmi also obtained a Virginia drivers' license, and made a request for it to be reissued on September 7.&lt;ref name="travel"/&gt;

On July 20, al-hazmi and fellow hijacker [[Hani Hanjour]] flew to the [[Montgomery County Airpark]] in Maryland from on a practice flight from [[Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey|Fairfield, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&amp;the_alleged_9%2F11_hijackers=haniHanjour|title=Complete 911 Timeline: Hani Hanjour|work=History Commons|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830015453/http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&amp;the_alleged_9%2F11_hijackers=haniHanjour|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf|title=Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|date=2004|page=242|access-date=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Hazmi, along with at least five other future hijackers, traveled to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], at least six times in the summer of 2001. They reportedly drank alcohol, gambled, and paid strippers to perform lap dances for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/10/04/MN102970.DTL |title=Agents of terror leave their mark on Sin City / Las Vegas workers recall the men they can't forget |publisher=Sfgate.com |author=Kevin Fagan, Chronicle Staff Writer |date=October 4, 2001 |accessdate=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the summer, al-Hazmi met with leader [[Mohamed Atta]] to discuss the status of the operation of a monthly basis.&lt;ref name="lats"/&gt;

On August 23, [[Israel]]i [[Mossad]] reportedly gave his name to the [[CIA]] as part of a list of 19 names they said were planning an attack in the near future.  Only four of the names are known for certain – Narwaf, Atta, al-Shehhi and al-Mihdhar, but again, the connection was not made with previous contacts by local law enforcement.&lt;ref name="failures"&gt;[[BBC]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/2294487.stm Report details US intelligence failures], October 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, he was added to an [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] watch list, together with Mihdhar to prevent entry into the US.

An internal review after 9/11 found that "everything was done [to find them] that could have been done." However, the search does not appear to have been particularly aggressive. A national motor vehicle index was reportedly checked, but Hazmi's speeding ticket was not detected for some reason. The FBI did not search credit card databases, bank account databases, or car registration, all of which would have produced positive results. Hazmi was even listed in the 2000–2001 San Diego phone book, but this too was not searched until after the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-worldtrade-suspectprofiles.story  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310010142/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-worldtrade-suspectprofiles.story |date=March 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He had not been placed on terrorist watch lists, nor did the CIA or NSA alert the FBI, Customs and Immigration, or local police and enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="badintel"/&gt;

On August 27, brothers Nawaf and Salem purchased flight tickets through [[Travelocity]].com using Nawaf's [[VISA|Visa card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html |title=Statement of Robert S.

On September 1, Nawaf registered Room #7 at the Pin-Del Motel in [[Laurel, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/sep/10/20020910-085104-1364r/|title=Killers in the Cockpit: Who and Why?|access-date=March 20, 2017|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=September 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the registration, he listed his driver's license number as 3402142-D, and gave a New York hotel as his permanent residence.

Nawaf and Mihdhar purchased their 9/11 plane tickets online using a credit card with their real names. This raised no red flags, since the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] had not been informed that the two were on a terrorist watchlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webcom.com/hrin/magazine/la-watchlist.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011125191717/http://www.webcom.com/hrin/magazine/la-watchlist.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 25, 2001 |title='Watch List' Didn't Get to Airline |publisher=Webcom.com |accessdate=October 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2001, Hanjour, Mihdhar, and Nawaf checked into the [[Marriott International|Marriott Residence Inn]] in [[Herndon, Virginia]], where [[Saleh Ibn Abdul Rahman Hussayen]], a prominent Saudi government official, was staying  – although no evidence was ever uncovered that they had met, or knew of each other's presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Schmidt |first= Susan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A31402-2003Oct1|title=Spreading Saudi Fundamentalism in U.S.: Network of Wahhabi Mosques, Schools, Web Sites Probed by FBI|publisher=Washington Post, Page A01|date=October 2, 2003 |accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Nawaf al-Hazmi's 1988 blue [[Toyota Corolla]] was found on the next day in Dulles International Airport's hourly parking lot.  Inside the vehicle, authorities found a letter written by [[Mohamed Atta]], maps of [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[New York City]], a cashier's check made out to a Phoenix flight school, four drawings of a Boeing 757 cockpit, a [[box cutter]], and a page with notes and phone numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Authorities' Dragnet Snags More Suspects |author=Lichtblau, Eric |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=September 27, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight&amp;nbsp;77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any [[DNA]] samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI. Forensics teams confirmed that it seemed two of the hijackers were brothers, based on their DNA similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/08/17/attack/main519033.shtml |title=Remains Of 9 Sept. 11 Hijackers Held |date=August 17, 2002 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=September 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div831/strbase/pub_pres/Edson2004.pdf |format=PDF|title=Naming the Dead – Confronting the Realities of Rapid Identification of Degraded Skeletal Remains |author=Edson, S.M.|journal=Forensic Science Review |volume=16 |date=January 2004 |accessdate=September 30, 2008 | issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks after the attacks, a Las Vegas [[Days Inn]] employee went to the FBI and stated that she recognized Hazmi's photographs from the media as being a man she had met at the hotel, who had asked for details on hotels near [[Los Angeles]]. She admitted that he never gave his name.&lt;ref name="hotel"&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2001/Oct-26-Fri-2001/news/17309944.html Ex-hotel worker says she conversed with hijacker], Las Vegas Review-Journal, By GLENN PUIT and J.M.

==Timeline in America==
Late in 2005, Army Lt. Col. Kevin Shaffer and Congressman [[Curt Weldon]] alleged that the Defense Department data mining project [[Able Danger]] had kept Nawaf, [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], [[Mohamed Atta]] and [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] all under surveillance as [[al-Qaeda]] agents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2464">'''Pedro Blanco''' (1795–1854) was a notorious Spanish slave trader based in [[Gallinas River (Liberia)|Gallinas]] on the coast of [[Sierra Leone]] between 1822 and 1838. Before entering the [[slave trade]], Blanco ran a sugar mill in [[Cuba]].

Blanco sailed to Africa on the ''Conquistador'', one of his ships. He began trading in African slaves in 1822, and by 1839 he controlled a network that fed Cuba's insatiable hunger for plantation workers. Blanco expanded his operation by establishing a working relationship with the African King [[Siaka]].

He eventually had agents stationed at Cape Mount, [[Shebar]], [[Digby, Liberia|Digby]], [[Nuevo Sestos]] and elsewhere. Blanco entered a partnership with one Lino Carballo, with a center of operations in Havana and other branches in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Trinidad]], and the [[Republic of Texas]]. His mercantile standing was so high that his credit bills were enthusiastically accepted in [[New York City]], [[London]] and many other well-known financial centers.

In Gallinas, Blanco built himself a private kingdom with storehouses on an island, his office on another island, and houses for his African wives on yet a third island. Slaves awaiting shipment were housed on the islands of Taro and Kamasun. In 1838, Blanco left Africa for Cuba and went to [[Barcelona]], all the time trading in slaves. He left Gallinas just before most of the ''[[La Amistad]]'' Africans reached his stockades, but he left behind a network of employees to continue his business. It is likely that some of them handled the ''Amistad'' Africans. At any rate, he played a vital part in the development of the slave trade in this region. Blanco's business finally collapsed in 1848, and in 1854 he died in [[Genoa]].

'''Randolph A. Credico''' is an American [[Perennial candidate|perennial political candidate]], comedian, radio host, activist and the former Director of the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstler.org|title=William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice|website=www.kunstler.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Show business career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2014}}
Credico was once active on the comedy circuit, and at the age of 27 he made an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]].'' During the appearance, he criticized U.S. foreign policy and compared Ambassador [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] to [[Eva Braun]]; Credico was not invited back to the show, and some believe this is due to the Kirkpatrick impersonation. He was featured on the 1988 comedy album, ''Strange Bedfellows: Comedy and Politics'' along with [[Jimmy Tingle]], [[Barry Crimmins]], and [[Will Durst]].

Credico spent four years in [[Tulia, Texas]], bringing national attention to a racially charged mass drug arrest. The Kunstler Fund produced an award-winning [[documentary]] on the subject entitled ''Tulia, Texas: Scenes from the drug war'', written, directed and edited by [[Emily Kunstler]] and Sarah Kunstler. Credico is the subject of the film ''Sixty Spins Around the Sun'', directed by comedian [[Laura Kightlinger]].

Credico produced, directed and wrote the radio program ''60 Mimics'', and is a frequent guest on ''[[Fred Dicker|Live from the State Capitol with Fred Dicker]]'', a political talk radio program on [[WGDJ]] in [[Albany, New York]].

==Political activism==
At age 37, Credico began a periodic campaign against [[New York (state)|New York]] state's [[Rockefeller drug laws]], which he claimed were too harsh, disproportionately affecting the poor and minorities. Small changes softening the stiffest penalties were passed in the [[New York State Legislature|state legislature]], which Credico thought were insufficient.

In 2009, Credico attended a meeting of the New York State Senate on [[Open Government]] dressed as the Greek philosopher [[Diogenes the Cynic]], "seeking an honest politician."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the early 2010s, Credico became a [[perennial candidate]] for political office.

Credico's most notable appearance in the [[United States elections, 2016|2016 election cycle]] was headlining a Republican fund-raiser in Cayuga County, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://auburnpub.com/news/local/political-satirist-randy-credico-to-headline-cayuga-county-gop-fundraiser/article_0c253f9c-4b9c-11e6-aa52-5f4b7fffeac7.html|title=Political satirist Randy Credico to headline Cayuga County GOP fundraiser July 29|work=[[The Citizen (Auburn)|The Citizen]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|date=July 17, 2016|location=[[Auburn, New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 U.S. Senate election===
{{main|United States Senate election in New York, 2010}}
Credico ran as a Democratic primary challenger against [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Schumer]] in 2010. Credico submitted petitions in an effort to get onto the Democratic Party primary ballot. The party chairman claimed that Credico only submitted a few pages' worth of petitions to the state, far short of the 15,000 necessary, a charge Credico denied. Credico threatened to throw his support to Republican candidate [[Carl Paladino]] in the gubernatorial race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Celeste|authorlink1=Celeste Katz|title=NYS Dems Party Chair: Randy Credico &amp; Co.

Credico's campaign was supported by several actors and comedians, including ''[[Seinfeld]]'' co-creator [[Larry David]], [[Roseanne Barr]], and [[Irwin Corey|"Professor" Irwin Corey]]. He was nominated by the [[Libertarian Party of New York]] and the nascent "Anti-Prohibition Party" of [[Kristin Davis (politician)|Kristin "Manhattan Madam" Davis]], though those parties do not have permanent [[ballot access]] and were required to petition their way onto the ballot. Credico finished with 25,975 votes (0.6%), in last place among the four candidates; in most jurisdictions, Credico was only given one ballot line despite petitioning for two.

Credico sued the [[New York State Board of Elections]] under the [[Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment]] over this issue of ballot access. On June 19, 2013, the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled in favor of Credico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballot-access.org/?p=34517|title=New York Libertarian Party Wins Lawsuit Against Discriminatory Election Law - Ballot Access News|website=www.ballot-access.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York State Board of Elections did not appeal this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballot-access.org/?p=34854|title=New York State Changes Mind, Won’t Appeal Credico Decision - Ballot Access News|website=www.ballot-access.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Santorum was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar and practiced law for four years at the Pittsburgh law firm Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart, a firm known for raising political candidates and lobbyists (later named [[K&amp;L Gates]]). As an associate, he successfully lobbied on behalf of the [[World Wrestling Federation]] to deregulate professional wrestling, arguing that it should be exempt from federal [[anabolic steroid]] regulations because it was entertainment, not a sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/rick-santorum-mr-bipartisan-compromise-and-mr-pro-wrestling/|title=Rick Santorum, Mr. Bipartisan Compromise – and Mr. Pro Wrestling?|work=ABC News|date=January 4, 2012|first=Jake|last=Tapper|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="11 things"&gt;{{cite news|title=11 Things You Might Not Know About Rick Santorum|first=Molly|last=Ball|work=The Atlantic|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45873944/ns/politics-decision_2012/t/things-you-might-not-know-about-santorum/#.W-JgmpNKiUk|accessdate=November 6, 2018|date=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conn. race a body slam – with Pa. ties: GOP Senate hopefuls rise got boost from Santorum.|author=Fitzgerald, Thomas|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=October 22, 2010|page=A.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum left his private law practice in 1990 after his election to the House of Representatives.

Having been groomed by Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart, Santorum decided Democratic congressman [[Doug Walgren]] was vulnerable, and took up residence in Walgren's district. Needing money and political support, he courted GOP activist and major donor [[Elsie Hillman]],&lt;ref name="Hillman" /&gt; the chair of the state Republican Party.&lt;ref name="Hillman"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Konigsberg |first1=Eric |year=1995 |title=A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To Santorum |journal=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]] |volume=86 |issue=12 |page=150 |publisher=[[Metrocorp]] |doi= |url=http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/PhillyMagSantorum.pdf |accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, at age 32, Santorum was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] to represent [[Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district]], located in the eastern suburbs of [[Pittsburgh]].

In 1993, Santorum was one of 17 House Republicans who sided with most Democrats to support legislation that prohibited employers from permanently replacing [[Strike action|striking]] employees.&lt;ref name="pro labor"/&gt; He also joined a minority of Republicans to vote against the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;John Vaught LaBeaume (January 9, 2012)[http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/santorum-examiner-stands-93-nafta-nay/302866 "Santorum to Examiner: Stands by '93 NAFTA 'nay'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210095501/http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/santorum-examiner-stands-93-nafta-nay/302866 |date=February 10, 2012 }} ''[[Washington Examiner]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the [[Gang of Seven]], Santorum was involved in exposing members of Congress involved in the [[House banking scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toeplitz|first1=Shira|title=Santorum and Gingrich Share Complicated Past|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_85/Santorum-and-Gingrich-Share-Complicated-Past-211813-1.htm|accessdate=April 27, 2016|publisher=Roll Call|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his reelection bid of [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|2006]], he lost to Democrat [[Bob Casey, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120213184703/http://njtoday.net/2012/02/09/fact-check-is-santorum-the-biggest-senate-loser/ "Fact Check: Is Santorum the Biggest (Senate) Loser?"] ''NJ Today''. Retrieved February 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; by a 59–41% margin.

After his election to the Senate in 1994, Santorum sought to "practice what [he] preached" and hired five people for his staff who were on welfare, food stamps, or other government aid.&lt;ref&gt;Santorum, Rick. ''Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America that Works''. Regnery Publishing, 2014, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Santorum served as Chairman of the Republican Party Task Force on Welfare Reform, and contributed to legislation that became the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]]. Santorum was an author and the floor manager of the bill.&lt;ref name="Fact Checker – Welfare reform"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hicks |first=Josh |title=Rick Santorum and welfare reform (Fact Checker biography) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/rick-santorum-and-welfare-reform-fact-checker-biography/2012/01/12/gIQAmmUTtP_blog.html |work=The Washington Post |department=The Fact Checker |access-date=December 15, 2013 |date=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, Santorum endorsed moderate Republican [[Arlen Specter]] in his short-lived campaign for president. Reporters have observed that though Santorum and Specter differed on social policy, Specter provided him with key political staff for his successful run in 1994.&lt;ref name="post gazette"/&gt;

The [[National Taxpayers Union]], a fiscal conservative organization, gave Santorum an "A−" score for his votes on fiscal issues, meaning that he was one of "the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies" during his tenure, and ranked fifth in the group's rankings out of 50 senators who served at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/was-santorum-senate-spendthrift_629850.html |title=Was Santorum a Senate Spendthrift?|work=The Weekly Standard |date=February 15, 2012 |access-date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative proposals===

====Religious freedom initiatives====

In 2002, Santorum was a co-sponsor of that year's attempt to pass the [[Workplace Religious Freedom Act]] (WRFA).&lt;ref name="2002 WRFA sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|title=S.2572 – Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2002|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/senate-bill/2572/cosponsors|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill had first been introduced in the Senate by Senator [[John Kerry]] (D-MA) in 1996, having been introduced in the House by Rep. [[Jerrold Nadler]] (D-NY) in 1994. Although Santorum was in the Senate at the time, he was not a sponsor of the bill when it was introduced in 1996, or when it was reintroduced in 1997 and 1999.&lt;ref name="WFRA 1996 Thomas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status: 104th Congress (1995 – 1996)  S.2071|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s2071:|publisher=The Library of Congress (Thomas)|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFRA 1997 Senate Cosponsors"&gt;{{cite web|title=S.1124 – Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1997|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/senate-bill/1124/cosponsors|publisher=Congress.gov|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WFRA 1999 Cosponsors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status  106th Congress (1999 – 2000)  S.1668 Cosponsors|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:SN01668:@@@P|publisher=The Library of Congress (Thomas)|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once signed on as a co-sponsor, Santorum remained so throughout his tenure in the Senate.

Santorum founded the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/R?r109:FLD001:S51408 |title=Congressional Record – 109th Congress (2005-2006) – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONGRESSIONAL RECORD—SENATE |pages=S1407–409 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-02-16/pdf/CREC-2006-02-16-pt1-PgS1407-2.pdf#page=2 |date=February 16, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group included members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and met monthly to address issues such as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act, tax-exempt status for churches, the CARE act, international religious freedom, and [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="Senate Religious Freedom Agenda"/&gt;

====Teaching of evolution and intelligent design====
{{Main|Santorum Amendment}}
Santorum added to the 2001 [[No Child Left Behind]] bill a provision that would have provided more freedom to schools in teaching about the origins of life, including the teaching of [[intelligent design]] alongside [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="wapostslevin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="federal mandate"/&gt; The bill, with the [[Santorum Amendment]] included, passed the Senate 91–8&lt;ref name="wapostslevin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="we'd like"/&gt; and was hailed as a victory by intelligent design promoters,&lt;ref name="fromthehill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kitzmiller_pg89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nejm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt; but before it became law, scientific and educational groups successfully urged its [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]] to strike the Santorum Amendment from the final version. Intelligent design supporters in Congress then preserved the language of the Santorum Amendment in the conference committee report of the bill's legislative history.&lt;ref name="fromthehill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kitzmiller_pg89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nejm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt;&lt;ref name="no child"/&gt; The [[Discovery Institute]] and other intelligent design proponents point to this report as "a clear endorsement by Congress of the importance of teaching a variety of scientific views about the theory of evolution."&lt;ref name="intelligent design"/&gt;&lt;ref name="language"/&gt;

In 2002, Santorum called intelligent design "a legitimate scientific theory that should be taught in science classes",&lt;ref name="illiberal"/&gt; but by 2005 he had adopted the [[Teach the Controversy]] approach.&lt;ref name="teach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="intelligent judging"/&gt; He told [[National Public Radio]], "I'm not comfortable with intelligent design being taught in the science classroom. What we should be teaching are the problems and holes ... in the theory of evolution."&lt;ref name="it takes"/&gt; Later that year, Santorum resigned from the advisory board of the Christian-rights [[Thomas More Law Center]] after the Center's lawyers lost a case representing a school board that had required the teaching of intelligent design.&lt;ref name="breaks with"/&gt; Santorum, who had previously supported the school board's policy, indicated he had not realized that certain members of the board had been motivated by religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="breaks with"/&gt; Santorum critics said he was backtracking from his earlier position because he was facing a tough reelection fight in 2006.&lt;ref name="breaks with"/&gt; When asked in November 2011 about his views on evolution, Santorum stated that he believes that evolution occurred on a tiny, [[microevolution|micro level]].&lt;ref name="chris matthews"/&gt;

====National Weather Service Duties Act====
{{Main|National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005}}
Santorum introduced the National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005,&lt;ref name="adds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="national weather"/&gt; which aimed to prohibit the National Weather Service from releasing weather data to the public without charge where private-sector entities perform the same function commercially.&lt;ref name="some gop"/&gt; The [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] was organizing a lobbying effort in opposition to the legislation,&lt;ref name="aopa"/&gt; but it never passed committee.&lt;ref name="aopa"/&gt; The motivations for the bill were controversial, as employees of [[AccuWeather]], a commercial weather company based in Pennsylvania, donated $10,500 to Santorum and his PAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Election '06|work=The Sunday Patriot – News |location=Harrisburg, Pa|date=August 27, 2006|page=A02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liberal advocacy group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] cited the bill as one of several reasons for listing Santorum as one of its "most corrupt politicians".&lt;ref name="20mostcorrupt"/&gt; In support of the bill, Santorum criticized the National Weather Service in September 2005, saying its evacuation warnings for [[Hurricane Katrina]] were "insufficient".&lt;ref name="some gop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Todd Dorman column|author=Dorman, Todd|work=The Gazette|location=Cedar Rapids, Iowa|date=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corruption Roll Call|work=Multinational Monitor|volume=27|issue=3|date=May–Jun 2006|pages=15–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Santorum is a supporter of the [[War on Terror]] and shares the views of [[neoconservatives]] and the [[Bush Doctrine]] in regard to foreign policy. He felt the [[War in Iraq]] was justified, and, in 2006, declared that [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) had been found in Iraq. Santorum made the declaration regarding WMDs&lt;ref name="wmdiraq"/&gt; based in part on declassified portions of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command.&lt;ref name="iraqi chemical"/&gt; The report stated that coalition forces had recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions that contain degraded or vacant [[mustard gas|mustard]] or [[sarin]] nerve agent casings. The specific weapons he referred to were chemical munitions dating back to the [[Iran–Iraq War]] that were buried in the early 1990s. The report stated that while agents had degraded to an unknown degree, they remained dangerous and possibly lethal.&lt;ref name="wmdiraq" /&gt; Officials of the Department of Defense, CIA intelligence analysts, and the White House have all explicitly stated that these expired casings were not part of the WMDs threat that the [[Iraq War]] was launched to contain.&lt;ref name="lawmakers cite"/&gt;

Santorum has said the war on terror can be won and is optimistic about U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan in the long term. He has defended the [[enhanced interrogation|treatment of prisoners]] in [[Guantanamo Bay]], including [[waterboarding]], and stated that [[John McCain]], who opposes the practice, "doesn't understand how enhanced interrogation works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/55140.html |title=Rick Santorum: John McCain wrong on torture |author=Juana Summers |work=Politico.Com |date=May 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="post gazette1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mccain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/05/18/santorum-mccain-doesnt-understand-interrogation/ | work=Fox News | title=Santorum: McCain Doesn't Understand Interrogation | date=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum called the War in Afghanistan "a very winnable operation" in 2012, dismissing efforts for withdrawal by 2014. He similarly criticized President Obama's foreign policy, saying he was "not focused on trying to win the war" in Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/santorum-hits-president-on-afghanistan-withdrawal-timeline/ |title=Santorum Hits President on Afghanistan Withdrawal Timeline – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said he was against any withdrawal in Iraq in 2012, saying, "We want victory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/22/gop-debate-live_n_975000.html#22_rick-santorum-stay-in-iraq |title=GOP Debate: Republican Presidential Candidates Face Off In Florida (LIVE UPDATES) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=January 20, 2013 |first=Elyse |last=Siegel |date=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santorum supports U.S. political intervention&lt;ref name=Helf/&gt; and economic sanctions against [[state sponsors of terrorism]].&lt;ref name="trying again"/&gt; He views "Islamic-fascism" in Iran as the center of the "world's conflict", and his geopolitical strategy for peace involves the United States promoting "a strong Lebanon, a strong Israel, and a strong Iraq."&lt;ref name=Helf/&gt; He sponsored the [[Syria Accountability Act]] of 2003 to require Syria to cease all activity with Lebanon and end all support for terrorism.&lt;ref name="trying again"/&gt; In 2005, Santorum sponsored the [[Iran Freedom and Support Act]], which appropriated $10 million aimed at [[regime change]] in Iran. The Act passed with overwhelming support. Santorum voted against the [[Lautenberg]] amendment, which would have closed the loophole that allows companies like [[Halliburton]] to do business with Iran through their foreign affiliates.&lt;ref name="on iran"/&gt; Santorum reflected on his last year in the Senate as one spent talking a lot about Iran, and was characterized by ''[[The Atlantic Wire]]'' as an "extreme hawk" in his approach to Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rick Santorum |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/rick_santorum/20071206_The_Elephant_in_the_Room___Put_aside_politics_to_confront_Iran.html |title=The Elephant in the Room &amp;#124; Put aside politics to confront Iran |publisher=Philly.com |date=December 6, 2007 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Molly|title=Who Is Rick Santorum?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/01/who-is-rick-santorum/250740/|accessdate=January 20, 2012|newspaper=Atlantic Wire|date=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum stated that Iran was the creator of [[Hezbollah]] and the driving force of [[Hamas]]. He said Iran was at the center of "much of the world's conflict" but he was opposed to direct military action against the country in 2006.&lt;ref name=Helf/&gt; Santorum was one of only two senators who voted against confirming [[Robert Gates]] as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. He said his objection was to Gates's support for talking with Iran and [[Syria]], because it would be an error to talk with radical [[Islamism|Islamists]].&lt;ref name="dangerous"/&gt;

===Party leadership and other actions===
Santorum became chairman of the [[Senate Republican Conference]] in 2000, the party's third-ranking leadership position in the Senate.&lt;ref name=sokolove /&gt; In that role, he directed Senate Republicans' communications operations and was a frequent party spokesperson. He was the youngest member of the Senate leadership and the first Pennsylvanian to hold such a prominent position since Senator [[Hugh Scott]] was Republican leader in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="joyner2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toeplitz1"/&gt; In addition, Santorum served on the Senate Agriculture Committee; the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; the Senate Special Committee on Aging; and the [[Senate Finance Committee]], of which he was the chairman of the Subcommittee on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and Family Policy. He also sat at the [[candy desk]] for ten years.&lt;ref name="joyner2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toeplitz1"/&gt;

In January 2005, Santorum announced his intention to run for [[United States Senate Republican Whip|Senate Republican Whip]], the second-highest post in the Republican caucus after the [[Pennsylvania United States Senate election, 2006|2006 election]], saying he expected the incumbent whip, [[Mitch McConnell]] of [[Kentucky]], to run for Senate Republican leader to succeed [[Bill Frist]] of [[Tennessee]], who was planning to retire.&lt;ref name="focusing"/&gt; As a result of Santorum's loss in the 2006 election, this plan was never realized.

====K Street Project====
Beginning in 1995, Republicans leaders such as [[Tom DeLay]] and [[Grover Norquist]] initiated an order to place Republicans in lobbying firm jobs, and exclude Democrats. In addition, the initiative pressured lobbying firms to contribute to Republican campaigns, by withholding access to lawmakers from firms that did not comply.&lt;ref name=NPR-Kstreet&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Juan|title=The K Street Project and Jack Abramoff|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5148982|publisher=NPR|accessdate=December 14, 2013|date=January 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative became politically toxic for Republicans when the [[Jack Abramoff]] scandal broke in late 2004. Although some sources indicate that Santorum played a key role&lt;ref name="rivals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plays down"/&gt; in the [[K Street Project]], he has denied any involvement.&lt;ref name="after"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lobbyists"/&gt; In November 2005, several months after the indictments of Abramoff and DeLay, Santorum told the ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', "The K Street project is purely to make sure we have qualified applicants for positions that are in town. From my perspective, it's a good government thing."&lt;ref name="Post-Gazette 2005-11-15 K-Street"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reston|first=Maeve|title=Casey chides Santorum on lobbying ethics|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/05319/606571.stm#ixzz2nTljVLzC|accessdate=December 14, 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=Nov 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, however, Santorum emphatically denied any connection with either the K Street Project or Norquist, saying: "I had absolutely nothing to do—never met, never talked, never coordinated, never did anything—with Grover Norquist and the quote K Street Project."&lt;ref name="Morning Call 2006-01-26- K Street"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Jeff|title=Santorum denies working with K Street project|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2006-01-26/news/3656826_1_santorum-grover-norquist-meetings|accessdate=December 14, 2013|newspaper=The Morning Call|date=Jan 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s "Fact Checker" concluded that "we can't prove definitively whether or not Santorum collaborated on the K Street Project", saying that it "depend[ed] on how you define the initiative".&lt;ref name="k street"/&gt;

===2006 reelection campaign===
[[File:PA2006SenatorCounties.png|upright|thumb|County results of the 2006 U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania. Counties in red were won by Santorum.]]
{{Main|United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006}}
In 2006, Santorum sought reelection to a third Senate term.&lt;ref name="rasvuln"/&gt; He ran unopposed in the Republican Party. His seat was considered among the most vulnerable for Republicans and was a prime target of the Democratic Party in the [[U.S. Senate election, 2006|2006 elections]]. George W. Bush had a 38% approval rating in Pennsylvania in 2006.&lt;ref name="old loss"/&gt; Mary Isenhour, a Democratic strategist, reflected on Santorum's campaign and his connection to the unpopular president, "In 2006, we were doubly blessed—we could run against George W. Bush and Rick Santorum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooke |first=Kristina |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/05/us-usa-campaign-santorum-special-idUSTRE8241LJ20120305 |title=Special report: Santorum's wins and self-inflicted wounds |agency=Reuters |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum chose to campaign alongside George W. Bush, and called him a "terrific president", hurting his popularity. Also problematic was Santorum's 2004 endorsement of his Republican Senate colleague [[Arlen Specter]] over conservative Congressman [[Pat Toomey]] in the primary for Pennsylvania's other Senate seat. Many socially and fiscally conservative Republicans considered the endorsement a betrayal of their cause.&lt;ref name="outside"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shame"/&gt;

Santorum's opponent was Democratic State Treasurer [[Bob Casey, Jr.]], the son of popular former governor [[Robert P. Casey|Robert Casey, Sr.]] Casey was well known for his opposition to abortion, negating one of Santorum's key issues.&lt;ref name="casey widens"/&gt; For most of the campaign, Santorum trailed Casey by 15 points or more in polls.&lt;ref name=forbes.com/&gt; [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate Carl Romanelli failed to gain ballot access in the race, further hurting Santorum's chances. Reportedly, several of Santorum's supporters had funded and petitioned for Romanelli to siphon away Democrats from Casey.&lt;ref name="green party"/&gt;

Santorum was mired in controversy and spent much of his time on the campaign defending his past statements and positions. He faced criticism from Casey and others for several statements in his book, ''It Takes a Family'', including his denunciation of 1960s "[[radical feminism]]", which he said had made it "socially affirming to work outside the home" at the expense of [[child care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/us/politics/santorum-faces-questions-on-women-in-work-force.html|title=Santorum Faces Questions on Women in the Work Force|author=Brian Knowlton|date=February 12, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Santorum also compared pro-choice Americans to "German Nazis." John Brabender, an adviser to Santorum's Senate and Presidential races, reflected back on the book's controversies and said Santorum was warned that sections could bring political damage, and Santorum was not willing to change much of it simply to gain moderate supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/rick-santorum-was-warned-that-2005-book-could-become-fodder-for-political-attacks/ |title=Rick Santorum Was Warned That 2005 Book Could Become Fodder For Political Attacks |work=ABC News |date=March 17, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a past article Santorum wrote to ''The Catholic Online'' resurfaced in 2005, in which he linked [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and [[moral relativism]] in American society, particularly within [[seminaries]], to the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal]]. He wrote, "... it is no surprise that Boston, a seat of academic, political and cultural liberalism in America, lies at the center of the storm."&lt;ref name="fishers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a look"/&gt; His remarks were heavily criticized, especially in Massachusetts, and he was asked for an explanation. Santorum did not retract his statement and defended his premise that it was "no surprise that the center of the Catholic Church abuse took place in very liberal, or perhaps the nation's most liberal area, Boston."&lt;ref name="rush limbaugh 2005"/&gt; Casey also raised the question of Santorum's association with the K Street Project.&lt;ref name="Post-Gazette 2005-11-15 K-Street" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morning Call 2006-01-26- K Street" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morning Call 2006-01-20"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Jeff|title=Casey rips Santorum on "K Street'|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2006-01-20/news/3657801_1_sen-rick-santorum-reform-effort-campaign-manager|accessdate=December 14, 2013|newspaper=The Morning Call|date=Jan 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Post-Gazette 2006-04-02 K Street"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reston|first=Maeve|title=Casey still pounding Santorum on lobbies|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/politics-federal/2006/04/02/Casey-still-pounding-Santorum-on-lobbies/stories/200604020166|accessdate=December 14, 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=April 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santorum said he spent "maybe a month a year" at his Pennsylvania home,&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; raising allegations of hypocrisy as he had denounced his former opponent [[Doug Walgren]] for living away from his House district.&lt;ref name="responds"/&gt; Critics also complained that Pennsylvania taxpayers were paying 80% of the tuition for five of Santorum's children to attend an online "cyber school"—a benefit available only to Pennsylvania residents—when all his children lived in Virginia.&lt;ref name="dems press"/&gt; The Penn Hills School District, which covered the tuition costs for the cyber school through local taxes, unsuccessfully filed a complaint against Santorum for reimbursement in 2005,&lt;ref name="school flap"/&gt; but won reimbursement from the state in September 2006 in the amount of $55,000.&lt;ref name="home school"/&gt;&lt;ref name="state pays"/&gt; In response, Santorum asked county officials to remove the homestead tax exemption from his Penn Hills property, saying he was entitled to it but chose not to take it because of the political dispute.&lt;ref name="asks county"/&gt; Since 2006, Santorum has been home-schooling his seven children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senator is a force, a target Santorum emerging as the face of Senate Republicans High-profile battles are the norm for Santorum|author1=Goldstein, Steve|author2=Budoff, Carrie|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=December 9, 2004|page=A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Santorum Opens the Floor: Q&amp;A Session In Newport Caps Weekend|author=Brubeck, Sarah|work=Valley News |location=White River Junction, Vt|date=November 28, 2011|page=A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum responded to the dispute saying that his children should not be implicated in the "politics of personal destruction".&lt;ref name="loses bid"/&gt; One of his children appeared in a  2006 reelection campaign ad saying, "My dad's opponents have criticized him for moving us to Washington so we could be with him more."&lt;ref name="kidding"/&gt;

Santorum ran a television ad suggesting that Casey's supporters had been under investigation for various crimes. The negative ad backfired, as ''[[The Times-Tribune (Scranton)|The Scranton Times-Tribune]]'' found that all but a few of Casey's contributors donated when he was running for other offices, and none were investigated for anything.&lt;ref name="hurls"/&gt; In fact, two of the persons cited in Santorum's campaign ad actually contributed to Santorum in 2006, and one died in 2004.&lt;ref name="impugns"/&gt; Santorum's campaign countered that those donations were not kept, and had been donated to educational institutions.&lt;ref name="ad shows"/&gt;

Toward the end of his campaign, Santorum shifted his theme to the threat of [[radical Islam]].&lt;ref name="post gazette1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="return"/&gt; In October 2006 he gave a "Gathering Storm" speech, invoking British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]'s description of Europe prior to World War II.&lt;ref name="post gazette1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="return"/&gt; As evidence that [[Islamists]] were waging a more than 300-year-old crusade against the Western world, Santorum pointed to September 11, 1683, the date of the [[Battle of Vienna]].&lt;ref name="call"/&gt; Casey responded, "No one believes terrorists are going to be more likely to attack us because I defeat Rick Santorum."&lt;ref name="11 things"/&gt; Noting that he had been "even more hawkish" during this time period than President Bush, Santorum later said, "Maybe that wasn’t the smartest political strategy, spending the last few months running purely on national security".&lt;ref name="return"/&gt;

A heated debate between the candidates occurred on October 11, 2006.&lt;ref name=PPG1006/&gt; Bill Toland of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' described both candidates' performances during the debate as "unstatesmanlike".&lt;ref name=PPG1006/&gt;

In the November 7, 2006, election, Santorum lost by over 700,000 votes, receiving 41% of the vote to Casey's 59%. This was the largest margin of defeat for a sitting senator in the 2006 cycle, and the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent senator since 1980.&lt;ref name="candidate profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="playing tricks"/&gt;

===Political contributors===
In 1994, [[Sylvester Stallone]] contributed $1,000 to then-[[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] Santorum's first Senate campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Like Rocky Balboa, Rick Santorum is a working class hero|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100127506/like-rocky-balboa-rick-santorum-is-a-working-class-hero/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Caviezel]] donated $2,100 to Santorum's [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|2006 reelection campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Jim_Caviezel.php|title=Jim Caviezel's Federal Campaign Contribution Report|publisher=newsmeat.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117235330/http://newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Jim_Caviezel.php|archivedate=January 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Senate career==
===Lawyer, political consultant and commentator===
In January 2007, Santorum joined the [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]], a D.C.-based conservative [[think tank]], as director of its America's Enemies Program focusing on foreign threats to the United States, including Islamic fascism, Venezuela, North Korea and Russia.&lt;ref name="return"/&gt; In February 2007, he signed a deal to become a contributor on the [[Fox News Channel]], offering commentary on politics and public policy.&lt;ref name="Salena Zito"/&gt; In March 2007 he joined Eckert Seamans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/breaking/s_498510.html|title=Santorum joins law firm of Eckert Seamans Cherin &amp; Mellott|newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=March 19, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130131213721/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/breaking/s_498510.html|archivedate=January 31, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he primarily practiced law in the firm's [[Pittsburgh]] and Washington, D.C., offices, providing business and strategic counseling services to the firm's clients. In 2007, he joined the Board of Directors of [[Universal Health Services]], a hospital management company based in [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="board"/&gt; He also began writing an Op-Ed column, "The Elephant in the Room", for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.&lt;ref name="elephant"/&gt;

Santorum earned $1.3 million in 2010 and the first half of 2011. The largest portion of his earnings—$332,000—came from his work as a consultant for industry interest groups, including [[Consol Energy]] and American Continental Group. Santorum also earned $395,414 in corporate director's fees and stock options from [[Universal Health Services]], and $217,385 in income from the Ethics and Public Policy Center.&lt;ref name="rivals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BloombergJan2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="experienced"/&gt; In 2010 he was paid $23,000 by ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' for his work as a columnist.&lt;ref name="rivals"/&gt;

In January 2017, Santorum became a [[CNN]] senior political commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/17/rick-santorum-joins-cnn-as-senior-political-commen/|title=Rick Santorum joins CNN as senior political commentator|work=[[The Washington Times]]|author=Jessica Chasmar|date=January 17, 2017|accessdate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speculation about political plans===
Before the 2006 election, Santorum was frequently mentioned as a possible [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential candidate]]. Such speculation faded when, during the 2006 campaign and in light of unimpressive poll numbers in his Senate race, he declared that, if reelected, he would serve a full term. After he lost, Santorum once again ruled out a presidential run.&lt;ref name="no oval"/&gt;

On February 1, 2008, Santorum said he would vote for [[Mitt Romney]] in the 2008 Republican presidential primary.&lt;ref name="free and strong"/&gt; Santorum criticized John McCain, questioning his pro-life voting record and conservative values. Santorum later said he endorsed Romney because he saw him as the "best chance to stop John McCain", whom he considered too moderate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/santorum-gets-a-grilling-on-meet-the-press/2012/01/01/gIQARRtLUP_blog.html|title=Santorum gets a grilling on ‘Meet the Press’|work=The Washington Post|date=May 23, 2011|accessdate=March 7, 2012|first=Aaron|last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, Santorum expressed support for McCain as the nominee, citing McCain's choice of [[Sarah Palin]] as his running mate as a step in the right direction.&lt;ref name="lanc333"/&gt;

Santorum was mentioned as a candidate for [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] in [[Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]].&lt;ref name="eyes gubernatorial"/&gt; At one point, he was said to have "quietly but efficiently put his fingerprints on a wide array of conservative causes in the state."&lt;ref name=pareport2009/&gt; Santorum declined to seek the gubernatorial nomination and instead endorsed eventual winner [[Tom Corbett]].&lt;ref name="endorses corbett"/&gt;

===2012 presidential campaign===
[[File:Rick Santorum Iowa State Fair 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Santorum speaking at the Iowa State Fair in August 2011]]
{{see also|Rick Santorum presidential campaign, 2012}}
In the fall of 2009, Santorum gave a speech at the [[University of Dubuque]] on the economy, fueling speculation that he would run for president in 2012. Santorum later recalled, "It got a lot of buzz on the Internet, so I thought, 'Wow, maybe there's some interest'". He decided to campaign after multiple conversations with his wife, who was not enthusiastic at first.&lt;ref name="fights"/&gt;

On September 11, 2009, Santorum spoke to Catholic leaders in Orlando, Florida, saying that the 2012 presidential elections were going to be "a real opportunity for success." He then scheduled various appearances in Iowa with political nonprofit organizations.&lt;ref name="reportedly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="admits to"/&gt;

On January 15, 2010, Santorum sent an email and letter to supporters of his [[political action committee]], saying, "I'm convinced that conservatives need a candidate who will not only stand up for our views, but who can articulate a conservative vision for our country's future". He continued, "And right now, I just don't see anyone stepping up to the plate. I have no great burning desire to be president, but I have a burning desire to have a different president of the United States".&lt;ref name="considering bid"/&gt; He formed a presidential exploratory committee on April 13, 2011. Santorum also mentioned his grandfather's historical encounter with [[Italian fascism]] as an inspiration for his presidential campaign.&lt;ref name="daily brief"/&gt;

He formally announced his run for the Republican presidential nomination on ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on June 6, 2011, saying he's "in it to win." He initially lagged in the polls, but gained as other conservative candidates slumped. By the weekend before the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2012|Iowa caucuses]], polls showed him in the top three, along with Romney and [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref name="CNN12282011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DMRpoll"/&gt; The ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' also noted that the momentum was with Santorum. In the closest finish in the history of the Iowa caucuses, the count on the night put Romney as winner by a margin of eight votes, but the final result announced two weeks later showed that Santorum had won by 34 votes.&lt;ref name="romney beats"/&gt; Santorum later focused on the states holding votes on February 7, a strategy that paid off as he won all three.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind S.

Following the hospitalization of his daughter Bella and losses in [[Wisconsin Republican primary, 2012|Wisconsin]], [[Maryland Republican primary, 2012|Maryland]], and the [[District of Columbia Republican primary, 2012|District of Columbia]], Santorum announced the suspension of his campaign on April 10, 2012, in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=dropout1&gt;{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Aaron|title=Rick Santorum to drop out of the presidential race|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/rick-santorum-drops-out-of-the-presidential-race/2012/04/10/gIQACvaV8S_blog.html?wpisrc=al_comboNP_p|accessdate=April 10, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 10, 2012|author2=Henderson, Nia-Malika}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dropout2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/04/10/santorum/|date=April 10, 2012|title=Santorum suspends campaign|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had won 11 state primaries and nearly 4 million votes, more than any other candidate except Romney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/santorum-im-open-2016-run_664017.html |title=Santorum: 'I'm Open' to 2016 Run |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=November 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum topped Romney in polls for a brief period.

Santorum received a primetime speaking slot at the [[2012 Republican National Convention]]. He was originally slated to speak early in the evening, but convention organizers moved him to 9&amp;nbsp;pm with the other highly anticipated speakers of the evening, [[Ann Romney]] and convention keynote [[Chris Christie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/gop-convention-rick-santorum-attacks-obama-over-welfare-reform |title=GOP Convention: Rick Santorum attacks Obama over welfare reform |work=Alaska Dispatch |author=Linda Feldman |date=August 29, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602135633/http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/gop-convention-rick-santorum-attacks-obama-over-welfare-reform |archivedate=June 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum spoke of the [[American dream]] his immigrant grandfather worked to give his family, and said Obama was turning the dream into a nightmare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/28/santorum-talks-up-romney-in-heartfelt-speech-most-critical-obama/ |title=Santorum talks up American dream, accuses Obama of turning it into 'nightmare{{'-}} |publisher=Fox News|date=August 28, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He talked about his experiences on the presidential campaign trail, speaking with emotion about his daughter Bella and meeting disabled people and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/CONVENTION-WATCH-Santorum-Mitt-in-the-house-3822311.php#page-2 |title=Convention Watch: Convention kiss, praising mom |work=San Francisco Chronicle }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized the importance of strengthening marriage and the family.&lt;ref name="USAT08282012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/08/santorum-lauds-romney-blasts-obama/1#.UD76hGt5lP4 |title=Santorum lauds Romney, blasts Obama |author=David Jackson |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 28, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also condemned Obama's actions on the welfare reform law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://washingtonpost.com/national/santorum-says-under-obama-dream-of-freedom-has-become-nightmare-of-dependency/2012/08/28/a3977eec-f17a-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html |title=Santorum says under Obama, dream of freedom has become 'nightmare of dependency{{'-}} | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he was one of the chief proponents in Congress, and his actions on education, including school choice and student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/08/santorum-hits-obama-for-nightmare-of-dependency-133589.html |title=Santorum hits Obama for 'nightmare of dependency{{'-}} |work=Politico|date=August 28, 2012 |author=Maggie Haberman |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum concluded his speech to a standing ovation, saying,

===Patriot Voices===
In June 2012, Santorum launched Patriot Voices, a [[501(c)(4)]] nonprofit with a mission to "mobilize conservatives around this country who are committed to promoting faith, family, freedom and opportunity" in support of causes and candidates across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rachel Weiner |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/rick-santorums-next-move-patriot-voices/2012/06/08/gJQA8K2sNV_blog.html |title=Rick Santorum's next move: ‘Patriot Voices’ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 8, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum supported U.S. Senate candidates [[Ted Cruz]] in Texas and [[Richard Mourdock]] in Indiana in their respective Republican primaries; both won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strauss |first=Daniel |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/259347-santorum |title=Santorum plants seed for possible 2016 White House candidacy |publisher=Thehill.com |date=September 30, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general elections, Patriot Voices endorsed eight U.S. Senate candidates and four House candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patriotvoices.com/candidate_endorsements |title=Endorsements |publisher=Patriotvoices.com |accessdate=January 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115091942/http://www.patriotvoices.com/candidate_endorsements |archivedate=January 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iowa's 2012 retention elections Santorum lent support to the "NO Wiggins" effort to oust [[Iowa Supreme Court]] Justice David Wiggins, who they say promulgated a personal political agenda in the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.ottumwacourier.com/ottumwa/pm_113059/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=PBXNRaL3 |title=Judge-retention vote at a fevered pitch |publisher=M.ottumwacourier.com |accessdate=January 20, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been vocal in opposition to the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], which they say threatens parental rights and U.S. sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriotvoices.com/crpd |title=CRPD |publisher=Patriotvoices.com |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious faith==
[[File:Rick Santorum prays.jpg|thumb|right|Rick Santorum at prayer, 2012]]
Although he was raised in a nominally Catholic household, Santorum's faith began to deepen when he met his future wife, Karen. By his account, conversations with her father, Dr. Kenneth Garver, a staunch Catholic and pro-life advocate, solidified his understanding and opposition to abortion. He and his wife have since become increasingly religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/us/politics/from-nominal-catholic-to-clarion-of-faith.html?pagewanted=all|title=From ‘Nominal Catholic’ to Clarion of Faith|date=March 3, 2012|author=Sheryl Gay Stolber|author2=Laurie Goodstein|accessdate=January 20, 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum now considers himself a devout Catholic and acknowledges his faith as the source of his politics and worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/marchweb-only/113-12.0.html |title=Sen.

Santorum proudly calls himself a "culture warrior" and "true Christian conservative".

Santorum has written for Catholic publications and frequently comments on political issues from a religious standpoint. He has said, "I don't believe in an America where the [[separation of church and state]] is absolute. The First Amendment means the free exercise of religion and that means bringing people and their faith into the public square."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Santorum says he doesn't believe in separation of church and state|url=https://news.yahoo.com/santorum-says-doesnt-believe-separation-church-state-164307440.html|publisher=Yahoo!

Kennedy]], had caused "great harm in America". He said: "All of us have heard people say, 'I privately am against abortion, homosexual marriage, stem cell research, cloning. But who am I to decide that it's not right for somebody else?' It sounds good, but it is the corruption of freedom of conscience."&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; He told a group of college students in 2008 that the United States had been founded on "Judeo-Christian" ethics, and now "it is a shambles, it is gone from the world of Christianity as I see it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ryan Grim |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/18/rick-santorum-protestantism_n_1286471.html |title=Rick Santorum In 2008: Mainstream Protestantism Fell Out Of 'World Of Christianity{{'-}} |work=The Huffington Post|date=February 18, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santorum has said he values faith over politics and considers politicians' faith significant. He questioned whether Barack Obama truly has a religion, alleging that he may have chosen Christianity as a politically expedient platform for power.&lt;ref name="faithbasedcriticism"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tartar |first=Andre |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/02/santorum-implies-hes-the-only-real-christian.html |title=Santorum Says Obama's Not a Real Christian, Then Grudgingly Admits He Is |work=New York|date=February 19, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum stated, "if the President says he's a Christian, he's a Christian", but has stated that Obama's agenda is based on a "phony theology", not the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/santorum-says-obamas-agenda-based-on-phony-theology-not-bible-69806/ |title=Santorum Says Obama's Agenda Based on 'Phony' Theology, Not Bible |work=The Christian Post|date=February 19, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Glenn Beck]], Santorum said Obama's desire for greater higher education rates nationwide was a veiled attempt at "indoctrination", saying that "62 percent of kids who go into college with a faith commitment leave without it." Santorum declined to provide a source for that figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Santorum: Obama College Plan Aimed at 'Indoctrination'|url=https://news.yahoo.com/santorum-obama-college-plan-aimed-indoctrination-221507241.html|work=[[National Journal]]|date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights: Rick Santorum talks economy, controversy, and faith on GBTV|url=http://www.glennbeck.com/2012/02/23/developing-rick-santorum-talks-economy-controversy-and-faith-on-gbtv|publisher=[[TheBlaze|GBTV]]|date=February 23, 2012 | accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes colleges reinforce [[secular]] [[relativism]] and antagonize religiosity, particularly Christianity, and lists young people's support for abortion, gay marriage, and [[pornography]] as "symptoms" of indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/18/rick-santorum-blames-gay-marriage-abortion-porn-college-indoctrination_n_2501970.html |title=Rick Santorum Blames Gay Marriage, Abortion And Porn Ideals On College Indoctrination |work=The Huffington Post|date=January 18, 2013 |author=Cavan Sieczkowski |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to Pope Francis's encyclical ''[[Laudato si']]'', which acknowledges man-made climate change and calls for swift and unified global policies to phase out fossil fuels, Santorum said in 2015: "The church has gotten it wrong a few times on science, and I think we probably are better off leaving science to the scientists and focusing on what we’re good at, which is theology and morality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/17/jeb-bush-joins-republican-backlash-pope-climate-change "Jeb Bush joins Republican backlash against pope on climate change"] in ''The Guardian'', 17 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
Santorum has consistently held [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] views and has advocated "[[compassionate conservatism]]".&lt;ref name="future"/&gt; He has a more mixed record on fiscal issues.&lt;ref name="fiscal record"/&gt; As a member of Congress, he voted for the Bush tax cuts, favored a [[balanced budget amendment]] and sought to curb entitlements, playing a key role in enacting welfare reform.&lt;ref name="fiscal record"/&gt; He has been criticized for supporting costly federal programs in education and transportation and for using earmarks to fund Pennsylvania projects.&lt;ref name="fiscal record"/&gt; He says he regrets many of his votes for such programs, and opposes earmarks.&lt;ref name="fiscal record"/&gt; He has also specifically disavowed his 2003 support for the unfunded [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare prescription drug benefit]] and his vote for the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].&lt;ref name="fiscal record"/&gt;&lt;ref name="record on fiscal"/&gt;

In 2003, he was described by the ''[[Pennsylvania Report]]'' as having a "confrontational, partisan, 'in your face' style of politics and government."&lt;ref name=pareport2003/&gt; "I just don’t take the pledge. I take the bullets," Santorum said. "I stand out in front and I lead to make sure the voices of those who do not have a voice are out in front and being included in the national debate."&lt;ref name="reaffirms"/&gt;

===Abortion===
[[File:PBAsigning.jpg|thumb|right|Santorum at the signing of the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] by Pres. George W. Bush in 2004]]
Santorum considered himself [[pro-choice]] on abortion throughout his early life, but adopted a [[pro-life]] position by 1990 when he ran for Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/rick-santorum-abortion_n_1291634.html?ref=politics|title=Santorum In '95: 'I Was Basically Pro-Choice All My Life, Until I Ran For Congress'|work=The Huffington Post|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=March 7, 2012|first=Sam|last=Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/santorum-in-1995-i-was-basically-pro-choice-all-my-life-until-i-ran-for-congress-2012-2|title=Santorum In 1995: 'I Was Basically Pro-Choice All My Life Until I Ran For Congress'|publisher=Businessinsider.com|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/report-rick-santorum-supported-abortion-rights-in-past/2012/02/21/gIQAHb2vRR_blog.html|title=Report: Rick Santorum supported abortion rights in past|work=The Washington Post|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=March 7, 2012|first=Rachel|last=Weiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has become known for his staunch opposition to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/01/28/santorum-defends-his-anti-abortion-stances/79482824/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/27/409835451/5-things-you-should-know-about-rick-santorum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/rick-santorum-wants-to-be-more-than-just-a-pro-life-candidate/455397/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he said, "'I do not ''believe'' life begins at conception. I ''know'' life begins at conception. This is not a matter of debate. It's not a matter of faith... Every child at the moment of conception is both living — that embryo is metabolizing — and it is...genetically completely human"'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/rick-santorum-wants-to-be-more-than-just-a-pro-life-candidate/455397/&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2016 presidential debate, Santorum said, "'Twice in my life we were counseled to have an abortion — once with our son Gabriel and one with our little girl, Bella... Neither time did Karen (Santorum's wife) and I even think about [an abortion], because we know life begins at conception'".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/01/28/santorum-defends-his-anti-abortion-stances/79482824/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Santorum led the unsuccessful attempt to override President [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] veto of the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-09-27-9609270220-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; He also sponsored a similar bill in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/19991021/aponline151725_000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum was a lead sponsor of the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/22/abortion/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] in November 2003&lt;ref&gt;https://www.foxnews.com/story/bush-signs-ban-on-partial-birth-abortions&lt;/ref&gt; and upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the 2007 decision ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/washington/19scotus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class/Inequality===
Santorum has condemned the term "middle class" as “Marxism talk” used by liberals, maintaining that the United States has no social classes.&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reilly |first1=Mollie |title=Rick Santorum On Middle Class: ‘That’s Marxism Talk,’ ‘There’s No Class In America’ |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/12/rick-santorum-middle-class_n_3745283.html |accessdate=2 September 2018 |agency=huffington post |date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krugman-2-9-18"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Krugman |first1=Paul |title=For Whom the Economy Grows |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/opinion/economy-gdp-income-inequality.html |accessdate=2 September 2018 |agency=New York Times |date=30 August  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an August 2013 GOP fundraiser in Rock Rapids, Iowa, he said, “Don’t use the term the other side uses. ... The middle class. ... Since when in America do we have classes? Since when in America are people stuck in areas or defined places called a class? That’s Marxism talk. ... When Republicans get up and talk about middle class, we’re buying into their rhetoric of dividing America. Stop it. There’s no class in America. Call them on it.”&lt;ref name=Reilly/&gt;

===Contraception===
Santorum has said he does not believe a "right to privacy" is part of the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]]. He has criticized the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), which held that the Constitution guaranteed that right and overturned a law prohibiting the sale of [[birth control|contraceptives]] to married couples.&lt;ref name="wrecking ball"/&gt; Santorum has asserted that the right to privacy set forth in ''Griswold'' was a "jurisprudential novelty [that] quickly become a constitutional wrecking ball" and eventually led the Court to recognize a constitutional right to abortion in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973).&lt;ref name="wrecking ball"/&gt; In critiquing ''Griswold'', Santorum emphasized that he did not support laws banning contraceptives.&lt;ref name="wrecking ball"/&gt; Santorum has, however, described contraception as "a license to do things in [the] sexual realm that [are] counter to how things are supposed to be."&lt;ref name="weak field"/&gt;

===Death penalty===
In March 2005, Santorum expressed misgivings about the death penalty in light of wrongly convicted individuals who were sentenced to death. He went on to say, "I agree with the Pope that in the civilized world ... the application of the death penalty should be limited. I would definitely agree with that. I would certainly suggest there probably should be some further limits on what we use it for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=politicks Org|url=http://2012.republican-candidates.org/Santorum/Capital-Punishment.php|title=Santorum on Capital Punishment|publisher=2012.republican-candidates.org|date=March 22, 2005|accessdate=April 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418131253/http://2012.republican-candidates.org/Santorum/Capital-Punishment.php#|archive-date=April 18, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Santorum said, "when there is certainty, that's the case that capital punishment can be used", but "if there is not certainty, under the law, it shouldn't be used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/23/clips-from-friday-rick-santorum-on-the-death-penalty-karen-santorum-opens-up-about-the-death-of-their-infant-son/|title=Clips From Friday: Rick Santorum on the death penalty; Karen Santorum opens up about the death of their infant son|publisher=Piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com|accessdate=April 11, 2012 |date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
Santorum used cannabis in college, but later said, "Even during that time, I knew that what I was doing was wrong."&lt;ref name="on_drugs"/&gt; He is against the legalization of cannabis, and  believes that the federal law against it should be enforced in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferner|first1=Matt|title=Here's Where The GOP's 2016 Presidential Contenders Stand On Marijuana Legalization|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/06/heres-what-the-presidenti_n_7184508.html|publisher=HuffingtonPost|accessdate=May 28, 2015|date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has voted in favor of increasing penalties for drug trafficking and possession, and for increased spending on drug control.&lt;ref name="on_drugs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rick Santorum on Drugs|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2012/Rick_Santorum_Drugs.htm|publisher=OnTheIssues|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy and environment===
Santorum rejects the [[scientific opinion on climate change]] that stresses human causation for [[global warming]], calling it "[[global warming controversy|junk science]]". He has said that global warming is a "beautifully concocted scheme" by the [[political left]] and "an excuse for more government control of your life."&lt;ref name="rush limbaugh 2011"/&gt; He has also rebuked [[Pope Francis]] for his opinions on climate change, saying Francis should "leave science to the scientists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/santorum-pope-francis-leave-science-the-scientists|title=Santorum to Pope Francis: 'Leave science to the scientists'|author=Jane C.

He has stated a policy of "drill everywhere" for oil and that there is "enough oil, coal and natural gas to last for centuries".&lt;ref name="no such"/&gt;

===Euthanasia===
In 2012, Santorum said that half of all euthanizations in the Netherlands are involuntary, that Dutch hospitals euthanize elderly patients for financial reasons, and that 10% of all deaths in the Netherlands are the result of such involuntary euthanizations. Santorum's claims were called "bogus" by both ''The Washington Post'' fact-checker [[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]] and [[FactCheck.org]], which noted that no evidence supported the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Glenn |last=Kessler |authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist) |date=February 22, 2012 |title=Euthanasia in the Netherlands: Rick Santorum's bogus statistics |quote=There appears to be not a shred of evidence to back up Santorum's claims about euthanasia in the Netherlands.

===Fiscal policy===
As U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, in each year from 1992 through 1994, Santorum received a grade of B, and as U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, Santorum received grades of A from 1995 through 1997, B+ in 1998 and 1999, B in 2000, A from 2001 through 2004, B in 2005, and B+ in 2006 from the [[National Taxpayers Union]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Taxpayer groups|taxpayers advocacy organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.ntu.org/state/legislator/rick-santorum-2|title=National Taxpayers Union – Rick Santorum|publisher=[[National Taxpayers Union]]|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.ntu.org/state/legislator/rick-santorum|title=National Taxpayers Union – Rick Santorum|publisher=[[National Taxpayers Union]]|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun laws===
Santorum, who received nearly $116,000 from the gun lobby from 1990 to 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Tyler; Frostenson, Sarah; Mihalik, Lily, [https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/gun-lobbying-spending-in-america-congress/?query=Rick+Santorum, "The gun lobby: See how much your representative gets"], ''Politico'', February 21, 2018, Retrieved March 25, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; has consistently supported gun rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Molly|title=Rick Santorum on Gun Rights|url=http://gunowners.org/ricksantorum-2012.htm|accessdate=March 11, 2012|date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum is an advocate of the [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|right to bear arms]]. He is also a defender of gun manufacturers, and voted for the 2005 [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act]] (Bill S 397), which prevents civil suits from being brought against gun manufacturers for criminal acts perpetrated with their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2012.republican-candidates.org/Santorum/Gun-Control.php|title=Santorum on Gun Control|author=politicks Org|date=August 10, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 2018, in response to the "[[March for Our Lives]]", Santorum told CNN that rather than marching the students should "take CPR classes" instead of "looking to someone else to solve their problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/video/news/santorum-knocks-marches-kids-should-learn-cpr/vi-BBKG0xT|date=March 25, 2018|title=Santorum knocks marches: Kids should learn CPR|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Journalism Review]] called the comment "asinine on its face," but said that, even so, the response from doctors, journalists and students about the "stupid" comment was excessive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/cnn-santorum-gun-cpr.php The media today: CNN's Santorum 'controversy' shows the worst of cable news] By Pete Vernon, CJR, March 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
In 2015, Santorum called for more restrictions on family-based immigration after warning of a "flood of legal—not illegal—immigrants to our country", which he blamed for depressing the median income of American workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/santorum-2016-message |title=Rick Santorum's 2016 message comes into focus |last1=Sarlin |first1=Benjy |date=January 19, 2015 |website=www.msnbc.com |publisher=NBC UNIVERSAL |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Santorum opposed the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006|Senate's immigration reform proposal]], saying the U.S. should simply act to enforce currently existing laws. He has openly stated his opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants. He supports the construction of a barrier along the [[U.S.-Mexican border|U.S.–Mexican border]], an increase in the number of border patrol agents, and the stationing of National Guard troops along the border.

[[File:Rick Santorum by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|right|Santorum speaking in Des Moines, Iowa in 2011]]
In his 2005 book ''[[It Takes a Family]]'', Santorum advocated a society oriented toward "family values" and centered on monogamous, heterosexual relationships, marriage, and child-raising. He opposes [[same-sex marriage]], saying the American public and their elected officials should decide on these "incredibly important moral issues" rather than the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Stephanopoulos Interviews Sen. Rick Santorum|url=http://thinkprogress.org/santorum-this-week/|publisher=[[Think Progress]]|date=July 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 2003 interview, Santorum expressed opposition to same-sex marriage, said he favors having laws against [[polygamy]], [[sodomy]], and other actions "antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family", and likened homosexuality to [[Zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="usa today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Excerpt from Santorum interview|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|date=April 23, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008|quote=Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman....

In 2011, during his bid for the Republican nomination in the upcoming presidential election, Santorum  attended a Republican primary debate held two days after the official end of the Clinton-era [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]] policy that effectively banned homosexuals from open service in the United States Armed Forces, and fielded a question from [[Stephen Snyder-Hill]], a gay soldier then serving in [[Iraq War|Iraq]],  about the progress made by gay and lesbian soldiers in the military.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/obama-blasts-republicans-over-booing-of-gay-soldier/

Santorum was roundly criticized for not supporting the soldier, and he later asserted he had not heard the booing from the stage.

In 2015, Santorum signed an online pledge vowing not to respect any law, including any decision by the United States Supreme Court, conferring legal recognition on same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ennis|first1=Dawn|title=Who Are the 44,500 Who Say They'll Go to Jail to Fight Marriage Equality?|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2015/06/15/who-are-44500-who-say-theyll-go-jail-fight-marriage-equality|accessdate=June 15, 2015|agency=The Advocate|publisher=advocate.com|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pledge states, in part: "A decision purporting to redefine marriage flies in the face of the Constitution and is contrary to the natural created order.

In May 2015, Santorum made a statement that was seen as supportive of [[Caitlyn Jenner]]. At a Republican convention in South Carolina, in response to a question about Jenner, Santorum said: "if [Jenner] says he's a woman, then he's a woman. My responsibility as a human being is to love and accept everybody. Not to criticize people for who they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Linshi|first1=Jack|title=Rick Santorum on Bruce Jenner: 'If He Says He's a Woman, Then He's a Woman'|url=http://time.com/3844757/rick-santorum-bruce-jenner-lgbt-transgender/|accessdate=June 15, 2015|work=Time Magazine|issue=May 3, 2015|date=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Santorum's consistent opposition to same-sex marriage, his apparent acceptance of Jenner's transition was considered surprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Margolin|first1=Emma|title=Santorum clarifies surprising remarks about Bruce Jenner|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/santorum-clarifies-surprising-remarks-about-bruce-jenner|accessdate=June 15, 2015|work=MSNBC|date=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, however, some people criticized Santorum for continuing to use the male pronoun in reference to Jenner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gass|first1=Nick|title=Rick Santorum: I'd welcome an endorsement from Caitlyn Jenner|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/rick-santorum-endorsement-caitlyn-jenner-118917.html#ixzz3dAcYdFrS|website=Politico.com|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum declined to take a position on whether transgender people should be allowed to use restrooms of the gender of their choice, saying only that he believed the federal government should leave the issue to local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlson|first1=Adam|title=Rick Santorum Supports Bruce Jenner: 'If He Says He's a Woman, Then He's a Woman'|url=http://www.people.com/article/rick-santorum-interview-bruce-jenner-transition|accessdate=June 15, 2015|work=People Magazine|date=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flores|first1=Reena|title=Rick Santorum clarifies comments on Bruce Jenner's identity|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rick-santorum-clarifies-comments-on-bruce-jenners-identity/|accessdate=June 15, 2015|agency=CBS News|publisher=cbsnews.com|date=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum later "clarified" his statement, writing that he "meant to express empathy", and "not a change in public policy."&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt; In July 2015, Santorum reaffirmed his support for [[Federal Marriage Amendment|a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/santorum-marriage-defined-amendment/2015/07/13/id/654706/ |title=Santorum Calls For 'National Standard' Marriage Amendment |publisher=Newsmax.com |date= |accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; contending that "... we need a national standard for marriage."

===Libertarianism===
In June 2011, Santorum said he would continue to "fight very strongly against [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian influence]] within the Republican Party and the conservative movement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://townhall.com/tipsheet/greghengler/2012/01/05/rick_santorums_real_concerns_about_the_tea_party Rick Santorum's "Real Concerns" About The Tea Party] ''[[Townhall.com]]'' January 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[NPR]] in the summer of 2005, Santorum discussed what he called the "[[right-libertarianism|libertarianish right]]", saying "they have this idea that people should be left alone, be able to do whatever they want to do. Government should keep our taxes down and keep our regulation low and that we shouldn't get involved in the bedroom, we shouldn't get involved in cultural issues, you know, people should do whatever they want. Well, that is not how traditional conservatives view the world, and I think most conservatives understand that individuals can't go it alone...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Inskeep]], host [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4784905 Rick Santorum, 'It Takes a Family'] ''[[NPR]]'' August 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimum wage===
During his 2016 presidential campaign, Santorum came out in support of an increase in the federal minimum wage. In September 2015, he said, "'Republicans are losing elections because we aren’t taking about [workers], all we want to talk about is what happened to business, there are people that work in those businesses.'"&lt;ref&gt;https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/253957-santorum-defends-raising-minimum-wage&lt;/ref&gt;

On his official website, Santorum said that the "Obama Administration has turned a blind eye" to [[pornography]], but promised that that "will change under a Santorum Administration."&lt;ref name=santorumusatoday&gt;{{cite news|last=Sneed|first=Tierney|title=Is Rick Santorum Right on Banning Internet Porn?|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/03/16/is-rick-santorum-right-on-banning-internet-porn|accessdate=March 26, 2012|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[USA Today]]'', some conservatives believe Santorum's opposition to pornography could "hurt the party politically."&lt;ref name=santorumusatoday/&gt; On March 23, 2012, Santorum wrote on his campaign website that there is "a wealth of research" demonstrating that pornography causes "profound brain changes" and widespread negative effects on children and adults, including "violence to women."&lt;ref name=santorumhp&gt;{{cite news|title=Santorum Says Porn Causes Aggression But Scientists Disagree|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/23/santorum-porn-agression_n_1376285.html|accessdate=March 26, 2012|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=March 23, 2012|first=Melissa|last=Cronin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers say that there is no such evidence of brain changes, although pornography's harmfulness "is still in dispute."&lt;ref name=santorumhp/&gt; James Poulos, a writer for ''[[Forbes]]'', wrote on March 19, 2012, that Santorum's criticism of pornography is an "ability to transform relatively irrelevant issues into politically relevant controversies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poulos|first=James|title=Santorum's Problems Go Way Beyond Porn, Polls Show|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamespoulos/2012/03/19/santorums-problems-go-way-beyond-porn/|accessdate=March 26, 2012|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He supported increased funding for Social Services Block Grants and organizations like Healthy Start and the [[Children's Aid Society]], and financing community health centers.&lt;ref name="political theater"/&gt;

===Social Security===
Santorum supported partial privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and following [[United States presidential election, 2004|President Bush's reelection]], he held forums across Pennsylvania on the topic.&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt;

===Trade policy===
The [[Cato Institute]]'s Center for Trade Policy Studies identified Santorum, during his U.S. Senate tenure, as having a mostly pro-[[free trade]] and mostly anti-[[subsidy|subsidies]] voting record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://www.cato.org/research/trade-immigration/congress?senator=91|title=Free Trade, Free Markets: Rating the Congress|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karen Santorum and daughter Sarah Maria, Value Voters Summit 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Rick Santorum's wife Karen, along with daughter Sarah Maria, at the [[Values Voter Summit]] in October 2011]]
Santorum met his future wife, Karen Garver (born 1960), while she was a neo-natal nurse studying law at the University of Pittsburgh and he was recruiting summer interns for [[K&amp;L Gates|Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart]].

Santorum has written four books: ''[[It Takes a Family|It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good]]'' (2005);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rick Santorum|title=[[It Takes a Family|It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good]]|year=2005|publisher=[[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]]|isbn=1-932236-29-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Patriots: Answering the Call to Freedom'' (2012);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rick Santorum|title=American Patriots: Answering the Call to Freedom|year=2012|publisher=[[Tyndale House Publishers]]|isbn=978-1414379081}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works'' (2014);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rick Santorum|title=Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works|year=2014|publisher=[[Regnery Publishing]]|isbn=978-1621572398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Bella's Gift: How One Little Girl Transformed Our Family and Inspired a Nation'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rick Santorum|title=Bella's Gift: How One Little Girl Transformed Our Family and Inspired a Nation|year=2015|publisher=Thomas Nelson |isbn=978-0718021955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Santorum's books, a collection of his speeches as a U.S. senator was published and released by Monument Press in 2005 under the title ''Rick Santorum: A Senator Speaks Out on Life, Freedom, and Responsibility''.

Santorum also wrote a foreword to [[William A. Dembski]]'s 2006 ''Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson and the Intelligent Design Movement''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson and the Intelligent Design Movement |year=2006|author=Foreword by Rick Santorum|editor=[[William A.

In ''It Takes a Family'', Santorum argues that the traditional family is the foundation of society. Santorum criticizes alike laissez-faire conservatives and liberal proponents of social welfare for promoting a radical view of autonomy. In particular, he criticizes the "bigs" – "big government, big media, big entertainment, big universities." The book became a ''[[New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times Best Seller list|bestseller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://secureapps.libraries.psu.edu/PACFTB/bios/biography.cfm?AuthorID=1530|title=Author biographies|publisher=|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Patriots'' tells the stories of 25 lesser-known Americans from the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/49260781/ns/today-books/#.UHEk7ZG9KSM |title=Santorum cites unsung heroes of the American Revolution (book excerpt) |work=MSNBC.com |date=October 2, 2012 |author=Rick Santorum |accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum writes, "Most Americans know something about our Founding Fathers and their role in creating the government of the United States. However, most know little about the day-to-day battles fought by Americans of all backgrounds that paved the way for the high ideals of our founders to be put into practice."&lt;ref name="POLITICOamericanpatriots"&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82709.html "Rick Santorum slams 'pursuit of happiness{{'"}}]. POLITICO. 22 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He also writes, "Today we are facing a threat to the very foundation our founders laid. That threat does not come from an alien force but from those who are willing and determined to abandon the concept of God-given rights. Like the royalty during the Revolution, today's elites wish to return to the pre-Revolutionary paradigm in which they, through governmental force, allocate rights and responsibilities."&lt;ref name="POLITICOamericanpatriots"/&gt; 

''Blue Collar Conservatives'' departs from traditional Republican orthodoxy&lt;ref name="POLITICObluecollar"/&gt; and says that the Republican Party must to appeal to [[blue collar]] Americans. He says, "As many as six million blue collar voters stayed home from the polls, and there's good reason to believe that a large majority of them would have voted Republican if they had voted."&lt;ref name="POLITICObluecollar"&gt;[http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/rick-santorum-book-106072.html?hp=f3 Rick Santorum bucks Republican orthodoxy in book] POLITICO&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum puts forward a recipe for Republican success in which Republicans advocate for workers and not just corporations.&lt;ref name="WTbook"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/7/book-review-campaigns-should-emphasize-jobs/?page=all BOOK REVIEW: 'Blue Collar Conservatives{{'"}}]. ''The Washington Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; He says that many middle class workers who have been forced into part-time jobs at [[big box stores]] or even into public assistance programs are amenable to the GOP's message if it is presented in relatable terms.&lt;ref name="WTbook"/&gt; He tackles education, saying the current system of government-run schools is a "relic of the late 19th century" and that children should not be pressured into going to college when a job or vocational training would be a better option.&lt;ref name="WTbook"/&gt; He criticizes [[libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] influence in the Republican Party, saying, "There are some in my party who have taken the ideal of individualism to such an extreme that they have forgotten the obligation to look out for our fellow man."&lt;ref name="POLITICObluecollar"/&gt; He says the GOP should be less quick to dismiss concerns over decreasing social and economic mobility, saying that large businesses and stocks are strong, while life has become "a trickle" for workers.&lt;ref name="POLITICObluecollar"/&gt; He questions rich compensation of business executives, and says that while he supports [[free trade]], Republicans need to look at its impact on the average person and consider whether existing laws are fair.&lt;ref name="POLITICObluecollar"/&gt;

In January 2015, Santorum announced ''Bella's Gift: How One Little Girl Transformed Our Family and Inspired a Nation'', a book about his daughter Bella, who lives with a rare genetic condition called [[Trisomy 18]]. The book is authored by Santorum and his wife, Karen Santorum, and co-authored by their daughter, Elizabeth Santorum. It was released February 10, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/2015/01/07/senator-rick-santorum-and-his-wife-have-a-book-coming-out-about-a-special-child-bella/|title=Senator Rick Santorum and his wife have a book coming out about a special child – Bella – Gretawire|work=Gretawire|accessdate=August 10, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915063721/http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/2015/01/07/senator-rick-santorum-and-his-wife-have-a-book-coming-out-about-a-special-child-bella/|archivedate=September 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Donald William Farquharson''' (born 1969) is an Australian man charged, tried and convicted of [[murder]]ing his three sons on [[Father's Day]] in 2005 by driving them in his car into a farm [[dam]].&lt;ref name="Gregory2007-10-05"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gregory | first = Peter | date = 5 October 2007 | title = Dad guilty of killing sons | work = [[The Age]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/dad-guilty-of-killing-sons/2007/10/05/1191091341222.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farquharson was convicted in an earlier trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term. However, he maintained his [[innocence]] and appealed his sentence.&lt;ref name="Rennie2007-10-05"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rennie | first = Reko | date = 5 October 2007 | title = Dad to appeal conviction | work = [[The Age]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/dad-to-appeal-conviction/2007/10/05/1191091354402.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 December 2009, he won the right to a retrial, due in part to the key witness for the prosecution, Greg King, facing potential criminal charges himself at the time of the original trial.&lt;ref name="Rout2009-12-17"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rout | first = Milanda | date = 17 December 2009 | title = Robert Farquharson to face retrial over death of three sons | work = [[The Australian]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/robert-farquharson-to-face-retrial-over-death-of-three-sons/story-e6frg6nf-1225811414155 | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was released on bail on 21 December, but was again convicted of murder on 22 July 2010.

[[Helen Garner]] published ''[[This House of Grief]]'' (2014) as a response to the crime and the ensuing trials, in which Faruqharson is heavily depicted. 

==Early life==
[[File:Farquharson-children-dad-guilty.jpg|right|thumb|The deceased Farquharson children, Jai, 10, Bailey, 2, Tyler, 7]]
Farquharson met Cindy Gambino, in February 1990 and the two began a relationship. Gambino had previously been in a relationship with a man who was killed in a car accident. In 1996, Farquharson took a redundancy package from his employer and bought a lawn-mowing franchise servicing his local area, a venture which lost him AU$40,000.&lt;ref name="Kissane2007-10-06"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kissane | first = Karen | date = 6 October 2007 | title = In the name of the father, how could he? | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/in-the-name-of-the-father-how-could-he/2007/10/05/1191091364670.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farquharson married Gambino in 2000&lt;ref name="Kissane2007-10-06" /&gt; and they had three children by 2002. The pair separated amicably in 2004.&lt;ref name="Houlihan2007-10-07"&gt;{{cite news | last = Houlihan | first = Liam | date = 7 October 2007 | title = Oprah $1m offer to 'dam' mum | work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22543433-5006003,00.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farquharson suffered from [[avoidant personality disorder]] and bouts of [[clinical depression|depression]], and sought the assistance of a [[psychologist]] and later a [[psychiatrist]] to deal with the separation. He was prescribed the [[antidepressants]] [[Zoloft]] and later [[Mirtazapine|Avanza]].&lt;ref name="Kissane2007-10-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="News.com"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Critchley | first1 = Cheryl | last2 = McGrath | first2 = Helen | date = 8 August 2015 | title = What drives a dad to murder his sons? | work = News.com.au | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/what-drives-a-dad-to-murder-his-sons/news-story/da98f8203373ab0b10740eab02184e51 | accessdate = 26 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drownings==
About 7&amp;nbsp;pm on 4 September 2005, as Farquharson was returning his children to their mother after a [[Father's Day]] access visit, his white 1989 [[VN Commodore]] vehicle veered across the [[Princes Highway]] between [[Winchelsea, Victoria|Winchelsea]] and [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], crashed through a fence and came to rest in a farm dam where it filled with water and submerged. His three children, Jai (10), Tyler (7) and Bailey (2), were unable to free themselves and drowned. Farquharson managed to escape and alerted another driver who took him to nearby Winchelsea.&lt;ref name="Silvester2005-12-15"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Silvester | first1 = John | last2 = Adams | first2 = David | date = 15 December 2005 | title = 'Dumbfounded' dad to fight murder charges | work = [[The Age]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/12/14/1134500913306.html?from=top5 | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police divers recovered the boys' bodies about 2&amp;nbsp;am the next day. They were still inside the vehicle and unrestrained by [[seatbelt]]s. 

After a three-month investigation, police prepared murder charges against Farquharson and went to his Winchelsea home on 14 December 2005. He was not there at the time but presented himself at the Geelong police station in the presence of his lawyer. He was arrested and charged with three counts of murder. He had previously requested and undertook a [[Polygraph|lie detector]] test, the results of which are inadmissible in court.&lt;ref name="Silvester2005-09-21"&gt;{{cite news | last = Silvester | first = John | date = 21 September 2005 | title = Drowned brothers' father takes lie detector test | work = [[The Age]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/drowned-brothers-father-takes-lie-detector-test/2005/09/20/1126982061861.html?from=moreStories | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later appeared in the Geelong [[Magistrates Court of Victoria|Magistrates Court]], where he was [[Detention of suspects|remanded]] in custody and ordered to appear before the court on 7 April 2006.&lt;ref name="Silvester2005-12-15" /&gt;

Gambino told the court that she did not believe Farquharson intended to kill their children deliberately, saying "I believe with all my heart that this was just an accident and that he would not have hurt a hair on their heads. I don't believe this is murder."&lt;ref name="Medew2006-08-15"&gt;{{cite news | last = Medew | first = Julia | date = 15 August 2006 | title = Court told of plan to kill three sons | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/court-told-of-plan-to-kill-three-sons/2006/08/14/1155407741517.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police alleged that Farquharson was in control of the vehicle in the moments before it crashed into the dam and that he earlier told a friend, Greg King, that he had intended to kill his children to get back at his wife.&lt;ref name="ABC2006-08-16"&gt;{{cite news | date = 16 August 2006 | title = Father was in control of car before dam plunge, court told | work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200608/s1716517.htm | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later granted [[bail]] and released from custody to appear at his trial which was scheduled to begin in August 2007.

==Trial==

Farquharson's trial for the murder of his sons began in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], before Justice [[Philip Cummins]], on 21 August 2007.&lt;ref name="ABC2007-08-21"&gt;{{cite news | date = 21 August 2007 | title = Dad on trial over Father's Day drownings | work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | url = http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/21/2010406.htm?section= | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 49 witnesses appeared during the six-week trial.&lt;ref name="ABC2007-10-02"&gt;{{cite news | date = 2 October 2007 | title = Farquharson jury considers verdict | work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/02/2049201.htm | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosecution===

Sergeant Glen Urquhart gave evidence that the steering wheel of Farquharson's vehicle would require a 220-degree turn to veer as it did on the highway to leave the road. There was no evidence of braking before the car entered the dam.&lt;ref name="Bice2007-10-06"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bice | first = Katie | date = 6 October 2007 | title = Killer father's daze | work = [[Herald Sun]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22538736-2862,00.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle's [[headlight]]s, heater and [[ignition system]] were all in the off position.&lt;ref name="Kissane2007-10-06" /&gt; 

The body of the oldest child, Jai, was found protruding halfway out of the vehicle's front door. The other boys were discovered in the back seat. 

Police video re-enactments of the crime scene played before the court showed the car veering left, instead of right, towards the dam  at the exact position on the highway the accident happened. Farquharson's car was found to pull slightly to the right, though not to the degree that would counteract the left-veering force according to Urquhart.

King, a bus driver, testified that he recalled a conversation with Farquharson two months before the incident outside a fish and chip shop. He said his friend spoke of seeking revenge on his former wife and of wanting to "take away the things that mean the most to her",{{cn|date=January 2013}} meaning the children. King recalled Farquharson complaining how his wife had taken the newer of the two cars. But King's wife could not recall her husband relaying this conversation to her that day.

Another witness, Shane Atkinson, who discovered Farquharson on the side of the road, said Farquharson twice refused to call the [[000 emergency]] number, preferring instead to travel to Winchelsea to tell his wife of his children's fate.&lt;ref name="Bice2007-10-06" /&gt; The court transcript reveals Atkinson had to borrow a mobile phone to call police from the Winchelsea police station, which was closed for the night. This backs up the evidence given originally at the committal hearing that no mobile phone was available. 

Matthew Naughton, an associate professor and specialist in sleep and respiratory medicine, told the jury that it was highly unlikely Farquharson had suffered a coughing fit in the moments before the accident.&lt;ref name="Bice2007-09-13"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bice | first = Katie | date = 13 September 2007 | title = Expert hits dam dad's blackout plea | work = [[Herald Sun]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22408332-661,00.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He further testified that coughing to the point of blacking out is an extremely rare condition, known as [[Vasovagal_response|cough syncope]], and that Farquharson was unlikely to have suffered such an attack while driving given the warmth of his vehicle.&lt;ref name="ABC2007-10-05"&gt;{{cite news | date = 5 October 2007 | title = Father found guilty of killing three sons | work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | url = http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/05/2052087.htm?section=justin | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later conceded, however, that he had never seen cough syncope, would not know how to take a history to determine it and was sceptical even of its existence, a consideration not backed up by others in the same sphere of medicine.

===Defence===

Farquharson relied upon the defence of losing consciousness due to a coughing fit and told police that he woke up in the dam. He said that the car had begun to submerge when his son Jai tried to free himself by opening the passenger door.&lt;ref name="Gregory2007-09-14"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gregory | first = Peter | date = 14 September 2007 | title = 'Dad, we're in water' | work = [[The Age]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/dad-were-in-water/2007/09/14/1189276972181.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cam Everett, the owner of the property where the dam was located, told the court that a total of seven vehicles had crashed through his farm fence in eight years. No vehicles other than Farquharson's had ended up in the dam in that time.&lt;ref name="Kissane2007-10-06" /&gt;

Former police superintendent David Axup, who has not been a policeman for over 20 years, contradicted the prosecution's arguments about the path and steering of the car as it left the road, believing it had probably travelled on a 53-degree arc. He said this could be explained by the right camber of the road towards the dam as well as the fact that the car had poor wheel alignment, meaning it would move uncontrolled to the right.&lt;ref name="GelongAdvertiser2007-10-09"&gt;{{cite news | date = 9 October 2007 | title = Farqharson's guilty verdict shocks top lawyers | work = [[Geelong Advertiser]] | location = [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2007/10/09/7666_news.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farquharson's thoracic medicine specialist, Chris Steinfort, also concluded it was "highly likely" that his patient had suffered from cough syncope on the night. Steinfort has seen cases of cough syncope and believed the symptoms suffered by Farquharson were a "classic" example.&lt;ref name="SMH2007-09-20"&gt;{{cite news | date = 20 September 2007 | title = Blackout behind car wheel likely: doctor | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Blackout-behind-car-wheel-likely-doctor/2007/09/20/1189881677517.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verdict===

The day before the verdict came in, Farquharson arranged for flowers (three red [[tulips]]) to be laid at the grave of his children. Attached was a card reading "Dear Jai, Thinking of you on your birthday. Love you, Dad." Jai would have turned 13 that day.&lt;ref name="Ryan2007-10-08"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ryan | first = Kelly | date = 8 October 2007 | title = Flowers from Robert Farquharson to his children victims | work = [[Herald Sun]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22546642-661,00.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three days of deliberations, the jury found Farquharson guilty on 5 October 2007.&lt;ref name="Gregory2007-10-05" /&gt; Gambino broke down in court when the verdict was announced; her mother collapsed and was taken to hospital by ambulance.&lt;ref name="ABC2007-10-05"/&gt; Justice Cummins allowed a recess of 15 minutes for the court to compose itself before proceedings resumed.&lt;ref name="Sherborne2007-10-06"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sherborne | first = Craig | date = 6 October 2007 | title = Mum in agony as day of judgment arrives | work = [[Herald Sun]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22538805-2862,00.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 2007, Farquharson was sentenced to three terms of life imprisonment without parole. He then announced that he intended to appeal his convictions.&lt;ref name="Rennie2007-10-05" /&gt;

==Appeal, bail and retrial==

On 17 December 2009, Farquharson's conviction was unanimously overturned by the three appeal judges.  They were critical of the trial judge, the prosecution and the evidence of key prosecution witness Greg King.&lt;ref name="Devic2009-12-18"&gt;{{cite news | last = Devic | first = Aleks | date = 18 December 2009 | title = Robert Farquharson's triple murder conviction in Winchelsea quashed | work = [[Geelong Advertiser]] | location = [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]] | url = http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2009/12/18/132611_news.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December 2009 he was granted bail and released into the care of one of his sisters with AU$200,000 surety.&lt;ref name="ABC2009-12-21"&gt;{{cite news | date = 21 December 2009 | title = Dam deaths father granted bail | work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/21/2777613.htm?section=justin | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The retrial commenced on 4 May 2010 before Justice [[Lex Lasry]] [[Queens_Counsel|QC]]. The jury retired to consider their verdict on 19 July 2010 after hearing 11 weeks of evidence and argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/farquharson-jury-retires-to-consider-verdict-20100719-10hbj.html | title = Farquharson jury retires to consider verdict | date = 19 July 2010 | accessdate = 19 July 2010 | work = The Age | publisher = Fairfax Media | location=Melbourne | first=Andrea | last=Petrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July, after three days of deliberation, the second jury again found Farquharson guilty of murder. On 15 October 2010 he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 33-year minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/robert-farquharson-guilty-of-murdering-sons/story-e6frfkvr-1225895767491 | title = Robert Farquharson guilty of murdering sons | work = news.com.au | author = AAP | date = 22 July 2010 | accessdate = 22 July 2010 | publisher = News Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media offers==

[[Harpo Productions]], the company of American [[talk show]] host [[Oprah Winfrey]], is reported to have offered Gambino $1&amp;nbsp;million to appear on the programme and tell her story.&lt;ref name="Kissane2007-10-06" /&gt; Gambino told her story to Australian magazine ''[[Woman's Day]]'', saying that she did not believe Farquharson had killed their children,&lt;ref name="Cooper2007-10-23"&gt;{{cite news | last = Cooper | first = Mex | date = 23 October 2007 | title = Farquharson internet campaign starts | work = [[Geelong Advertiser]] | location = [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2007/10/23/8133_news.html | accessdate = 21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since changed her mind.&lt;ref name="Gough2014-10-27"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gough | first = Deborah | date = 7 October 2013 | title = Cindy Gambino seeks to keep Robert Farquharson away from children after death | work = [[The Age]] | location = [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/cindy-gambino-seeks-to-keep-robert-farquharson-away-from-children-after-death-20131007-2v3r8.html | accessdate = 16 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samia Ahad''' is a [[Pakistani]] chef who is [[head chef]] at the Coriander Leaf restaurant in [[Singapore]], having previously worked in restaurants in Manhattan. Ahad opened a second restaurant, inside her Screening Room entertainment complex.

==Career==
Samia Ahad was born in [[Pakistan]]. She ended up working as a [[travel agent]] in London for ten years, before moving to [[New York City]] with her husband.&lt;ref name="newz"/&gt; While there, she learnt to cook and trained in [[French cuisine]] at [[Peter Kump]]'s Cooking School (now the [[Institute of Culinary Education]]). She worked in Manhattan restaurants such as [[The Quilted Giraffe]].&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Narayan|first1=Shoba|title=From durian to Kampong Glam|url=https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/travel/from-durian-to-kampong-glam-1.594038|accessdate=11 November 2017|work=The National|date=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband's job was transferred to [[Singapore]], and so they couple moved in 1997.

For a successful prediction Cyrus rewarded him with 3000 darics, or 10 talents. This money Silanus carefully preserved throughout the campaign and subsequent retreat, and was very anxious to return with it to his country. Accordingly, when Xenophon consulted him at Cotyora, on the plan which he had formed of founding a Greek colony on the coast of the Euxine, he revealed the project to the Cyreans, and did all in his power to thwart it. On this Xenophon publicly professed to have abandoned the design, and proposed that no one should be permitted to remain behind the rest of the army, or to sail away before it. The latter part of this proposition was most disagreeable to Silanus, who loudly remonstrated against it, but to no purpose, the soldiers threatening to punish him, should they catch him in any attempt to depart by himself. Not long after, however, he contrived to make his escape in a ship which he hired at Heracleia. (Xen. ''Anab''. i. 7. § 18, v. 6. §§ 16, 18, 29, 34, vi. 4. § 13.) [E. E.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spider Jerusalem''' is a fictional character and the [[protagonist]] of the [[comic book]] ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'', created by writer [[Warren Ellis]] and artist [[Darick Robertson]], introduced under the now-defunct [[Helix (comics)|Helix]] imprint of [[DC Comics]] before being moved to the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint.  

He is a sarcastic, [[drug]]-addicted, [[profanity|foul-mouthed]], troubled, bitter, but brilliant [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo journalist]] with a deep-seated hatred of authority, political corruption, and dogs. Spider is almost always drawn wearing a set of [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] sunglasses with one lens red and the other green, and he is most often compared to the real-life figure [[Hunter S. Thompson]].

[[IGN]] named him 45th of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.
==Background==

Spider is a renegade [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo journalist]] forced to return to [[The City (Transmetropolitan)|The City]] after having exhausted a substantial advance from a publisher without completing the books required by contract. After five years of effective retirement as a long-haired hermit in a compound in the mountains, he returns to [[The City (Transmetropolitan)|The City]] to complete the books, takes up work for an urban newspaper to support his writing, and finds himself battling political corruption at the highest level.

One of Spider's most apparent character traits is his heavy drug use, which he makes no attempt to conceal. In addition to being a chain smoker and heavy drinker, Spider uses an extensive and bewildering variety of drugs ranging from mild [[stimulant]]s, [[Nootropic|intellect enhancers]], and [[Psychedelic drug|mood-altering drug]]s to cocaine, heroin and rare, exotic, futuristic drugs. As is common in his society, Spider is resistant or immune to many forms of drug addiction, as well as lung cancer. Spider is well known for his foul language, especially when combining the word "fuck" with other words to make new and amusing insults. Spider is easily angered, his displays of temper ranging from mild verbal outbursts to violent physical assault. However, despite his temper and contempt for the City as a whole, Spider is often seen to treat innocents (particularly children) with kindness and care.  

Spider's past is not well known, though characters like Mitchell Royce and Spider himself have referred to past memorable incidents such as the ''enfant terrible'' (a French child assassin from the Anglo/Franco war) and the Prague telephone incident (in which Spider caused six politicians to commit suicide using just a phone). There are also hints at his childhood, which seems to have been extremely turbulent - somewhere between a victim of [[urban blight]] and a [[child soldier]] - and his early ambitions—"I wanted to be a [[sniper]] when I grew up. Didn't everyone?" - as well as his parents' growing madness.

He claims to have worked as a prostitute at some point in the past, and as a stripper at 8 years old. He grew up on the City's docks with drunken parents as an only child. His father drove a city bus and his mother was a housewife who cooked lizards for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. He returned to the docks as an adult to see that everyone was gone and the docks were abandoned and vowed to never forget his childhood there.

==Philosophy==
Spider is a firm believer in the [[truth]] and delivering it to his readers in the most direct and blunt manner possible, often capitalising it as "The Truth" in his writing for emphasis. This is most notable in one story, when Spider's editor recounts the tale of how Spider submitted an article on the election of the [[Richard Nixon]]-analogue "[[List of Transmetropolitan characters#Presidents|The Beast]]", which consisted of the word "fuck" repeated eight thousand times (see ''Transmetropolitan #1''). His approach to journalism has been encapsulated by Spider as "The truth...no matter what," and his appraisal of others rises if they feel the same way.

The primary focus of conflict within Spider's psyche, over the course of the series, is a combination of concern for his delivery of 'The Truth' and [[misanthropy]] towards his public. Spider hates and struggles against authority figures who oppress others, but he is also bitter toward the uninvolved public who give the authority its power. Likewise, he struggles to convince the public to listen to The Truth, but is disgusted by those who blindly accept what he reports. In addition, Spider's talents earn him unwanted fame and adoration, which clouds his ability to "get at The Truth", often resulting in him experiencing writer's block and depression. His editor, [[Mitchell Royce]], opines that Spider needs to be hated in order to function as a writer and journalist.

Despite his absolute disdain for those around him, Spider is quite loyal to those few who he considers friends and is equally quick to hurt those who would betray him. Indeed, much of Spider's motivation in the second half of the series was dedicated to bringing the President to justice for ordering the murder of [[List of Transmetropolitan characters#Allies|Vita Severn]], whom Spider had befriended.

Although he opposed The Beast, Spider is not loyal to any political party or organization, and his initial support of [[List of Transmetropolitan characters#Presidents|The Smiler]] was tinged with contempt at his [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] attitude and false [[altruism]]. He is also an avowed, often virulent [[atheism|atheist]] who opposes all organized religion, which he sees as little more than unworthy authority figures that exploit their members.

==Weapons==
He proudly claims to be "always armed", and is shown with several firearms, at least one of which, called "The Upper Hand", can blow up a vehicle. He has also possessed a rocket launcher, which he used to blow up a bar at the base of his mountain home. He was accidentally given a [[bandolier]] of grenades at a party, which he took as a sign that "There is a God".

Spider's weapon of choice for most of the series is a "bowel disruptor," which causes instant and painful loss of [[fecal incontinence|bowel control]], with settings that allow him to vary the level of pain and discomfort, ranging from simple loose, watery [[diarrhea]] to complete [[rectal prolapse]]. Most of the time the victim has a bowel movement so dramatic and agonizing that it induces [[unconsciousness]]. At least three times it is revealed through dialogue that the gun can be set to 'Fatal Intestinal [[Maelstrom]]'. Spider prefers this weapon because, despite being illegal, it is (usually) non-lethal and its effects are untraceable. His assistants, [[Channon Yarrow|Channon]] and [[Yelena Rossini|Yelena]], have also been armed with bowel disruptors during ''The Cure'' arc. 

On a few occasions, he has been known to carry lethal [[firearm]]s, though according to Spider, he only carries such weapons in emergency cases. He has, in at least one case, used a handgun to kill two would-be assassins (a third was beaten to death). In issue #38, he is revealed to be a competent gunfighter, having learned his skills in "places you never want to go." It is also revealed in issue #38 that he has killed sixteen people, all but one in self-defence; he never specifies how or why (although it could be inferred that he means Vita Severn, as Spider feels responsible for her death).

Regardless of whether or not he is armed, Spider is shown to be a surprisingly capable, though not invincible, fighter. He frequently lashes out violently at those who threaten or aggravate him, and his ferocity often allows him to defeat opponents who are well-trained or much more imposing physically. He is also not averse to brutalizing people in order to get crucial information (as is shown in his Year Five assault on [[List of Transmetropolitan characters#Other antagonists|Fred Christ]]). Like [[Channon Yarrow|Channon]], he had also gained experience in firearms while in school, though unlike Channon, he and his classmates had had to ''make'' their own arms—to prevent the teachers having an unfair advantage. He often uses improvised weapons to gain the upper hand - for example, putting his cigarette out in the eye of a guard or beating Fred Christ with a broken chair leg, which he dubbed "The Chair Leg of Truth".

==Appearance==
Initially, Spider is shown with a huge amount of muddy brown, shaggy hair and a long unkempt beard, claiming he has hair in places that his once and future editor/friend Mitchell Royce doesn't even know he owns.  On his return to the City, nearly all his hair is removed by a malfunctioning cleaning unit in his first apartment's bathroom. For the rest of the series, he is portrayed as virtually hairless, the exception being his eyebrows and a small amount of pubic hair. Spider is a small, slight figure with a long nose and slightly crooked teeth. His body is covered with black [[tattoo]]s, combining geometric tribal designs and other more [[Western world|Western]] images (his right buttock is marked "kiss here"), including a small spider on his upper forehead. He is also said to have a tattoo on his penis, though this is never shown.

Although he prefers not to wear clothes much of the time, when in public his primary mode of dress is typically a "black linen suit, urban weight, generous cut" (jacket and pants, no shirt under the jacket) with a pair of heavy black leather boots, although during the winter he is sometimes seen wearing a black [[sweater|jumper]] under his jacket; also, on the rare occasions when modesty is required of him he will wear knee-length [[boxer shorts]]. He also wears a pair of 'live-shades', [[sunglasses]] with [[Hidden camera|built-in still-photography]] capabilities; the right lens is green and rectangular, whilst the left one is red and circular (the AI that created them was on drugs at the time). The first pair he owns have gold rims around the lenses, while the ones he obtains during the second part of the ''Dirge'' arc have no rims. This appearance, and the comic's futuristic setting, has made Spider Jerusalem a cult (albeit fictional) character among [[Rivethead|rivet heads]], in a similar manner to [[Tank Girl]].

==Influences==
Spider Jerusalem is reminiscent of previous "[[Muckraker|muck-raking]]" or "[[Gonzo journalism|Gonzo]]" journalists such as [[H. L. Mencken]] and [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. 

Hunter S. Thompson is perhaps the most obvious inspiration for the character of Spider Jerusalem, and the fictional reporter's fondness for weaponry and spectacular [[Recreational drug use|consumption]] of drugs both indicate a resemblance toward the American gonzo journalist. (In Transmetropolitan #13, page 5, a book by Thompson is clearly visible amongst the objects strewn across the table in Spider's apartment. A book entitled "FEAR AND LOATHING" is also visible in Issue #1, Page 1, Panel 3, in the lower left-hand corner of the panel.)

Visually, Spider Jerusalem is based on Darick Robertson's friend Andre Ricciardi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Robertson|first=Darick|interviewer=Jaime Kiffel|title=An Interview with Darick Robertson|url=http://www.lollipop.com/article.php3?content=issue59/darickrobertson.html|access-date=8 July 2015|quote=K: I read that your friends sometimes appear as the models for characters in Transmetropolitan. For instance, your friend André Ricciardi was the model for Spider... R: André is still a close friend. When it came time to do Spider, he was so much like Spider in his own right... Spider ended up being older and kind of growing into his own character by himself, but André is definitely the basis for it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Planetary''==
One of Ellis' other titles, ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'', features a character in its seventh issue named Jack Carter, who is a thinly-veiled pastiche of [[John Constantine]], being essentially identical in appearance, role, abilities and diction. The issue is essentially a retrospective commentary on the genre of grim, British-penned comics of the anti-[[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcherite]] 1980s milieu, of which the Carter character is positioned as the apotheosis. Having faked his own death, Carter reappears in a dramatically altered form with a shaved head and long black coat which he later opens to reveal a bare chest featuring identical tattoos to Spider Jerusalem. Lacking only the spider tattoo on the head and the trademark shades, this former Constantine-cipher has become the spitting image of Jerusalem and departs with the words: "The Eighties are long over. Time to Move on. Time to be someone else."

==Reception==
''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine ranked Spider Jerusalem as the 38th greatest comic book character of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 | title=Wizard's top 200 characters.

Knut '''Stefan Anderson''' (born December 26, 1878, [[Enköping]], [[Sweden]], died May 8, 1966, [[Ludvika]]) was a Swedish industrialist, journalist and [[master craftsman]] watchmaker decorated with badges of [[chivalric order]]s by the Kings of Sweden, Denmark and Norway and the President of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;''Vem är vem Svealand'' (Stockholm), 1964&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of August T. Anderson and Hildegard von Reis and began to learn watchmaking in 1892 at age 13 in [[Norrköping]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mitt långa liv har lart mig'' essays by [[Prince Oscar Bernadotte]], [[Sven Hedin]], [[Anna Branting]] &amp; 30 others; [[Nordisk rotogravyr]], [[Stockholm]], 1949 (Swedish 302 p.) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1910 to 1953 he wrote regular articles in [[trade paper]]s and was also their editor,&lt;ref name="Lars"&gt;Lars Magnus Jansson in ''Mästares verk, Sveriges Urmakareförbund 100 år'' [[LIBRIS]]-ID:3311604 pp. 29 &amp; 39 (long-term executive positions), pp. 31, 39 &amp; 48 (trade papers), pp. 39, 48 &amp; 66 (school's name), p. 39 (quality label &amp; medal)&lt;/ref&gt; often using the [[pseudonym]] '''''Stander'''''.&lt;ref&gt;''Svensk Urmakeri-Tidning'' December 1913 [[LIBRIS]]-ID:711856&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson was instrumental in organizing watchmakers and [[Artisan|craftsmen]] into permanent trade organizations in Scandinavia and Germany, which he then led as CEO in terms of service lasting for decades.&lt;ref name="Lars" /&gt; He is considered by some the most important industrial organizer in his field in the history of his country&lt;ref&gt;''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', May 9, 1966 p. 24 &amp; ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', May 9, 1966 p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1971 had a watchmaker's college named for him in [[Borensberg]].&lt;ref name="Lars" /&gt;

[[Ludvika Town Hall]] has a clock designed and installed by Anderson in its tower since the building was dedicated in 1938 (mechanism replaced in 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Gunnarsson in ''[[Cyrillus Johansson]], stadsarkitekt i Ludvika 1931-1941'' [[Ludvika]] kommun 2010 [[LIBRIS]]-ID:12100490 pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known quality classification ''Stjärnurmakarna'' for Swedish watchmakers and merchants was originally registered and protected by Anderson, who also in 1944 created a specially designed insurance policy for them, and since 1952 a Swedish gold medal for contributions to watchmaking bears Anderson's likeness and name.&lt;ref name="Lars" /&gt;

Anderson married Ragnhild Sandberg of Ludvika in 1907. Of their five children one son was Swedish senator Stig Stefanson, a daughter was singer [[Birgit Ridderstedt]] and a grandson is photographer [[Mattias Klum]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nya Ludvika Tidning]]'' 2001-05-08 p 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Hunziker''' (1899–1974) was a Swiss professor who founded the Tourism Research Institute at the [[University of St. Gallen]], co-developed the scientific study of [[tourism]], developed the travel savings fund concept, co-founded the Association Internationale d'Experts Scientifiques du Tourisme (AIEST) and the [[Glion Institute of Higher Education|Institut International de Glion]].

In 1917, he completed a two-year primary commercial school (''Handelsschule'') in Zurich before receiving a Doctorate in Economic Sciences from the University of Zurich in 1923.&lt;ref name="matrikel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elitesuisses" /&gt;  His doctoral thesis was on the Swiss cotton industry, 1914-1919.  Hunziker was first employed by Swiss Natural Gas (''Schweizerischen Gaswerke'') and the [[Union Bank of Switzerland#1945.E2.80.931979|Eidgenössische Bank]], before becoming the business editor and subsequently business and publishing director of the [[Berner Zeitung|Berner Tagblatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schumacher |first1=Beatrice |year=2002 |title=Ferien: Interpretationen und Popularisierung eines Bedürfnisses : Schweiz 1890-1950 | trans-title=Holiday: interpretations and popularization of a need : Switzerland 1890-1950 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BLilhVTaR0C&amp;pg=PA295 |series= |language=DE |volume= |issue= |others= |edition= |location= |publisher=Böhlau Verlag Wien |publication-date= |page=295 |pages= |at= |isbn=9783205994114 |access-date= |via= |quote=(Google Translate) Citizens of Mooslerau AG; Education:.

Hunziker's scientific work and commitment is closely linked to that of Kurt Krapf. As a companion and friend called, but of highly-alone profile, he is likely to have a decisive impact on the scientific profiling Hunziker.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science of tourism==
In March 1936, Hunziker was hired to be secretary of the Swiss Tourist Association and, on 23 Oct 1937, appointed its director. In 1941, Hunziker initiated graduate studies in tourism at the University of St. Gallen.  Hunziker founded a Tourism Research Institute at the University of St. Gallen in conjunction with that founded by Kurt Krapf at the University of Berne.  The Institute is now known as the Institut für Öffentliche Dienstleistungen und Tourismus (Institute for Public Service and Tourism).  In 1942, Hunziker collaborated with Krapf (director of the Bern Research Institute of Tourism) to publish the "Outline of the General Teaching of Tourism" (''Grundriss der Allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre''), which became the standard work for basic research in tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sørensen |first=F. |title=Tourism Experience Innovation Networks, Tourism Experience Innovations and the Role of Geographically Organised Production and Information Innovation Networks |url=http://www.ruc.dk/upload/application/pdf/f51d6748/CSS_Rapport_4.pdf |year=2004 |publisher=Roskilde University |location= |quote=[W]hile the first serious scientific textbook on tourism was published in 1942 [Hunziker 1942]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

(eds.): The Sociology of Tourism, Bingeley: Emerald, pp. 70ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of this text, Hunziker and Krapf developed one of the first broadly accepted definitions of "tourism" (''Fremdenverkehr''), roughly translated as "Tourism is the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, in so far as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Stephen |title=Tourism: The nature and structure of tourism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DP9y1uOzYecC&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=31 Dec 2010 |volume=1 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge (Taylor &amp; Francis) |location=London |isbn=0-415-24373-4 |pages=50–51 |quote=Walter Hunziker and Kurt Krapf, in their general theory of tourism published in 1942, attempted to distil the essence of tourism as both a human and economic activity.  * * * They defined the subject of tourism as: 'the totality of relationships and phenomena linked with the stay of foreigners in a locality provided they do not exercise a major, permanent or temporary remunerated activity.' * * *  The work of Hunziker and Krapf is the base upon which several later definitions were built.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vanhove |first1=Norbert |title=The economics of tourism destinations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVXcXZOhPDoC&amp;pg=PA2 |accessdate=31 Dec 2010 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2005 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |location= |language= |isbn=9780750666374 |page=2 |quote=One of the oldest conceptual definitions of tourism was given by two pioneers of tourism research, Hunziker and Krapf (1942), who defined tourism as 'being a sum of relations and phenomena resulting from travel and stay of non residents, in so far a stay does not lead to permanent residence and is not connected with any permanent or temporary earning activity'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the earliest recognized definition of tourism was provided by the Austrian economist Hermann von Schullard in 1910, who defined it as, "sum total of operators, mainly of an economic nature, which directly relate to the entry, stay and movement of foreigners inside and outside a certain country, city or a region."&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later Hunziker published a book on the system of "scientific tourism research" (''System und Hauptprobleme einer wissenschaftlichen Fremdenverkehrslehre'') in which he tried to establish a "completely new discipline" as a branch of sociology; however, the attempt failed.&lt;ref&gt;Spode op.cit., pp.71ff.&lt;/ref&gt; But Hunziker and Krapf continued to examine tourism not only from an economic perspective, but also from a sociological one.  Hunziker did not want tourism to have a negative impact on the cultural values of either the destination or the tourist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Effects of Tourism on Socio-Cultural Values |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000162/016236EB.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=31 Dec 2010 |date=18 Dec 1975 |publisher=UNESCO |location=Paris |quote=We have seen that tourism has a critical impact on the social structures that characterize the traditional economies, and that it tends to replace, rather than boost, those economies.  We have also considered the question of whether or not tourism is going to borrow from the old values in order to avoid causing excessive upheavals.  In this aspect sociological and economic thought show the greatest weakness, which is paradoxical since in one of their earliest works, Hunziker and Krapf [Grudriss der Allgemeinen Frefdenverkehrslehre (Outline of the general theory of tourism), Zürich, 1942], regarded as the founders of the science of tourism, states that 'without culture, there is no tourism'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharpley |first1=Richard |last2=Telfer |first2=David J. |title=Tourism and development: concepts and issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wvo1sIjZH3UC&amp;pg=PA89 |accessdate= |year=2002 |publisher=Channel View Publications |location= |language= |isbn=9781873150344 |pages=89–90 |quote=Sixty years ago, Hunziker and Krapf (1942) showed that tourism has an influence on national economies.  They demonstrated that, depending on the inwards or outwards direction of tourist flows, tourism can have both a positive and negative impact upon the quantity of national income.  Consequently, tourism first brings about the redistribution of national income, dividing the world into tourist-generating and receiving countries, regions and destinations.  Second, it also leads to the redistribution of income between sectors and companies within the economy, the latter resulting from the fact that tourism consumption differs from personal consumption.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Przeclawski |first1=Krzysztof |editor1-first=Douglas G. |editor1-last=Pearce  |others=Richard Warren Butler |title=Tourism research: critiques and challenges |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 |accessdate= |year=1993 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=London |isbn=9780415083195 |page=9 |chapter=Tourism as the subject of interdisciplinary research |quote=According to Hunziker, in what is regarded now as one of the classic definitions: 'Tourism is the sum of the relations and phenomena which result from travelling and visiting an area by non-residents providing that it does not entail resettlement or paid work.' [Hunziker, W. (1951) Le Tourisme Social, Berne: Alliance Internationale du Tourisme]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, Dr. Hunziker defined the essential elements of tourism science as: 
* understanding the nature of tourism;
* defining and explaining the various terms and concepts associated with tourism;
* developing tourism pedagogy that is practical and not just theoretical; and,
* addressing problems related to economic policy and business management.

Hunziker was an early advocate of the need to apply interdisciplinary scientific analysis to understand the highly diverse nature of tourism, develop a coherent tourism pedagogy, and use that analytical framework and training to resolve problems associated with business management and economic policy.  Although Hunziker was an economist by training, he rejected the earlier view of tourism research as a subset solely of economics.  Instead, Hunziker viewed tourism more as a cultural phenomenon.  As such, he expanded tourism research to integrate aspects of sociology, psychology, history, geography, marketing and law as well as an understanding of how medicine and technology impacts tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dwyer |first1=Larry |title=The Discovery of Tourism Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzn9RFs9vK0C&amp;pg=PA118 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |series=Tourism Social Science |volume=16 |year=2011 |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |isbn=9780857246820 |pages=118–119 |quote=When I entered tourism research, I read the pioneering tourism work by Hunziker and Krapf (1942), ''The Outline of General Tourism Science''.  This book was an attempt by Swiss scholars to develop a general theory of tourism. The work was economic based and significantly influenced the tourism economics doctrine in Slovenia. It became clear to me that tourism cannot be perceived by economic instrumentation only and that tourism is not a single discipline or theory, but a multidisciplinary platform of knowledge.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social tourism===
In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism (Austria), Dr. Hunziker proposed the following definition: “Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goeldner |first1=Charles R. |last2=Ritchie |first2=J.

[Citing Hunziker W., (1958), Comments on the finance and investments in social tourism. Tourism Progress, Nr.1.]  This opinion was supported by L. Minnaert, R. Maitland ir G. Miller (2006), who stated that social tourism is a tourism with additional moral value, main task of which is to bring mutual benefit both to service provider and service receiver in tourism services' exchange.

(1951) ''Social Tourism: Its Nature and Problems''. Geneva: International Tourists Alliance Scientific Commission]. In 1957, he added a comment regarding the nature of social tourism and defined the concept as 'a particular type of tourism characterised by the participation of people with a low income, providing them with special services, recognised as such' [Hunzicker, W. (1957). Cio che rimarrebe ancora da dire sul turismo sociale, ''Revue de tourisme'' 2, pp. 52-57)].}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons (rather than looking solely at economics), Dr. Hunziker opined that governments should support and encourage social tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunziker |first=Walter |year=1961 |title=Die menschlichen beziehungen in der touristischen Entwicklungshilfe |trans-title=Human relations in tourism development aid |journal=Tourism Review |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=89–99 |publisher=MCB UP Ltd |language=German |issn= |doi=10.1108/eb059872 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reka ===
As a pragmatic implementation of social tourism, Walter Hunziker co-developed the concept of the Swiss travel savings fund (''Schweizerische Reisekasse'' or Reka), which helps low income families enjoy vacations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reka.ch/en/reka/facts%20and%20figures/history/Pages/default.aspx REKA] "The Chairman and Director of the Swiss Tourism Federation, Dr Fritz Ehrensperger and Dr  Walter Hunziker, came up with the notion together with the Chairman of the Swiss Trade Union Federation, Robert Bratschi, of creating a travel savings fund."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunziker |first=Walter |year=1969 |title=Dreissig Jahre Schweizer Reisekasse |trans-title=Thirty years of Swiss Travel Fund |journal=Tourism Review |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=56–59 |publisher=MCB UP Ltd |language=German |issn=1660-5373 |doi=10.1108/eb059958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunziker was president of REKA, 1939-1974.

In 1951, Drs. Hunziker and Krapf founded the Association Internationale d'Experts Scientifiques du Tourisme (AIEST) in order to re-connect tourism researchers after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126143828/http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|archive-date=2011-11-26|title=International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism (AIEST) |publisher=Hospitality Net BV |location=Maastricht, The Netherlands |url=http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html |quote=AIEST owes its origin to the initiative of the Heads of the two Swiss Tourism Research Institutes founded at the Universities of St.Gallen and Berne in 1941, Walter Hunziker and Kurt Krapf.

From the start, the annual meetings (congresses) of the Association and the theoretical works it published became the foundation for scientific insights into world tourism. The above-mentioned authors did not stop working together, but worked independently as well. As a result, Kurt Krapf (1953) wrote a widely quoted work ''Die touristische Konsum: Ein Beitrag zur Lehre von der Konsumption'', and Walter Hunziker (1959) wrote a comprehensive work ''Betriebswirtschaftslehre des Fremdenverkehrs, and a number of shorter articles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Hunziker and Frédéric Tissot co-founded the [[Glion Institute of Higher Education|Institut International de Glion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=February 2012 | title =Academic Catalog, 2012-2014 | publisher=Glion Institute of Higher Education | place=Clarens, Switzerland | url=http://www.glion.edu/glion_education/en/en-en/file.cfm/document/Glion_academic_catalog_2009-10.pdf?contentid=680 | format=PDF | quote =Two pioneers of the Swiss tourism industry, Walter Hunziker and Frédéric Tissot, materialized their vision and opened “Glion” in the early 60’s.

To this end it is in charge of coordinating the tourist activities of its members, as well as informing them on all matters concerning social tourism, as much on the cultural aspects as on the economic and social consequences."  Further, OITS continues to promote Dr. Hunziker's interest in "access to leisure, holidays and tourism for the greatest number of people - youth, families, seniors and disabled people" and "fair and sustainable tourism, ensuring profit for the host populations and respecting the natural and cultural heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bits-int.org/en/index.php?menu=44 |title=What is the OITS? |publisher=OITS |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wappinger''' were an [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]]-speaking tribe from [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Connecticut]]. They lived on the east bank of the [[Hudson River]] eastward to the [[Connecticut River]] Valley.{{sfn|Sebeok|1977|p=380}}

In the 17th century, they were primarily based in what is now [[Dutchess County, New York]], and their territory included the east bank of the Hudson along both [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties all the way to [[Manhattan Island]]&lt;ref&gt;Boesch, Eugene, J., [http://www.mahopaclibrary.org/mplex/localhistory.htm Native Americans of Putnam County]&lt;/ref&gt; to the south, the [[Mahican]] territory bounded by the [[Roeliff-Jansen Kill]] to the north,&lt;ref name=proceedings/&gt; and extended east into parts of [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=americana&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Americana|year=1920|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
They were most closely related to the [[Lenape]], both being members of the [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]]-speaking subgroup of the [[Algonquian peoples]]. The Lenape and Wappinger spoke using very similar [[Delaware languages|Delawarean]] language. They are close enough that a Wappinger speaking in the [[Munsee language|Munsee Delaware]] tongue and a Lenape would mostly understand each other.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Their nearest allies were the Mahicans to the north, the [[Montaukett]]s to the south, and the remaining New England tribes to the east.  Like the Lenape, the Wappinger were not organized into cohesive tribes for most of their history; instead, they formed approximately 18 loosely associated bands.&lt;ref name=trelease&gt;

==European relations==
The first contact with Europeans came in 1609, during [[Henry Hudson|Henry Hudson's]] expedition.{{sfn|Swanton|1952|p=47}}

The total population of the Wappinger Confederacy has been estimated at about 13,200 individuals at the beginning of European contact.&lt;ref&gt;Cook 1976:74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boesch&gt;Eugene J. Boesch, Native Americans of Putnam County&lt;/ref&gt; Their settlements included camps along the major rivers with larger villages located at the river mouths.&lt;ref&gt;MacCracken 1956:266&lt;/ref&gt; Despite references to villages and other site types by early European explorers and settlers, few Contact period sites have been identified in southeastern New York (Funk 1976).&lt;ref name=Boesch/&gt;

Robert Juet, an officer on the "Half Moon", provides an account in his journal of some of the lower Hudson Valley Native Americans. In his entries for September 4 and 5, 1609, he states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This day the people of the country came aboord of us, seeming very glad of our comming, and brought greene tobacco, and gave us of it for knives and beads. They goe in deere skins loose, well dressed. They have yellow copper. They desire cloathes, and are very civill. 
They have great store of maize or Indian wheate whereof they make good bread. The country is full of great and tall oakes. 
This day [September 5, 1609] many of the people came aboord, some in mantles of feathers, and some in skinnes of divers sorts of good furres. Some women also came to us with hempe. They had red copper tabacco pipes and other things of copper they did wear about their neckes. At night they went on land againe, so wee rode very quite, but durst not trust them" (Juet 1959:28).&lt;ref name=Boesch/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Pietersz. de Vries|David Pieterz De Vries]] recorded another description of the Wappinger who resided around Fort Amsterdam:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Indians about here are tolerably stout, have black hair with a long, lock which they let hang on one side of the head. Their hair is shorn on the top of the head like a cock's comb. Their clothing is a coat of beaver skins over the body, with the fur inside in winter and outside in summer; they have, also, sometimes a bear's hide, or a coat of the skins of wild cats, or hefspanen [probably raccoon], which is an animal most as hairy as a wild cat, and is also very good to eat. They also wear coats of turkey feathers, which they know how to put together.
Their pride is to paint their faces strangely with red or black lead, so that they look like fiends. Some of the women are very well featured, having long countenances. Their hair hangs loose from their head; they are very foul and dirty; they sometimes paint their faces, and draw a black ring around their eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyle|first1=David|title=Short Historical and Journale Notes by David Pietersz, De Vries, 1665|journal=Annual Archæological Report|date=1896|volume=1894–95|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKJFAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22David%20Pietersz%2C%20De%20Vries%2C%201665%22&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=%22David%20Pietersz,%20De%20Vries,%201665%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Warwick Bros. &amp; Rutter|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the Dutch began to settle in the area, they pressured the Connecticut Wappinger to sell their lands and seek refuge with other Algonquian-speaking tribes.  The western bands, however, stood their ground amidst rising tensions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635515/Wappinger |title=Wappinger |year=2010 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Kieft's War]] in 1643, the remaining Wappinger bands united against the Dutch, attacking settlements throughout [[New Netherland]]. Allied with their trading partners, the powerful [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], the Dutch defeated the Wappinger by 1645.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Profiles in Folly]]|author=Axelrod, Alan|pages=229–236|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2008|isbn=1-4027-4768-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mohawk and Dutch killed more than 1500 Wappinger in the two years of the war. This was a devastating toll for the Wappinger, whose population in 1600 was estimated at 3,000.&lt;ref name=trelease/&gt;

The Wappinger faced the Dutch again in the 1655 [[Peach Tree War]], a three-day engagement which left an estimated 100 settlers and 60 Wappinger dead, and strained relations further between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Restless City: A Short History of New York from Colonial Times to the Present|author=Reitano, Joanne R.|isbn=0-415-97849-1|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, the confederation broke apart, and many of the surviving Wappinger left their native lands for the protection of neighboring tribes.

In 1765, the remaining Wappinger in Dutchess County sued the [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse family]] for control of the land but lost.  In the aftermath the Philipses raised rents on European-American [[tenant farmer]]s, sparking riots across the region.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1766 [[Daniel Nimham]], [[sachem]] from [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]], was part of a delegation that traveled to [[London]] to petition the Crown for land rights and better treatment by the [[colonists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transatlantic Encounters: American Indians in Britain, 1500-1776|author=Vaughan, Alden|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=8-4s2aXr8oQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Transatlantic%20Encounters%3A%20American%20Indians%20in%20Britain&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Transatlantic%20Encounters:%20American%20Indians%20in%20Britain&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-86594-8|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nimham and some forty braves fell in the Battle of Kingsbridge fighting against the British on August 30, 1778. It proved an irrecoverable blow to the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Historical and Genealogical Record Dutchess and Putnam Counties New York, Press of the A. V. Haight Co., Poughkeepsie, New York, 1912; pp. 62-79 [http://genealogytrails.com/ny/dutchess/history/chapter3.html] "In this fray the power of the tribe was forever broken. More than forty of the Indians were killed or desperately wounded."&lt;/ref&gt;

From that time the Wappingers ceased to have a name in history. A few scattered remnants still remained, and as late as 1811, a small band had their dwelling place on a low tract of land by the side of a brook, under a high hill, in the northern part of the town of Kent."

Many Wappinger served in the [[Stockbridge Militia]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Following the war, most of the surviving Wappinger moved west to join the Algonquian [[Stockbridge-Munsee]] tribe in [[Ohio]].  Later they were removed to [[Wisconsin]].  Today, members of the federally recognized [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community|Stockbridge-Munsee Nation]] reside mostly in [[Wisconsin]].

==Decline==
Following their service on behalf of the American cause in the Revolution, loss of their leader [[Daniel Nimham]], and subsequent irrecoverable loss of their land, the tribe became scattered. A very few were still found in [[Kent, New York|Kent]] as late as 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Historical and Genealogical Record Dutchess and Putnam Counties New York, Press of the A. V. Haight Co., Poughkeepsie, New York, 1912; pp. 62-79 [http://genealogytrails.com/ny/dutchess/history/chapter3.html] "From that time the Wappingers ceased to have a name in history.

===Etymology===
The origins of the name ''Wappinger'' is debated. While the present-day spelling appeared as early as 1643,&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; countless alternate phonetic spellings were also used by early European settlers well into the late 19th century. Anthropologist [[Ives Goddard]] suggests the [[Munsee language]]-word ''wápinkw'', meaning "[[opossum]]", might be related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Pritchard | first=Evan T.| title = Native New Yorkers, the legacy of the Algonquin people of New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c5hky9f5PgoC&amp;dq=isbn+9781571781079&amp;q=moo-wha-pink-us#v=onepage&amp;q=moo-wha-pink-us&amp;f=false | accessdate = November 1, 2010 | date=April 12, 2002 | publisher = Council Oaks Distribution |isbn = 978-1-57178-107-9 | pages = 28}}

&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Reed Swanton]] in 1952.{{sfn|Swanton|1952|p=48}}

Others suggest that Wappinger is anglicized from the Dutch word ''wapendragers'', meaning "weapon-bearers", alluding to the warring relationship between the Dutch and the Wappinger.&lt;ref name=proceedings/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Abbotts to Zurich: New York State Placenames|author=Vasiliev, Ren|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8156-0798-9|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bands==
While a Wappinger Confederacy was proposed by Edward Manning Ruttenber in 1872 and [[James Mooney]] in 1910, [[Ives Goddard]] contests their view and writes that no evidence supports this idea.{{sfn|Goddard|1978|p=238}}

==Morse's contentions==
&lt;!-- [[File:Map-Novi_Belgii_Nov%C3%A6que_Angli%C3%A6_%28Amsterdam,_1685%29.jpg|thumb|''Novi Belgii Novæque Angliæ (Amsterdam, 1685)'' (New Netherland and New England, and also parts of Virginia, a 1685 reprint of a 1656 map by Nicolaes Visscher)]] Relocated in excerpt.  No indication of "Woarani" or "Towakoni" on original. --&gt;

The following content comes from: ''Freemasonry in the American Revolution'', Sidney Morse, 1924, and contains numerous contentions, including the introduction of Brazilian Amazonian Indians into the Hudson Valley:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The 1685 Dutch map of New Netherland places the Wappani tribe as one of many family tribes of the Tawakoni (Taconic) that lived in the Fishkill highlands.

The Towakoni tribe of which the Wappani belonged was a larger family of the Lenape. The [[Guaraní people|Woarani]]&lt;!-- Previous editor believed the author was confused with similarly named [[Huaorani people]] of Ecuador, who were not enslaved and transported elsewhere by Dutch pirates the way the Guaraní people of today's Paraguay, who once ranged as far north into today's Brazil as Rio&amp;ndash;see comments below --&gt; family held the highlands of Pawling NY, and Nochpeem held the highlands of Kent NY, just below the Wappani highlands of Fishkill (See: Map of Nava Belgii Nieuw)

In 1805, 200 years after the stated 3000 person population General Clinton and Sullivan of the British forces destroyed 40 Indian Towns, their crops, fruit trees, and burned over 100,000 bushels of corn from Elmira to Genesse valley New York. This places the Indian Population well above 3000 considering the work force to maintain 40 stationary farming towns, and the various fields that supplied the vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Freemasonry in the American Revolution |first1=Sidney |last1=Morse |year=1924 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wappani as one small band of the Towakani of Southern NY, NJ and PA. may have had 3000 members living upon one mountain top region of Fishkill, however The Towakani tribe had Family tribes upon every mountain throughout the region which is completely over looked. Further the Towakani adopted their Woarani neighbors who were [[Guaraní_people#Slavery|relocated by the Dutch Privateer sailors]] into Pawling to run the iron furnaces. The Woarani (pronounced Gwuarani ) &lt;!-- [[Guaraní people]]; see comment above--&gt; originated in the Brazil/Paraguay region of South America. The Towakoni tribe of the Lenape was known for teaching healers or medicine through spirituality.

Putnam County New York is known as the Stone chamber capital of the world and boasts over 300 known and intact stone chambers, massive effigies and man made lakes of the once vibrant Towakani tribes.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">'''Xuejia Lai''' ({{zh|s=来学嘉 |t=來學嘉 |p=Lái Xuéjiā}}) is a cryptographer, currently a professor at [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]. His notable work includes the design of the [[block cipher]] [[International Data Encryption Algorithm|IDEA]], the theory of [[Markov cipher]]s, and the [[cryptanalysis]] of a number of [[cryptographic hash function]]s. His book ''On the Design and Security of Block Ciphers'' ({{ISBN|978-3891915738}}) is frequently cited in cryptography papers.

Lai received a [[B.Sc.]] in [[electrical engineering]] in 1982 and an [[M.Sc.]] in [[mathematics]] in 1984 at [[Xidian University]] (then known as ''Northwest Institute of Telecommunication Engineering''). About 1982 he met [[James Massey]], who was visiting the university to give lectures in cryptography. Lai served as interpreter for these lectures. He later became one of Massey's doctoral students at [[ETH Zurich]], where he received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1992. Together they designed the IDEA cipher.

&lt;/ref&gt;is best known for inventing the [[IMI Galil|Galil]] [[assault rifle]]. He also helped create the [[Uzi]] [[submachine gun]]. He was known in the military by the nickname 'Father of the Rifle'.

==Early life==
Born in Israel on October 26, 1923, Galili served in the British Army in [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following his discharge, he volunteered to work with the [[Haganah]] in weapons manufacture.

==Galil rifle==

During the Six-Day War in 1967, the Israelis captured many [[AK-47]] assault rifles from the Egyptian soldiers which proved more reliable and useful in the arid conditions against the [[FN FAL]]. Inspired by the AK-47, the IDF assessed it thoroughly and began the process of designing a new automatic rifle for which the task was assigned to two groups: one led by [[Uziel Gal]], the designer of the famous [[Uzi submachine gun]], &amp; Yisrael Galili (Balashnikov) together with [[Yakov Lior]] invented the [[IMI Galil|Galil assault rifle]] which named for him. Tests were conducted from the end of the 1960s to the early 1970s led to Galili's rifle emerging as the winner, as a result Galil was adopted by the military. The Galil assault rifle heavily derives most of the features from Kalashnikov AK-47. In 1973, he received the [[Israel Defense Prize]] for this achievement.
