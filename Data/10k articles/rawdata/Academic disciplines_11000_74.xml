&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:air_source_heat_pump_principle.jpg|200px|thumb|A visual representation of the air source heat pump principle|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 23 January 2008|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

An '''air source [[heat pump]]''' (ASHP) is a system which transfers heat from outside to inside a building, or vice versa. Under the principles of [[vapor compression refrigeration]], an ASHP uses a [[refrigerant]] system involving a compressor and a condenser to absorb heat at one place and release it at another. They can be used as a space heater or cooler, and are sometimes called "reverse-cycle air conditioners".

In domestic heating use, an ASHP absorbs heat from outside air and releases it inside the building, as hot air, hot water-filled radiators, underfloor heating and/or domestic hot water supply. The same system can often do the reverse in summer, cooling the inside of the house. When correctly specified, an ASHP can offer a full central heating solution and domestic hot water up to 80&amp;nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Description==
[[Air]] at any temperature above [[absolute zero]] contains some energy. An air-source heat pump transfers ('pumps') some of this energy as heat from one place to another, for example between the outside and inside of a building. This can provide space heating and/or hot water. A single system can be designed to transfer heat in either direction, to heat or cool the interior of the building in winter and summer respectively. For simplicity, the description below focuses on use for interior heating.

The technology is similar to a refrigerator or freezer or air conditioning unit: the different effect is due to the physical location of the different system components. Just as the pipes on the back of a refrigerator become warm as the interior cools, so an ASHP warms the inside of a building whilst cooling the outside air.

The main components of an air-source heat pump are:
* An outdoor heat exchanger coil, which extracts heat from ambient air
* An indoor heat exchanger coil, which transfers the heat into hot air ducts, an indoor heating system such as water-filled radiators or  underfloor circuits and/or a domestic hot water tank

Air source heat pumps can provide fairly low cost space heating. A high efficiency heat pump can provide up to four times as much heat as an electric heater using the same energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homebuilding.co.uk/2012/05/09/heat-pumps-the-real-cost/ Heat Pumps: The Real Cost]&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison to gas as a primary heat source, however, the lifetime cost of an air source heat pump may be affected by the price of electricity compared to gas (where available). Use of gas may be associated with higher carbon emissions, depending upon how the electricity is generated.

A "standard" domestic air source heat pump can extract useful heat down to about {{convert|-15|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air source heat pumps / Choosing a renewable technology |url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generating-energy/Choosing-a-renewable-technology/Air-source-heat-pumps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}--&gt; At colder outdoor temperatures the heat pump is less efficient; it could be switched off and the premises heated using only supplemental heat (or emergency heat) if the supplemental heating system is large enough. There are specially designed heat pumps that, while giving up some performance in cooling mode, will provide useful heat extraction to even lower outdoor temperatures.

==In cold climates==
An air source heat pump designed specifically for very cold climates can extract useful heat from ambient air as cold −30&amp;nbsp;°C (−22&amp;nbsp;°F). Manufacturers include Mitsubishi and Fujitsu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Air Source Heat Pumps A Threat To Geothermal Heat Pump Suppliers?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2014/01/15/are-air-source-heat-pumps-a-threat-to-geothermal-heat-pump-suppliers/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Mitsubishi model provides heat at −35&amp;nbsp;°C, but the [[Coefficient of performance]] (COP) drops to 0.9, indicating that resistance heating would be more efficient at that temperature. At −30&amp;nbsp;°C, the COP is 1.1, according to the manufacturer's data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitsubishi ZUBA Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps |url=http://encore-geothermal.ca/sustainable-solutions/air-source-heat-pumps/ |publisher=Encore Heating and Cooling, Kanata, Ontario |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021195035/http://encore-geothermal.ca/sustainable-solutions/air-source-heat-pumps/ |archivedate=21 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the manufacturer's marketing literature also claims a minimum COP of 1.4 and performance to −30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zuba-Central|url=http://www.mitsubishielectric.ca/en/hvac/PDF/zuba-central/Zuba-Central_Catalogue.pdf|publisher=Mitsubishi Electric|accessdate=15 October 2014|page=5|quote=Zuba-Central’s COP ranges from 1.4 to 3.19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731072149/http://mitsubishielectric.ca/en/hvac/PDF/zuba-central/Zuba-Central_Catalogue.pdf|archivedate=31 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although air source heat pumps are less efficient than well-installed [[ground source heat pump]]s in cold conditions, air source heat pumps have lower initial costs and may be the most economic or practical choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Air Source Heat Pumps A Threat To Geothermal Heat Pump Suppliers?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2014/01/15/are-air-source-heat-pumps-a-threat-to-geothermal-heat-pump-suppliers/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Natural Resources Canada]] found that cold climate air source heat pumps (CC-ASHPs) do work in Canadian winters, based on testing in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] in late December 2012 to early January 2013 using a ducted CC-ASHP. (The report does not explicitly state whether backup heat sources should be considered for temperatures below −30&amp;nbsp;°C. The record low for Ottawa is −36&amp;nbsp;°C.) The CC-ASHP provided 60% energy (though not energy cost) savings compared to natural gas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps: Results from Testing at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology |url=http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada) |ref=NRC |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020150417/http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when considering only energy efficiency in the home. When considering energy efficiency in electricity generation however, more energy would be used with the CC-ASHP, relative to natural gas heating, in provinces or territories ([[Alberta]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Northwest Territories]]) where coal-fired generation was the predominant method of electricity generation. (The energy savings in [[Saskatchewan]] were marginal. Other provinces use primarily hydroelectric and/or nuclear generation.) Despite the significant energy savings relative to gas in provinces not relying primarily on coal, the higher cost of electricity relative to natural gas (using 2012 retail prices in Ottawa, Ontario) made natural gas the less expensive energy source. (The report did not calculate the cost of operation in the province of [[Quebec]], which has lower electricity rates, nor did it show the impact of time of use electricity rates.) The study found that in Ottawa a CC-ASHP cost 124% more to operate than the natural gas system. However, in areas where natural gas is not available to homeowners, 59% energy cost savings can be realized relative to heating with fuel oil. The report noted that about 1 million residences in Canada (8%) are still heated with fuel oil. The report shows 54% energy cost savings for CC-ASHPs relative to electric baseboard resistance heating. Based on these savings, the report showed a five-year payback for converting from either fuel oil or electric baseboard resistance heating to a CC-ASHP. (The report did not specify whether that calculation considered the possible need for an electrical service upgrade in the case of converting from fuel oil. Presumably no electrical service upgrade would be needed if converting from electric resistance heat.) The report did note greater fluctuations in room temperature with the heat pump due to its defrost cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps: Results from Testing at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology |url=http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada) |ref=NRC |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020150417/http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longevity==
Air source heat pumps can last for over 20 years with low maintenance requirements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- unreliable sources: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions by Danfoss Heat Pumps|url=http://www.ecoheatpumps.co.uk/heat_pump_faq.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How air source heat pumps work from HomeTips.com|url=http://www.hometips.com/heatpumps-airsource.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; There are numerous heat pumps from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}, even in places where winters are extremely cold. Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements. However, the outdoor heat exchanger and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris. Heat pumps have more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance heater or fuel burning heater.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Ground source heat pumps have fewer moving parts than air source heat pumps as they do not need fans or defrosting mechanisms and are located indoors. The ground array for a ground source installation should last for over 100 years.

==Usage==
Air source heat pumps are used to provide interior space heating and cooling even in colder climates, and can be used efficiently for water heating in milder climates. A major advantage of some ASHPs is that the same system may be used for heating in winter and cooling in summer, though it is not true air conditioning without a facility to adjust the humidity of the inside air. Though the [[cost]] of installation is generally high, it is less than the cost of a [[Geothermal heat pump|''ground source'' heat pump]], because a ground source heat pump requires excavation to install its ground loop. The advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it has access to the thermal storage capacity of the ground which allows it to produce more heat for less electricity in cold conditions.

ASHPs are often paired with auxiliary or emergency heat systems to provide backup heat when outside temperatures are too low for the pump to work efficiently, or in the event the pump malfunctions. Since ASHPs have high capital costs, and efficiency drops as temperature decreases, it is generally not cost-effective to size a system for the coldest possible temperature scenario, even if an ASHP could meet the entire heat requirement at the coldest temperatures expected. [[Propane]], natural gas, oil or [[pellet fuel]] furnaces can provide this supplementary heat.

All-electric heat pump systems have an electric furnace or electric resistance heat, or strip heat, which typically consists of rows of electric coils that heat up. A fan blows over the heated coils and circulates warm air throughout the home. This serves as an adequate heating source, but as temperatures go down, electricity costs rise. Electrical service outages pose the same threat as to [[Forced air|central forced-air systems]] and pump-based boilers, but woodstoves and non-electric [[fireplace insert]]s can mitigate this risk. Some ASHPs can be coupled to [[solar panel]]s as primary energy source, with a conventional electric grid as backup source.

Thermal storage solutions incorporating resistance heating can be used in conjunction with ASHPs. Storage may be more cost-effective if time of use electricity rates are available. Heat is stored in high density ceramic bricks contained within a thermally-insulated enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Franklin Energy Services, LLC |title=Air Source Heat Pump Efficiency Gains from  Low Ambient Temperature Operation Using  Supplemental Electric Heating: Thermal Storage Supplemental Heating Systems |url=http://mn.gov/commerce/energy/images/CIP-AirSource-Pump-Report.pdf |publisher=Minnesota Division of Energy Resources; Minnesota Department of Commerce |accessdate=15 October 2014 |page=9 |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611123108/http://mn.gov/commerce/energy/images/CIP-AirSource-Pump-Report.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASHPs may also be paired with passive solar heating. Thermal mass (such as concrete or rocks) heated by passive solar heat can help stabilize indoor temperatures, absorbing heat during the day and releasing heat at night, when outdoor temperatures are colder and heat pump efficiency is lower.

The outdoor section on some units may 'frost up' when there is sufficient moisture in the air and outdoor temperature is  between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 5&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F to 41&amp;nbsp;°F){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. This restricts air flow across the outdoor coil. These units employ a defrost cycle where the system switches temporarily to 'cooling' mode to move heat from the home to the outdoor coil to melt the ice. This requires the supplementary heater (resistance electric or gas) to activate.  The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly, although the newer (demand) systems are more intelligent and need to defrost less.  As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air.

It is difficult to retrofit conventional heating systems that use radiators/radiant panels, hot water baseboard heaters, or even smaller diameter ducting, with ASHP-sourced heat. The lower heat pump output temperatures would mean radiators would have to be increased in size or a low temperature [[underfloor heating]] system be installed instead. Alternatively, a high temperature heat pump can be installed and existing heat emitters can be retained.

==Technology==

[[File:Refrigerator-cycle.svg|thumb|A: indoor compartment, B: outdoor compartment, I: insulation, 1: condenser, 2: expansion valve, 3: evaporator, 4: compressor]]
Heating and cooling is accomplished by pumping a [[refrigerant]] through the heat pump's indoor and outdoor coils. Like in a refrigerator, a [[gas compressor|compressor]], [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], [[expansion valve (steam engine)|expansion valve]] and [[evaporator]] are used to change states of the refrigerant between colder [[liquid]] and hotter [[gas]] states.

When the liquid refrigerant at a low [[temperature]] and low pressure passes through the outdoor heat exchanger coils, ambient heat causes the liquid to boil (change to gas or [[vapor]]): heat energy from the outside air has been absorbed and stored in the refrigerant as [[latent heat]]. The gas is then compressed using an electric pump; the compression increases the temperature of the gas.

Inside the building, the gas passes through a pressure [[valve]] into heat exchanger coils.  There, the hot refrigerant gas condenses back to a liquid and transfers the stored [[latent heat]] to the indoor air, water heating or hot water system. The indoor air or heating water is pumped across the heat exchanger by an electric pump or [[fan (mechanical)|fan]].

The cool liquid refrigerant then re-enter the outdoor heat exchanger coils to begin a new cycle.

Most heat pumps can also operate in a cooling mode where the cold refrigerant is moved through the indoor coils to cool the room air.

==Efficiency ratings==
The 'Efficiency' of air source heat pumps is measured by the [[Coefficient of performance]] (COP). A COP of 3 means the heat pump produces 3 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of electricity it consumes. Within temperature ranges of −3&amp;nbsp;°C to 10&amp;nbsp;°C, the COP for many machines is fairly stable at 3–3.5.

In very mild weather, the COP of an air source heat pump can be up to 4. However, on a cold winter day, it takes more work to move the same amount of heat indoors than on a mild day.&lt;ref&gt;Efficiency of heat pumps in changing conditions, http://www.icax.co.uk/Air_Source_Heat_Pumps.html&lt;/ref&gt; The heat pump's performance is limited by the [[Carnot cycle]] and will approach 1.0 as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases, which for most air source heat pumps happens as outdoor temperatures approach −18&amp;nbsp;°C / 0&amp;nbsp;°F. Heat pump construction that enables carbon dioxide as a refrigerant may have a COP of greater than 2 even down to −20&amp;nbsp;°C, pushing the break-even figure downward to −30&amp;nbsp;°C (−22&amp;nbsp;°F). A [[ground source heat pump]] has comparatively less of a change in COP as outdoor temperatures change, because the ground from which they extract heat has a more constant temperature than outdoor air.

The design of a heat pump has a considerable impact on its efficiency. Many air source heat pumps are designed primarily as [[air conditioning unit]]s, mainly for use in summer temperatures. Designing a heat pump specifically for the purpose of heat exchange can attain greater COP ratings and an extended life cycle. The principal changes are in the scale and type of compressor and evaporator.

Seasonally adjusted heating and cooling efficiencies are given by the [[heating seasonal performance factor]] (HSPF) and [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] (SEER) respectively.

In units charged with [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]] [[refrigerants]], the COP rating is reduced when heat pumps are used to heat domestic water to over 60&amp;nbsp;°C or to heat conventional [[central heating]] systems that use radiators to distribute heat (instead of an underfloor heating array).

==Risks and precautions==
*Conventional air source heat pumps lose their capacity as the external temperatures fall below 5 degrees Celsius (about 41 degrees Fahrenheit). CC-ASHPs (see above) may operate efficiently in temperatures as low as −30C, although they may not be as efficient in cooling during the summer season as conventional air source heat pumps. If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all.
*An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or [[pellet fuel]] furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures.

==Controversy==

Units charged with [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]] [[refrigerants]] are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, as measured in [[global warming potential]] (GWP) and [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP). Recent government mandates{{where?|date=February 2013}} have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Impact on electric utilities==

While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. Even if there is a non-electric backup system, the fact that efficiencies of ASHPs decrease with outside temperatures is a concern to electric utilities. The drop in efficiency means their electrical load increases steeply as temperatures drop. A study in Canada's [[Yukon Territory]], where [[diesel generator]]s are used for peaking capacity, noted that widespread adoption of air source heat pumps could lead to increased diesel consumption if the increased electrical demand due to ASHP use exceeds available hydroelectric capacity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Evaluation of Air Source Heat Pump Technology in Yukon|url=http://www.energy.gov.yk.ca/pdf/air_source_heat_pumps_final_may2013_v04.pdf|publisher=Government of Yukon’s Energy Solution Centre and Yukon Energy, Mines and Resources|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding those concerns, the study did conclude that ASHPs are a cost effective heating alternative for Yukon residents.
As [[wind farm]]s are increasingly used to supply electricity to the grid, the increased winter load matches well with the increased winter generation from [[wind turbine]]s and calmer days result in decreased heating load for most houses even if the air temperature is low.

'''Abu al-Wafa' al-Mubashshir ibn Fatik''' ({{lang-ar|ابو الوافاء المبشّر بن فاتك}} {{transl|ar|Abū al-Wafā’ Al-Mubaššir ibn Fātik}}) was a scholar well versed in the mathematical sciences and also wrote  on logic and medicine. He was born in [[Damascus]] but lived mainly in Egypt during the 11th century [[Fatimid]] Caliphate. He also wrote an historical chronicle of the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. However, the book he is famed for and the only one extant, ''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers|Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim]]'' ({{lang|ar|مختار الحكم ومحاسن الكلم}}), the "Selected Maxims and Aphorisms", is a collection of sayings attributed to the ancient sages (mainly Greeks) translated into Arabic.  The date of composition given by the author is 1048–1049.

==Biography==
The biographical details we have come from [[Ibn Abi Usaibia]]'s ''Uyūn ul-Anbāʾ fī Ṭabaqāt ul-Aṭibbāʾ'' ({{lang|ar|عيون الأنباء في طبقات الأطباء}}, "the History of Physicians"). According to Usaibia, Ibn Fatik was from a noble family and held the position of "[[emir]]" at the court of the [[Fatimids]] in the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. He was a passionate [[bibliophile]], acquired a great collection of books and enjoyed the company of scholars, and above all, he devoted himself to study. He trained in mathematics and astronomy under the philosopher, mathematician and astronomer [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (965-1040).  He also associated with Ibn al-Amidi and the physician, astrologer, and astronomer [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (988–1061). When he died, many heads of state attended his funeral. According to this biography, such was his wife's disaffection through want of attention, she threw most of his books into the pool at the center of the house, and so they were lost by drowning.

==Works==
{{anchor|al-Mukhtar}} ''Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim'' ({{lang|ar|مختار الحكم ومحاسن الكلم}}), the “Book of Selected Maxims and Aphorisms”, can be described as a collection of biographies of twenty-one "sages", mainly Greeks (e.g. [[Seth]], ([[Zedekiah]]),&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish translation has "Sedechias" in place of Seth here. (See ''Bocados de Oro'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermes]], [[Homer]], [[Solon]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Diogenes]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]], [[Alexander the Great]]), accompanied by the maxims and sayings attributed to them.  The biographies are largely legendary and most attributions highly dubious.

His ''al-Mukhtar'' was a great success in the centuries that followed, first in the Arab-Muslim world where it provided source material for later scholars, such as for Muhammad [[al-Shahrastani]] in his book ''Kitab al-wa-l-Milal Nihal'' and Shams [[al-Din al-Shahrazuri]] for his ''[[Nuzhat al-Arwah]]''.

==Translations==
; Spanish:
*''Los Bocados de Oro''; translated in the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile]] (1252–1284) was the earliest translation into a Western European vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;This primitive text (existing in isolation in several manuscripts) was notably integrated in the story of the journey of "Bonium of King of Persia" went to India to find wisdom and which he write down in ''Las Los Palabras Sabios Philosophers''. Text printed in Seville in 1495, in Salamanca in 1499, in Toledo in 1502 and 1510, Valencia in 1522, and in Valladolid in 1527.&lt;/ref&gt; 
; Latin:
*''Liber Philosophorum Moralium Antiquorum'' by the Italian [[John of Procida]] († 1298), friend and doctor of [[Emperor Frederick II]].  Several early Latin translations appeared as  [[florilegia]] and excerpts integrated into larger works.
; French:
*''Les Dits Moraulx des Philosophes'' by {{ill|Guillaume de Tignonville|fr}}, chamberlain to [[Charles VI of France|King Charles VI]]; [[Middle French]] from the Latin translation. Of the fifty manuscripts extant the oldest dates from 1402. The first printed editions were made in [[Bruges]] by [[Colard Mansion]] (no date, perhaps 1477), in Paris by [[Antoine Vérard]] in 1486, by [[Jean Trepperel]] in 1502, by [[Galliot du Pré]] in 1531, etc. (Nine reported editions by 1533).

'''Anthropogenic biomes''', also known as '''anthromes''' or '''human biomes''', describe the terrestrial [[biosphere]] in its contemporary, human-altered form using global ecosystem units defined by global patterns of sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems. Anthromes were first named and mapped by [[Erle Ellis]] and [[Navin Ramankutty]] in their 2008 paper, "Putting People in the Map: Anthropogenic Biomes of the World".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Anthrome maps now appear in numerous textbooks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chapin III|first1=F. Stuart|last2=Matson|first2=Pamela A|last3=Vitousek|first3=Peter M|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-9504-9|edition=Second|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441995032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the National Geographic World Atlas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Geographic Society|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|date=2014|publisher=National Geographic|isbn=978-1-4262-1354-0|edition=10th|url=http://www.natgeomaps.com/atlas-of-the-world-10th-edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthropogenic transformation of the Biosphere ==
For more than a century, the biosphere has been described in terms of global ecosystem units called [[biomes]], which are vegetation types like [[tropical rainforests]] and [[grasslands]] that are identified in relation to global [[climate]] patterns. Considering that human populations and their use of land have fundamentally altered global patterns of ecosystem form, process, and biodiversity, anthropogenic biomes provide a framework for integrating human systems with the biosphere in the [[Anthropocene]].

=== Before 1700 ===
Humans have been altering ecosystems since we have evolved.  Evidence suggests that our ancestors were burning land to clear it at one million years ago.  600,000 years ago, humans were using spears to kill horses and other large animals in Great Britain and China.  For the past tens of thousands of years, humans have greatly changed the plant and animal life around the globe, from what type of wildlife and plant life dominated to what type of ecosystems dominate.&lt;ref name="botkin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Botkin |first=Daniel B. |chapter=Chapter 10: People Have Changed the Environment Only Since the Industrial/Scientific Age. |title=25 Myths That Are Destroying the Environment: What Many Environmentalists Believe and Why They Are Wrong |publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing |date=2017 |pages=95–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Native Americans; they altered the forest, burnt land to clear it, settled in cities, disrupting forests and other ecosystems, and built monuments that required moving large amounts of earth, such as the Cahokia Monuments. &lt;ref name="botkin" /&gt; More examples are the civilizations of the ancient world; they mined large amounts of material, made roads, and especially for the Romans, when mining lead, released large amounts of Mercury and lead into the air.  They also moved large numbers of animals for entertainment, disrupting wildlife patterns.

=== Agriculture (1700–present) ===
Humans have been altering ecosystems since before [[agriculture]] first developed, and as the human population has grown and become more technologically advanced over time, the land use for agricultural purposes has increased significantly. The anthropogenic biome in the 1700s, before the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]], was made up of mostly wild, untouched land, with no human settlement disturbing the natural state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ellis, E. C. (2011). Anthropogenic transformation of the terrestrial biosphere.''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences'', ''369''(1938), 1010-1035.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this time period, most of the Earth's ice-free land consisted of wildlands and natural anthromes, and it wasn't until after the industrial revolution in the 19th century that land use for agriculture and human settlements started to increase.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ellis, E. C., Klein Goldewijk, K., Siebert, S., Lightman, D., &amp; Ramankutty, N. (2010). Anthropogenic transformation of the biomes, 1700 to 2000. ''Global Ecology and Biogeography'', ''19''(5), 589-606.&lt;/ref&gt;  With technology advancing and manufacturing processes becoming more efficient, the human population was beginning to thrive, and was subsequently requiring and using more natural resources.  By the year 2000, over half of the Earth's ice free land was transformed into rangelands, croplands, villages and dense settlements, which left less than half of the Earth's land untouched.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Anthropogenic changes between 1700 and 1800 were far smaller than those of the following centuries, and as such the rate of change has increased over time. As a result, the 20th century had the fastest rate of anthropogenic ecosystem transformation of the past 300 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Land distribution ===
As the human population steadily increased in numbers throughout history, the use of [[natural resource]]s and land began to increase, and the distribution of land used for various agricultural and settlement purposes began to change. The use of land around the world was transformed from its natural state to land used for agriculture, settlements and pastures to sustain the population and its growing needs. The distribution of land among anthromes underwent a shift away from natural anthromes and wildlands towards human-altered anthromes we are familiar with today. Now, the most populated anthromes (dense settlements and villages) account for only a small fraction of the global ice-free land.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  From the year 1700-2000, lands used for agriculture and urban settlements increased significantly, however the area occupied by rangelands increased even more rapidly, so that it became the dominant anthrome in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  As a result, the biggest global land-use change as a result of the industrial revolution, was the expansion of pastures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Human population ===
Following the industrial revolution, the human population experienced a rapid increase. The human [[population density]] in certain anthromes began to change, shifting away from rural environments to urban settlements, where the population density was much higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These changes in population density between areas shifted global patterns of anthrome emergence, and also had wide-spread effects on various ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Half of the Earth's population now lives in cities, and most people reside in urban anthromes, with some populations dwelling in smaller cities and towns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Currently, human populations are expected to grow until at least midcentury,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  and the transformation of the Earth's anthromes are expected to follow this growth.

=== Current state of the anthropogenic biosphere ===
The present state of the terrestrial biosphere is predominantly anthropogenic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More than half of the terrestrial biosphere remains unused directly for agriculture or urban settlements, and of these unused lands still remaining, less than half are wildlands. Most of Earth's unused lands are now within the agricultural and settled landscapes of semi-natural, rangeland, cropland and village anthromes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Major anthromes ===
Anthromes include dense settlements (urban and mixed settlements), villages, croplands, rangelands and semi-natural lands and have been mapped globally using two different classification systems, viewable on [[Google Maps]] and [[Google Earth]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;http://ecotope.org/anthromes/maps/&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 18 anthropogenic biomes, the most prominent of which are listed below.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Alessa, L., &amp; Chapin, F. S. (2008). Anthropogenic biomes: a key contribution to earth-system science. ''Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution'', ''23''(10), 529-531.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dense settlements ====
Dense Settlements are the second most densely populated regions in the world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They are defined as areas with a high population density, though the density can be variable.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Population density, however, never falls below 100 persons/km, even in the non-urban parts of the dense settlements, and it has been suggested that these areas consist of both the edges of major cities in underdeveloped nations, and the long standing small towns throughout [[western Europe]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most often we think of dense settlements as cities, but dense settlements can also be suburbs, towns and rural settlements with high but [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented]] populations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ellis, E. C. (2013). Sustaining biodiversity and people in the world's anthropogenic biomes. ''Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability'', ''5''(3), 368-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Croplands ====
Croplands are another major anthrome throughout the world. Croplands include most of the [[Agriculture|cultivated]] lands of the world, and also about a quarter of global tree cover.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Croplands which are locally [[Irrigation|irrigated]] have the highest human population density,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; likely due to the fact that it provides crops with a constant supply on water. This makes harvest time and crop survival more predictable. Croplands that are sustained mainly from the local rainfall are the most extensive of the populated anthromes,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; with annual precipitation near 1000&amp;nbsp;mm in certain areas of the globe. In these areas, there is sufficient water supplied by the climate to support all aspects of life without hardly any irrigation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, in dryer areas, this method of agriculture would not be as productive.

==== Rangelands ====
Rangelands are a very broad anthropogenic biome group that has been described according to three levels of population density: residential, populated and remote. The Residential rangeland anthrome has two key features: its population density is never below 10 persons per square kilometre, and a substantial portion of its area is used for pasture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Pastures in rangelands are the most dominant land cover. Bare earth is significant in this anthrome, covering nearly one third of the land for every one square kilometer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rangeland anthromes are less altered than croplands, but their alteration tends to increase with population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Domestication|Domesticated]] grazing livestock are typically adapted to [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, so the alteration of these biomes tends to be less noticeable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Forests ====
Forested anthromes are dominated by tree cover, and they have high precipitation and minimal human populations, where the population density is usually less than 3 persons/km².&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most populated forests act as [[carbon sink]]s because of the lack of human activity. Without harmful emissions being released in the forests due to human activity, the vegetation is able to utilize carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and act as a sink. Remote forests are a little different than populated forests because the majority of the vegetation in these forests have been clear-cut for human consumption.  Forests are generally cleared to sustain substantial populations of domestic livestock,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and to utilize the lumber.

==== Indoor ====
Very few biologists have studied the evolutionary processes at work in indoor environments.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Estimates of the extent of [[Residential area|residential]] and [[commercial district|commercial]] buildings range between 1.3% and 6% of global ice-free land area. This area is just as extensive as other small biomes such as flooded grass-lands and tropical [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forests.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The indoor biome is rapidly expanding, while forest anthromes are shrinking. The indoor biome of [[Manhattan]] is almost three times as large, in terms of its floor space, as is the geographical area of the island itself,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; due to the buildings rising up instead of spreading out. Thousands of species live in the indoor biome, many of them preferentially or even obligatorily. The only action that humans take to alter the evolution of the indoor biome is with cleaning practices. The field of indoor biomes will continue to change as long as our culture will change.

=== Implications of an anthropogenic biosphere ===
Humans have fundamentally altered global patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=E. C. |last2=Ramankutty |first2=N. |date=2008 |title=Putting people in the map: anthropogenic biomes of the world |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=439–447 |doi=10.1890/070062}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer possible to explain or predict ecological patterns or processes across the Earth without considering the human role.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Ellis, E. C. (2015). Ecology in an Anthropogenic Biosphere. ''Ecological Monographs''.&lt;/ref&gt; Human societies began transforming terrestrial ecology more than 50 000 years ago,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and [[evolution]]ary evidence has been presented demonstrating that the ultimate causes of human transformation of the biosphere are social and cultural, not biological, chemical, or physical.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Anthropogenic biomes offer a new way forward by acknowledging human influence on global ecosystems and moving us toward models and investigations of the terrestrial biosphere that integrate human and ecological systems.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Challenges facing biodiversity in the anthropogenic biosphere ===
==== Extinctions ====
Over the past century, anthrome extent and land use intensity increased rapidly together with growing human populations, leaving wildlands without human population or land use in less than one quarter of the terrestrial biosphere.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This massive transformation of Earth's ecosystems for human use has occurred with enhanced rates of species [[extinction]]s. Humans are directly causing species extinctions, especially of [[megafauna]], by reducing, fragmenting and transforming native habitats and by overexploiting individual species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Current rates of extinctions vary greatly by taxa, with mammals, reptiles and amphibians especially threatened; however there is growing evidence that viable populations of many, if not most native taxa, especially plants, may be sustainable within anthromes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the exception of especially vulnerable taxa, the majority of native species may be capable of maintaining viable populations in anthromes.

==== Conservation ====
Anthromes present an alternative view of the terrestrial biosphere by characterizing the [[Biodiversity|diversity]] of global ecological land cover patterns created and sustained by human population densities and land use while also incorporating their relationships with [[Life|biotic]] communities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Martin, L. J., Quinn, J. E., Ellis, E. C., Shaw, M. R., Dorning, M. A., Hallett, L. M., ... &amp; Michel, N. L. (2014). Conservation opportunities across the world's anthromes. ''Diversity and distributions'', ''20''(7), 745-755.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biome]]s and [[ecoregion]]s are limited in that they reduce human influences, and an increasing number of [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] biologists have argued that biodiversity conservation must be extended to [[habitat]]s directly shaped by humans. Within anthromes, including densely populated anthromes, humans rarely use all available land. As a result, anthromes are generally mosaics of heavily used lands and less intensively used lands.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Protected areas and [[biodiversity]] hotspots are not distributed equally across anthromes. Less populated anthromes contain a greater proportion of protected areas. While 23.4% of remote woodland anthrome is protected, only 2.3% of irrigated village anthrome is protected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is increasing evidence that suggests that biodiversity conservation can be effective in both densely and sparsely settled anthromes. Land sharing and land sparing are increasingly seen as conservation strategies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Indiana University]] '''Archives of Traditional Music''' holds over 100,000 audio and video individual recordings across over 3500 collections of field, broadcast, and commercial recordings. Its holdings are primarily focused on audiovisual recordings relating to research in the academic disciplines of [[ethnomusicology]], [[folklore]], [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], and various area studies.

==History==
The archive was initiated by [[George Herzog]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1936.  It was modeled on the [[Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv]], where Herzog had worked as an assistant to [[Erich von Hornbostel|Erich M. von Hornbostel]] from 1921–1924. Herzog brought the nascent archive to [[Indiana University]] in 1948 when he was appointed as professor in the Department of Anthropology. The archive was formally established at Indiana University in 1954 under its second director, [[George List]], as the Archives of Folk and Primitive Music.  Its present name, the Archives of Traditional Music, was adopted in 1964 when it became a division of the Folklore Institute.&lt;ref name="ATM Booklet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|date=1970|publisher=Indiana University Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|location=Bloomington, IN|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Following insights gained through the Sound Directions Project about a looming crisis in time-based media preservation, staff at the ATM pursued a collaborative strategy for saving its media holdings. In 2008, they participated in a small coalition of archivists and librarians at Indiana University that began a survey of the audio-visual materials held on the Bloomington Campus. The survey was prompted by the recognition that the university held a large amount of time-based media in danger of deterioration and playback obsolescence. This survey revealed that the Bloomington campus held more than a half-million audiovisual recordings across eighty units and that large portions of the University's holdings were at risk for loss. Following the publication of a survey report in 2009, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research funded a preservation planning document under the aegis of what was known as the Media Preservation Initiative (MPI).&lt;ref name="Media Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~libarchm/index.php/projects/media-preservation-initiative.html|title=MPI|publisher=Indiana University Archive of Traditional Music|accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the recommendations of the planning document, Indiana University President Michael McRobbie announced a 15 million dollar commitment to the preservation of audio and video recordings on the Bloomington campus.  The resulting endeavor was renamed the Media Preservation and Digitization Initiative (MDPI) which formed a partnership with Memnon Archiving Services to digitally preserve 280,000 audio and video recordings by 2020.&lt;ref name="Media Digitization and Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mdpi.iu.edu/index.php |title=MDPI|publisher=Media and Digitization and Preservation Initiative |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 12,000 films from Indiana University's Moving Image Archives and other campus collections, including the Archives of Traditional Music were added to the efforts of MDPI. As the largest holder of unique and rare audiovisual recordings at Indiana University, nearly all of the archives' 100,000 recordings will be digitized by 2020 through this initiative. MDPI was the first – and as of 2018 the only – university-based media preservation effort in the United States on this scale.

==Projects==

===Archive of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories===
The AHEYM Project has collected nearly 400 interviews related to Jewish life before, during, and after World War II. Conducted primarily in Yiddish, the interviewees come from small towns throughout Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. The current online exhibit cover daily life, foodways, Jewish life between the wars, religion, World War II and the Holocaust, and Jewish life after World War II. The archive can be explored by location, person, or subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iub.edu/~aheym/index.php|title=AHEYM - The Archives of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories - Home - Indiana University|website=www.iub.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservation and cataloging of AHEYM Project recordings was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

===Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive===
The EVIA Digital Archive is a project created to host a digital archive of ethnographic videos for educational use. The projected originated from a collaboration between Indiana University and University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eviada.webhost.iu.edu/Scripts/default.cfm|title=EVIA Digital Archive Project|publisher=Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnomusicology Multimedia===
EM publishes books and supplemental audiovisual material on [[Ethnomusicology]] in order to aid scholars in research. EM offers access to Annotation Management System (AMS), which allows authors to upload audiovisual material and link it to content in their text. EM is a joint project between Indiana   and Temple Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ethnomultimedia.org/about.html|title=About Ethnomusicology Online|website=ethnomultimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoagy Carmichael Online===
The [[Hoagy Carmichael]] Project at [[Indiana University]] was a project funded by IMLS between 1999 and 2000 to digitize and preserve the extensive collection of items related to Hoagy Carmichael that are housed at Indiana University. This early digital collection website aimed to present in its entirety the complete Carmichael collection. The collection contains sound recordings, letters, photographs, lyric sheets, correspondence, as well as personal effects.  It offers a biography and a virtual tour of the Carmichael Room located at the Archives of Traditional Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/collections/hoagy/intro/collec_over/|title=Overview of the Hoagy Carmichael Collection|website=www.dlib.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberian Collections Project===
The Liberian Collection was established in 2002. The Archives of Traditional Music is home to the audiovisual part of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.libraries.indiana.edu/africanstudies/liberia|title=Library Research Guides: African Studies Research Guide: Liberian Collections|first=Mireille|last=Djenno|website=guides.libraries.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound Directions===
The Sound Directions Project was a joint project between Indiana University’s Archives of Traditional Music and Harvard University’s Archive of World Music  and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities between 2005 and 2011. Phase 1 consisted of testing and determining the best practices and workflows for digital audio preservation. The following two phases focused on the preservation of archive holdings and on the development of software tools for media assessment and technical metadata collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/projects/sounddirections/|title=Sound Directions: Digital Audio Preservation and Access for Global Audio Heritage|website=www.dlib.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art criticism''' is the discussion or evaluation of visual art.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gemtou|first=Eleni|title=Subjectivity in Art History and Art Criticism|journal=Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities|year=2010|volume=2|issue=1|pages=2–13|url=http://rupkatha.com/V2/n1/SubjectivityinArtHistoryandArt%20Criticism.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art critics]] usually criticise art in the context of [[aesthetics]] or the theory of beauty.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marty.  [http://www.jewishjournal.com/marty_kaplan/article/the_curious_case_of_criticism "The curious case of criticism."] ''Jewish Journal''.  23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of [[Art movement|artistic movements]] has resulted in a division of art criticism into different disciplines which may each use different criteria for their judgements.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; The most common division in the field of criticism is between historical criticism and evaluation, a form of art history, and contemporary criticism of work by living artists.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;

Despite perceptions that art criticism is a much lower risk activity than making art, opinions of current art are always liable to drastic corrections with the passage of time.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Critics of the past are often ridiculed for either favouring artists now derided (like the [[Academic art|academic painters]] of the late 19th century){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} or dismissing artists now venerated (like the early work of the [[Impressionists]]).&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rewald1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=James S.|title=Art History and the Problems of Criticism|journal=Daedalus|date=Winter 1960|volume=89|issue=1 – The Visual Arts Today|pages=253–263|jstor=20026565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art movements themselves were named disparagingly by critics, with the name later adopted as a sort of badge of honour by the artists of the style (e.g., [[Impressionism]], [[Cubism]]), with the original negative meaning forgotten.&lt;ref name="rewald1973"&gt;Rewald, John (1973).

Artists have often had an uneasy relationship with their critics. Artists usually need positive opinions from critics for their work to be viewed and purchased; unfortunately for the artists, only later generations may understand it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seenan|first=Gerard|title=Painting by ridiculed but popular artist sells for £744,800|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/20/arts.artsnews1|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art is an important part of being human and can be found through all aspects of our lives, regardless of the culture or times. There are many different variables that determine one's judgment of art such as aesthetics, cognition or perception. Art can be objective or subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form. It can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance. Art is a basic human instinct with a diverse range of form and expression. Art can stand-alone with an instantaneous judgment or can be viewed with a deeper more educated knowledge. Aesthetic, pragmatic, expressive, formalist, relativist, processional, imitation, ritual, cognition, mimetic and postmodern theories are some of many theories to criticize and appreciate art. Art criticism and appreciation can be subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form, or it can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Definition==
Art criticism has many and often numerous subjective viewpoints which are nearly as varied as there are people practising it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; It is difficult to come by a more stable definition than the activity being related to the discussion and interpretation of art and its value.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Depending on who is writing on the subject, "art criticism" itself may be obviated as a direct goal or it may include [[art history]] within its framework.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Regardless of definitional problems, art criticism can refer to the [[history of art|history of the craft]] in its essays and art history itself may use critical methods implicitly.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; According to art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], "The borders between art history and art criticism... are no more as firmly drawn as they once used to be. It perhaps began with art historians taking interest in modern art."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Art criticism includes a descriptive aspect,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; where the work of art is sufficiently translated into words so as to allow a case to be made.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation of a work of art that follows the description (or is interspersed with it) depends as much on the artist's output as on the experience of the critic.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p6" /&gt; There is in an activity with such a marked subjective component a variety of ways in which it can be pursued.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; As extremes in a possible spectrum,&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5" /&gt; while some favour simply remarking on the immediate impressions caused by an artistic object,&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; others prefer a more systematic approach calling on technical knowledge, favoured [[aesthetic theory]] and the known sociocultural context the artist is immersed in to discern their intent.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of art criticism}}
Critiques of art likely originated with the origins of art itself, as evidenced by texts found in the works of [[Plato]], [[Vitruvius]] or [[Augustine of Hippo]] among others, that contain early forms of art criticism.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Also, wealthy [[patron]]s have employed, at least since the start of [[Renaissance]], intermediary art-evaluators to assist them in the procurement of commissions and/or finished pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton E.|title=What Did the Renaissance Patron Buy?|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Summer 1998|volume=51|issue=2|pages=392–450|url=http://classroom.kleinisd.net/users/1243/docs/what_did_the_renaissance_patron_buy.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Renaissance Society of America|doi=10.2307/2901572|jstor=2901572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Alexander|title=Negotiating the Gift: Pre-Modern Figurations of Exchange|year=2003|pages=319–360|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/people/faculty/nagel_PDFs/Art_as_Gift_lq.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|chapter=Art as Gift: Liberal Art and Religious Reform in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Jonathan Richardson by Jonathan Richardson.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] coined the term 'art criticism' in 1719.]]
Art criticism as a genre of writing, obtained its modern form in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; The earliest use of the term art criticism was by the English painter [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] in his 1719 publication ''An Essay on the Whole Art of Criticism''. In this work, he attempted to create an objective system for the ranking of works of art. Seven categories, including drawing, composition, invention and colouring, were given a score from 0 to 18, which were combined to give a final score. The term he introduced quickly caught on, especially as the English middle class began to be more discerning in their art acquisitions, as symbols of their flaunted social status.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and England in the mid 1700s, public interest in art began to become widespread, and art was regularly exhibited at the Salons in Paris and the [[Summer Exhibition]]s of London. The first writers to acquire an individual reputation as art critics in 18th-century France were [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] with his ''Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture'' (1718)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubos|first=Jean-Baptiste|title=Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture|year=1732|publisher=E. Neaulme|location=Utrecht|url=https://archive.org/details/reflexionscriti03jeagoog|edition=3rd|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; which garnered the acclaim of [[Voltaire]] for the sagacity of his approach to aesthetic theory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voltaire|authorlink=Voltaire |title=Le Siècle de Louis XIV|year=1874|publisher=Charpentier et C&lt;sup&gt;ie&lt;/sup&gt;, Libraires-Éditeurs|location=Paris|page=581|url=https://archive.org/details/sicledelouisxiv00voltgoog|editor=Charles Louandre|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Étienne La Font de Saint-Yenne]] with ''Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France'' who wrote about the Salon of 1746,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Font de Saint-Yenne|first=Étienne|title=Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France : avec un examen des principaux ouvrages exposés au Louvre le mois d'août 1746|year=1747|publisher=Jean Neaulme|location=The Hague|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting on the socioeconomic framework of the production of the then popular [[Baroque]] art style,&lt;ref name="saisselin1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saisselin|first=Rémy G.|title=The Enlightenment Against the Baroque: Economics and Aesthetics in the Eighteenth Century|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=49–50|url=http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0779n6fb/|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a perception of anti-monarchist sentiments in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Walter |first=Nancy Paige Ryan |title=From Armida to Cornelia: Women and Representation in Prerevolutionary France |type=MA |page=11 |url=http://repositories.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/15694 |year=1995 |publisher=Texas Tech University |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th-century French writer [[Denis Diderot]] greatly advanced the medium of art criticism. Diderot's "The Salon of 1765"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diderot|first=Denis|title=Essais sur la peinture|year=1795|publisher=François Buisson|location=Paris|pages=118–407|url=https://archive.org/details/gri_000033125010886956|editor=François Buisson|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first real attempts to capture art in words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morley|first=John|authorlink=John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|editor=Hugh Chisholm, Franklin Henry Hooper|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=DIDEROT, DENIS|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_08.djvu/222|accessdate=10 December 2012|edition=11th|year=1911|volume=8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Thomas E. Crow]], "When Diderot took up art criticism it was on the heels of the first generation of professional writers who made it their business to offer descriptions and judgments of contemporary painting and sculpture. The demand for such commentary was a product of the similarly novel institution of regular, free, public exhibitions of the latest art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Thomas E.|title=Diderot on Art, Volume I: The Salon of 1765 and Notes on Painting|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=x|editor=Denis Diderot|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in England an exhibition of the [[Society of Arts]] in 1762 and later, in 1766, prompted a flurry of critical, though anonymous, pamphlets. Newspapers and periodicals of the period, such as the ''[[London Chronicle]]'', began to carry columns for art criticism; a form that took off with the foundation of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.
In the 1770s, the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' became the first newspaper to systematically review the art featured at exhibitions.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:John Ruskin - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]], the preeminent art critic of 19th century England.]]
From the 19th century onwards, art criticism became a more common vocation and even a profession,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; developing at times formalised methods based on particular [[aesthetic theory|aesthetic theories]].&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a rift emerged in the 1820s between the proponents of traditional [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] forms of art and the new [[romanticism|romantic]] fashion. The Neoclassicists, under [[Étienne-Jean Delécluze]] defended the classical ideal and preferred carefully finished form in paintings. Romantics, such as [[Stendhal]], criticized the old styles as overly formulaic and devoid of any feeling. Instead, they championed the new expressive, Idealistic, and emotional nuances of Romantic art. A similar, though more muted, debate also occurred in England.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the prominent critics in England at the time was [[William Hazlitt]], a painter and essayist. He wrote about his deep pleasure in art and his belief that the arts could be used to improve mankind's generosity of spirit and knowledge of the world around it. He was one of a rising tide of English critics that began to grow uneasy with the increasingly abstract direction [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s landscape art was moving in.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the great critics of the 19th century was [[John Ruskin]]. In 1843 he published ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in which he robustly defended the work of [[J. M. W. Turner]] from his critics, who charged Turner with being unfaithful to nature. Through painstaking analysis and attention to detail, Ruskin was able to demonstrate the very opposite, in what the art historian [[E. H. Gombrich]] called "the most ambitious work of scientific art criticism ever attempted." Ruskin became renowned for his rich and flowing prose, and later in life he branched out to become an active and wide-ranging critic, publishing works on architecture and [[Renaissance art]], including the ''[[Stones of Venice]]''.

Another dominating figure in 19th-century art criticism, was the French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], whose first published work was his art review ''Salon of 1845'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Curiosités esthétiques: Salon 1845–1859|year=1868|publisher=M.

He tried to move the debate from the old binary positions of previous decades, declaring that "the true painter, will be he who can wring from contemporary life its epic aspect and make us see and understand, with colour or in drawing, how great and poetic we are in our cravats and our polished boots".&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===Turn of the twentieth century===
[[File:Roger Fry self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Self portrait of [[Roger Fry]], described by the [[art historian]] [[Kenneth Clark]] as "incomparably the greatest influence on taste since [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]... In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry".&lt;ref&gt;IAN CHILVERS. "Fry, Roger." The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists. 2003. Encyclopedia.com. 9 March 2009 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;.Retrieved 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Towards the end of the 19th century a movement towards abstraction, as opposed to specific content, began to gain ground in England, notably championed by the playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]. By the early twentieth century these attitudes formally coalesced into a coherent philosophy, through the work of [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, as art critic &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_artcritic.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Group Profiles &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/group.htm#bellc|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an art historian in the 1890s, Fry became intrigued with the new modernist art and its shift away from traditional depiction. His 1910 exhibition of what he called [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] art attracted much criticism for its iconoclasm. He vigorously defended himself in a lecture, in which he argued that art had moved to attempt to discover the language of pure imagination, rather than the staid and, to his mind, dishonest scientific capturing of landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, ideas &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_ideas.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, modern art &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_modernart.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry's argument proved to be very influential at the time, especially among the progressive elite. [[Virginia Woolf]] remarked that: "in or about December 1910 [the date Fry gave his lecture] human character changed."&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

Independently, and at the same time, [[Clive Bell]] argued in his 1914 book ''Art'' that all art work has its particular 'significant form', while the conventional subject matter was essentially irrelevant. This work laid the foundations for the [[formalism (art)|formalist]] approach to art.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tekiner|first=Deniz|title=Formalist Art Criticism and the Politics of Meaning|journal=Social Justice|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2 (104) – Art, Power, and Social Change|pages=31–44|jstor=29768369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Fry argued that "it’s all the same to me if I represent a Christ or a [[saucepan]] since it's the form, and not the object itself, that interests me." As well as being a proponent of [[formalism (art)|formalism]], he argued that the value of art lies in its ability to produce a distinctive aesthetic experience in the viewer. an experience he called "aesthetic emotion". He defined it as that experience which is aroused by significant form. He also suggested that the reason we experience aesthetic emotion in response to the significant form of a work of art was that we perceive that form as an expression of an experience the artist has. The artist's experience in turn, he suggested, was the experience of seeing ordinary objects in the world as pure form: the experience one has when one sees something not as a means to something else, but as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4XeRgAACAAJ|title=Art|author=Clive Bell|year=2010|publisher=General Books LLC|isbn=9781770451858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Read]] was a champion of modern British artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] and became associated with Nash's contemporary arts group Unit One. He focused on the [[modernism]] of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], and published an influential 1929 essay on the meaning of art in ''The Listener''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Paul Nash (1889–1946)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/paul-nash|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Ben Nicholson (1894–1982)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/ben-nicholson|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Henry Moore (1898–1986)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/henry-moore|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Barbara Hepworth (1903–1975)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/barbara-hepworth|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the trend-setting ''Burlington Magazine'' (1933–38) and helped organise the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1945===
As in the case of Baudelaire in the 19th century, the poet-as-critic phenomenon appeared once again in the 20th, when French poet [[Apollinaire]] became the champion of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Katharine |title=The Cubist Painters by Guillaume Apollinaire; Peter Read|journal=French Forum|date=Spring 2005|volume=30|issue=2|pages=139–141|jstor=40552391|doi=10.1353/frf.2005.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Timothy|title=Apollinaire and Cubism?|journal=Style|date=Summer 1988|volume=22|issue=2|pages=275–298|url=http://mlpa.nottingham.ac.uk/archive/00000033/01/Rec_Mathews.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, French writer and hero of the Resistance [[André Malraux]] wrote extensively on art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Derek|title=Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi}}&lt;/ref&gt; going well beyond the limits of his native Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudek|first=Antony|title=The Vocal Turn|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|year=2012|volume=10|issue=1|pages=64–65|doi=10.5334/jcms.1011210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction that the vanguard in Latin America lay in [[Mexican Muralism]] ([[José Clemente Orozco|Orozco]], [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|Siqueiros]]){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} changed after his trip to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1958. After visiting the studios of several Argentine artists in the company of the young Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Buenos Aires [[Rafael Squirru]], Malraux declared the new vanguard to lie in [[Argentina]]'s new artistic movements.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Squirru, a poet-critic who became Cultural Director of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] in [[Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], during the 1960s, was the last to interview [[Edward Hopper]] before his death, contributing to a revival of interest in the American artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Gail|title=Edward Hopper : an intimate biography|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]]) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the [[New York Vanguard]].&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=The Art Story: Gallery – The Art of This Century Gallery|url=http://www.theartstory.org/gallery-art-of-this-century.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]] who functioned as critics as well.&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-robert-motherwell-13286 |title=Oral history interview with Robert Motherwell, 1971 Nov. 24-1974 May 1 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Motherwell|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-motherwell-1673|publisher=Tate|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php The Barnett Newman Foundation website: Chronology of the Artist's Life page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although New York and the world were unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]],&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury" /&gt; by the late 1940s most of the artists who have become household names today had their well established patron critics.&lt;ref name="oxfordart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Painters in Postwar New York City|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/public/page/benz/themes/PostwarNYC|work=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Barnett Newman, [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Abstract Expressionism|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-abstract-expressionism.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uima.uiowa.edu/mural/ Jackson Pollock, ''Mural'' (1943)] [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]], Iowa City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenberg55"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Clement|title=American-Type Painting|journal=[[Partisan Review]]|year=1955|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Abstract Expressionism: Painting Action and Colorfields|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/abstract-expressionism.html|work=Color Vision &amp; Art|publisher=webexhibits.org|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php|publisher=The Barnett Newman Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibitions – Adolph Gottlieb|url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/home/content/exhibitions/special/gottlieb/gottlieb.html|publisher=The Jewish Museum|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Hofmann: Biography|url=http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|publisher=The Estate of Hans Hofmann|accessdate=12 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129075738/http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de&amp;nbsp;Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Mark|author2=Annalyn Swan|title=When de Kooning Was King|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=8 November 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/10248/index1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Harold Rosenberg|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-rosenberg-harold.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas B. Hess]], the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Thomas B. Hess|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hess-thomas.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers" or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.:13&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, in 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] "became the first American painter since Whistler (1895) to win top prize at the Biennale of Venice. New York's two leading art magazines were not interested. ''Arts'' mentioned the historic event only in a news column and ''Art News'' (Managing editor: Thomas B. Hess) ignored it completely. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' printed feature articles".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/5750568&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]] wrote catalogue forewords and reviews and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Session at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pgs.: 240–241, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter to [[Sidney Janis]] on 9 April 1955: {{quotation|It is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, p.: 201, University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York [[Trotskyist]], [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordart"/&gt; As long time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; Artist [[Robert Motherwell]], well-heeled, joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glueck|first=Grace|title=Robert Motherwell, Master of Abstract, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/obituaries/robert-motherwell-master-of-abstract-dies.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement Greenberg proclaimed [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. Greenberg supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever "purer" and more concentrated in what was "essential" to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:154–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New,'' Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", Da Capo Press, 1959 pp.:23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of Abstract Expressionism at the time was ''New York Times'' art critic [[John Canaday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=John Canaday|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-canaday-john.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] were also important postwar art historians who voiced support for Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|title=A Critic Turns 90; Meyer Schapiro|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/magazine/a-critic-turns-90-meyer-schapiro.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire|first=Kristi|title=Remembering Leo Steinberg (1920–2011)|url=http://pressblog.uchicago.edu/2011/03/15/remembering-leo-steinberg-1920-2011.html|work=The Chicago Blog|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early to mid sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Michael Fried|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-fried-michael.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Rosalind Krauss|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Robert Hughes|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hughes-robert.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist art criticism===
[[Feminist art criticism]] emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=N.paradoxa|date=September 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of art criticism.

===Art blogs===

An '''automatic trip''' is an action performed by some system, usually a [[Safety Instrumented System]], [[Programmable Logic Controller]], or [[Distributed Control System]], to put an industrial process into a safe state.  It is triggered by some parameter going into a pre-determined unsafe state.  It is usually preceded by an [[alarm]] to give a process operator a chance to correct the condition to prevent the trip, since trips are usually costly because of lost production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2011">In [[zoology]], an '''available name'''  is a [[scientific name]] for a [[taxon]] of animals that has been published conforming to all the mandatory provisions of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] for the establishment of a zoological name.

For a name to be available, there are a number of general requirements it must fulfill: it must use only the [[Latin alphabet]], be published in a timely fashion by a reputable source, etc. In some rare cases, a name which does not meet these requirements may nevertheless be available, for historical reasons.&lt;ref name="iczn code"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ |title=ICZN article 79 (in Chapter 17)|accessdate={{date|2012-01-02}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An available name is not necessarily a [[valid name (zoology)|valid name]], because an available name may be in [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]]. However, a valid name must always be an available one.

==Contrast to botany==
Under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], this term is not used. It corresponds to a [[validly published name (botany)|validly published name]] in botany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=glo|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Reine, W.F.P.h.V. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011: Glossary|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|publisher=A.R.G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2729">'''The Awaze Tribune''' ('''AwazeTribune''') is an Eritrean [[news satire]] organization that publishes articles on international, national, and local news. Based in [[Asmara]], Eritrea.  The website carries articles that may cover current events, both real and fictional, satirizing the tone and format of traditional news organizations with stories, editorials, [[op-ed]] pieces, and [[Vox populi|man-in-the-street]] interviews using a traditional news website layout and an editorial voice modeled after [[the New York Times]], and the usage of the [[AP Stylebook|AP Style]] of news writing.

== History ==
The articles of AwazeTribune mostly revolve around the coverage of real or imaginary events in a satirical and offbeat way, taking again most of the press codes. AwazeTribune appeared first an element on [[Twitter]] that began in February 2016, during the American Presidential Elections, before being transformed to becoming a website. Since then, many of its articles were relayed in the press.

In its about page, the website claims to have been founded in 32 A.D., to have covered the [[baptism]] of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and the birth of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Mohammad]], and to receive 14 billion unique daily hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://awazetribune.com/index.php/about/|title=About|date=2016-07-02|newspaper=Awaze Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the curators is yet unknown, in a recent interview with [[Radio France Internationale]], one of the anonymous personalities associated with the website flatly declined to be identified stating that " the message of AT outweighs the identity of the curators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20161114-erythree-awase-site-parodique-actualite-denoncer-dictature|title=Erythrée: Awaze, un site parodique d’actualité pour dénoncer la dictature - RFI|newspaper=RFI Afrique|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Many users of social media have taken AwazeTribune articles to be literal (especially those which address controversial topics), and have expressed their anger and confusion online failing, according to one of the website's managers, to 'comprehend that the site makes a [[tongue-in-cheek]] news commentary revolving around the secretive Eritrean regime'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://information.tv5monde.com/afrique/en-erythree-l-humour-est-la-politesse-du-desespoir-138929|title=En Erythrée, l'humour du Awaze Tribune est la politesse du désespoir|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=TV5MONDE|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biochemical systems theory''' is a [[mathematical model]]ling framework for [[biochemical system]]s, based on ordinary [[differential equation]]s (ODE), in which [[biochemistry|biochemical processes]] are represented using '''power-law''' expansions in the variables of the [[system]].

This framework, which became known as Biochemical Systems Theory, has been developed since the 1960s by [[Michael Savageau]] and others for the [[systems analysis]] of [[biochemical]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biolchem.qui.uc.pt/curso/BST.htm ''Biochemical Systems Theory''], an introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cornish-Bowden (2007) they "regarded this as a general theory of [[metabolic]] control, which includes both metabolic control analysis and flux-oriented theory as special cases".&lt;ref&gt;Athel Cornish-Bowden, [http://bip.cnrs-mrs.fr/bip10/mcafaq4.htm#sava Metabolic control analysis FAQ], website 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
The dynamics of a species is represented by a differential equation with the structure:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dX_i}{dt}=\sum_j \mu_{ij} \cdot \gamma_j \prod_k X_k^{f_{jk}}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represents one of the ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; variables of the model (metabolite concentrations, protein concentrations or levels of gene expression). ''j'' represents the ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; biochemical processes affecting the dynamics of the species. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; (stoichiometric coefficient), &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; (rate constants) and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; (kinetic orders) are two different kinds of parameters defining the dynamics of the system.

The principal difference of [[power-law]] [[Mathematical model|models]] with respect to other ODE models used in biochemical systems is that the kinetic orders can be non-integer numbers. A kinetic order can have even negative value when inhibition is modelled. In this way, power-law models have a higher flexibility to reproduce the non-linearity of biochemical systems.

Models using power-law expansions have been used during the last 35 years to model and analyse several kinds of biochemical systems including metabolic networks, genetic networks and recently in cell signalling.

The '''blue sky catastrophe''' is a form of orbital indeterminacy, and an element of bifurcation theory.

==Orbital dynamics==
Blue sky catastrophe is a type of [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] of a [[periodic orbit]]. In other words, it describes a sort of behaviour stable solutions of a set of differential equations can undergo as the equations are gradually changed. This type of bifurcation is characterised by both the [[Orbital period|period]] and [[length]] of the orbit approaching infinity as the control parameter approaches a finite bifurcation value, but with the orbit still remaining within a [[wikt:bounded|bounded]] part of the [[phase space]], and without loss of [[orbit (dynamics)#Stability of orbits|stability]]  before the bifurcation point. In other words, the orbit ''vanishes into the blue sky''.

==Applications of blue sky catastrophe in other fields==
The bifurcation has found application in, amongst other places, [[slow-fast model]]s of [[computational neuroscience]]. The possibility of the phenomenon was raised by [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] in 1971, and explored by [[R.L. Devaney]] and others in the following decade. More compelling analysis was not performed until the 1990s.

This bifurcation has also been found in the context of [[fluid dynamics]], namely in double-diffusive convection of a small [[Prandtl number]] fluid. Double diffusive convection occurs when convection of the fluid is driven by both thermal and concentration gradients, and the temperature and concentration diffusivities take different values. The bifurcation is found in an orbit that is born in a global saddle-loop bifurcation, becomes chaotic in a period doubling cascade, and disappears in the blue sky catastrophe.

The '''California NanoSystems Institute''' ('''CNSI''') is an integrated research center operating jointly at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]]. Its missions are to foster interdisciplinary collaborations for discoveries in nanosystems and [[nanotechnology]]; train the next generation of scientists, educators and technology leaders; and facilitate partnerships with industry, fueling economic development and the social well-being of [[California]], the United States and the [[world]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} 

CNSI was created by Governor [[Gray Davis]] as part of a science and innovation initiative, it was established in 2000 with $100 million from the state of California and an additional $250 million in federal research grants and industry funding. At the institute, scientists in the areas of biology, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, mathematics, computational science and engineering measure, modify and manipulate the building blocks of our world – [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s. These scientists benefit from an integrated laboratory culture enabling them to conduct dynamic research at the [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]], leading to significant breakthroughs in the areas of health, energy, the environment and information technology.

== History ==
On December 7, 2000, California Governor Gray Davis announced the location of the federally sponsored California NanoSystems Institute section of the [[California Institutes for Science and Innovation]] (Cal ISI) initiative. The California legislature put forth $100 million for  three research facilities to advance the future of the state's economy.&lt;ref&gt;California Launches Major Nanotechnology Research Initiative”. Foresight Update 43.December 20, 2000. &lt;http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Update43/Update43.2.html&gt;. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019170748/http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Update43/Update43.2.html |date=2008-10-19 }} 13 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) was selected out of the proposals along with three other Cal ISIs: [[California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences]] (QB3), [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]] (Cal-(IT)2), and [[Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society]] (CITRIS).&lt;ref&gt;Foust, Brenda. “The California Institutes for Science and Innovation”.

The '''Centre for Appropriate Rural Technology''' (CART) is a community-driven [[sustainable development]] project located in the [[Eastern Cape]] of [[South Africa]]. It functions as a life skills centre in the heart of Sicambeni Village, a rural village near Port St Johns.

==Background==
[[Image:theview.jpg|right|500px]]
The Eastern Cape is South Africa’s poorest region and has for many years been a victim of massive skill loss due to the [[rural exodus|migration]] of workers to the larger cities in seek of work.  Invariably these migrants find themselves living in the already overcrowded [[Township (South Africa)]] compounding South Africa’s desperate slum culture.
Having accrued 15 years of experience working in several African Countries, building communities with the homeless, CART was formed as a centre to tackle poverty in a more holistic way. CART aims to give the local population the skills and technology to allow them to live self-sustainably without the need to seek work outside of their own villages, ultimately allowing the migrants to return to their homelands.

==Goals==
[[Image:AllofCART.jpg|right|500px]]
CART’s primary goal is to complete the self sustainable model, serving as the epicentre to the surrounding village of over four hundred families. Technology developed here is being taught to and implemented within the community to produce a fully sustainable village. CART ensures that any technology implemented can be replicated in other rural environments, allowing this sustainable village to become a living example to other communities around South Africa and Globally. 

CART operates numerous other initiatives, including innovative farming techniques, to provide much needed nutritional enrichment and a HIV support group offering nutritional, physical and spiritual healing. 

==Technologies==
[[Image:Aeratedbed.JPG|right|200 px]]
[[Image:Lotsofbricks.JPG|right|200 px]]
One of the primary goals of CART is to experiment with and implement technologies that can be used sustainably in a rural environment. This includes effective water, waste, energy and building systems.

===Aerated beds===
[[Image:Brickpit.JPG|right|200 px]]
[[Image:Education centre.JPG|right|200 px]]
The aerated, raised beds can be implemented anywhere but are ideally suited to areas that have high [[clay]] content in the soil structure. Though clay-rich soil is ideal for keeping nutrients in the soil, it can also retain too much water. The raised structure design allows better [[drainage]], minimizes the threat of [[root rot]], and enables rooting vegetables (carrots, beets, onions, etc.) to grow significantly larger than when planted in the ground. The structure's unique shape also makes monitoring the fertility easier and the overall planting surface is greatly improved.

The garden resembles a [[compost heap]] with green matter placed on the very bottom of the structure, which is made from lengths of thin poles (latte). Decomposed material (wood chips, leaves, etc.) is layered on top of the green matter, followed by a mix of soil and compost. Seedlings are planted and mulched on top of the bed while herbs are planted on the sides, creating a network of strong roots to help contain the soil in the garden structure.

===Brick machine===
[[Image:Thedam.JPG|right|200 px]]
A hand-operated mechanical press creates stabilised bricks. Clay based soil mixed with five percent cement is used to form the base of the bricks.

===Dams===
[[Image:Biodigester.JPG|right|200 px]]
[[Image:Insidethatchedroof.JPG|right|200 px]]
Water management problems mean that only one crop per year is grown. Sometime the community has little choice but to drink from [[water contamination|contaminated rivers]]. The project aims to improve on this by using year round planting and more effective water management techniques.

===Biodigester===
[[Image:Small Garden Prototype Complete.png|right|200 px]]
[[Image:Sustainable.jpg|right|200 px]]
One of the most common problems facing rural communities around the world is that of waste disposal.  The incorrect disposal of animal and human waste can lead to the poisoning of waterways, render land un-farmable and cause numerous fatal diseases such as [[Cholera]], [[Typhoid]] and [[Diphtheria]].  CART needed a way to not only dispose of its waste but also to find a way of actually making this waste useful.  After much research it was decided that a [[Biodigester]] could provide the solution to this problem, however no design existed that could be cheaply replicated in rural areas – so CART made one.   Conventional Biodigesters cost in the region of US$30,000, CART’s costs about US$500.

The simple design consists of a hole 7m x 1.5m x 1.5m into which a reinforced PVC cylindrical black bag is placed.  At one end is the ‘inlet’ situated at the bottom of the bag, a pipe from the toilet block brings all human waste into the bag together with a hatch for animal and kitchen waste.  Two outlet pipes are situated at the other end of the bag, one at the top for gas removal the other is 1/3 of the way up for liquid removal.  The design incorporates a black colour so as to attract solar heat to accelerate decomposition.  The placement of the outlet pipe is important as it is necessary to maintain 1/3 liquids : 2/3 gas.

Due to the sealed nature of the bag all this waste begins to decompose anaerobically releasing [[methane]] gas, water and sludge waste whilst also killing harmful [[pathogens]] such as [[E-Coli]].  The methane gas is released and captured using the valve at the top of the outlet end of the bag, this gas can be used for cooking, lighting and heating  (although CART currently intend to use the gas solely for cooking.)  The water is released through the outlet pipe, this water is known as ‘High nutrient’ or ‘Black’ water.  Less than 10% of the products are solids and therefore only need removing from the bag every few years, these solids can be used as a high nutrient fertiliser for fruit trees or for plants where the fertiliser does not come into direct contact with the crop.  The black water is mixed with grey waters, such as shower or washing water (N.B CART only uses organic, [[bio-degradable]] washing products to ensure no toxins are introduced to the cycle.)  This water is filtered through sand and charcoal and used to irrigate the food gardens.  Excess water, together with runoff from the gardens is collected in the Dam, from which it can be used to water gardens in the dry season or filtered further making it safe for drinking (see [[water cycle]]).

===Indoor gardens===
The indoor garden is a conceptual design for a compact, portable garden that can be put in almost any living space. Ideally, the garden would be put under a south-facing window (in the northern hemisphere), and would provide enough food to sustain a family.

The '''chronology of the Bible''' is an elaborate system of lifespans, "generations," and other means by which the passage of events is measured, beginning with [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] and extending through other significant events. A widespread scholarly understanding is that the Bible marks out a world cycle ([[Great Year]]) of 4,000 years, beginning with Creation and ending, presumably, around 164 [[Common Era|BCE]], with the year [[Anno Mundi|AM]] 2666 for [[the Exodus]] representing 26 2/3 of 100 years or two-thirds of the total.&lt;ref name="Johnson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall D.

By adding the remaining 375 years we arrive—in our modern calculations—at 538 - 375 = 163 BCE, the date of the rededication of the temple by Judas Maccabee. Of course, this calculation implies that the framers of the chronology were aware of the accurate figure. So possibly the endpoint is the year of desecration (167), or even a date a little in the future, the date of the expected eschaton ... If so, the present Masoretic chronology dates from the second century BCE.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blenkinsopp2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Blenkinsopp|title=Opening the Sealed Book: Interpretations of the Book of Isaiah in Late Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ePy3U7GkvQC&amp;pg=PA87|date=7 November 2006|publisher=Wm.

If, as has been suggested, a figure of 4000 was held in mind, the present biblical chronology might be predicated upon the rededication of the Temple (about 164 BCE) after its profanation by Antiochus, which would establish a connection with Daniel, as well as with the books of Enoch and Jubilees. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p=234}} It was theological in intent, not historical in the modern sense,{{sfn|Christensen|1990|p=148}} and functions as an implied prophecy whose key lies in the identification of the final event.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|pp=73–74}}

The count begins with creation and Year 1. The passage of time from the Creation to [[the Exodus]] is measured by adding the ages of the [[Patriarch]]s at the birth of their firstborn sons, later through express statements, and later still by the synchronised reigns of the [[kings of Israel and Judah]].{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=96–97}} The Exodus takes place in the year [[Anno Mundi|''anno mundi'']] 2666, or AM 2666, exactly two thirds of the way through the four thousand years, the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is commenced 480 years, or 12 generations of 40 years each, after that, and 430 years pass between the building of the Temple and its destruction.{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=96–97}} The 50 years between the destruction of the Temple and the "[[Cyrus's edict|Decree of Cyrus]]" and end of the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]], added to the 430 years for which the Temple stood, produces another symmetrical period of 480 years,{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}} and the 374 years between the re-dedication of the Temple by the [[Maccabees]] and the Edict of Cyrus completes the 4,000 years.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}}

As recently as the 18th century, scholars of the stature of [[Isaac Newton]] believed that the date of Creation was knowable from the Bible.{{sfn|Barr|1987|p=3}} Today, the Genesis account of Creation has long since vanished from serious [[cosmology]], the Patriarchs and Exodus are no longer included in most serious histories of ancient Israel,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=81, 168}} and it is almost universally accepted that [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]] have little historical value.{{sfn|Finkelstein|Mazar|2007|pp=62, 74}} Even the monarchy is questioned, and although scholars continue to advance proposals for reconciling the chronology of the [[Books of Kings]], there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=81, 168}}{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}

== Pre-Masoretic chronologies ==
During the centuries that [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Biblical texts and canons developed]], theological chronologies emerged at different composition stages, though scholars have advanced various theories to identify these stages and their schematizations of time. These chronologies include:
* A "Progenitor" chronology that placed [[Abraham]]'s birth at AM 1600 and the foundation of the Temple at AM 2800. Alfred Jepsen proposed this chronology on the basis of melding time periods in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan]] and [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic recensions]].{{sfn|Northcote|2004|pp=3ff.}}
* Distinct chronologies can be inferred from the [[Priestly source]] (of the Pentateuch), along with priestly authors of later Biblical books,&lt;ref&gt;On the "Priestly chronology", see especially Hughes, e.g., 233f.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deuteronomistic history]], which purports to chronicle the reigns of the kings of Judah and Israel (with some significant historical corroboration, see below and [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]). 
* The Nehemiah chronology, devised to show 3,500 years from creation to [[Nehemiah|Nehemiah's]] mission. Northcote says that this chronology was "probably composed by [[Levites]] in Jerusalem not long after Nehemiah's mission, perhaps sometime late in the fifth century BCE (i.e. nearing 400 BCE)."{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=8}} Bousset (1900) apparently sees this schematization, too, but calls it Proto-[[Masoretic Text|MT]].{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=8}}
* A proto-Masoretic chronology, shaped by [[Jubilee (biblical)|jubilees]], with an overall literary showing of 3,480 years from creation to the completion of the [[Second Temple]], per B.W. Bousset (1900), and which had the [[first Temple]] at 3,000 years.
* The Saros chronology that reflected 3,600 years leading up to the first Temple and 4,080 years from creation to the completion of the Second Temple. This scheme served as "the basis for the later [[Septuagint|LXX]] chronology and pre-SP [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] chronologies".{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=12}}

== Masoretic Text ==

{{hatnote|The following table is derived from Thomas L. Thompson, ''The Mythic Past'';{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=75}} notes within the table as cited.}}

It should be noted that some data in this table are questionable. For example, Genesis 11:10 states that Shem was 100 years old when he gave birth to his son two years after the flood. The statement (Gn 5:32) that Noah was 500 years old when his sons were born, means that they were born starting then. Some commentators state that Shem was the youngest of the three, which could mean that he was born two years later in order to make his age 100 two years after the flood. If one starts from two years after the flood (no matter what the age of Shem was) and adds the ages of his descendants, Abraham was born in 1948 AM. Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old in 2048. According to some commentators the Exodus is dated as 400 years after the birth of Isaac (from Genesis 15:13), making it 2448. According to others the 430 year time mentioned in Exodus 12:40 is dated from the descent of Jacob to Aegypt, making it 2668.

The temple was built 480 years after the Exodus, in the fourth year of King Solomon's rein, according to I Kings 6:1. This places the start of King Solomon's reign as 2924 and the building of the temple as 2928.

The Masoretic Text is the basis of modern Jewish and Christian bibles. While difficulties with Biblical texts make it impossible to reach sure conclusions, perhaps the most widely held hypothesis is that it embodies an overall scheme of 4,000 years (a "great year") taking the re-dedication of the Temple by the Maccabees in 164 BCE as its end-point.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}} Two motives may have led to this: first, there was a common idea at the time of the Maccabees that human history followed the plan of a divine "week" of seven "days" each lasting a thousand years;{{sfn|Grabbe|2002|p=246}} and second, a 4,000 year history—even longer in the Septuagint version—would establish the antiquity of the Jews against their pagan neighbours.{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=98–99}}

== Other Second Temple chronologies: Septuagint, Samaritan, Jubilees==
[[File:Tissot Solomon Dedicates the Temple at Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Solomon Dedicates the Temple ([[James Tissot]])]]

The canonical text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] is called the [[Masoretic Text]], a text preserved by Jewish rabbis from early the 7th and 10th centuries CE. There are, however, two other major texts, the [[Septuagint]] and the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. The Septuagint is a [[Koine Greek]] translation of the original [[biblical Hebrew]] holy books. It is estimated that the first five books of the Septuagint, known as the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch, were translated in the mid-3rd century [[BCE]] and the remaining texts were translated in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=April 7, 2018|date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It mostly agrees with the Masoretic Text, but not in its chronology. The Samaritan text is the text preserved by the [[Samaritan]] community. This community dates from some time in the last few centuries BCE—just when is disputed—and, like the Septuagint, differs markedly from the Masoretic Text in its chronology. Modern scholars do not regard the Masoretic Text as superior to the other two—the Masoretic is sometimes clearly wrong, as when it says that Saul began to reign at two years of age and reigned for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a13.htm 1 Samuel 13:1]&lt;/ref&gt; More relevantly, all three texts have a clear purpose, which is not to record history so much as to bring the narrative to a point which represents the culmination of history.

In the Samaritan Pentateuch, 'the genealogies and narratives were shaped to ensure a chronology of 3000 years from creation to the Israelite settlement of Canaan. Northcote reports this as the "Proto-SP chronology," as designated by John Skinner (1910), and he speculates that this chronology may have been extended to put the rebuilding of the Second Temple at an even AM 3900, after three 1,300-year phases. In the Septuagint version of the Pentateuch the Israelite chronology extends 4,777 years from creation to the finishing of the Second Temple, as witnessed in the [[Codex Alexandrinus]] manuscript. This calculation only emerges by supplementing Septuagint with the MT's chronology of kings. There were at least 3 variations of Septuagint chronology; [[Eusebius]] used one variation, now favored by Hughes and others. Northcote asserts that the Septuagint calendrical pattern was meant to demonstrate that there were 5,000 years from creation to a contemporaneous [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], circa 300 BCE.{{sfn|Northcote|2004|pp=14ff}}

The 2nd century BCE [[Book of Jubilees]] begins with the Creation and measures time in years, "weeks" of years (groups of seven years), and jubilees (sevens of sevens), so that the interval from Creation to the settlement of Canaan, for example, is exactly fifty jubilees (2450 years).{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p=245}}

==Seder Olam==

More significant, and still in common use among Jews, was the [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] ("Great Order of the World"), a work tracing the history of the world and the Jews from Creation to the 2nd century CE.{{sfn|Milikowski|2011|p = 656}}{{sfn|Solomon|2006|p = 61}} It allows 410 years for the duration of the First Temple, 70 years from its destruction to the Second Temple, and 420 years for the duration of the Second Temple, making a total of 900 years for the two temples.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p = 253}} This schematic approach to numbers accounts for its most remarkable feature, the fact that it shortens the entire Persian Empire from over two centuries to just 52 years, mirroring the 52 years it gives to the [[Babylonian exile]].{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p = 257}}

==Christian use and development of biblical chronology==

The early Church Father [[Eusebius]] (c. 260–340), attempting to place Christ in the chronology, put his birth in AM 5199, and this became the accepted date for the Western Church.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=259–260}} As the year AM 6000 (800 CE) approached there was increasing fear that the end of the world was nigh, until the [[Venerable Bede]] made his own calculations and found that Christ's birth took place in AM 3592, allowing several more centuries to the end of time.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=259–260}}

[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) switched the point of focus from Christ's birth to the Apostolic Council of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 15, which he placed in the year AM 4000, believing this marked the moment when the Mosaic Law was abolished and the new age of grace began.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=260–261}} This was widely accepted among European Protestants, but in the English-speaking world, Archbishop [[James Ussher]] (1581–1656) calculated a date of 4004 BCE for creation; he was not the first to reach this result, but his chronology was so detailed that his dates were incorporated into the margins of English Bibles for the next two hundred years.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=261–262}} This popular 4,000 year theological timespan, which ends with the birth of Jesus, differs from the 4,000 timespan later proposed for the Masoretic text alone, which ends with the Temple rededication in 164 BCE.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}}

==The Israelite kings==
{{For|detailed reconstructions of the chronology of the Hebrew kings|Kings of Judah}}

The chronology of the monarchy, unlike that of earlier periods, can be checked against non-Biblical sources and seems to be correct in general terms.{{sfn|Lemche|2010|pp=95–96}} This raises the prospect that the [[Books of Kings]], linking the Hebrew kings by accession and length of reign ("king X of Judah came to the throne in the ''n''th year of king Y of Israel and ruled ''n'' years"), can be used to reconstruct a chronology for the monarchy, but the task has in fact proven intractably difficult.{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=2}} The problem is that the books contain numerous contradictions: to take just one example, since Rehoboam of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel began to rule at the same time (1 Kings 12), and since Ahaziah of Judah and Joram of Israel were killed at the same time (1 Kings 9:24, 27), the same amount of time should have elapsed in both kingdoms, but the count shows 95 years passing in Judah and 98 in Israel.{{sfn|Galil|1996|p=12}} In short, "[t]he data concerning the synchronisms appeared in hopeless contradiction with the data as to the lengths of reigns."{{sfn|Thiele|1983|p=15}}

Possibly the most widely followed attempt to reconcile the contradictions has been that proposed by [[Edwin R. Thiele]] in his ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (three editions between 1951 and 1983), but his work has been widely criticised for, among other things, introducing "innumerable" co-regencies, constructing a "complex system of calendars", and using "unique" patterns of calculation; as a result his following is largely among scholars "committed ... to a doctrine of scripture's absolute harmony" (the criticism is to be found in [[Brevard Childs]]' ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'').{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=4 and fn.6}} The weaknesses in Thiele's work have led subsequent scholars to continue to propose chronologies, but, in the words of a recent commentary on Kings, there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}

Efforts to save endangered species may, paradoxically, lead to '''conservation-induced extinction''' of other species. This mostly threatens the parasite and pathogen species that are highly host-specific to critically endangered hosts. When the last individuals of a host species are captured for the purpose of captive breeding and reintroduction programs, they typically undergo anti-parasitic treatments to increase survival and reproductive success. This practice may unintentionally result in the extinction of the species antagonistic to the target species, such as certain parasites. It has been proposed that the parasites should be reintroduced to the endangered population. A few cases of conservation-induced extinction have occurred in parasitic [[lice]].&lt;ref name="Rózsa2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rózsa | first=Lajos | last2=Vas | first2=Zoltán | title=Co-extinct and critically co-endangered species of parasitic lice, and conservation-induced extinction: should lice be reintroduced to their hosts? | journal=Oryx | volume=49 | issue=01 | date=2014-08-22| doi=10.1017/s0030605313000628 | pages=107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* Parasite: ''[[Colpocephalum californici]]'' – host: [[California condor]]&lt;ref name = Dunn&gt;Dunn RR 2009. Coextinction: anecdotes, models, and speculation. In Holocene Extinctions (ed. S.T. Turvey), pp. 167–180. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The parasite most probably became extinct when the last individuals of its only host species were captured for a captive-breeding program; all parasites found were deliberately killed in an attempt to assist the host's survival.&lt;ref name="Stringer2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stringer |first1=Andrew Paul |last2=Linklater |first2=Wayne |title=Everything in Moderation: Principles of Parasite Control for Wildlife Conservation |journal=BioScience |date=2014 |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=932–937 |doi=10.1093/biosci/biu135 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parasite: ''Rallicola (Aptericola) pilgrimi'' – host: [[little spotted kiwi]]&lt;ref name = Buckley&gt;Buckley TR, Palma RL, Johns PM, Gleeson DM, Heath ACG, Hitchmough RA, Stringer IAN 2012. The conservation status of small or less well known groups of New Zealand terrestrial invertebrates. ''New Zealand Entomologist'' '''35:''' 137–143.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The parasite most probably became extinct when the last individuals of its only host species were captured and, after routine veterinary antiparasitic treatments, re-introduced into predator-free islands.
* Parasite: ''Rallicola (Rallicola) guami'' – host: [[Guam rail]]
:The only known host species of this parasite exists exclusively in captivity and kept under veterinary control. No information about the fate of the parasite, likely extinct.
* Parasite: ''Linognathus petasmatus'' – host: [[scimitar-horned oryx]]
:The host specificity of this parasite is uncertain. Either it was specific to the scimitar-horned oryx and became extinct during captive breeding of the host, or – alternatively – it may be specific to the [[addax]] and possibly still surviving in the wild.

==Erroneous example==

* “The Trichodectid lice of the [[black-footed ferret]]” has been mentioned in the literature several times&lt;ref name = Gompper&gt;Gompper ME, Williams ES 1998. Parasite conservation and the black-footed ferret recovery program. ''Conservation Biology'' '''12:''' 730–732.&lt;/ref&gt; as a parasite that became extinct during the captive breeding program of the host. However, this parasite most probably never existed as a separate species.&lt;ref name="Rózsa2014"/&gt;

==Current example==

Parasite species that are specific to a single host species are endangered whenever the host is to be saved by captive breeding programs. A current example is the louse ''Felicola isidoroi'', a louse parasitizing the [[Iberian lynx]].&lt;ref name = Felicola&gt;Pérez, J.M.; Sánchez, I. &amp; Palma, R.L. (2013). The dilemma of conserving parasites: the case of ''Felicola (Lorisicola) isidoroi'' (Phthiraptera: Trichodectidae) and its host, the endangered Iberian lynx (''Lynx pardinus''). ''Insect Conservation and Diversity'' '''6:''' 680–686.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4009">A '''diffuser''' is "a device for reducing the velocity and increasing the static pressure of a fluid passing through a system”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |chapter-url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diffuser.html |contribution=diffuser |title=Merriam–Webster Dictionary |accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diffusers are used to slow the fluid's velocity while increasing its static pressure. The fluid's static pressure rise as it passes though a duct is commonly referred to as pressure recovery.  In contrast, a [[nozzle]] is often intended to increase the discharge velocity and lower pressure while directing the flow in one particular direction.

Frictional effects during analysis can sometimes be important, but usually they are neglected. Ducts containing fluids flowing at low velocity can usually be analyzed using [[Bernoulli's principle]].  Analyzing ducts flowing at higher velocities with [[mach number]]s in excess of 0.3 usually require [[Compressible flow]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mach Number|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/mach.html|website=NASA|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical, subsonic diffuser is a [[Duct (HVAC)|duct]] that increases in size in the direction of flow. As the duct increases in size, fluid velocity decreases, and static pressure rises. 
Both [[mass flow rate]] and [[Bernoulli's principle]] are responsible for these changes in pressure, and velocity.

==Supersonic Diffusers==

A supersonic diffuser is a duct that decreases in size in the direction of flow. As the duct decreases in size, fluid temperature, pressure, and density increase, while velocity decreases. [[Compressible flow]] is responsible for these changes in pressure, velocity, density, and temperature. [[Shock wave]]s may also play an important role in a supersonic diffuser.

== HVAC ==
[[Image:Central ventilation tube2.jpg|thumb|250px|A round diffuser in an HVAC system]]

Diffusers are very common in [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Designer's Guide to Ceiling-Based Air Diffusion'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Diffusers are used on both all-air and air-water HVAC systems, as part of [[room air distribution]] subsystems, and serve several purposes:

* To deliver both conditioning and ventilating air
* Evenly distribute the flow of air, in the desired directions
* To enhance mixing of room air into the primary air being discharged
* Often to cause the air jet(s) to attach to a ceiling or other surface, taking advantage of the [[Coanda effect|Coandă effect]]
* To create low-velocity air movement in the occupied portion of room
* Accomplish the above while producing the minimum amount of [[noise]]

When possible, dampers, extractors, and other flow control devices should not be placed near diffusers' inlets (necks), either not being used at all or being placed far upstream.  They have been shown to dramatically increase noise production.  For as-cataloged diffuser performance, a straight section of [[duct (HVAC)|duct]] needs serve a diffuser.  An elbow, or kinked flex duct, just before a diffuser often leads to poor air distribution and increased noise.

Diffusers can be as a shape of round, rectangular,  or can be as linear slot diffusers(LSDs, e.g.: Linear slot diffusers takes the form of one or several long, narrow slots,mostly semi-concealed in a fixed or suspended ceiling.

Occasionally, diffusers are mostly used in reverse fashion, as air inlets or returns. This is especially true for Linear slot diffuser and 'perf' diffusers.  But more commonly, [[grille]]s are used as return or exhaust air inlets.

==Concept==
Excessivism is a reflection, examination, or investigation of every aspect of life in excessive state with particular consideration to the areas that have real and consequential effect on the members of the society.  Subject areas are, but not limited to, economics, politics and psychology. In the area of economics it is a commentary on [[economic materialism]]. It reflects, examines and investigates the excessive desire to acquire material goods beyond one's needs and often means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Excessivism depicts the excessive use of resources in an exaggerated way, by means of two- or three-dimensional visual creations, written or spoken words, or in any other manner. It aims at a reflection, examination, or investigation of the capitalist system, devoid of aesthetic, legal, commercial, ethical, moral, racial, or religious considerations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The goal of the capitalist system is to deliver profit for private investors, or corporations (without consideration of consequences including human and environmental), as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means of wealth. Said structure provides incomparable contribution to economic growth, employment and prosperity. According to [[determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Southern Cone Model: The Political Economy of Regional Capitalist Development in Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w0N-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=excessive+economic+determinism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=excessive%2520economic%2520determinism&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 2004-08-02|isbn = 9781134327089|first = Nicola|last = Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Charting a New Course: The Politics of Globalization and Social Transformation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5CEGwRutaEEC|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780742508934|first = Fernando Henrique|last = Cardoso|first2 = Mauricio Augusto|last2 = Font}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Crafting Qualitative Research: Working in the Postpositivist Traditions|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KtDKBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2015-02-24|isbn = 9781317473695|first = Pushkala|last = Prasad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Elgar Companion to Radical Political Economy|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lc6b1Q1Kf1YC|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|date = 1994-01-01|isbn = 9781843768647|first = Philip|last = Arestis|first2 = Malcolm C.|last2 = Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; freedom of choice is illusory and society is positioned to function as a reliable producer of excess, the lubricant of the capitalist engine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The inaugural exhibition of Excessivism took place in LA Artcore Brewery Annex gallery with the title "Excessivist Initiative".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And the Excessivism Manifesto was published in [[Downtown News]] weekly in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[[Downtown News]], Excessivism Manifesto, September 28, 2015 page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.survivorlibrary.com/library/architect_and_engineer_of_california_vol_22_1910.pdf |title=The Architect and Engineer of California Volume 22 |publisher=The Architect and Engineer Co. |date=August 1910 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an art critic Shana Nys Dambrot the idea was conceived in the studio of the founder based on his personal realizations of his relationship as a consumer with the capitalist environment.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  Excessivism was introduced to the Los Angeles art scene in November 2014 in the Red Pipe gallery in an  exhibition titled ''Excess The New Norm''. It was curated by art critic, publisher and curator Mat Gleason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Pipe Gallery: Kaloust Guedel: Excess The New Norm|url=http://www.artslant.com/la/events/show/353832-excess-the-new-norm|publisher=ArtSlant|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flat Eric''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[puppet]] character created by [[Mr. Oizo|Quentin Dupieux]] from [[Levi's]] [[Television advertisement|commercials]] for [[Sta-Prest]] One Crease Denim Clothing, built by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/299803.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Flat Eric's cruise to the top |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-03-20 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name comes from an idea for a commercial that included having a car run over his head and flattening it. The idea was not used, but the name stuck. In the commercials, Flat Eric would ride with his friend Angel (played by Philippe Petit) around California, evading the police as a wanted criminal.&lt;ref name="guardian1608"&gt;{{cite news|author=Carolyne Ellis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/aug/16/mondaymediasection1 |title=Eric exposed &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2000-08-29|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Flat Eric was based on a puppet called Stéphane that was similar, but with ears and the hands were fixed.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utalkmarketing.com/pages/Article.aspx?ArticleID=15018 |title=Advertising icon Flat Eric to be resurrected - Marketing News |publisher=UTalkMarketing |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stéphane appeared in some short films by Mr. Oizo (including a video for the track [[M-Seq]]), and had a small cult following in the United Kingdom and France.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"/&gt; In 1999, Levi's decided to build a television commercial campaign around the puppet, to be directed by Oizo. The character was renamed Eric, a more "international name", in contrast to the original French name Stéphane.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

He was made by Janet Knechtel for [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips |first=Dom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/mar/07/flateric.advertising |title=No strings attached &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2001-03-31|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom, and was performed by [[Drew Massey]] for all the Levi's commercials. The Levi's adverts took three days to shoot.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The original short films made with Stéphane cost around 15,000 [[franc]]s to produce.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The two Levi's ads cost around two or three million francs each.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The rights to the character were retained by Oizo and production company Partizan.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"/&gt;

==Appearances==
He was featured in the [[music video]] for "[[Flat Beat]]" by French musician [[Mr. Oizo]] and he also appeared as a [[Theatrical property|prop]] in Series 1 of the 2001 to 2003 [[BBC]] comedy ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. In August 2004, he co starred with [[David Soul]], in a five million pound television advert for ''[[Auto Trader Group|Auto Trader]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/220250/David-Soul-partners-Flat-Eric-5m-Auto-Trader-ad |title=David Soul partners Flat Eric in £5m Auto Trader ad - Brand Republic News |publisher=Brandrepublic.com |date=2004-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also appeared on ''[[The Big Breakfast]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian2203"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/mar/22/flateric.advertising |title=Is Flat Eric an earner? &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 1999-03-30|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The puppet also featured heavily as a prop for more than ten years on [[SIC Radical]] interactive chat show ''[[Curto Circuito]]'', being usually named as "''Boneco Amarelo''" (Portuguese for "Yellow Puppet").

Flat Eric has also been featured in many magazines, including ''[[Arena (magazine)|Arena]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]'', ''[[Melody Maker]]'', ''Ministry'', ''[[Mixmag]]'', ''[[Muzik]]'', ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian2203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heat"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://reocities.com/Hollywood/heights/5617/articles.html|date=1999-04-03|title=Flat Eric: King of the World|magazine=[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[molecular biology]] and [[biotechnology]], a '''fluorescent tag''', also known as a '''fluorescent  label''' or '''fluorescent probe''', is a [[molecule]] that is attached chemically to aid in the detection of a [[biomolecule]] such as a protein, antibody, or amino acid. Generally, [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] tagging, or labeling, uses a reactive derivative of a fluorescent molecule known as a [[fluorophore]].  The fluorophore selectively binds to a specific region or functional group on the target molecule and can be attached chemically or biologically.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;  Various labeling techniques such as enzymatic labeling, [[protein tag|protein labeling]], and genetic labeling are widely utilized. [[ethidium bromide]], [[fluorescein]] and [[green fluorescent protein]] are common tags. The most commonly labelled molecules are antibodies, proteins, amino acids and peptides which are then used as specific probes for detection of a particular target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/01/fluorescent-labeling-of-biomolecules-with-organic-probes/|title=Fluorescent labeling of biomolecules with organic probes - Presentations - PharmaXChange.info|date=29 January 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of methods to detect and identify biomolecules has been motivated by the ability to improve the study of molecular structure and interactions.  Before the technology of [[fluorescent labeling]], [[radioisotopes]] were used to detect and identify molecular compounds.  Since then, safer methods have been developed that involve the use of fluorescent dyes or fluorescent proteins as tags or probes as a means to label and identify biomolecules.&lt;ref name="Gwynne and Page"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gwynne and Page|first=Peter and Guy|title=Laboratory Technology Trends: Fluorescence + Labeling|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/products/labtech.xhtml|publisher=Science|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although fluorescent tagging in this regard has only been recently utilized, the discovery of fluorescence has been around for a much longer time.

[[Sir George Stokes]] developed the Stokes Law of Fluorescence in 1852 which states that the wavelength of fluorescence emission is greater than that of the exciting radiation.  Richard Meyer then termed [[fluorophore]] in 1897 to describe a chemical group associated with fluorescence.  Since then, [[Fluorescein]] was created as a fluorescent dye by Adolph von Baeyer in 1871 and the method of staining was developed and utilized with the development of [[fluorescence microscopy]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="pmid19233914"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kricka LJ, Fortina P |title=Analytical ancestry: "firsts" in fluorescent labeling of nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids |journal=Clin.

Ethidium bromide and variants were developed in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="pmid19233914"/&gt; and in 1994, fluorescent proteins or FPs were introduced.&lt;ref name="urlChemical Tags for Labeling Proteins Inside Living Cells"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=3232020 |title=Chemical Tags for Labeling Proteins Inside Living Cells | pmid=21879706 |doi=10.1021/ar200099f |volume=44 |issue=9 |year=2011 |journal=Acc.

New methods for tracking biomolecules have been developed including the use of colorimetric biosensors, photochromic compounds, [[biomaterials]], and electrochemical sensors.  [[Fluorescent labeling]] is also a common method in which applications have expanded to enzymatic labeling, chemical labeling, [[protein tag|protein labeling]], and genetic labeling.&lt;ref name=Sahoo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahoo|first=Harekrushna|title=Fluorescent labeling techniques in biomolecules: a flashback|journal=[[RSC Advances]]|date=1 January 2012|volume=2|issue=18|pages=7017–7029|doi=10.1039/C2RA20389H|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/pdf/article/2012/ra/c2ra20389h|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods for tracking biomolecules==
There are currently several labeling methods for tracking biomolecules.  Some of the methods include the following.

===Isotope markers===
Common species that isotope markers are used for include proteins. In this case, amino acids with stable isotopes of either carbon, nitrogen, or hydrogen are incorporated into polypeptide sequences.&lt;ref name="Mass Tagging Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xian|author2=Smith, Lloyd M. |author3=Bradbury, E. Morton |title=Site-Specific Mass Tagging with Stable Isotopes in Proteins for Accurate and Efficient Protein Identification|journal=Analytical Chemistry|date=1 March 2000|volume=72|issue=6|pages=1134–1143|doi=10.1021/ac9911600|pmid=10740850}}&lt;/ref&gt; These polypeptides are then put through [[mass spectrometry]]. Because of the exact defined change that these isotopes incur on the peptides, it is possible to tell through the spectrometry graph which peptides contained the isotopes. By doing so, one can extract the protein of interest from several others in a group. Isotopic compounds play an important role as photochromes, described below.

===Colorimetric biosensors===
Biosensors are attached to a substance of interest. Normally, this substance would not be able to absorb light, but with the attached biosensor, light can be absorbed and emitted on a [[spectrophotometer]].&lt;ref name=colorassay&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorimetric Assays|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/methods/protein/protcurve.html|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, biosensors that are fluorescent can be viewed with the naked eye. Some fluorescent biosensors also have the ability to change color in changing environments (ex: from blue to red). A researcher would be able to inspect and get data about the surrounding environment based on what color he or she could see visibly from the biosensor-molecule hybrid species.&lt;ref name="Biosensor Vesicles Revital"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halevy, Revital|author2=Sofiya Kolusheval |author3=Robert E.W. Hancock |author4=Raz Jelinek |title=Colorimetric Biosensor Vesicles for Biotechnological Applications|journal=Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings.| volume = 724. Biological and Biomimetic Materials - Properties to Function|year=2002|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/p014413.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorimetric assays are normally used to determine how much concentration of one species there is relative to another.&lt;ref name=colorassay /&gt;

===Photochromic compounds===
[[Photochromic]] compounds have the ability to switch between a range or variety of colors. Their ability to display different colors lies in how they absorb light. Different isomeric manifestations of the molecule absorbs different wavelengths of light, so that each isomeric species can display a different color based on its absorption. These include photoswitchable compounds, which are proteins that can switch from a non-fluorescent state to that of a fluorescent one given a certain environment.&lt;ref name="Lummer Photoswitchable"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lummer|first=M|author2=Humpert, F |author3=Wiedenlüebbert, M |author4=Sauer, M |author5=Schüettpelz, M |author6= Staiger, D |title=A new set of reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins for use in transgenic plants|journal=Molecular Plant|date=Feb 23, 2013|pmid=23434876|doi=10.1093/mp/sst040|volume=6|issue=5|pages=1518–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common organic molecule to be used as a photochrome is [[diarylethene]].&lt;ref name="Perrier photochrome"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrier|first=Aurélie|author2=Maurel, François |author3=Jacquemin, Denis |title=Single Molecule Multiphotochromism with Diarylethenes|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=21 August 2012|volume=45|issue=8|pages=1173–1182|doi=10.1021/ar200214k|pmid=22668009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of photoswitchable proteins include PADRON-C, rs-FastLIME-s and bs-DRONPA-s, which can be used in plant and mammalian cells alike to watch cells move into different environments.&lt;ref name="Lummer Photoswitchable" /&gt;

===Biomaterials===
Fluorescent biomaterials are a possible way of using external factors to observe a pathway more visibly. The method involves fluorescently labeling peptide molecules that would alter an organism's natural pathway. When this peptide is inserted into the organism's cell, it can induce a different reaction. This method can be used, for example to treat a patient and then visibly see the treatment's outcome.&lt;ref name="Zhang Biomaterials"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yi|author2=Yang, Jian|title=Design strategies for fluorescent biodegradable polymeric biomaterials|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry B|date=1 January 2013|volume=1|issue=2|pages=132–148|doi=10.1039/C2TB00071G|pmid=23710326|pmc=3660738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrochemical sensors===
Electrochemical sensors can used for label-free sensing of biomolecules.  They detect changes and measure current between a probed metal electrode and an electrolyte containing the target analyte.  A known potential to the electrode is then applied from a feedback current and the resulting current can be measured.  For example, one technique using electrochemical sensing includes slowly raising the voltage causing chemical species at the electrode to be oxidized or reduced.  Cell current vs voltage is plotted which can ultimately identify the quantity of chemical species consumed or produced at the electrode.&lt;ref name="urlbioee.ee.columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioee.ee.columbia.edu/downloads/2007/7.pdf |title=bioee.ee.columbia.edu |format= |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorescent tags can be used in conjunction with electrochemical sensors for ease of detection in a biological system.

===Fluorescent labels===
[[File:Aequorea victoria.jpg|thumb|200px|''Aequorea victoria'']]
[[File:GFP structure.png|thumb|200px|GFP structure]]

Of the various methods of labeling biomolecules, fluorescent labels are advantageous in that they are highly sensitive even at low concentration and non-destructive to the target molecule folding and function.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;

[[Green fluorescent protein]] is a naturally occurring fluorescent protein from the jellyfish ''Aequorea victoria'' that is widely 
used to tag proteins of interest.  GFP emits a photon in the green region of the light spectrum when excited by the absorption of light.  The [[chromophore]] consists of an oxidized tripeptide -Ser^65-Tyr^66-Gly^67 located within a β barrel.  GFP catalyzes the oxidation and
only requires molecular oxygen.  GFP has been modified by changing the wavelength of light absorbed to include other colors of fluorescence.  YFP or [[yellow fluorescent protein]], BFP or [[blue fluorescent protein]], and CFP or [[cyan fluorescent protein]] are examples of GFP variants.  These variants are produced by the genetic engineering of the GFP gene.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-7108-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cox, Michael |author2=Nelson, David R. |author3=Lehninger, Albert L |title=Lehninger principles of biochemistry |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7167-7108-1 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic fluorescent probes can also be used as fluorescent labels.  Advantages of these labels include a smaller size with more variety in color.  They can be used to tag proteins of interest more selectively by various methods including chemical recognition-based labeling, such as utilizing metal-chelating peptide tags, and biological recognition-based labeling utilizing enzymatic reactions.&lt;ref name="pmid23318293"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jung D, Min K, Jung J, Jang W, Kwon Y |title=Chemical biology-based approaches on fluorescent labeling of proteins in live cells |journal=Mol Biosyst |volume= 9|issue= 5|pages= 862–72|date=January 2013 |pmid=23318293 |doi=10.1039/c2mb25422k }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite their wide array of excitation and emission wavelengths as well as better stability, synthetic probes tend to be toxic to the cell and so are not generally used in cell imaging studies.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;

Fluorescent labels can be hybridized to mRNA to help visualize interaction and activity, such as mRNA localization. An antisense strand labeled with the fluorescent probe is attached to a single mRNA strand, and can then be viewed during cell development to see the movement of mRNA within the cell.&lt;ref name="Weil mRNA visualization"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weil|first=Timothy T.|author2=Parton, Richard M. |author3=Davis, Ilan |title=Making the message clear: visualizing mRNA localization|journal=Trends in Cell Biology|date=1 July 2010|volume=20|issue=7|pages=380–390|doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2010.03.006|pmid=20444605|pmc=2902723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluorogen labels ===
A fluorogen is ligand (fluorogenic ligand) which is not itself fluorescent, but when it is bound by a specific protein or RNA structure becomes fluorescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=April 2008|title=Fluorogen-activating single-chain antibodies for imaging cell surface proteins|url=|journal=[[Nat.

==Use of tags in fluorescent labeling==

Fluorescent labeling is known for its non-destructive nature and high sensitivity.  This has made it one of the most widely used methods for labeling and tracking biomolecules.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;  Several techniques of fluorescent labeling can be utilized depending on the nature of the target.

===Enzymatic labeling===
In enzymatic labeling, a DNA construct is first formed, using a gene and the DNA of a fluorescent protein.&lt;ref name=Biotechniques&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Richter |author2=C. Schwager |author3=S. Hentze |author4=W. Ansorge |author5=M.W. Hentze |author6=M. Muckenthaler |title=Comparison of Fluorescent Tag DNA  Labeling Methods Used for Expression  Analysis by DNA Microarrays|journal=BioTechniques |volume=33 |pages=620–630|year=2002|url=http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00011/02333rr05_11834a.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After transcription, a hybrid RNA + fluorescent is formed. The object of interest is attached to an enzyme that can recognize this hybrid DNA. Usually fluorescein or biotin is used as the fluorophore.

===Chemical labeling===
Chemical labeling or the use of chemical tags utilizes the interaction between a small molecule and a specific genetic amino acid sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid21567974"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wombacher R, Cornish VW |title=Chemical tags: applications in live cell fluorescence imaging |journal=J Biophotonics |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=391–402 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21567974 |doi=10.1002/jbio.201100018 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical labeling is sometimes used as an alternative for GFP. Synthetic proteins that function as fluorescent probes are smaller than GFP's, and therefore can function as probes in a wider variety of situations. Moreover, they offer a wider range of colors and photochemical properties.&lt;ref name="chemical labelling Jung"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jung|first=Deokho|author2=Min, Kyoungmi |author3=Jung, Juyeon |author4=Jang, Wonhee |author5= Kwon, Youngeun |title=Chemical biology-based approaches on fluorescent labeling of proteins in live cells|journal=Molecular BioSystems|date=1 January 2013|volume=9|issue=5|pages=862–72|doi=10.1039/C2MB25422K|pmid=23318293}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  With recent advancements in chemical labeling, Chemical tags are preferred over fluorescent proteins due to the architectural and size limitations of the fluorescent protein's characteristic β-barrel.  Alterations of fluorescent proteins would lead to loss of fluorescent properties.&lt;ref name="pmid21567974"/&gt;

===Protein labeling===
Protein labeling uses a short tag to minimize disruption of protein folding and function.  Transition metals are used to link specific residues in the tags to site-specific targets such as the N-termini, C-termini, or internal sites within the protein. Examples of tags used for protein labeling include biarsenical tags, Histidine tags, and FLAG tags.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"/&gt;

===Genetic labeling===
[[Fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH), is an example of a genetic labeling technique that utilizes probes that are specific for chromosomal sites along the length of a chromosome, also known as [[chromosome painting]].  Multiple fluorescent dyes that each have a distinct excitation and emission wavelength are bound to a probe which is then hybridized to chromosomes.  A fluorescence microscope can detect the dyes present and send it to a computer that can reveal the karyotype of a cell.  This technique allows abnormalities such as deletions and duplications to be revealed.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4292-3413-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Matthew P Scott |author2=Lodish, Harvey F. |author3=Arnold Berk |author4=Kaiser, Chris |author5=Monty Krieger |author6=Anthony Bretscher |author7=Hidde Ploegh |author8=Angelika Amon |title=Molecular Cell Biology |publisher=W. H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2012 |pages= |isbn=978-1-4292-3413-9 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell imaging==
Chemical tags have been tailored for imaging technologies more so than fluorescent proteins because chemical tags can localize photosensitizers closer to the target proteins.{{cn|date=September 2018}}  Proteins can then be labeled and detected with imaging such as [[super-resolution microscopy]], [[Calcium imaging|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-imaging]], pH sensing, hydrogen peroxide detection, chromophore assisted light inactivation, and multi-photon light microscopy.  [[In vivo]] imaging studies in live animals have been performed for the first time with the use of a [[monomeric]] protein derived from the bacterial haloalkane dehalogenase known as the Halo-tag.&lt;ref name="pmid21567974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23115610"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=N Peterson S, Kwon K |title=The HaloTag: Improving Soluble Expression and Applications in Protein Functional Analysis |journal=Curr Chem Genomics |volume=6 |issue= 1|pages=8–17 |year=2012 |pmid=23115610 |pmc=3480702 |doi=10.2174/1875397301206010008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Halo-tag [[covalently]] links to its [[ligand]] and allows for better expression of soluble proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid23115610"/&gt;

==Advantages==
Although fluorescent dyes may not have the same sensitivity as radioactive probes, they are able to show real-time activity of molecules in action.&lt;ref name=FlourescentAdvantages&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proudnikov|first=Dmitri|author2=Andrei Mirzabekov|title=Chemical methods of DNA and RNA fluorescent labeling|journal=Oxford University Press|year=1996|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC146275/pdf/244535.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2013|pmc=146275|pmid=8948646|volume=24|issue=22|pages=4535–42|doi=10.1093/nar/24.22.4535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, radiation and appropriate handling is no longer a concern.

With the development of fluorescent tagging, [[fluorescent microscopy]] has allowed the visualization of specific proteins in both fixed and live cell images. Localization of specific proteins has led to important concepts in cellular biology such as the functions of distinct groups of proteins in cellular membranes and organelles.  In live cell imaging, fluorescent tags enable movements of proteins and their interactions to be monitored.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4292-3413-X"/&gt;

Latest advances in methods involving fluorescent tags have led to the visualization of [[mRNA]] and its localization within various organisms.  Live cell imaging of RNA can be achieved by introducing synthesized RNA that is chemically coupled with a fluorescent tag into living cells by microinjection.  This technique was used to show how the ''oskar'' mRNA in the ''[[Drosophila]]'' embryo localizes to the [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] region of the [[oocyte]].&lt;ref name="urlMaking the message clear: visualizing mRNA localization"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2902723 |title=Making the message clear: visualizing mRNA localization | pmid=20444605 |doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2010.03.006 |volume=20 |issue=7 |date=Jul 2010 |journal=Trends Cell Biol |pages=380–90 | last1 = Weil | first1 = TT | last2 = Parton | first2 = RM | last3 = Davis | first3 = I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PeterFendi Erotic Scene.jpg|thumb|right|Two couples in a foursome. [[Painting]] by [[Peter Fendi]].]]
A '''foursome''' is a form of [[group sex]] involving four people of any gender combination.

==Types of foursomes==
The level of sexual activity among the four members may vary greatly. Other foursomes may involve some same sex contact, and some foursomes actively involve all four members.

===Wife Swapping===
'''Wife swapping''' Involves two couples, usually both married heterosexual pairs, where each man ''swaps'' his wife for the other, and has sexual intercourse with her. There is usually no sexual contact between the two wives or the two husbands. Although this act is named for married couples, it applies equally to unmarried and homosexual couples. Wife swapping is sometimes simply called "swapping" as some people find the term "wife swapping" degrading to women and implies treating them as objects.

===Soft Swinging===
'''Soft swinging''' involves two couples, where either one couple has a [[voyeurism|voyeuristic]] role watching the other have sex, or the couples each have sex but with no sexual contact between the two pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Swinging for Beginners | first=Kaye | last=Bellemeade | publisher=New Tradition Books | year=2003 | isbn=0-9728473-4-0 | pages=89–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Freak Nation: A Field Guide to 101 of the Most Odd, Extreme, and Outrageous American Subcultures | first=Kate | last=Stevens | publisher=Adams Media | year=2010 | isbn=1-4405-0646-9 | page=191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gangbangs===
{{main|Gang bang}}
A '''gang bang''' involves three (or more) people having sex with a fourth successively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gangbangs and drive-bys: grounded culture and juvenile gang violence | series=Social problems and social issues | first=William B. | last=Sanders | publisher=Transaction Publishers | year=1994 | isbn=0-202-30537-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This usually occurs with men penetrating women, but can equally apply to homosexual acts, or women penetrating men using [[Strap-on dildo]]s.

===Airtight seal===
The ''airtight seal'' involves [[sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]] and [[anal sex]] performed on a woman by two men in a [[List of sex positions#Multiple_penetration|double penetration]], while the woman performs [[fellatio]] on a third man.

===Quads===
A '''quad''' is a [[Romantic love|romantic relationship]] involving four people. It is most commonly used to describe a love relationship between two couples where it takes the form of a [[Square (geometry)|square]], in which all four people have a love relationship with each other.

While it can refer to two people independently romantically linked with two others, it usually implies that each of the four people has some kind of [[sexual relationship]] to the other three. The relationships are normally friendships, though romantic. Addition of [[bisexuality|bisexual]] or [[homosexual]] characters adds many possible combinations of sexes, and of romantic and sexual interactions.

Fungistatics have applications in agriculture, the food industry, the paint industry, and medicine.

== Anti-fungal medicines ==
[[Fluconazole]] is a fungistatic antifungal medication that is administered orally or intravenously. It is used to treat a variety of fungal infections, especially Candida infections of the vagina ("yeast infections'), mouth, throat, and bloodstream. It is also used to prevent infections in people with weak immune systems, including those with neutropenia due to cancer chemotherapy, transplant patients, and premature babies. Its mechanism of action involves interfering with synthesis of the fungal cell membrane.

[[Itraconazole]] (R51211), invented in 1984, is a triazole fungistatic antifungal agent prescribed to patients with fungal infections. The drug may be given orally or intravenously. Itraconazole has a broader spectrum of activity than fluconazole (but not as broad as voriconazole or posaconazole). In particular, it is active against Aspergillus, which fluconazole is not. The mechanism of action of itraconazole is the same as the other [[azole]] antifungals: it inhibits the fungal-mediated synthesis of [[ergosterol]].

== Anti-fungal food preservatives ==
[[Sodium benzoate]] and [[potassium sorbate]] are both examples of fungistatic substances that are widely used in the preservation of food and beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fbcindustries.com/Sodium_Benzoate.aspx | title=Sodium Benzoate | publisher=FBC Industries, Inc. | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/40abcj15.htm | title=Toxicological evaluation of some antimicrobials, antioxidants, emulsifiers, stabilizers, flour-treatment agents, acids, and bases | publisher=International Programme on Chemical Safety (INCHEM) | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender Park''' is an autonomous institution promoted by the Department of Social Justice, [[Government of Kerala|Government of Kerala State]], [[India]], to resolve the gender inequity in development. The institution has its headquarters at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]] and its [[Chief Executive Officer]] is [[P.T.Mohammed Sunish]] who is also the [[Managing Director]] of Kerala State Women's Development Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appointed KSWDC managing director|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/appointed-kswdc-managing-director/article5458234.ece|accessdate=26 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the [[objective (goal)|objective]]s of the institution are :

* To generate a space exclusively for women development activities, emphasizing entrepreneurship in service and cultural activities.
* To undertake research and documentation of the history and current trends in gender in different spheres of society through the Gender Park's International Institute for Gender and Development (IIGD). The IIGD is involved in research on gender at the local, national and international level, and aims to provide formal education in gender studies. 
* To strengthen women development activities undertaken by various departments/agencies/civil society movements, such as She-Taxi.

The Gender Park campus is located at [[Vellimadukunnu]] in [[Kozhikkode District]] in Kerala. The foundation stone for the Park was laid on 8 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bureau Report|title=‘Gender park' coming up in Kozhikode|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/gender-park-coming-up-in-kozhikode/article2817735.ece|accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=The Hindu: Business Line|date=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internal heat''' is the [[heat]] source from the interior of [[celestial object]]s, such as [[star]]s, [[brown dwarf]]s, [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, and (in the early history of the [[Solar System]]) even [[asteroid]]s such as [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], resulting from contraction caused by [[Gravitation|gravity]] (the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]]), [[nuclear fusion]], [[tidal heating]], core solidification ([[heat of fusion]] released as molten core material solidifies), and [[radioactive decay]]. The amount of internal heating depends on [[mass]]; the more massive the object, the more internal heat it has; also, for a given density, the more massive the object, the greater the ratio of mass to surface area, and thus the greater the retention of internal heat.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The internal heating keeps celestial objects warm and active.

== Small celestial objects ==

In the early history of the Solar System, [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotope]]s having a [[half-life]] on the order of a few million years (such as [[aluminium-26]] and [[Isotopes of iron#Iron-60|iron-60]]) were sufficiently abundant to produce enough heat to cause internal melting of some moons and even some asteroids, such as Vesta noted above.  After these radioactive isotopes had decayed to insignificant levels, the heat generated by longer-lived radioactive isotopes (such as [[potassium#Isotopes|potassium-40]], [[thorium#Isotopes|thorium-232]], and [[uranium#Isotopes|uranium-235 and uranium-238]]) was insufficient to keep these bodies molten unless they had an alternative source of internal heating, such as tidal heating.  Thus, Earth's [[Moon]], which has no alternative source of internal heating is now geologically dead, whereas a moon as small as [[Enceladus]] that has sufficient tidal heating (or at least had it recently) and some remaining radioactive heating, is able to maintain an active and directly detectable [[cryovolcanism]].

== Planets ==

=== Terrestrial planets ===
The internal heating within [[terrestrial planet]]s powers [[tectonic]] and [[volcanic]] activities. Of the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, [[Earth]] has the most internal heating because it is the most massive. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Mars]] have no ongoing visible surface effects of internal heating because they are only 5 and 11% the mass of Earth respectively; they are nearly "geologically dead" (however, see [[Mercury's magnetic field]] and [[Geological history of Mars]]).  Earth, being more massive, has a great enough ratio of mass to surface area for its internal heating to drive [[plate tectonics]] and [[volcanism]].

=== Gas giants ===
The [[gas giant]]s have much greater internal heating than terrestrial planets, due to their greater mass and greater compressibility making more energy available from gravitational contraction. [[Jupiter]], the most massive planet in the Solar System, has the most internal heating, with core temperature estimated to be 36,000 K. For the outer planets of the Solar System, internal heating powers the [[weather]] and [[wind]] instead of [[sunlight]] that powers the weather for terrestrial planets. The internal heating within gas giant planets raise temperatures higher than [[effective temperature]]s, as in the case of Jupiter, this makes 40 K warmer than given effective temperature. A combination of external and internal heating (which may be a combination of tidal heating and electromagnetic heating) is thought to make giant planets that orbit very close to their stars ([[hot Jupiter]]s) into "[[puffy planet]]s" (external heating is not thought to be sufficient by itself).

== Brown dwarfs ==
[[Brown dwarf]]s have greater internal heating than gas giants but not as great as stars. The internal heating within brown dwarfs (initially generated by gravitational contraction) is great enough to ignite and sustain fusion of [[deuterium]] with [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]]; for the largest brown dwarfs, it is also enough to ignite and sustain fusion of [[lithium]] with hydrogen, but not fusion of hydrogen with itself. Like gas giants, brown dwarfs can have weather and wind powered by internal heating. Brown dwarfs are substellar objects not massive enough to sustain hydrogen-1 fusion reactions in their cores, unlike main-sequence stars. Brown dwarfs occupy the mass range between the heaviest gas giants and the lightest stars, with an upper limit around 75 to 80 Jupiter masses (MJ). Brown dwarfs heavier than about 13 MJ are thought to fuse deuterium and those above ~65 MJ, fuse lithium as well.

== Stars ==
The internal heating within stars is so great that (after an initial phase of gravitational contraction) they ignite and sustain thermonuclear reaction of hydrogen (with itself) to form [[helium]], and can make heavier [[chemical element|elements]] (see [[Stellar nucleosynthesis]]). The [[Sun]] for example has a core temperature of 13,600,000 K. The more massive and older the stars are, the more internal heating they have. During the end of its lifecycle, the internal heating of a star increases dramatically, caused by the change of composition of the core as successive fuels for fusion are consumed, and the resulting contraction (accompanied by faster consumption of the remaining fuel). Depending upon the mass of the star, the core may become hot enough to fuse helium (forming [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] and traces of heavier elements), and for sufficiently massive stars even large quantities of heavier elements. Fusion to produce elements heavier than [[iron]] and [[nickel]] no longer produces energy, and since stellar cores massive enough to attain the temperatures required to produce these elements are too massive to form stable [[white dwarf]] stars, a [[core collapse supernova]] results, producing a [[neutron star]] or a [[black hole]], depending upon the mass.  Heat generated by the collapse is trapped within a neutron star and only escapes slowly, due to the small surface area; heat cannot be conducted out of a black hole at all (however, see [[Hawking radiation]]).

The '''Master of Animals''' or '''Lord of Animals''' is a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in ancient art showing a human between and grasping two [[confronted animals]]. It is very widespread in the art of the Ancient Near East and Egypt.  The figure is normally male, but not always, the animals may be realistic or fantastical, and the figure may have animal elements such as horns, or an animal upper body.  Unless he is shown with specific divine attributes, he is typically described as a hero, although what the motif represented to the cultures which created the works probably varies greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Micah (ed), ''From the Banks of the Euphrates: Studies in Honor of Alice Louise Slotsky'', pp. 174-177, 2008, Eisenbrauns, {{ISBN|1575061449}}, 9781575061443, [https://books.google.com/books?id=edVOGJKa7XUC&amp;pg=PA176 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The motif is so widespread and visually effective that many depictions were probably conceived as decoration with only a vague meaning attached to them.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 75&lt;/ref&gt; The Master of Animals is the "favorite motif of [[Achaemenian]] official [[cylinder seal|seal]]s", but the figures in these cases should be understood as the king.&lt;ref&gt;Teissier, Beatrice, ''Ancient Near Eastern Cylinder Seals from the Marcopolic Collection'', p. 46, 1984, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0520049276}}, 9780520049277, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qu7WeaZA3VUC&amp;pg=PA46 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The human figure may be standing, found from the 4th millennium BC, or kneeling on one knee, these latter found from the 3rd millennium BC.  They are usually shown looking frontally, but in Assyrian pieces typically shown from the side.  Sometimes the animals are clearly alive, whether fairly passive and tamed, or still struggling or attacking. In other pieces they may represent dead hunter's prey.&lt;ref&gt;"Horse Cheekpiece" by "OWM", in ''Notable Acquisitions, 1980-1981'', pp. 7-8, 1981, Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0870992848}}, 9780870992841, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1qG1_i36TbwC&amp;pg=PA7 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other associated representations show a figure controlling or "taming" a single animal, usually to the right of the figure. But the many representations of heroes or kings killing an animal are distinguished from these.&lt;ref&gt;Arruz, 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The motif takes pride of place at the top of the famous [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] in the Louvre, an ivory and flint knife dating from the [[Gerzeh culture|Naqada II d]] period of [[prehistoric Egypt|Egyptian prehistory]], which began c.3450 BC. Here a figure in Mesopotamian dress, often taken to be a god, grapples with two lions. It has been connected to the famous [[Pashupati seal]] from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (2500-1500 BC), showing a figure seated in a [[yoga]]-like posture, with a horned headress (or horns), and surrounded by animals.&lt;ref&gt;Werness, 270&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn is related to a figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], who sits with legs part-crossed, has antlers, is surrounded by animals and grasps a snake in one hand and a [[torc]] in the other.  This famous and puzzling object probably dates to 200 BC, or possibly as late as 300 AD, and though found in [[Denmark]] was perhaps made in [[Thrace]].

A form of the master of animals motif appears on an Early Medieval belt buckle from Kanton Wallis, Switzerland, which depicts the biblical figure of Daniel between two lions&lt;ref&gt;Gaimster, Marit. 1998. Vendel period bracteates on Gotland. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

The [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|purse-lid from the Sutton Hoo burial]] of about 620 AD has two plaques with a man between two wolves, and the motif is common in [[Anglo-Saxon art]] and related Early Medieval styles, where the animals generally remain aggressive. Other notable examples of the motif in Germanic art include one of the [[Torslunda plates]], and helmets from [[Vendel]] and [[Valsgärde]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaimster, Marit. 1998. Vendel period bracteates on Gotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[art of Mesopotamia]] the motif appears very early, usually with a "naked hero", for example at [[Uruk]] in the [[Uruk period]] (c. 4000 to 3100 BC), but was "outmoded in Mesopotamia by the seventh century BC".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 30-31 (Uruk), 75, 78-79, 347 (2nd quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Luristan bronze]]s the motif is extremely common, and often highly stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 343-347&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of its composition the Master of Animals motif compares with another very common motif in the art of the [[ancient Near East]] and Mediterranean, that of two [[confronted animals]] flanking and grazing on a [[Tree of Life]].

Although such figures are not all, or even usually, deities, the term can also be a generic name for a number of deities from a variety of cultures with close relationships to the animal kingdom or in part animal form (in cultures where that is not the norm). These figures control animals, usually wild ones, and are responsible for their continued reproduction and availability for hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel&lt;/ref&gt;  They sometimes also have female equivalents, the so-called [[Mistress of the Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Arruz, 303-304&lt;/ref&gt; Many Mesopotamian examples may represent [[Enkidu]], a central figure in the [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.  They may all have a [[Stone Age]] precursor who was probably a hunter's deity.  Many relate to the [[horned deity]] of the [[Hunting|hunt]], another common type, typified by [[Cernunnos]], and a variety of stag, bull, ram and goat gods. Horned gods are not universal however, and in some cultures bear gods, like [[Arktos]] might take the role, or even the more [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] deities who lead the [[Wild Hunt]]. Such figures are also often referred to as 'Lord of the forest'* or 'Lord of the mountain'.

''[[Potnia Theron]]'', a phrase used by [[Homer]] meaning "Mistress of the Animals" is used for early Greek depictions of goddesses, usually [[Artemis]], holding animals. The Greek god shown as "Master of Animals" is usually [[Apollo]], the god of hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Arruz, 303-304, 308&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiva]] has the epithet [[Pashupati]] meaning the "Lord of cattle", and these figures may derive from a [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European deity]] or [[archetype]].&lt;ref&gt;Werness, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  Chapter 39 of the [[Book of Job]] has been interpreted as an assertion of the God of the [[Hebrew Bible]] as Master of Animals.&lt;ref&gt;Doak, Brian R., ''Consider Leviathan: Narratives of Nature and the Self in Job'', 2014, Fortress Press, {{ISBN|145148951X}}, 9781451489514, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QB7qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT235 google books]; [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2039&amp;version=NIV Job:39, NIV]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurogenesis in mammals ==

===Developmental neurogenesis===
During embryonic development, the [[mammal]]ian [[central nervous system]] (CNS; [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]) is derived from the [[neural tube]], which contains NSCs that will later generate [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore|last3=Helsinki|first3=the University of|title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf4RA6l3keoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neurogenesis doesn't begin until a sufficient population of NSCs has been achieved. These early stem cells are called neuroepithelial cells (NEC)s, but soon take on a highly elongated radial morphology and are then known as radial glial cells (RGC)s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore|last3=Helsinki|first3=the University of|title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf4RA6l3keoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; RGCs are the primary stem cells of the mammalian CNS, and reside in the embryonic [[ventricular zone]], which lies adjacent to the central fluid-filled cavity ([[ventricular system]]) of the [[neural tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakic|first1=P|title=Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=October 2009|volume=10|issue=10|pages=724–35|pmid=19763105|doi=10.1038/nrn2719|pmc=2913577|url=http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2913577?pdf=render|format=Accepted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lui|first1=JH|last2=Hansen|first2=DV|last3=Kriegstein|first3=AR|title=Development and evolution of the human neocortex|journal=Cell|date=8 July 2011|volume=146|issue=1|pages=18–36|pmid=21729779|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.06.030|pmc=3610574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following RGC proliferation, neurogenesis involves a final cell division of the parent RGC, which produces one of two possible outcomes. First, this may generate a subclass of neuronal progenitors called intermediate neuronal precursors (INP)s, which will divide one or more additional times to produce neurons. Alternatively, daughter neurons may be produced directly. Neurons do not immediately form neural circuits through the growth of axons and dendrites. Instead, newborn neurons must first [[Neuronal migration|migrate]] long distances to their final destinations, maturing and finally generating neural circuitry. For example, neurons born in the [[ventricular zone]] migrate radially to the [[cortical plate]], which is where neurons accumulate to form the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakic|first1=P|title=Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=October 2009|volume=10|issue=10|pages=724–35|pmid=19763105|doi=10.1038/nrn2719|pmc=2913577|url=http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2913577?pdf=render|format=Accepted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lui|first1=JH|last2=Hansen|first2=DV|last3=Kriegstein|first3=AR|title=Development and evolution of the human neocortex|journal=Cell|date=8 July 2011|volume=146|issue=1|pages=18–36|pmid=21729779|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.06.030|pmc=3610574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the generation of neurons occurs in a specific tissue compartment or 'neurogenic niche' occupied by their parent stem cells.

The rate of neurogenesis and the type of neuron generated (broadly, excitatory or inhibitory) are principally determined by molecular and genetic factors. These factors notably include the [[Notch signaling pathway]], and many [[gene]]s have been linked to Notch pathway [[regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kageyama|first1=R|last2=Ohtsuka|first2=T|last3=Shimojo|first3=H|last4=Imayoshi|first4=I|title=Dynamic Notch signaling in neural progenitor cells and a revised view of lateral inhibition|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=November 2008|volume=11|issue=11|pages=1247–51|pmid=18956012|doi=10.1038/nn.2208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rash|first1=BG|last2=Lim|first2=HD|last3=Breunig|first3=JJ|last4=Vaccarino|first4=FM|title=FGF signaling expands embryonic cortical surface area by regulating Notch-dependent neurogenesis|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=26 October 2011|volume=31|issue=43|pages=15604–17|pmid=22031906|doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4439-11.2011|pmc=3235689}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes and mechanisms involved in regulating neurogenesis are the subject of intensive research in academic, [[pharmaceutical]], and government settings worldwide.

The amount of time required to generate all the neurons of the CNS varies widely across mammals, and brain neurogenesis is not always complete by the time of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore|last3=Helsinki|first3=the University of|title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf4RA6l3keoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, mice undergo cortical neurogenesis from about embryonic day (post-conceptional day) (E)11 to E17, and are born at about E19.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbott|first1=David M.

===Adult neurogenesis===

[[Adult neurogenesis]] has been shown to occur at low levels compared with development, and in only two regions of the brain: the adult [[subventricular zone]] (SVZ) of the [[striatum]], and the [[dentate gyrus]] of the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=A|last2=Alkass|first2=K|last3=Bernard|first3=S|last4=Salehpour|first4=M|last5=Perl|first5=S|last6=Tisdale|first6=J|last7=Possnert|first7=G|last8=Druid|first8=H|last9=Frisén|first9=J|title=Neurogenesis in the striatum of the adult human brain|journal=Cell|date=27 February 2014|volume=156|issue=5|pages=1072–83|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.044|pmid=24561062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=DA|last2=Alvarez-Buylla|first2=A|title=The Adult Ventricular-Subventricular Zone (V-SVZ) and Olfactory Bulb (OB) Neurogenesis|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|date=2 May 2016|volume=8|issue=5|pages=a018820|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a018820|pmid=27048191|pmc=4852803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alvarez-Buylla|first1=A|last2=Lim|first2=DA|title=For the long run: maintaining germinal niches in the adult brain|journal=Neuron|date=4 March 2004|volume=41|issue=5|pages=683–6|pmid=15003168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subventricular zone====

In many mammals, including for example rodents, the [[olfactory bulb]] is a brain region containing [[Olfactory receptor neuron|cells that detect smell]], featuring integration of adult-born neurons, which migrate from the SVZ of the [[striatum]] to the olfactory bulb through the [[rostral migratory stream]] (RMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=A|last2=Alkass|first2=K|last3=Bernard|first3=S|last4=Salehpour|first4=M|last5=Perl|first5=S|last6=Tisdale|first6=J|last7=Possnert|first7=G|last8=Druid|first8=H|last9=Frisén|first9=J|title=Neurogenesis in the striatum of the adult human brain|journal=Cell|date=27 February 2014|volume=156|issue=5|pages=1072–83|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.044|pmid=24561062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ming 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ming|first=GL|author2=Song, H |title=Adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain: significant answers and significant questions|journal=Neuron|date=May 26, 2011|volume=70|issue=4|pages=687–702|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.05.001|pmid=21609825|pmc=3106107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The migrating neuroblasts in the olfactory bulb become [[interneuron]]s that help the brain communicate with these sensory cells. The majority of those interneurons are inhibitory [[granule cell]]s, but a small number are [[periglomerular cell]]s. In the adult SVZ, the primary neural stem cells are SVZ astrocytes rather than RGCs. Most of these adult neural stem cells lie dormant in the adult, but in response to certain signals, these dormant cells, or B cells, go through a series of stages, first producing proliferating cells, or C cells.

Significant neurogenesis also occurs during adulthood in the [[hippocampus]] of many mammals, from [[rodent]]s to some [[primate]]s, although its existence in adult humans is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorrells|first1=SF|last2=Paredes|first2=MF|last3=Cebrian-Silla|first3=A|last4=Sandoval|first4=K|last5=Qi|first5=D|last6=Kelley|first6=KW|last7=James|first7=D|last8=Mayer|first8=S|last9=Chang|first9=J|last10=Auguste|first10=KI|last11=Chang|first11=EF|last12=Gutierrez|first12=AJ|last13=Kriegstein|first13=AR|last14=Mathern|first14=GW|last15=Oldham|first15=MC|last16=Huang|first16=EJ|last17=Garcia-Verdugo|first17=JM|last18=Yang|first18=Z|last19=Alvarez-Buylla|first19=A|title=Human hippocampal neurogenesis drops sharply in children to undetectable levels in adults|journal=Nature|date=15 March 2018|volume=555|issue=7696|pages=377–381|doi=10.1038/nature25975|pmid=29513649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boldrini|first1=M|last2=Fulmore|first2=CA|last3=Tartt|first3=AN|last4=Simeon|first4=LR|last5=Pavlova|first5=I|last6=Poposka|first6=V|last7=Rosoklija|first7=GB|last8=Stankov|first8=A|last9=Arango|first9=V|last10=Dwork|first10=AJ|last11=Hen|first11=R|last12=Mann|first12=JJ|title=Human Hippocampal Neurogenesis Persists throughout Aging|journal=Cell Stem Cell|date=5 April 2018|volume=22|issue=4|pages=589–599.e5|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2018.03.015|pmid=29625071|pmc=5957089}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hippocampus plays a crucial role in the formation of new declarative memories, and it has been theorized that the reason human infants cannot form declarative memories is because they are still undergoing extensive neurogenesis in the hippocampus and their memory-generating circuits are immature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Josselyn|first=Sheena A.|last2=Frankland|first2=Paul W.|date=2012-09-01|title=Infantile amnesia: A neurogenic hypothesis|url=http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/19/9/423|journal=Learning &amp; Memory|language=en|volume=19|issue=9|pages=423–433|doi=10.1101/lm.021311.110|issn=1072-0502|pmid=22904373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many environmental factors, such as exercise, stress, and antidepressants have been reported to change the rate of neurogenesis within the hippocampus of rodents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Nicola D.|last2=Owens|first2=Michael J.|last3=Nemeroff|first3=Charles B.|date=2011-12-01|title=Depression, Antidepressants, and Neurogenesis: A Critical Reappraisal|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v36/n13/abs/npp2011220a.html|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|language=en|volume=36|issue=13|pages=2589–2602|doi=10.1038/npp.2011.220|issn=0893-133X|pmc=3230505|pmid=21937982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santarelli|first=Luca|last2=Saxe|first2=Michael|last3=Gross|first3=Cornelius|last4=Surget|first4=Alexandre|last5=Battaglia|first5=Fortunato|last6=Dulawa|first6=Stephanie|last7=Weisstaub|first7=Noelia|last8=Lee|first8=James|last9=Duman|first9=Ronald|date=2003-08-08|title=Requirement of Hippocampal Neurogenesis for the Behavioral Effects of Antidepressants|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/301/5634/805|journal=Science|language=en|volume=301|issue=5634|pages=805–809|doi=10.1126/science.1083328|issn=0036-8075|pmid=12907793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence indicates postnatal neurogenesis in the human hippocampus decreases sharply in newborns for the first year or two after birth, dropping to "undetectable levels in adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorrells|first1=SF|last2=Paredes|first2=MF|last3=Cebrian-Silla|first3=A|last4=Sandoval|first4=K|last5=Qi|first5=D|last6=Kelley|first6=KW|last7=James|first7=D|last8=Mayer|first8=S|last9=Chang|first9=J|last10=Auguste|first10=KI|last11=Chang|first11=EF|last12=Gutierrez|first12=AJ|last13=Kriegstein|first13=AR|last14=Mathern|first14=GW|last15=Oldham|first15=MC|last16=Huang|first16=EJ|last17=Garcia-Verdugo|first17=JM|last18=Yang|first18=Z|last19=Alvarez-Buylla|first19=A|title=Human hippocampal neurogenesis drops sharply in children to undetectable levels in adults|journal=Nature|date=15 March 2018|volume=555|issue=7696|pages=377–381|doi=10.1038/nature25975|pmid=29513649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Partridge Creek monster''' is the subject of a story by French writer Georges Dupuy describing alleged encounters with a large [[dinosaur]] at [[Partridge River (BC-Yukon)|Partridge Creek]], in the [[Yukon]] territory of [[Canada]].

==History==
According to a 1908 story by Georges Dupuy entitled "The Monster of Partridge Creek" published in the French journal ''[[Je sais tout]]'' and ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', banker James Lewis Buttler and miner Tom Leemore told him they were hunting moose near [[Clear Creek, Yukon|Clear Creek]] when the animals they were hunting began running away in fright. The men said they followed tracks, which they interpreted as being made by a large animal, into a deep rocky [[Canyon|gorge]]. The narrative asserts that Dupuy agreed to join the men, along with French missionary Father Pierre Lavagneux and five unnamed [[First Nations]] individuals, to search for the reported animal. According to the story, the group established a camp site overlooking a ravine near Partridge Creek where, for 10 minutes, they observed a creature described as 30 feet long with a hairy body. According to the French language version of the story, upon seeing it, a frightened Lavagneux exclaimed, "A [[ceratosaurus]]. It is the ceratosaurus of the Arctic Circle".&lt;ref name="Strand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tout" /&gt; 

Dupuy's story describes how he and Buttler were "the laughing stock of Golden City" for a month after they reported an encounter with a dinosaur, and that the ''Dawson Daily Nugget'' wrote a satirical article comparing him to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Dupuy's story includes a letter he allegedly later received from Lavagneux in which the missionary claimed to have spotted the creature again in the same area on December 24, 1907, carrying a dead [[Reindeer|caribou]] in its jaws and leaving tracks identical to previous ones.&lt;ref name="Strand"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dupuy |first=Georges |editor-last=Newnes |editor-first=George |date=July 1908 |title=The Monster of 'Partridge Creek' |url=https://archive.org/stream/TheStrandMagazineAnIllustratedMonthly/TheStrandMagazine1908bVol.XxxviJan-jun#page/n81/ |magazine=The Strand Magazine | publisher=George Newnes Ltd. |volume=36 |issue=211 |pages=73–79 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tout"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dupuy |first=Georges |date=15 April 1908 |title=Le Monstre de 'Partridge Creek' |trans-title=The Monster of "Partridge Creek" |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1029821/f416.item |magazine=[[Je sais tout]] |publisher=Pierre Lafitte &amp; Cie |location=Paris, France |language=French |volume=4 |issue=39 |pages=403–409 |via=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the September 1908 issue of ''Knowledge &amp; Illustrated Scientific News'', naturalist [[Richard Lydekker]] commented on the publication of Dupuy's story, noting the existence of carnivorous dinosaurs in northern Alaska "seems incredible to every scientific mind" and pointing out the "[[prima facie]] presumption" that "the larger dinosaurs were inhabitants of warm rather than of Arctic zones".&lt;ref name="Lydekker"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lydekker |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Lydekker |date=September 1908 |title=The Monster of Partridge Creek |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2834659?urlappend=%3Bseq=237 |journal=Knowledge &amp; Illustrated Scientific News |location=London, England |volume=5 |issue=9 |department=Zoology |page=219 |via=Hathi Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American comics artist [[Stephen R. Bissette]] calls the story "one slice of great northern Yukon territory fiction" and cites it as among early "Western/paleontology tales" involving protagonists facing still-living dinosaurs. According to Bissette, Dupuy's story is "enshrined as the real thing by certain cryptozooology circles".&lt;ref name="Lansdale2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lansdale |first=Joe R.|title=Red Range: A Wild Western Adventure |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE4rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT110 |date=19 July 2017 |publisher=IDW Publishing |isbn=978-1-68406-290-4 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political [[forecasting]]''' aims at predicting the outcome of elections.

== History ==
People have long been interested in predicting election outcomes. Quotes of betting odds on [[Pope|papal succession]] appear as early as 1503, when such wagering was already considered “an old practice.”&lt;ref&gt;Frederic J. Baumgartner. ''Behind Locked Doors: A History of Papal Elections''. New York, Palgrave, 2003 (pages 88 and 250).&lt;/ref&gt; Political betting also has a long history in Great Britain. As one prominent example, Charles James Fox, the late-eighteenth-century Whig statesman, was known as an inveterate gambler. His biographer, George Otto Trevelyan, noted that“(f)or ten years, from 1771 onwards, Charles Fox betted frequently, largely, and judiciously, on the social and political occurrences of the time.”&lt;ref&gt;George Otto Trevelyan. ''The Early History of Charles James Fox''. New York, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1880 (page 416).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of scientific polling in 1936, betting odds in the [[United States]] correlated strongly to vote results.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien. ''Markets vs. polls as election predictors: An historical assessment''. Electoral Studies 31 (2012) 532–539. Elsevier, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1936, [[opinion poll]]s have been a basic part of political forecasting. More recently, [[prediction market]]s have been formed, starting in 1988 with [[Iowa Electronic Markets]].

With the advent of statistical techniques, electoral data have become increasingly easy to handle. It is no surprise, then, that election forecasting has become a big business, for polling firms, news organizations, and betting markets as well as academic students of politics.&lt;ref name ="ef"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0023.xml|title= Election forecasting|last1= Stegmaier|first1= Mary|last2= Norpoth|first2= Helmut|date= 2013-09-30|access-date=2016-09-26|doi =10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic scholars have constructed models of voting behavior to forecast the outcomes of elections. These forecasts are derived from theories and empirical evidence about what matters to voters when they make electoral choices. The forecast models typically rely on a few predictors in highly aggregated form, with an emphasis on phenomena that change in the short-run, such as the state of the economy, so as to offer maximum leverage for predicting the result of a specific election.&lt;ref name = "ef"/&gt;

An early successful model which is still being used is [[The Keys to the White House]] by [[Allan Lichtman]]. Election forecasting in the United States was first brought to the attention of the wider public by [[Nate Silver]] and his [[FiveThirtyEight]] website in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]]. Currently, there are many competing models trying to predict the outcome of elections in the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], and elsewhere.

== Methods ==
===Averaging polls===

Combining poll data lowers the forecasting mistakes of a poll.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred G. Cuzan, J. Scott Armstrong, and Randall Jones, [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html "Combining Methods to Forecast the 2004 Presidential Election: The PollyVote"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130123102051/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html |date=2013-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political forecasting models include averaged poll results, such as the [[RealClearPolitics]] poll average.

===Poll damping===

Poll damping is when incorrect indicators of public opinion are not used in a forecast model. For instance, early in the campaign, polls are poor measures of the future choices of voters. The poll results closer to an election are a more accurate prediction.  Campbell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=James E.|title=Polls and Votes|journal=American Politics Quarterly|date=October 1996|volume=24|issue=4|pages=408–433|doi=10.1177/1532673X9602400402|url=http://apr.sagepub.com/content/24/4/408.abstract|accessdate=11 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the power of poll damping in political forecasting.

===Nomenclature===

When discussing the likelihood of a particular electoral outcome, political forecasters tend to use one of a small range of shorthand phrases.&lt;ref name="rollcall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.cq.com/electionguide/|title=Election Guide 2018|publisher=Roll Call Politics|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings|title=2018 Senate Race Ratings|date=24 August 2018|publisher=[[Cook Political Report]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/17/here-are-the-house-seats-most-likely-to-flip-according-to-election-rating-systems/|title=Here are the House seats most likely to flip, according to election rating systems|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=17 August 2018|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:

*'''Solid''' (e.g., "Solid Republican"), also '''Safe'''.  Very unlikely that the party which currently holds the seat will change in the upcoming election.
*'''Likely''' (e.g., "Likely Democrat"), also '''Favored'''.  It is not thought at the moment that the seat will be particularly competitive, and hence the party is likely to remain unchanged, but there is a possibility this may alter. 
*'''Lean''' (e.g., "Leans Independent"). One candidate / party has a slight advantage in polling and forecasting, but other outcomes are possible.
*'''Tilt'''.  Used less widely than the other terms, but indicates a very small advantage to one or another party.&lt;ref name="rollcall"/&gt;
*'''Toss-Up'''. These are the seats that are considered to be the most competitive, with more than one party having a good chance of winning.

== Markets ==
[[Prediction market]]s show very accurate forecasts of an election outcome. One example is the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]]. In a study, 964 election polls were compared with the five US presidential elections from 1988 to 2004. [http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf Berg et al. (2008)] showed that the Iowa Electronic Markets topped the polls 74% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, damped polls have been shown to top prediction markets. Comparing damped polls to forecasts of the Iowa Electronic Markets, [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725101900/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/Political/PDFs/EriksonWlezien_Markets_AAPOR_for_POLLY.pdf Erikson and Wlezien (2008)] showed that the damped polls outperform all markets or models.

== Regression models ==
Political scientists and economists oftentimes use [[regression analysis|regression models]] of past elections. This is done to help forecast the votes of the political parties – for example, Democrats and Republicans in the US. The information helps their party’s next presidential candidate forecast the future. Most models include at least one public opinion variable, a trial heat poll, or a presidential approval rating.
Bayesian statistics can also be used to estimate the posterior distributions of the true proportion of voters that will vote for each candidate in each state, given both the polling data available and the previous election results for each state.  Each poll can be weighted based on its age and its size, providing a highly dynamic forecasting mechanism as Election day approaches.   http://electionanalytics.cs.illinois.edu/ is an example of a site that employs such methods.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Rigdon, S., Jacobson, S.H., Cho, W.T., Sewell, E.C., Rigdon, C.J., 2009, “A Bayesian Prediction Model for the United States Presidential Election,” American Politics Research, 37(4), 700-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">'''Scientific teaching''' is a [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] approach used in undergraduate science classrooms whereby teaching and learning is approached with the same rigor as science itself. 

According to a 2004 Policy Forum in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine, "scientific teaching involves active learning strategies to engage students in the process of science and teaching methods that have been systematically tested and shown to reach diverse students."&lt;ref&gt;Jo Handelsman, Diane Ebert-May, Robert Beichner, Peter Bruns, Amy Chang, Robert DeHaan, Jim Gentile, Sarah Lauffer, James Stewart, Shirley M. Tilghman, and William B. Wood. (2004). "[http://scientificteaching.wisc.edu/documents/ScientificTeaching.pdf Scientific Teaching]." Science 304(5670, 23 April), 521-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 volume ''Scientific Teaching''&lt;ref&gt;Jo Handelsman, Sarah Miller, and Christine Pfund.  (2007). [http://scientificteaching.wisc.edu/books.htm ''Scientific Teaching''].  Madison, WI; Englewood, CO; and New York: The Wisconsin Program for Scientific Teaching, Roberts &amp; Company, and W.H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;  lists three major tenets of scientific teaching:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''Active learning''': A process in which students are actively engaged in learning.  It may include inquiry-based learning, cooperative learning, or student-centered learning.
*'''Assessment''': Tools for measuring progress toward and achievement of the learning goals.
*'''Diversity''':  The breadth of differences that make each student unique, each cohort of students unique, and each teaching experience unique.  Diversity includes everything in the classroom: the students, the instructors, the content, the teaching methods, and the context.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These elements should underlie educational and pedagogical decisions in the classroom. The "[[SCALE-UP]]" learning environment is an example of applying the scientific teaching approach.  In practice, scientific teaching employs a "backward design" approach.  The instructor first decides what the students should know and be able to do (learning goals), then determines what would be evidence of student achievement of the learning goals, then designs assessments to measure this achievement.  Finally, the instructor plans the learning activities, which should facilitate student learning through scientific discovery.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ebert-May and J. Hodder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">'''Sculptured stones''' is a name applied to commemorative monuments of [[early Christian]] date found in various parts of the [[British Isles]] and [[Scandinavia]].

They are usually rough-hewn slabs or boulders, and in a few cases well-shaped crosses, bearing lettered and symbolic inscriptions of a rude sort and ornamental designs resembling those found on [[Celt]]ic scriptures of the [[Gospels]]. Their lettered inscriptions are in [[Latin]], [[Ogam]] or [[Viking|Scandinavian]] and [[Angles|Anglican]] [[runes]], while some are uninscribed. Sculptured stones are usually found near ancient [[Church (building)|ecclesiastical]] sites, and their date is approximately fixed according to the character of the ornamentation. Some of these stones date as late as the 11th century. The [[Pictish stones]] from [[Scotland]] are particularly remarkable for their elaborate decoration and for certain symbolic characters to which as yet no satisfactory interpretation has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pictishstones.org.uk/

[[File:Obus 501556 fh000021.jpg|thumb|400px|Sectioned [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|high explosive anti-tank]] round with the inner shaped charge visible]]

[[File:CumulativeHead.png|thumb|300px|1: Aerodynamic cover; 2: Air-filled cavity; 3: Conical liner; 4: Detonator; 5: Explosive; 6: [[Piezoelectric sensor|Piezo-electric]] trigger]]

A '''shaped charge''' is an [[explosive]] charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive's energy. Various types are used to cut and form metal, initiate [[nuclear weapon]]s, penetrate [[armor]], and [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|"complete" wells]] in the [[Hydrocarbon exploration|oil and gas industry]].

A typical modern shaped charge, with a metal liner on the charge cavity, can penetrate armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10&amp;nbsp;CD and above&lt;ref&gt;https://www.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/06_98.3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://str.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/06_98.3.pdf|title=Shaped Charges Pierce the Toughest Targets|last=Post|first=Richard|date=June 1, 1998|website=|publisher=Science &amp; Technology Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been achieved. Contrary to a widespread misconception (possibly resulting from the acronym [[HEAT]]) the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the jet from a shaped charge does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2007/ARL-SR-150.pdf Introduction to Shaped Charges, Walters, Army Research Laboratory, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Munroe effect==
The Munroe or Neumann effect is the focusing of blast energy by a hollow or void cut on a surface of an explosive. The earliest mention of hollow charges occurred in 1792. [[Franz Xaver von Baader]] (1765–1841) was a German mining engineer at that time; in a mining journal, he advocated a conical space at the forward end of a blasting charge to increase the explosive's effect and thereby save powder.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Baader (March 1792) [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10704955_00275.html "Versuch einer Theorie der Sprengarbeit"] (Investigation of a theory of blasting), ''Bergmännisches Journal'' (Miners' Journal), vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 193–212.  Reprinted in:  Franz Hoffmann et al. ed.s, ''Franz von Baader's sämtliche Werke …'' [Franz von Baader's complete works …] (Leipzig (Germany):  Herrmann Bethmann, 1854), Part I, vol. 7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vS4CAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 153–166.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea was adopted, for a time, in Norway and in the mines of the [[Harz]] mountains of Germany, although the only available explosive at the time was gunpowder, which is not a [[high explosive]] and hence incapable of producing the [[shock wave]] that the shaped-charge effect requires.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Kennedy, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA220095 ''History of the Shaped Charge Effect:  The First 100 Years''] (Los Alamos, New Mexico:  Los Alamos National Laboratory, 1990),  pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true hollow charge effect was achieved in 1883, by Max von Foerster (1845–1905),&lt;ref&gt;For a brief biography of [[:de:Max von Foerster|Max von Foerster]], see the German Wikipedia article on him.&lt;/ref&gt; chief of the nitrocellulose factory of Wolff &amp; Co. in [[Walsrode]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), pp. 5 and 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

*  Max von Foerster (1883) ''Versuche mit Komprimierter Schiessbaumwolle'' [Experiments with compressed gun cotton], (Berlin, Germany:  Mittler und Sohn, 1883).

By 1886, Gustav Bloem of [[Düsseldorf]], Germany had filed {{US patent|342423}} for hemispherical cavity metal detonators to concentrate the effect of the explosion in an axial direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|inventor=Gustav Bloem|number=342423|title=Shell for detonating caps|y=1886|m=05|d=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Munroe effect is named after [[Charles E. Munroe]], who discovered it in 1888.  As a civilian chemist working at the U.S. [[Naval Torpedo Station]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], he noticed that when a block of explosive [[guncotton]] with the manufacturer's name stamped into it was detonated next to a metal plate, the lettering was cut into the plate. Conversely, if letters were raised in relief above the surface of the explosive, then the letters on the plate would also be raised above its surface.&lt;ref&gt;See:

*  Kennedy (1990), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1894, Munroe constructed the first crude shaped charge:&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Munroe (1894) Executive Document No. 20, 53rd [U.S.] Congress, 1st Session, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Munroe (1900) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7W1MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA300#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The applications of explosives,"] Appleton's ''Popular Science Monthly'', vol. 56, pp. 300–312, 444–455.  A description of Munroe's first shaped-charge experiment appears on [https://books.google.com/books?id=7W1MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA453#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 453].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the experiments made&amp;nbsp;... was one upon a safe twenty-nine inches cube, with walls four inches and three quarters thick, made up of plates of iron and steel&amp;nbsp;... [W]hen a hollow charge of dynamite nine pounds and a half in weight and untamped was detonated on it, a hole three inches in diameter was blown clear through the wall&amp;nbsp;...  The hollow cartridge was made by tying the sticks of dynamite around a tin can, the open mouth of the latter being placed downward.&lt;ref&gt;Munroe (1900), p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Munroe's discovery of the shaped charge was widely publicized in 1900 in ''Popular Science Monthly'', the importance of the tin can "liner" of the hollow charge remained unrecognized for another 44&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of that 1900 article was reprinted in the February 1945 issue of ''[[Popular Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PAA65&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "It makes steel flow like mud" ''Popular Science'', February 1945, pp. 65–69]&lt;/ref&gt; describing how shaped-charge warheads worked.  It was this article that at last revealed to the general public how the fabled ''[[Bazooka]]'' actually worked against armored vehicles during WWII.

In 1910, Egon Neumann of Germany discovered that a block of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], which would normally dent a steel plate, punched a hole through it if the explosive had a conical indentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Big Bang: A history of explosives | author = G.I.

However, it was not until 1932 that Franz Rudolf Thomanek, a student of physics at Vienna's ''Technische Hochschule'', conceived an anti-tank round that was based on the hollow charge effect.  When the Austrian government showed no interest in pursuing the idea, Thomanek moved to [[Technical University of Berlin|Berlin's ''Technische Hochschule'']], where he continued his studies under the ballistics expert Carl Julius Cranz.&lt;ref&gt;For a biography of Carl Julius Cranz (1858–1945), see:

*  [[:de:Carl Cranz|German Wikipedia: Carl Cranz]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There in 1935, he and Hellmuth von Huttern developed a prototype anti-tank round.  Although the weapon's performance proved disappointing, Thomanek continued his developmental work, collaborating with [[Hubert Schardin]] at the ''Waffeninstitut der Luftwaffe'' (Air Force Weapons Institute) in Braunschweig.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut W. Malnig (2006) "Professor Thomanek und die Entwicklung der Präzisions-Hohlladung" (Professor Thomanek and the development of the precision hollow charge), ''Truppendienst'', no. 289.  Available on-line at:  [http://www.bundesheer.at/truppendienst/ausgaben/artikel.php?id=402 ''Bundesheer'' (Federal Army (of Austria))]&lt;/ref&gt;  

By 1937, Schardin believed that hollow-charge effects were due to the interactions of shock waves.  It was during the testing of this idea that, on February 4, 1938, Thomanek conceived the shaped-charge explosive (or ''Hohlladungs-Auskleidungseffekt'' (hollow-charge liner effect)).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  (It was Gustav Adolf Thomer who in 1938 first visualized, by flash radiography, the metallic jet produced by a shaped-charge explosion.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Kennedy (1990), p. 63.
*  Krehl (2009), p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt;)  Meanwhile, [[Henry Mohaupt|Henry Hans Mohaupt]], a chemical engineer in Switzerland, had independently developed a shaped-charge munition in 1935, which was demonstrated to the Swiss, French, British, and U.S. militaries.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  H. Mohaupt, "Chapter 11:  Shaped charges and warheads", in:  F. B. Pollad and J. A. Arnold, ed.s, ''Aerospace Ordnance Handbook'' (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey:  Prentice-Hall, 1966).

Available on-line at:  [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a226772.pdf Defense Technical Information Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, shaped-charge munitions were developed by Germany ([[Panzerschreck]], [[Panzerfaust]], [[Panzerwurfmine]], [[Mistel]]), Britain ([[PIAT]], Beehive charge), the Soviet Union ([[RPG-43]], [[RPG-6]]), and the U.S. ([[bazooka]]).&lt;ref&gt;Donald R.

Tanks faced a serious vulnerability from a weapon that could be carried by an [[infantryman]] or aircraft.

One of the earliest uses of shaped charges was by German glider-borne troops against the Belgian [[Battle of Fort Eben-Emael|Fort Eben-Emael]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Col. James E. Mrazek (Ret.) | title = The Fall of Eben Emael | publisher = Luce | date = 1970 | asin = B000IFGOVG}}&lt;/ref&gt; These demolition charges – developed by Dr. Wuelfken of the German Ordnance Office – were ''unlined'' explosive charges&lt;ref name=thomanek61&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomanek|first1=Rudolf|title=The Development of Lined Hollow Charge|journal=Explosivstoffe|date=1960|volume=8|issue=8|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0255668|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and didn't produce a metal jet like the modern HEAT warheads.
Due to the lack of metal liner they shook the turrets but they did not destroy them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb on the turrets and smash the gun barrels.&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucas|first1=James|title=Storming eagles : German airborne forces in World War Two|date=1988|publisher=Arms and Armour|location=London|isbn=9780853688792|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Modern military===
{{further|High explosive anti-tank warhead}}
The common term in military terminology for shaped charge [[warhead]]s is [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT). HEAT warheads are frequently used in [[anti-tank guided missile]]s, unguided [[rocket]]s, gun-fired projectiles (both spun and unspun&lt;!--needs def of terms or wikilink to ??--&gt;), [[rifle grenade]]s, [[land mine]]s, [[bomblet]]s, [[torpedo]]es, and various other weapons.

===Non-military===
In non-military applications shaped charges are used in [[building implosion|explosive demolition of buildings and structures]], in particular for cutting through metal piles, columns and beams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/parkersburg-belpre-bridge | work= Controlled Demolition, Inc | title =Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/500-wood-street-building | work= Controlled Demolition, Inc | title =500 Wood Street Building|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mondial-defence.com/2011/Products/RAZOR.html | work= Mondial Defence Systems | title =Semtex RAZOR |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for boring holes.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Shaped%20Charge%20Concept,%20An%20Overview%20-%20Walters.pdf | title =An Overview of the Shaped Charge Concept | first =William | last =Walters | access-date =2011-08-27 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110819124915/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Shaped%20Charge%20Concept,%20An%20Overview%20-%20Walters.pdf | archive-date =2011-08-19 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[steelmaking]], small shaped charges are often used to pierce [[Tap (steelmaking)|taps]] that have become plugged with slag.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt; They are also used in quarrying, breaking up ice, breaking log jams, felling trees, and drilling post holes.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Shaped charges are used most extensively in the [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] industries, in particular in the [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completion of oil and gas wells]], in which they are detonated to [[perforation (oil well)|perforate the metal casing]] of the well at intervals to admit the influx of oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bullets2-shaped-charge.htm |title=Shaped Charge |publisher=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 110715-N-KG738-278.jpg|thumb|right|A {{Convert|40|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} [[Composition B]] 'formed projectile' used by combat engineers. The shaped charge is used to bore a hole for a cratering charge.]]
A typical device consists of a solid cylinder of explosive with a metal-lined [[conical]] hollow in one end and a central [[detonator]], array of detonators, or [[detonation]] wave guide at the other end. Explosive energy is released directly away from ([[Normal (geometry)|normal to]]) the surface of an explosive, so shaping the explosive will concentrate the explosive energy in the void. If the hollow is properly shaped (usually conically), the enormous [[pressure]] generated by the detonation of the explosive drives the liner in the hollow cavity inward to collapse upon its central axis. The resulting collision forms and projects a high-velocity jet of metal particles forward along the axis. Most of the jet material originates from the innermost part of the liner, a layer of about 10% to 20% of the thickness. The rest of the liner forms a slower-moving slug of material, which, because of its appearance, is sometimes called a "carrot".

Because of the variation along the liner in its collapse velocity, the jet's velocity also varies along its length, decreasing from the front. This variation in jet velocity stretches it and eventually leads to its break-up into particles. Over time, the particles tend to fall out of alignment, which reduces the depth of penetration at long standoffs.

Also, at the apex of the cone, which forms the very front of the jet, the liner does not have time to be fully accelerated before it forms its part of the jet. This results in its small part of jet being projected at a lower velocity than jet formed later behind it. As a result, the initial parts of the jet coalesce to form a pronounced wider tip portion.

Most of the jet travels at [[hypersonic]] speed. The tip moves at 7 to 14&amp;nbsp;km/s, the jet tail at a lower velocity (1 to 3&amp;nbsp;km/s), and the slug at a still lower velocity (less than 1&amp;nbsp;km/s). The exact velocities depend on the charge's configuration and confinement, explosive type, materials used, and the explosive-initiation mode. At typical velocities, the penetration process generates such enormous pressures that it may be considered [[hydrodynamic]]; to a good approximation, the jet and armor may be treated as [[inviscid flow|inviscid]], [[compressible flow|compressible]] fluids (see, for example,&lt;ref&gt;[[Garrett Birkhoff|G. Birkhoff]], D.P. MacDougall, E.M. Pugh, and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G.I. Taylor]], "[https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1698173]," ''J. Appl. Phys.'', vol. 19, pp. 563–582, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;), with their material strengths ignored.

A recent technique using magnetic diffusion analysis showed that the temperature of the outer 50% by volume of a copper jet tip while in flight was between 1100K and 1200K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uhlig |first1=W. Casey |last2=Hummer |first2=Charles |title=In-flight conductivity and temperature measurements of hypervelocity projectiles |journal=Procedia Engineering |date=2013 |volume=58 |pages=48–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; much closer to the melting point of copper (1358 K) than previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=William|title=Fundamentals of Shaped Charges|date=1998|publisher=CMCPress|location=Baltimore Maryland|isbn=0-471-62172-2|page=192|edition=softcover edition with corrections}}&lt;/ref&gt; This temperature is consistent with a hydrodynamic calculation that simulated the entire experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sable |first1=P. |title=Characterization In-Flight Temperature of Shaped Charge Penetrators in CTH |journal=Procedia Engineering |date=2017 |volume=204 |pages=375–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, two-color radiometry measurements from the late 1970s indicate lower temperatures for various shaped charge liner material, cone construction and type of explosive filler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Von Holle |first1=W.G. |last2=Trimble |first2=J.J. |title=Temperature Measurement of Copper and Eutectic Metal Shaped Charge Jets |journal=U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory |date=1977 |issue=BRL-R-2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Comp-B loaded shaped charge with a copper liner and pointed cone apex had a jet tip temperature ranging from 668 K to 863 K over a five shot sampling. Octol-loaded charges with a rounded cone apex generally had higher surface temperatures with an average of 810 K, and the temperature of a tin-lead liner with Comp-B fill averaged 842 K. While the tin-lead jet was determined to be liquid, the copper jets are well below the melting point of copper. However, these temperatures are not completely consistent with evidence that soft recovered copper jet particles show signs of melting at the core while the outer portion remains solid and cannot be equated with bulk temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lassila |first1=D. H. |last2=Walters |first2=W. P. |title=Analysis of "Soft" Recovered Shaped Charge Jet Particles |date=1996 |issue=UCRL-JC-123850 |doi=10.2172/251380 |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:167531/metadc665285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the charge relative to its target is critical for optimum penetration for two reasons. If the charge is detonated too close there is not enough time for the jet to fully develop. But the jet disintegrates and disperses after a relatively short distance, usually well under two meters. At such standoffs, it breaks into particles which tend to tumble and drift off the axis of penetration, so that the successive particles tend to widen rather than deepen the hole. At very long standoffs, velocity is lost to [[air drag]], further degrading penetration.

The key to the effectiveness of the hollow charge is its diameter. As the penetration continues through the target, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic "fist to finger" action, where the size of the eventual "finger" is based on the size of the original "fist". In general, shaped charges can penetrate a steel plate as thick as 150% to 700%&lt;ref&gt;''Jane's Ammunition Handbook 1994'', pp. 140–141, addresses the reported ≈700 mm penetration of the Swedish 106 3A-HEAT-T and Austrian RAT 700 HEAT projectiles for the 106&amp;nbsp;mm M40A1 recoilless rifle.&lt;/ref&gt; of their diameter, depending on the charge quality. The figure is for basic steel plate, not for the [[composite armor]], [[reactive armor]], or other types of modern armor.

===Liner===
The most common shape of the liner is [[cone (geometry)|conical]], with an internal apex angle of 40 to 90 degrees. Different apex angles yield different distributions of jet mass and velocity. Small apex angles can result in jet [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]], or even in the failure of the jet to form at all; this is attributed to the collapse velocity being above a certain threshold, normally slightly higher than the liner material's bulk sound speed. Other widely used shapes include hemispheres, tulips, trumpets, [[ellipse]]s, and bi-conics; the various shapes yield jets with different velocity and mass distributions.

Liners have been made from many materials, including various metals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a278191.pdf|title=Shaped Charge Liner Materials: Resources, Processes, Properties, Costs, and Applications, 1991|author=|date=|website=dtic.mil|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and glass. The deepest penetrations are achieved with a dense, [[ductile]] metal, and a very common choice has been [[copper]]. For some modern anti-armor weapons, [[molybdenum]] and pseudo-alloys of [[copper-tungsten|tungsten filler and copper binder]] (9:1, thus density is ≈18&amp;nbsp;Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) have been adopted. Nearly every common metallic element has been tried, including [[aluminum]], [[tungsten]], [[tantalum]], [[depleted uranium]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[cadmium]], [[cobalt]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], [[zinc]], [[zirconium]], [[molybdenum]], [[beryllium]], [[nickel]], [[silver]], and even [[gold]] and [[platinum]]. The selection of the material depends on the target to be penetrated; for example, aluminum has been found advantageous for [[concrete]] targets.&lt;!--List of liner materials supplemented from Kennedy, 1983--&gt;

In early antitank weapons, copper was used as a liner material. Later, in the 1970s, it was found [[tantalum]] is superior to copper, due to its much higher [[density]] and very high ductility at high strain rates. Other high-density metals and alloys tend to have drawbacks in terms of price, toxicity, radioactivity, or lack of ductility.&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Russell and Kok Loong Lee, ''Structure-Property Relations in Nonferrous Metals'' (Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 218].&lt;/ref&gt;

For the deepest penetrations, pure metals yield the best results, because they display the greatest ductility, which delays the breakup of the jet into particles as it stretches. In charges for [[oil well completion]], however, it is essential that a solid slug or "carrot" not be formed, since it would plug the hole just penetrated and interfere with the influx of oil. In the petroleum industry, therefore, liners are generally fabricated by [[powder metallurgy]], often of [[pseudo-alloy]]s which, if [[sintering|unsintered]], yield jets that are composed mainly of dispersed fine metal particles.

Unsintered [[Powder metallurgy#Powder compaction|cold pressed]] liners, however, are not waterproof and tend to be [[brittle]], which makes them easy to damage during handling. [[binary alloy|Bimetallic]] liners, usually zinc-lined copper, can be used; during jet formation the zinc layer vaporizes and a slug is not formed; the disadvantage is an increased cost and dependency of jet formation on the quality of bonding the two layers. Low-melting-point (below 500&amp;nbsp;°C) [[solder]]/[[braze]]-like alloys (e.g., Sn&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, Zn&lt;sub&gt;97.6&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;, or pure metals like lead, zinc or cadmium) can be used; these melt before reaching the well casing, and the molten metal does not obstruct the hole. Other alloys, binary [[eutectic]]s (e.g. Pb&lt;sub&gt;88.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;11.1&lt;/sub&gt;, Sn&lt;sub&gt;61.9&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;38.1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;!-- Pb??? --&gt;, or Ag&lt;sub&gt;71.9&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;28.1&lt;/sub&gt;), form a metal-matrix composite material with ductile matrix with brittle [[dendrite (metal)|dendrites]]; such materials reduce slug formation but are difficult to shape.

A metal-matrix composite with discrete inclusions of low-melting material is another option; the inclusions either melt before the jet reaches the well casing, weakening the material, or serve as crack [[nucleation]] sites, and the slug breaks up on impact. The dispersion of the second phase can be achieved also with castable alloys (e.g., copper) with a low-melting-point metal insoluble in copper, such as bismuth, 1–5% lithium, or up to 50% (usually 15–30%) lead; the size of inclusions can be adjusted by thermal treatment. Non-homogeneous distribution of the inclusions can also be achieved. Other additives can modify the alloy properties; tin (4–8%), nickel (up to 30% and often together with tin), up to 8% aluminium, [[phosphorus]] (forming brittle phosphides) or 1–5% [[silicon]] form brittle inclusions serving as crack initiation sites. Up to 30% zinc can be added to lower the material cost and to form additional brittle phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5098487.html|title=Copper alloys for shaped charge liners - Olin Corporation|work=freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxide glass liners produce jets of low density, therefore yielding less penetration depth. Double-layer liners, with one layer of a less dense but [[pyrophoric]] metal (e.g. [[aluminum]] or [[magnesium]]), can be used to enhance [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] effects following the armor-piercing action; [[explosive welding]] can be used for making those, as then the metal-metal interface is homogeneous, does not contain significant amount of [[intermetallics]], and does not have adverse effects to the formation of the jet.&lt;ref&gt;"Method of making a bimetallic shaped-charge liner" {{US patent|4807795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penetration depth is proportional to the maximum length of the jet, which is a product of the jet tip velocity and time to particulation. The jet tip velocity depends on bulk sound velocity in the liner material, the time to particulation is dependent on the ductility of the material. The maximum achievable jet velocity is roughly 2.34 times the sound velocity in the material.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Held. "[http://www.argospress.com/jbt/Volume4/4-3-1.pdf Liners for shaped charges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707161507/http://www.argospress.com/jbt/Volume4/4-3-1.pdf |date=2011-07-07 }}", ''Journal of Battlefield Technology'', vol. 4, no. 3, November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The speed can reach 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, peaking some 40 microseconds after detonation; the cone tip is subjected to acceleration of about 25 million g. The jet tail reaches about 2–5&amp;nbsp;km/s. The pressure between the jet tip and the target can reach one terapascal. The immense pressure makes the metal flow like a liquid, though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid; one of the theories explaining this behavior proposes molten core and solid sheath of the jet. The best materials are [[face-centered cubic]] metals, as they are the most ductile, but even [[graphite]] and zero-ductility [[ceramic]] cones show significant penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Doig, "[http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Some_metalurgical_aspects_of_shaped_charge_liners.pdf Some metallurgical aspects of shaped charge liners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724081452/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Some_metalurgical_aspects_of_shaped_charge_liners.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}", ''Journal of Battlefield Technology'', vol. 1, no. 1, March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explosive charge===
For optimal penetration, a high explosive with a high detonation velocity and pressure is normally chosen. The most common explosive used in high performance anti-armor warheads is [[HMX]] (octogen), although never in its pure form, as it would be too sensitive. It is normally compounded with a few percent of some type of plastic binder, such as in the polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) LX-14, or with another less-sensitive explosive, such as [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], with which it forms [[Octol]]. Other common high-performance explosives are [[RDX]]-based compositions, again either as PBXs or mixtures with TNT (to form [[Composition B]] and the [[Cyclotol]]s) or wax (Cyclonites). Some explosives incorporate powdered [[aluminum]] to increase their blast and detonation temperature, but this addition generally results in decreased performance of the shaped charge. There has been research into using the very high-performance but sensitive explosive [[CL-20]] in shaped-charge warheads, but, at present, due to its sensitivity, this has been in the form of the PBX composite LX-19 (CL-20 and Estane binder).

===Other features===
A 'waveshaper' is a body (typically a disc or cylindrical block) of an inert material (typically solid or foamed plastic, but sometimes metal, perhaps hollow) inserted within the explosive for the purpose of changing the path of the detonation wave. The effect is to modify the collapse of the cone and resulting jet formation, with the intent of increasing penetration performance. Waveshapers are often used to save space; a shorter charge with a waveshaper can achieve the same performance as a longer charge without a waveshaper.&lt;!--See U.S. Patent 2,809,585, Oct. 15, 1957--&gt;

Another useful design feature is ''sub-calibration'', the use of a liner having a smaller diameter (caliber) than the explosive charge. In an ordinary charge, the explosive near the base of the cone is so thin that it is unable to accelerate the adjacent liner to sufficient velocity to form an effective jet. In a sub-calibrated charge, this part of the device is effectively cut off, resulting in a shorter charge with the same performance.

==Defences==
During [[World War II]], the precision of the charge's construction and its detonation mode were both inferior to modern warheads. This lower precision caused the jet to curve and to break up at an earlier time and hence at a shorter distance. The resulting dispersion decreased the penetration depth for a given cone diameter and also shortened the optimum standoff distance. Since the charges were less effective at larger standoffs, [[spaced armour|side and turret skirts]] (known as ''Schürzen'') fitted to some German tanks to protect against ordinary [[anti-tank rifle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7rrMe15jhwC&amp;pg=PT15&amp;amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=when+was+schurzen+introduced%3F%3F |title= Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf.G, H and J 1942–45 |author1=Hilary L. Doyle |author2=Thomas L. Jentz |author3=Tony Bryan  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were fortuitously found to give the jet room to disperse and hence also reduce HEAT penetration.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The use of add-on [[spaced armor]] skirts on armored vehicles may have the opposite effect and actually ''increase'' the penetration of some shaped charge warheads. Due to constraints in the length of the projectile/missile, the built-in stand-off on many warheads is less than the optimum distance. In such cases, the skirting effectively increases the distance between the armor and the target, and the warhead detonates closer to its optimum standoff.&lt;ref&gt;WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D-69451 Weinheim (1999) - Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics 24 - Effectiveness Factors for Explosive Reactive Armour Systems - page 71&lt;/ref&gt; Skirting should not be confused with [[cage armor]] which is used to damage the fusing system of [[RPG-7]] projectiles. The armor works by deforming the inner and outer [[ogive]]s and shorting the firing circuit between the rocket's [[piezoelectric]] nose probe and rear [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] assembly. Cage armor can also cause the projectile to pitch up or down on impact, lengthening the penetration path for the shaped charge's penetration stream.  If the nose probe strikes one of the cage armor slats, the warhead will function as normal.

==Variants==
There are several different forms of shaped charge.

===Linear shaped charges===
[[File:LinearShapedCharge.png|thumb|upright|Linear shaped charge]]
A linear shaped charge (LSC) has a lining with V-shaped profile and varying length. The lining is surrounded with explosive, the explosive then encased within a suitable material that serves to protect the explosive and to confine (tamp) it on detonation. "At detonation, the focusing of the explosive high pressure wave as it becomes incident to the side wall causes the metal liner of the LSC to collapse–creating the cutting force."&lt;ref&gt;Accurate Energetic Systems LLC [http://www.aesys.biz/wp-content/uploads/14-102_liner-shaped-charge.pdf]" Linear Shape Charge&lt;/ref&gt;  The detonation projects into the lining, to form a continuous, knife-like (planar) jet. The jet cuts any material in its path, to a depth depending on the size and materials used in the charge. For the cutting of complex geometries, there are also flexible versions of the linear shaped charge, these with a lead or high-density foam sheathing and a ductile/flexible lining material, which also is often lead. LSCs are commonly used in the cutting of rolled steel joists (RSJ) and other structural targets, such as in the [[Building implosion|controlled demolition]] of buildings. LSCs are also used to separate the stages of [[multistage rocket]]s.

===Explosively formed penetrator===
{{Main|Explosively formed penetrator}}

[[File:explosively formed penetrator.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Formation of an EFP warhead. [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Research Laboratory]]

The explosively formed penetrator (EFP) is also known as the self-forging fragment (SFF), explosively formed projectile (EFP), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), plate charge, and [[Misznay-Schardin effect|Misznay-Schardin]] (MS) charge. An EFP uses the action of the explosive's detonation wave (and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of its detonation products) to project and deform a plate or dish of ductile metal (such as copper, iron, or tantalum) into a compact high-velocity projectile, commonly called the slug. This slug is projected toward the target at about two kilometers per second. The chief advantage of the EFP over a conventional (e.g., conical) shaped charge is its effectiveness at very great standoffs, equal to hundreds of times the charge's diameter (perhaps a hundred meters for a practical device).

The EFP is relatively unaffected by first-generation [[reactive armor]] and can travel up to perhaps 1000 charge diameters (CD)s before its velocity becomes ineffective at penetrating armor due to aerodynamic drag, or successfully hitting the target becomes a problem. The impact of a ball or slug EFP normally causes a large-diameter but relatively shallow hole, of, at most, a couple of CDs. If the EFP perforates the armor, [[spalling]] and extensive behind armor effects (BAE, also called behind armor damage, BAD) will occur. The BAE is mainly caused by the high-temperature and high-velocity armor and slug fragments being injected into the interior space and the blast [[overpressure]] caused by this debris. More modern EFP warhead versions, through the use of advanced initiation modes, can also produce long-rods (stretched slugs), multi-slugs and finned rod/slug projectiles. The long-rods are able to penetrate a much greater depth of armor, at some loss to BAE, multi-slugs are better at defeating light or area targets and the finned projectiles are much more accurate.

The use of this warhead type is mainly restricted to lightly armored areas of main battle tanks (MBT) such as the top, belly and rear armored areas. It is well suited for the attack of other less heavily protected armored fighting vehicles (AFV) and in the breaching of material targets (buildings, bunkers, bridge supports, etc.). The newer rod projectiles may be effective against the more heavily armored areas of MBTs. Weapons using the EFP principle have already been used in combat; the "[[smart weapon|smart]]" submunitions in the [[CBU-97]] [[cluster bomb]] used by the US Air Force and Navy in the 2003 Iraq war employed this principle, and the US Army is reportedly experimenting with precision-guided [[artillery shell]]s under Project [[SADARM]] (Seek And Destroy ARMor). There are also various other projectile (BONUS, DM 642) and rocket submunitions (Motiv-3M, DM 642) and mines (MIFF, TMRP-6) that use EFP principle. Examples of EFP warheads are US patents 5038683&lt;ref&gt;Ernest L.Baker, Pai-Lien Lu, Brian Fuchs and Barry Fishburn(1991)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/High_explosive_assembly_for_projecting_h.pdf?id=2dkbAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U1uJ8lS6CfmjJo1JKILjvWDC9sCSg High explosive assembly for projecting high velocity long rods]"&lt;/ref&gt; and US6606951.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold S.Klein (2003) "[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Bounding_anti_tank_anti_vehicle_weapon.pdf?id=oOoMAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U3WM4xBQ5f0d23uQdUeF1unjyGE9Q Bounding Anti-tank/Anti-vehicle weapon]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tandem warhead===
Some modern anti-tank rockets ([[RPG-27]], [[RPG-29]]) and missiles ([[BGM-71 TOW|TOW 2B]], [[ERYX]], [[Euromissile HOT|HOT]], [[MILAN]]) use a [[tandem warhead]] shaped charge, consisting of two separate shaped charges, one in front of the other, typically with some distance between them. TOW-2A was the first to use tandem warheads in the mid-1980s, an aspect of the weapon which the US Army had to reveal under news media and Congressional pressure resulting from the concern that NATO antitank missiles were ineffective against Soviet tanks that were fitted with the new [[Reactive armour|ERA boxes]].  The Army revealed that a 40&amp;nbsp;mm precursor shaped charge warhead was fitted on the tip of the TOW-2B collapsible probe.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman A. "ARMY ANTITANK CANDIDATES PROLIFERATE" Armed Forces Journal International/December 1987, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the front charge is somewhat smaller than the rear one, as it is intended primarily to disrupt ERA boxes or tiles. Examples of tandem warheads are US patents 7363862&lt;ref&gt;Jason C.Gilliam and Darin L.Kielsmeier(2008)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Multi_purpose_single_initiated_tandem_wa.pdf?id=Nt-qAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U0l5gTdL-TqxXkvATTpIYTVLeAg2g Multi-purpose single initiated tandem warhead]"&lt;/ref&gt; and US 5561261.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Lindstadt and Manfred Klare(1996)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Tandem_warhead_with_a_secondary_projecti.pdf?id=icslAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U3nqrCamThCu2bvHpqBNleeq4ssfQ Tandem warhead with a secondary projectile]"&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] antiarmor missile is one of the few that have accomplished the complex engineering feat of having two shaped charges of the same diameter stacked in one warhead.  Recently, a Russian arms firm revealed a 125mm tank cannon round with two same diameter shaped charges one behind the other, but with the back one offset so its penetration stream will not interfere with the front shaped charge's penetration stream.  The reasoning behind both the Hellfire and the Russian 125&amp;nbsp;mm munitions having tandem same diameter warheads is not to increase penetration, but to increase the [[beyond-armour effect|beyond-armor effect]].

===Voitenko compressor===
{{Main|Voitenko compressor}}
In 1964 a Russian scientist proposed that a shaped charge originally developed for piercing thick steel armor be adapted to the task of accelerating shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;Войтенко (Voitenko), А.Е. (1964) "Получение газовых струй большой скорости" (Obtaining high speed gas jets), ''Доклады Академии Наук СССР'' (Reports of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR), '''158''' : 1278-1280.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting device, looking a little like a wind tunnel, is called a Voitenko compressor.&lt;ref&gt;NASA, "[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-440/ch6-15.htm The Suicidal Wind Tunnel]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Voitenko compressor initially separates a test gas from a shaped charge with a malleable [[steel]] plate. When the shaped charge detonates, most of its energy is focused on the steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A 66-pound shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was 220,000 feet per second (67&amp;nbsp;km/s). The apparatus exposed to the detonation was completely destroyed, but not before useful data was extracted.&lt;ref&gt;GlobalSecurity"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bullets2-shaped-charge.htm Shaped Charge History]"&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates [[hydrogen]] gas which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;Explosive Accelerators"[http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SPBI134.HTM Voitenko Implosion Gun]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.I.

The fuels used in these devices, along with the secondary combustion reactions and long blast impulse, produce similar conditions to those encountered in fuel-air and [[thermobaric]] explosives.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (2004) "[https://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug04/pdfs/07_04.2.pdf Going To Extremes]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Jeanloz, Peter M.

Bae (2008)" [https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0340 Metastable Innershell Molecular State (MIMS)]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear shaped charges===
The proposed [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion nuclear propulsion]] system would have required the development of [[nuclear shaped charge]]s for reaction acceleration of spacecraft. Shaped charge effects driven by nuclear explosions have been discussed speculatively, but are not known to have been produced in fact.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Gsponer (2008) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0510071v5 Fourth Generation Nuclear Weapons: Military Effectiveness and Collateral Effects]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, George, ''Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965'', p. 113. {{ISBN|0-14-027732-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, ''Project Orion'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the early nuclear weapons designer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]] was quoted as saying, in the context of shaped charges, ''"A one-kiloton fission device, shaped properly, could make a hole ten feet in diameter a thousand feet into solid rock."''&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, John, ''The Curve of Binding Energy'', p.159 {{ISBN|0-374-51598-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a nuclear driven [[explosively formed penetrator]] was apparently proposed for terminal ballistic missile defense in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Explosively Produced Flechettes; JASON report 66-121, Institute for Defense Analysis, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Dr. Richard Blankenbecler http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/5196.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SSRN''', formerly known as Social Science Research Network, is a repository devoted to the rapid dissemination of scholarly research in the social sciences and humanities and it has been expanding into the life, physical, health, and applied sciences since 2017. In May 2016,  SSRN was bought from Social Science Electronic Publishing Inc. by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/ssrn-the-leading-social-science-and-humanities-repository-and-online-community-joins-elsevier|title=SSRN — a leading social science and humanities repository and online community — joins Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
SSRN was founded in 1994 by [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] and Wayne Marr, both [[financial economics|financial economists]].

In January 2013, SSRN was ranked the biggest open-access repository in the world by Ranking Web of Repositories (an initiative of the [[Cybermetrics Lab]], a research group belonging to the [[Spanish National Research Council]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/world|title=World|date=January 2013|publisher=Cybermetrics Lab|work=Ranking Web of Repositories|accessdate=11 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629031236/http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/world|archive-date=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured by number of PDF files, backlinks and Google Scholar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/Methodology|title=Methodology|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701033427/http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/Methodology|archivedate=2013-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016,  SSRN was bought from Social Science Electronic Publishing Inc. by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In July 2016 there were reports of papers being removed from SSRN without notice; revision comments from SSRN indicated this was due to copyright concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160718/02211935003/just-as-open-competitor-to-elseviers-ssrn-launches-ssrn-accused-copyright-crackdown.shtml|title=Just As Open Competitor To Elsevier's SSRN Launches, SSRN Accused Of Copyright Crackdown|website=Techdirt|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRN CEO Gregg Gordon characterized the issue as a mistake affecting about 20 papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/07/19/social-science-research-network-confusion-leads-calls-boycott|title='There Isn't Some Big Conspiracy Happening'|website=Inside Higher Ed|last1=Straumsheim|first1=Carl|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2017, SSRN has been adding new disciplines in areas such as biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, computer science and more. 

== Operations ==
Academic papers in PDF format can be uploaded directly to the SSRN site by authors and are then available around the world via download. Users can also subscribe to abstracting emails covering a broad range of research areas and topic specialties. These distributing emails contain abstracts (with links to the full text where applicable) of papers recently submitted to SSRN in the respective field.

SSRN, like other preprint services, circulates publications throughout the scholarly community at an early stage, permitting the author to incorporate comments into the final version of the paper before its publication in a journal. Moreover, even if access to the published paper is restricted, access to the original working paper remains open through SSRN, so long as the author decides to keep the paper up.  Often authors take papers down at the request of publishers, particularly if they are published by commercial or university presses that depend on payment for paper copies or online access.

Academic papers in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format can be uploaded directly to the SSRN site by authors and are then available for worldwide free downloading. Publishers and institutions can upload papers and charge a fee for readers to download them.&lt;ref name="About_SSRN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssrn.com/update/general/mjensen.html |title=About SSRN |first=Michael C. |last=Jensen |authorlink=Michael C.

These e-journals then periodically distribute emails containing abstracts (with links to the full text where applicable) of papers recently submitted to SSRN in the respective field.

On SSRN, authors and papers are ranked by their number of downloads, which has become an informal indicator of popularity on prepress and [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bernard S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13548">The '''Strategic Environmental Assessment''' (SEA), is a process in [[Denmark]] for assessing the environmental effects of proposed government projects and programmes. Established in 1993 by an administrative order of Denmark's Prime Minister’s Office,&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; this requirement was not initially enshrined in law, but was supported by a [[government circular]] which required an SEA to be carried out on “government proposals with major environmental effects”.&lt;ref&gt;Therival and Partidario (1996), The Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London, p25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SEA process was limited only to government proposals and did not extend to plans and programmes. SEAs were required to focus on the impacts proposals would have on physical, ecological, cultural, health and [[risk factors]].&lt;ref&gt;Therival and Partidario (1996), The Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the SEA requirement was extended to new parliamentary acts in addition to government proposals at the national level.

== Initial administrative order ==

The administrative order broadly outlined four steps in the SEA process.&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005, pg 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Screening – using the checklist contained in the guidance ([[water]], [[air]], [[climate]], surface of the earth, [[soil]], [[flora]] and [[fauna]], landscape, resources, waste, historical buildings, [[population health]], safety and transport of harmful substances) proposals that were likely to have a significant environmental impact had to be identified.

2. Scoping – the cumulative effects of a bill or policy had to be identified.

3. Assessment – analysis of the effects that had been identified as significant in the previous stages. Crucially the guidance stated that it was not possible to give an overall description, so a list of factors to be referenced were included in the guidance.

4. Report – a separate report of the environmental effects had to be included, attached to the bill that was to be put before parliament. The report had to be non-technical and easy to understand – it also had to be made available to the public.

===Legal Framework===

The SEA Directive (2001/42/EC) was integrated into the Danish planning system in 2004. The SEA Directive now ensures that SEA has been extended to plans and programmes, rather than just government proposals. The Act on the [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Assessment]] of Plans and Programmes (Danish SEA Act) was passed into law in May 2004 and “is strictly in accordance with the requirements of the [2001/42/EC] directive”.&lt;ref&gt;Elling cited in: Jones et al., Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London, 2005, pg66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEA Act allows the Minister for the Environment a certain amount of discretion (as the administrative order of 1993 did), with the Minister able to determine whether or not a private or [[Public ownership|publicly owned]] company is required to carry out a SEA on their plan or programme, when they are acting in the capacity of a public authority (for example, the provision of utilities).&lt;ref&gt;Elling cited in: Jones et al., Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important to note that the SEA Act can be overruled, as long as a plan or programme complies with the procedural and substantive requirements of the SEA Directive. This helps to avoid duplication with “land use plans that have been prepared in accordance with the [Danish] Planning Act”.&lt;ref&gt;Elling cited in: Jones et al., Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London, 2005, pg66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidance Documents===

Despite the integration of the SEA Directive, SEA guidance was restricted to a publication called Strategic Environmental Assessment of Bills and Other Proposals: Examples and Experience issued in 1995 by the Ministry for the Environment. New guidance was prepared in 2002, but never published due to a change in government.&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 guidance issues a six step approach with regards to the type of information that should be included within an SEA&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blst.dk/Planlaegning/Miljoekonsekvenser/MiljoevurderingPlaner/, Danish Ministry for the Environment (2008), Miljøvurdering af planer og programmer (SEA Legislation &amp; Guidance), Retrieved 18/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Formulating the problem and describing the process of the proposal and the alternatives that have been considered
* Identifying the relevant environmental effects
* Describing the extent of the likely environmental effects
* Identifying mitigation measures and monitoring follow up programmes
* assessing and weighing the environmental effects in relation to policy objectives
* A statement with the summary of the main findings

In 2006, The Environment Ministry released up to date guidance that related to the SEA requirements for plans and programmes dating from 2004. Instruction number 9664 entitled 'Vejledning om miljøvurdering af planer og programmer' replaced the earlier guidance dating from 1995. The new guide was later supplemented, in 2007, by examples of SEAs that had been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=12953, Danish Ministry for the Environment (2008 (2)), Vejledning om miljøvurdering af planer og programmer, Retrieved 19/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blst.dk/NR/rdonlyres/46372868-F4B7-4900-A743-063A553CB6E5/49265/Eksempelsamlingendeligudgave.pdf, Danish Ministry for the Environment (2008 (3)), Eksempelsamling for miljøvurdering af planer og programmer September 2007, Retrieved 19/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEA steps required===

SEA steps that are required are defined by the SEA Act and supplemented by the guidance.

The table sets out the specific SEA process as defined by 2006 and 2007 guidance from the [[Ministry of the Environment of Denmark|Danish Ministry of the Environment]]. The process is broadly split into nine main stages:

==Examples of SEAs produced so far==

Examples of Danish SEAs carried out following the introduction of [[European Union|the EU]] SEA Directive are “so far few".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danidadevforum.um.dk/en/menu/Topics/EnvironmentalSustainability/ToolsAndReferences/Guidelines/StrategicEnvironmentalAssessment/, Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2007), Strategic Environmental Assessment, Retrieved 25/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples of SEA that have been produced prior to the introduction of the EU SEA Directive.

===North Jutland Regional Development Plan (1995-1997)===

This was the very first SEA to be carried out in Denmark and was carried out before the introduction of the EU SEA Directive. As a result of this pilot SEA, the major concern amongst stakeholders was reconciling negative environmental impacts that resulted from planning activities. Overall, while stakeholders felt that no new knowledge was gained from carrying out an SEA, the planning process became more transparent. Politicians felt that there was more information on which they could make an informed decision about the choices presented to them. It was also decided that consultation should be carried out during the scoping process, rather than at later stages of the SEA process.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional groundwater plan for Vejle County, Eastern Jutland (2002)===

This SEA was carried out as a consequence of the regional planning process (which included the requirement for SEAs) and is notable for the alternatives suggested. [[Groundwater]] extraction takes places beneath polluted [[urban area]]s and two strategies were devised – ’cleaning up’ or extracting water from rural areas. The resulting analysis found there was no clear best solution and therefore other factors, such as economic considerations, should be taken into account to aid the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional mineral extraction plan for Vejle County (2003)===

Extraction of minerals controlled under the plan were assessed under six criteria – transportation, economy, changes in landscape, landscape dynamics, pollution suffered by local residents and stress factors for local residents. This SEA clearly influenced the decision making process as the decision on the best alternative was deferred until suitable mitigation measures could be found.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and Weaknesses of the SEA system==

===Strengths===

Before the implementation of the SEA Directive into the Danish planning system, there had been a long history of consideration of the environmental effects that a planning process may have. Therefore, the transposition of the SEA Directive into Danish legislation conforms fully, and the supporting guidance (albeit late) ensures that SEAs conducted should be directive compliant. This historical approach has ensured that the SEA process has been institutionalised into the planning process. This ensures that environmental considerations are the subject of political debates and that parliamentary bills are prepared adequately with the SEA Directive and Danish SEA Act in mind.

The SEA process in Denmark is transparent and SEAs have a discernible influence upon the decision making process (Jones et al., 2005). There is a long tradition of public participation in the Danish planning system and this philosophy is no exception with regards to the SEA system. This is coupled with a feeling among planners and stakeholders, that despite the costs of SEA, overall it is a worthwhile and productive process.

===Weaknesses===

The major weakness in the Danish SEA system largely relates to government ministries – this is ironic given that they are responsible for the integration of the SEA Directive into Danish legislation.

* There is a lack of satisfactory scoping procedure when ministries prepare bills and conduct environmental assessments.
* There is an administrative failure of ministries excluding negative effects and including only positive effects.
* Political adaptation of environmental assessments often takes place within ministries, sometimes with the result that information on the environmental impact of bills is not submitted to Parliament.
* Further consideration should be given to how the public could play a more attentive role in the SEA process to help overcome issues of stakeholder dominance and political short-sightedness.
* The development of SEA at the plan and programme level should be monitored to evaluate its contribution on the policy level and to identify how the practice on both levels could complement and stimulate each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/env/eia/documents/PolicySEA/SEA%20of%20Policies%20volume.pdf, RECCEE (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment at the Policy Level: Recent Progress, Current Status and Future Progress, Retrieved 25/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;

Monitoring systems currently in place need to be strengthened. Currently monitoring of environmental impacts is done only through informal communication instead of the Minister for the Environment issuing specific rules.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21856">'''T-norm fuzzy logics''' are a family of [[non-classical logic]]s, informally delimited by having a [[semantics]] that takes the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] for the system of truth values and functions called [[t-norm]]s for permissible interpretations of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]. They are mainly used in applied [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy set|fuzzy set theory]] as a theoretical basis for approximate reasoning.

T-norm fuzzy logics belong in broader classes of [[fuzzy logic]]s and [[many-valued logic]]s. In order to generate a well-behaved [[logical implication|implication]], the t-norms are usually required to be [[left-continuous]]; logics of left-continuous t-norms further belong in the class of [[substructural logic]]s, among which they are marked with the validity of the ''law of prelinearity'',  (''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''B'') &amp;or; (''B''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''A''). Both [[propositional logic|propositional]] and [[first-order logic|first-order]] (or [[higher-order logic|higher-order]]) t-norm fuzzy logics, as well as their expansions by [[Modal operator|modal]] and other operators, are studied. Logics that restrict the t-norm semantics to a subset of the real unit interval (for example, finitely valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]]s) are usually included in the class as well.

Important examples of t-norm fuzzy logics are [[monoidal t-norm logic|monoidal t-norm logic MTL]] of all left-continuous t-norms, [[BL (logic)|basic logic BL]] of all continuous t-norms, [[product fuzzy logic]] of the product t-norm, or the [[nilpotent minimum logic]] of the nilpotent minimum t-norm. Some independently motivated logics belong among t-norm fuzzy logics, too, for example Łukasiewicz logic (which is the logic of the Łukasiewicz t-norm) or [[intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] (which is the logic of the minimum t-norm).

== Motivation ==

As members of the family of [[fuzzy logic]]s, t-norm fuzzy logics primarily aim at generalizing classical two-valued logic by admitting intermediary [[truth value]]s between 1 (truth) and 0 (falsity) representing ''degrees'' of truth of propositions. The degrees are assumed to be real numbers from the unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. In propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, [[propositional formula|propositional connectives]] are stipulated to be [[truth-functional]], that is, the truth value of a complex proposition formed by a propositional connective from some constituent propositions is a function (called the ''truth function'' of the connective) of the truth values of the constituent propositions. The truth functions operate on the set of truth degrees (in the standard semantics, on the [0,&amp;nbsp;1] interval); thus the truth function of an ''n''-ary propositional connective ''c'' is a function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;: [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Truth functions generalize [[truth table]]s of propositional connectives known from classical logic to operate on the larger system of truth values.

T-norm fuzzy logics impose certain natural constraints on the truth function of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]. The truth function &lt;math&gt;*\colon[0,1]^2\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of conjunction is assumed to satisfy the following conditions:
* ''Commutativity'', that is, &lt;math&gt;x*y=y*x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that the order of fuzzy propositions is immaterial in conjunction, even if intermediary truth degrees are admitted.
* ''Associativity'', that is, &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that the order of performing conjunction is immaterial, even if intermediary truth degrees are admitted.
* ''Monotony'', that is, if &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x*z \le y*z&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that increasing the truth degree of a conjunct should not decrease the truth degree of the conjunction.
* ''Neutrality of 1'', that is, &lt;math&gt;1*x = x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This assumption corresponds to regarding the truth degree 1 as full truth, conjunction with which does not decrease the truth value of the other conjunct. Together with the previous conditions this condition ensures that also &lt;math&gt;0*x = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1], which corresponds to regarding the truth degree 0 as full falsity, conjunction with which is always fully false.
* ''Continuity'' of the function &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; (the previous conditions reduce this requirement to the continuity in either argument). Informally this expresses the assumption that microscopic changes of the truth degrees of conjuncts should not result in a macroscopic change of the truth degree of their conjunction. This condition, among other things, ensures a good behavior of (residual) implication derived from conjunction; to ensure the good behavior, however, ''left''-continuity (in either argument) of the function &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is sufficient.&lt;ref name="EG2001"&gt;Esteva &amp;amp; Godo (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In general t-norm fuzzy logics, therefore, only left-continuity of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is required, which expresses the assumption that a microscopic ''decrease'' of the truth degree of a conjunct should not macroscopically decrease the truth degree of conjunction.

These assumptions make the truth function of conjunction a left-continuous [[t-norm]], which explains the name of the family of fuzzy logics (''t-norm based''). Particular logics of the family can make further assumptions about the behavior of conjunction (for example, [[Intermediate logic|Gödel logic]] requires its [[idempotence]]) or other connectives (for example, the logic IMTL requires the [[involution (mathematics)|involutiveness]] of negation).

All left-continuous t-norms &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; have a unique [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]], that is, a binary function &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; such that for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1],
:&lt;math&gt;x*y\le z&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x\le y\Rightarrow z.&lt;/math&gt;
The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm can explicitly be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;(x\Rightarrow y)=\sup\{z\mid z*x\le y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This ensures that the residuum is the pointwise largest function such that for all ''x'' and ''y'',
:&lt;math&gt;x*(x\Rightarrow y)\le y.&lt;/math&gt;
The latter can be interpreted as a fuzzy version of the [[modus ponens]] rule of inference. The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm thus can be characterized as the weakest function that makes the fuzzy modus ponens valid, which makes it a suitable truth function for implication in fuzzy logic. Left-continuity of the t-norm is the necessary and sufficient condition for this relationship between a t-norm conjunction and its residual implication to hold.

Truth functions of further propositional connectives can be defined by means of the t-norm and its residuum, for instance the residual negation &lt;math&gt;\neg x=(x\Rightarrow 0)&lt;/math&gt; or bi-residual equivalence &lt;math&gt;x\Leftrightarrow y = (x\Rightarrow y)*(y\Rightarrow x).&lt;/math&gt; Truth functions of propositional connectives may also be introduced by additional definitions: the most usual ones are the minimum (which plays a role of another conjunctive connective), the maximum (which plays a role of a disjunctive connective), or the Baaz Delta operator, defined in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. In this way, a left-continuous t-norm, its residuum, and the truth functions of additional propositional connectives determine the truth values of complex propositional formulae in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

Formulae that always evaluate to 1 are called ''tautologies'' with respect to the given left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;*,&lt;/math&gt; or ''&lt;math&gt;*\mbox{-}&lt;/math&gt;tautologies.'' The set of all &lt;math&gt;*\mbox{-}&lt;/math&gt;tautologies is called the ''logic'' of the t-norm &lt;math&gt;*,&lt;/math&gt; as these formulae represent the laws of fuzzy logic (determined by the t-norm) which hold (to degree 1) regardless of the truth degrees of [[atomic formula]]e. Some formulae are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] with respect to a larger class of left-continuous t-norms; the set of such formulae is called the logic of the class. Important t-norm logics are the logics of particular t-norms or classes of t-norms, for example:
* [[Łukasiewicz logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|Łukasiewicz t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = \max(x+y-1,0)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|minimum t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = \min(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Product fuzzy logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|product t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = x\cdot y&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Monoidal t-norm logic]] MTL is the logic of (the class of) ''all'' left-continuous t-norms
* [[Basic fuzzy logic]] BL is the logic of (the class of) all ''continuous'' t-norms

It turns out that many logics of particular t-norms and classes of t-norms are axiomatizable. The completeness theorem of the axiomatic system with respect to the corresponding t-norm semantics on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] is then called the ''standard completeness'' of the logic. Besides the standard real-valued semantics on [0,&amp;nbsp;1], the logics are sound and complete with respect to general algebraic semantics, formed by suitable classes of prelinear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]]s.

== History ==

Some particular t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and investigated long before the family was recognized (even before the notions of [[fuzzy logic]] or [[t-norm]] emerged):
* [[Łukasiewicz logic]] (the logic of the Łukasiewicz t-norm) was originally defined by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1920) as a [[three-valued logic]];&lt;ref name="Luk1920"&gt;Łukasiewicz J., 1920, O logice trojwartosciowej (Polish, On three-valued logic). Ruch filozoficzny '''5''':170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; it was later generalized to ''n''-valued (for all finite ''n'') as well as infinitely-many-valued variants, both propositional and first-order.&lt;ref name="Hay1963"&gt;Hay, L.S., 1963, Axiomatization of the infinite-valued predicate calculus. ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''28''':77–86.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] (the logic of the minimum t-norm) was implicit in [[Gödel]]'s 1932 proof of infinite-valuedness of [[intuitionistic logic]].&lt;ref name="Goe1932"&gt;Gödel K., 1932, Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalkül, ''Anzeiger Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien'' '''69''': 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Later (1959) it was explicitly studied by [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] who proved a completeness theorem for the logic.&lt;ref name="Dum1959"&gt;Dummett M., 1959, Propositional calculus with denumerable matrix, ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''27''': 97–106&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic study of particular t-norm fuzzy logics and their classes began with [[Petr Hájek|Hájek]]'s (1998) monograph ''Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic'', which presented the notion of the logic of a continuous t-norm, the logics of the three basic continuous t-norms (Łukasiewicz, Gödel, and product), and the 'basic' fuzzy logic [[BL (logic)|BL]] of all continuous t-norms (all of them both propositional and first-order). The book also started the investigation of fuzzy logics as non-classical logics with Hilbert-style calculi, algebraic semantics, and metamathematical properties known from other logics (completeness theorems, deduction theorems, complexity, etc.).

Since then, a plethora of t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and their metamathematical properties have been investigated. Some of the most important t-norm fuzzy logics were introduced in 2001, by Esteva and Godo ([[monoidal t-norm logic|MTL]], IMTL, SMTL, NM, WNM),&lt;ref name="EG2001" /&gt; Esteva, Godo, and Montagna (propositional ŁΠ),&lt;ref name="EGM2001"&gt;Esteva F., Godo L., &amp; Montagna F., 2001, The ŁΠ and ŁΠ½ logics: Two complete fuzzy systems joining Łukasiewicz and product logics, ''Archive for Mathematical Logic'' '''40''': 39–67.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cintula (first-order ŁΠ).&lt;ref name="Cin2001"&gt;Cintula P., 2001, The ŁΠ and ŁΠ½ propositional and predicate logics, ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' '''124''': 289–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical language ==

The logical vocabulary of [[propositional logic|propositional]] t-norm fuzzy logics standardly comprises the following connectives:
* '''Implication''' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ([[arity|binary]]). In the context of other than t-norm-based fuzzy logics, the t-norm-based implication is sometimes called '''residual implication''' or '''R-implication''', as its standard semantics is the [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]] of the [[t-norm]] that realizes strong conjunction.
* '''Strong conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\And&lt;/math&gt; (binary). In the context of substructural logics, the sign &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and the names ''group'', ''intensional'', ''multiplicative'', or ''parallel conjunction'' are often used for strong conjunction.
* '''Weak conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice conjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] in algebraic semantics). In the context of substructural logics, the names ''additive'', ''extensional'', or ''comparative conjunction'' are sometimes used for lattice conjunction. In the logic [[BL (logic)|BL]] and its extensions (though not in t-norm logics in general), weak conjunction is definable in terms of implication and strong conjunction, by
::&lt;math&gt;A\wedge B \equiv A \mathbin{\And} (A \rightarrow B).&lt;/math&gt;
:The presence of two conjunction connectives is a common feature of contraction-free [[substructural logic]]s.
* '''Bottom''' &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; ([[nullary]]); &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt; are common alternative signs and '''zero''' a common alternative name for the propositional constant (as the constants bottom and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''falsity'' or ''absurdum'' and corresponds to the classical truth value ''false''.
* '''Negation''' &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; ([[unary operation|unary]]), sometimes called '''residual negation''' if other negation connectives are considered, as it is defined from the residual implication by the reductio ad absurdum:
::&lt;math&gt;\neg A \equiv A \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Equivalence''' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (binary), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B \equiv (A \rightarrow B) \wedge (B \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
: In t-norm logics, the definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(A \rightarrow B) \mathbin{\And} (B \rightarrow A).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''(Weak) disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice disjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[join (mathematics)|join]] in algebraic semantics). In t-norm logics it is definable in terms of other connectives as
::&lt;math&gt;A \vee B \equiv ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B) \wedge ((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Top''' &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (nullary), also called '''one''' and denoted by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{1}&lt;/math&gt; (as the constants top and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the classical truth value ''true'' and can in t-norm logics be defined as
::&lt;math&gt;\top \equiv \bot \rightarrow \bot.&lt;/math&gt;

Some propositional t-norm logics add further propositional connectives to the above language, most often the following ones:
* The '''Delta''' connective &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; is a unary connective that asserts classical truth of a proposition, as the formulae of the form &lt;math&gt;\triangle A&lt;/math&gt; behave as in classical logic. Also called the '''Baaz Delta''', as it was first used by Matthias Baaz for [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]].&lt;ref name="Baa96"&gt;Baaz M., 1996, Infinite-valued Gödel logic with 0-1-projections and relativisations. In P. Hájek (ed.), ''Gödel'96: Logical Foundations of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics'', Springer, ''Lecture Notes in Logic'' '''6''': 23–33&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of a t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by the Delta connective is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L_{\triangle}.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Truth constants''' are nullary connectives representing particular truth values between 0 and 1 in the standard real-valued semantics. For the real number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding truth constant is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{r}.&lt;/math&gt; Most often, the truth constants for all rational numbers are added. The system of all truth constants in the language is supposed to satisfy the ''bookkeeping axioms'':&lt;ref name="Haj98"&gt;Hájek (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\overline{r \mathbin{\And} s} \leftrightarrow (\overline{r} \mathbin{\And} \overline{s}),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\overline{r \rightarrow s} \leftrightarrow (\overline{r} \mathbin{\rightarrow} \overline{s}),&lt;/math&gt; etc. for all propositional connectives and all truth constants definable in the language.
* '''Involutive negation''' &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; (unary) can be added as an additional negation to t-norm logics whose residual negation is not itself [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]], that is, if it does not obey the law of double negation &lt;math&gt;\neg\neg A \leftrightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;. A t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; expanded with involutive negation is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; and called ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with involution''.
* '''Strong disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; (binary). In the context of substructural logics it is also called ''group'', ''intensional'', ''multiplicative'', or ''parallel disjunction''. Even though standard in contraction-free substructural logics, in t-norm fuzzy logics it is usually used only in the presence of involutive negation, which makes it definable (and so axiomatizable) by de Morgan's law from strong conjunction:
::&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B \equiv \mathrm{\sim}(\mathrm{\sim}A \mathbin{\And} \mathrm{\sim}B).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Additional t-norm conjunctions and residual implications'''. Some expressively strong t-norm logics, for instance the logic [[ŁΠ]], have more than one strong conjunction or residual implication in their language. In the standard real-valued semantics, all such strong conjunctions are realized by different t-norms and the residual implications by their residua.

[[Well-formed formula]]e of propositional t-norm logics are defined from [[propositional variable]]s (usually [[countable|countably]] many) by the above logical connectives, as usual in [[propositional logic]]s. In order to save parentheses, it is common to use the following order of precedence:
* Unary connectives (bind most closely)
* Binary connectives other than implication and equivalence
* Implication and equivalence (bind most loosely)

First-order variants of t-norm logics employ the usual logical language of [[first-order logic]] with the above propositional connectives and the following [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s:
* '''General quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Existential quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;
The first-order variant of a propositional t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L\forall.&lt;/math&gt;

== Semantics ==

[[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|Algebraic semantics]] is predominantly used for propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, with three main classes of [[algebraic structure|algebras]] with respect to which a t-norm fuzzy logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is [[completeness (logic)|complete]]:
* '''General semantics''', formed of all ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras'' — that is, all algebras for which the logic is [[Soundness theorem|sound]].
* '''Linear semantics''', formed of all ''linear'' &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras — that is, all &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras whose [[lattice (order)|lattice]] order is [[total order|linear]].
* '''Standard semantics''', formed of all ''standard'' &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras — that is, all &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] with the usual order. In standard &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras, the interpretation of strong conjunction is a left-continuous [[t-norm]] and the interpretation of most propositional connectives is determined by the t-norm (hence the names ''t-norm-based logics'' and ''t-norm &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras'', which is also used for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras on the lattice [0,&amp;nbsp;1]). In t-norm logics with additional connectives, however, the real-valued interpretation of the additional connectives may be restricted by further conditions for the t-norm algebra to be called standard: for example, in standard &lt;math&gt;L_\sim&lt;/math&gt;-algebras of the logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with involution, the interpretation of the additional involutive negation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is required to be the ''standard involution'' &lt;math&gt;f_\sim(x)=1-x,&lt;/math&gt; rather than other involutions which can also interpret &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; over t-norm &lt;math&gt;L_\sim&lt;/math&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="FM2006"&gt;Flaminio &amp; Marchioni (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In general, therefore, the definition of standard t-norm algebras has to be explicitly given for t-norm logics with additional connectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8101">'''Techno-globalism''' is a [[social theory]] that aims to explain [[globalization]] using the spread of [[science]] and [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-07-01|title=Techno-globalism, techno-nationalism and technological systems: organizing the evidence|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497200000614|journal=Technovation|language=en|volume=21|issue=7|pages=399–412|doi=10.1016/S0166-4972(00)00061-4|issn=0166-4972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the spread of science and technology, different nations and societies come together to form a more open and knowledge-based group which is characterized as "globalized." &lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Broadly speaking, techno-globalism is establishing connections between individuals or groups of individuals using shared science and technological practices. In terms of form, techno-globalism can be expressed in macro and micro scales ranging from the interconnections of [[Economy|national economies]] to individual behavioral culture.

== Origins and background ==
Techno-globalism as a social theory emerged in the late 1990s following the end of the [[Cold War]]. During the Cold War, technology, especially [[military technology]], acted as a separating force between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniele|first=Archibugi,|last2=Jonathan|first2=Michie,|date=|title=The globalisation of technology: a new taxonomy|url=https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/19/1/121/1708275?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.cje.a035299|issn=1464-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear arms race]] and the [[space race]] are examples of the tension between the two superpowers created by science and technology. As a result, political and social theorists on globalization saw technology as a symbol of [[nationalism]] which many theorized as [[Technological nationalism|techno-nationalism]]. However, following the Cold War, global initiatives on cooperation in scientific research and technology development shed new light on the role that science and technology can play in globalization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Massive science projects often require co-funding of different nations and, more importantly, the sharing of knowledge among different nations. These projects signal a shift from technology as competition to technology as cooperation. Techno-globalism further permeates the globe by going beyond national scale and into the realm of individual behavior. [[Consumerism]] in the 21st century led to the widespread consumption of technology products that created common behavioral and cultural patterns among individuals around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rise of the [[internet]], [[smartphone]]s and [[social media]] around the world create common values and behavioral patterns in people who have different national backgrounds. This trend of globalization on an individual level is supported by techno-globalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44953782|title=Techno-nationalism and techno-globalism : conflict and cooperation|last=Sylvia.|first=Ostry,|date=1995|publisher=Brookings Institution|others=Nelson, Richard R.|isbn=0585179506|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=44953782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of techno-globalism on a national scale ==
Examples of techno-globalism can be found in the joint efforts of nations pursuing scientific knowledge or realizing ambitious engineering projects. Large-scale scientific research and engineering projects often require fundings and manpower beyond the capacity of a single nation. As such, nations are brought together under the common goal of science and technology which affirms techno-globalism.

The [[International Space Station]] is a low-orbit space project made possible by the cooperation of 15 countries. The first part of the space station was launched into space in 1998 and other parts of the space station followed. Since the space station is made up of individual parts, each country utilizes its strength to build one part and the parts are finally assembled in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/overview/index.html|title=International Space Station Overview|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=2016-04-28|work=NASA|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that respect, the International Space Station is an embodiment of techno-globalism where nations share resources and information to achieve a common goal.[[File:ISS March 2009.jpg|thumb|The International Space Station. A joint effort of fifteen countries to establish a space platform for research and exploration.|217x217px]]

The [[Large Hadron Collider]] is another example of techno-globalism at a national scale. The LHC is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator and was built under the cooperation of more than 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider|title=The Large Hadron Collider {{!}} CERN|website=home.cern|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, both the construction and the utilization of the facility represent techno-globalism.

== Examples of techno-globalism on an individual scale ==
[[File:Apple-desk-laptop-macbook-pro (23699397893).jpg|thumb|The globally acclaimed MacBook Pro design]]
Techno-globalism can impact the behaviors and values of individuals through the use of technology in people's daily lives.

The [[MacBook Pro]] is a prime example of techno-globalism from a consumer standpoint. Due to the wild{{peacock term|date=July 2018}} success of the MacBook Pro around the globe, the unibody case design and the aesthetics of the MacBook Pro is highly valued{{according to whom|date=July 2018}} in the countries where it is sold.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is surprising{{according to whom|date=July 2018}} that China and the U.S, for instance, two countries with drastically different cultures and art tastes have all come to appreciate the engineering of this piece of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70668758|title=IWoz : computer geek to cult icon : how I invented the personal computer, co-founded Apple, and had fun doing it|last=1950-|first=Wozniak, Steve,|date=2006|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|others=Smith, Gina.|isbn=0393061434|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=70668758}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The example of the MacBook Pro goes to show the common values created by technology among individuals that use it despite their diverse cultural backgrounds.

== The impact of techno-globalism on science ==
Despite the many benefits that techno-globalism brings in terms of resources and cooperations, techno-globalism can pose certain challenges to the way that people deal with technology.{{clarify|date=July 2018}} Many existing policies regarding science and technology are inadequate to handle the fast-paced dynamics of techno-globalism due to their slow responses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de la Mothe|first=John|last2=Dufour|first2=Paul R.|date=1995|title=Techno-Globalism and the Challenges to Science and Technology Policy|jstor=20027317|journal=Daedalus|volume=124|issue=3|pages=219–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the corresponding political infrastructure, techno-globalism would bring chaos into the field of science and technology since people would be trying to integrate parts of science inappropriately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the other hand, techno-globalism could facilitate standardization in the science community. In the case of the LHC, scientists working at the LHC have the opportunity to work under a common setting which allows for better communication and integration of their academic works.

'''Theoretical planetology''', also known as '''theoretical planetary science'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12525.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211094245/http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12525.html |date=December 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of [[planetary sciences]] that developed in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="yugoplanet"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0005117 [astro-ph/0005117&amp;#93; Semiclassical planetology : some results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of the work ==
[[File:VFPt Earths Magnetic Field Confusion.svg|thumb|right|Diagram showing [[Earth's magnetic field]]: theoretical planetologists study many aspects of planetary bodies, such as how their magnetic fields are generated in their cores.&lt;ref name="uclaplanet"/&gt;]]

[[File:AtmosphCirc2.png|thumb|right|Theoretical planetologists study [[atmospheric circulation]] over planets.]]

Theoretical planetologists, also known as theoretical planetary scientists, use [[Scientific modelling|modelling]] techniques to develop an understanding of the internal structure of [[planet]]s by making assumptions about their [[chemical]] composition and the state of their materials, then calculating the radial distribution of various properties such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]], or [[density]] of material across the planet's internals.&lt;ref name="yugoplanet"/&gt;

Theoretical planetologists also use [[numerical analysis|numerical]] models to understand how the [[Solar System]] planets were formed and develop in the future, their [[thermal]] evolution, their [[tectonics]], how [[magnetic field]]s are formed in planetary interiors, how [[convection]] processes work in the [[Planetary core|cores]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]s of [[terrestrial planet]]s and in the interiors of [[gas giants]], how their [[lithosphere]]s deform, the [[orbit]]al dynamics of planetary satellites, how [[dust]] and [[ice]] are transported on the surface of some planets (such as [[Mars]]), and how the [[atmospheric circulation]] takes place over a planet.&lt;ref name="uclaplanet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ess.ucla.edu/research/planet_physics.asp |title=UCLA - Earth and Space Sciences - Research in Planetary Physics |publisher=Ess.ucla.edu |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426105504/http://www.ess.ucla.edu/research/planet_physics.asp |archivedate=2009-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical planetologists may use [[laboratory]] [[experiment]]s to understand various phenomena analogous to planetary processes, such as convection in rotating fluids.&lt;ref name="uclaplanet"/&gt;

Theoretical planetologists make extensive use of basic [[physics]], particularly [[fluid dynamics]] and [[condensed matter physics]], and much of their work involves interpretation of [[data]] returned by [[space missions]], although they rarely get actively involved in them.&lt;ref name="stevenson"&gt;[http://www.planetary.caltech.edu/faculty/stevenson/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820132705/http://www.planetary.caltech.edu/faculty/stevenson/ |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational requirements ==

Typically a theoretical planetologist will have to have had [[higher education]] in [[physics]] and [[theoretical physics]], at [[PhD]] doctorate level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.caltech.edu/faculty/stevenson/cv.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Media Relations |url=http://mr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12525.html |title=Four from Caltech Named to National Academy of Sciences - Caltech |publisher=Mr.caltech.edu |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814065850/http://mr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12525.html |archivedate=2007-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific visualisation ==

Because of the use of [[scientific visualisation]] animation, theoretical planetology has a relationship with [[computer graphics]].  Example movies exhibiting this relation are the 4-minute "[[The Origin of the Moon (scientific visualisation movie)|The Origin of the Moon]]"&lt;ref name="visualisation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olats.org/space/13avril/2002/space13Avr2002.html |title=Présentation de la journée |publisher=Olats.org |accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major successes ==

One of the major successes of theoretical planetology is the prediction and subsequent confirmation of [[volcanism on Io]].&lt;ref name="Hans-2003"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

  | first = Hans 
  | title = Encyclopedia of Space Science &amp; Technology

The prediction was made by [[Stanton J. Peale]] who wrote a [[scientific paper]] claiming that Io must be volcanically active that was published one week before [[Voyager 1]] encountered [[Jupiter]].  When Voyager 1 photographed Io in 1979, his theory was confirmed.&lt;ref name="prediction"/&gt;  Later photographs of Io by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and from the ground also showed volcanoes on Io's surface, and they were extensively studied and photographed by the [[Galileo]] orbiter of Jupiter from 1995-2003.

[[File:Bay of Fundy.jpg|400px|thumb|High and low tide in the [[Bay of Fundy]]]]

The '''theory of tides''' is the application of [[continuum mechanics]] to interpret and predict the [[tide|tidal]] deformations of planetary and satellite bodies and their atmospheres and [[ocean]]s (especially Earth's Ocean) under the gravitational loading of another astronomical body or bodies (especially the [[Moon]]).

== Kepler ==

In 1609 [[Johannes Kepler]] correctly suggested that the gravitation of the Moon causes the tides,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Astronomia nova …'' (1609), p. 5 of the Introductio in hoc opus&lt;/ref&gt; basing his argument upon ancient observations and correlations. The influence of the Moon on tides was mentioned in Ptolemy's ''Tetrabiblos'' as having derived from ancient observation.

==Galileo's attempt to explain the tides==
[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|thumb|left|Justus Sustermans – Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636]]
[[File:Galileo Theory of Tides.gif|thumb|right|"The greater circle represents the orbit of the Earth around the Sun...while the smaller one is the rotating Earth itself" (Palmeri 1998, p. 229).]]

In 1616, [[Galileo Galilei]] wrote ''[[Discourse on the Tides]]'' (''Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare''),&lt;ref name="Galileo's Theory of the Tides"&gt;[[Rice University]]: [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/tides.html Galileo's Theory of the Tides], by Rossella Gigli, retrieved 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in a letter to [[Alessandro Orsini (cardinal)|Cardinal Orsini]]. In this discourse, he tried to explain the occurrence of the tides as the result of the [[Earth]]'s rotation and [[heliocentrism|revolution around the Sun]]. Galileo believed that the oceans moved like water in a large basin: as the basin moves, so does the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyson|first=Peter|title=Galileo's Big Mistake|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/galileo-big-mistake.html|website=NOVA|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, as the Earth revolves, the force of the Earth's rotation causes the oceans to "alternately accelerate and retardate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmieri|first=Paolo|title=Re-examining Galileo's Theory of Tides|date=1998|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view on the oscillation and "alternately accelerated and retardated" motion of the Earth's rotation is a "dynamic process" that deviated from the previous dogma, which proposed "a process of expansion and contraction of seawater."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmeri|first=Paolo|title=Re-examining Galileo's Theory of Tides|date=1998|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Galileo's theory was erroneous.&lt;ref name="Galileo's Theory of the Tides"/&gt;  In subsequent centuries, [[Tide#Analysis|further analysis]] led to the current tidal physics. Galileo rejected Kepler's explanation of the tides.

== Newton ==

Newton, in the ''Principia'', provided a correct explanation for the [[tidal force]], which can be used to explain tides on a planet covered by a uniform ocean, but which takes no account of the distribution of the continents or ocean bathymetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/static.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410173511/http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/static.htm |archivedate=10 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dynamic theory of Laplace==
The dynamic theory of tides describes and predicts the actual real behavior of ocean tides.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearsonhighered.com/samplechapter/0132401223.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Newton's three-body diagram.PNG|400px|right|Newton's three-body model]]
While [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] explained the tides by describing the tide-generating forces and [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] gave a description of the static reaction of the waters on Earth to the tidal potential, the ''dynamic theory of tides'', developed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1775,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservearticles.com/2011112017524/short-notes-on-the-dynamical-theory-of-laplace.html&lt;/ref&gt; describes the ocean's real reaction to [[Tidal force|tidal forces]].&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/luanne/pages/ocean420/notes/tidedynamics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace's theory of ocean tides took into account [[friction]], [[resonance]] and natural periods of ocean basins. It predicted the large [[amphidromic]] systems in the world's ocean basins and explains the oceanic tides that are actually observed.&lt;ref&gt;http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kess/JGGHBA/2009/v30n5/JGGHBA_2009_v30n5_671.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium theory, based on the gravitational gradient from the Sun and Moon but ignoring the Earth's rotation, the effects of continents, and other important effects, could not explain the real ocean tides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanho.co.za/tides/tide_theory.pdf Tidal theory] website South African Navy Hydrographic Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/swojtal/SFWpage/161Stuff/161Lect17/sld012.htm |title=Dynamic theory for tides |publisher=Oberlin.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/645fall2003_web.dir/ellie_boyce/dynamic.htm|title=  Dynamic Theory of Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/dynamic.htm |title=Dynamic Tides – In contrast to "static" theory, the dynamic theory of tides recognizes that water covers only three-quarters o |publisher=Web.vims.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113022202/http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/dynamic.htm |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coa.edu/stodd/oceanweb/oceanography/Oceanlectures02/Lecture8/sld014.htm |title=The Dynamic Theory of Tides |publisher=Coa.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219161027/http://www.coa.edu/stodd/oceanweb/oceanography/Oceanlectures02/Lecture8/sld014.htm |archivedate=19 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beacon.salemstate.edu/~lhanson/gls214/gls214_tides{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/St-Ts/Tides.html |title=Tides – building, river, sea, depth, oceans, effects, important, largest, system, wave, effect, marine, Pacific |publisher=Waterencyclopedia.com |date=2010-06-27 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocean.tamu.edu/wormuth/tidestxt.html |title=TIDES |publisher=Ocean.tamu.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since measurements have confirmed the theory, many things have possible explanations now, like how the tides interact with deep sea ridges and chains of seamounts give rise to deep eddies that transport nutrients from the deep to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Floor Anthoni |url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/tides.htm |title=Tides |publisher=Seafriends.org.nz |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The equilibrium tide theory calculates the height of the tide wave of less than half a meter, while the dynamic theory explains why tides are up to 15 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/tidal-info/tidal-intro/cause-nature|title=  The Cause &amp; Nature of Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Satellite observations confirm the accuracy of the dynamic theory, and the tides worldwide are now measured to within a few centimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/stories/topex/tides.html |title=Scientific Visualization Studio TOPEX/Poseidon images |publisher=Svs.gsfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SVS-1333 |title=TOPEX/Poseidon Western Hemisphere: Tide Height Model : NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements from the [[CHAMP (satellite)|CHAMP]] satellite closely match the models based on the [[TOPEX]] data.&lt;ref&gt;TOPEX data used to model actual tides for 15 days from the year 2000 |url=http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a001300/a001332/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geomag.us/info/Ocean/m2_CHAMP+longwave_SSH.swf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/ |title=OSU Tidal Data Inversion |publisher=Volkov.oce.orst.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accurate models of tides worldwide are essential for research since the variations due to tides must be removed from measurements when calculating gravity and changes in sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.dgfi.tum.de/en/news/baroclinic-tides/|title=   Dynamic and residual ocean tide analysis for improved GRACE de-aliasing (DAROTA)|deadurl=   yes|archiveurl=   https://web.archive.org/web/20150402194935/http://www.dgfi.tum.de/en/news/baroclinic-tides/|archivedate=   2 April 2015|df=   dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] formulated a single set of linear [[partial differential equation]]s, for tidal flow described as a [[barotropic]] two-dimensional sheet flow. [[Coriolis effect]]s are introduced as well as lateral forcing by gravity. Laplace obtained these equations by simplifying the [[fluid dynamic]] equations. But they can also be derived from energy integrals via [[Lagrange's equation]].

For a fluid sheet of [[average]] thickness ''D'', the vertical tidal elevation ''ζ'', as well as the horizontal velocity components ''u'' and ''v'' (in the [[latitude]] ''φ'' and [[longitude]] ''λ'' directions, respectively) satisfy '''Laplace's tidal equations''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/group/dave/pdf/LTE.frame.pdf|title= The Laplace Tidal Equations and Atmospheric Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  \begin{align} 
    \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t}
    &amp;+ \frac{1}{a \cos( \varphi )} \left[
           \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} (uD)
         + \frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi} \left(vD \cos( \varphi )\right)  
       \right]
     = 0,
     \\[2ex]
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
   &amp;- v \left( 2 \Omega \sin( \varphi ) \right)
    + \frac{1}{a \cos( \varphi )} \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \left( g \zeta + U \right)
    =0 
    \qquad \text{and} \\[2ex]

   &amp;+ u \left( 2 \Omega \sin( \varphi ) \right)
    + \frac{1}{a} \frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi} \left( g \zeta + U \right)
    =0,
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Ω'' is the [[angular frequency]] of the planet's rotation, ''g'' is the planet's gravitational acceleration at the mean ocean surface, ''a'' is the planetary radius, and ''U'' is the external gravitational tidal-forcing [[potential]].

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] rewrote Laplace's momentum terms using the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] to find an equation for [[vorticity]]. Under certain conditions this can be further rewritten as a conservation of vorticity.

==Tidal analysis and prediction==

===Harmonic analysis===
[[File:Tides Fourier Transform.png|300px|thumb|Fourier transform of tides measured at Ft. Pulaski in 2012.  Data downloaded from http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datums.html?id=8670870 Fourier transform computed with https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/]]

Laplace's improvements in theory were substantial, but they still left prediction in an approximate state. This position changed in the 1860s when the local circumstances of tidal phenomena were more fully brought into account by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]]'s application of [[Fourier analysis]] to the tidal motions as [[harmonic analysis]].

Thomson's work in this field was then further developed and extended by [[George Darwin]], applying the lunar theory current in his time. Darwin's symbols for the tidal harmonic constituents are still used.

Darwin's harmonic developments of the tide-generating forces were later improved when [[Arthur Thomas Doodson|A T Doodson]], applying the [[lunar theory]] of [[Ernest William Brown|E W Brown]],&lt;ref name=dec2001&gt;D E Cartwright, "Tides: a scientific history", Cambridge University Press 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sSesNjG96JYC&amp;pg=PA163 at pages 163-4].&lt;/ref&gt; developed the tide-generating potential (TGP) in harmonic form, distinguishing 388 tidal frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;S Casotto, F Biscani, "A fully analytical approach to the harmonic development of the tide-generating potential accounting for precession, nutation, and perturbations due to figure and planetary terms", AAS Division on Dynamical Astronomy, April 2004, vol.36(2), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Doodson's work was carried out and published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;A T Doodson (1921), "The Harmonic Development of the Tide-Generating Potential", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Vol. 100, No. 704 (Dec. 1, 1921), pp. 305-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doodson devised a practical system for specifying the different harmonic components of the tide-generating potential, the [[Arthur Thomas Doodson#Doodson numbers|Doodson numbers]], a system still in use.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. T D Moyer (2003), "Formulation for observed and computed values of Deep Space Network data types for navigation", vol.3 in Deep-space communications and navigation series, Wiley (2003), e.g. at pp.126-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-twentieth century further analysis has generated many more terms than Doodson's 388.  About 62 constituents are of sufficient size to be considered for possible use in marine tide prediction, but sometimes many fewer can predict tides to useful accuracy.  The calculations of tide predictions using the harmonic constituents are laborious, and from the 1870s to about the 1960s they were carried out using a mechanical [[tide-predicting machine]], a special-purpose form of [[analog computer]] now superseded in this work by digital electronic computers that can be programmed to carry out the same computations.

===Tidal constituents===
Tidal constituents combine to give an endlessly varying aggregate because of their different and incommensurable frequencies: the effect is visualized in an [http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/tidesIII3.html animation of the American Mathematical Society] illustrating the way in which the components used to be mechanically combined in the [[tide-predicting machine]].  Amplitudes of tidal constituents are given below for six example locations:

A '''thermophile''' is an organism—a type of [[extremophile]]—that thrives at relatively high temperatures, between '''{{convert|41|and|122|C|F}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms | date=2006| author=Madigan MT| author2=Martino JM | edition=11th |pages=136 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=0-13-196893-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Takai T |display-authors= etal | title = Cell proliferation at 122°C and isotopically heavy CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production by a hyperthermophilic methanogen under high-pressure cultivation

Thermophilic [[eubacteria]] are suggested to have been among the earliest bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid19000750"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Horiike T |author2=Miyata D |author3=Hamada K |display-authors=etal |title=Phylogenetic construction of 17 bacterial phyla by new method and carefully selected orthologs |journal=Gene |volume=429 |issue=1–2 |pages=59–64 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19000750 |pmc=2648810 |doi=10.1016/j.gene.2008.10.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378-1119(08)00524-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermophiles are found in various [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]]ly heated regions of the [[Earth]], such as hot springs like those in [[Yellowstone National Park]] (see image) and [[deep sea]] [[hydrothermal vent]]s, as well as decaying plant matter, such as [[peat bogs]] and compost.

Thermophiles can survive at high temperatures, whereas other bacteria would be damaged and sometimes killed if exposed to the same temperatures. 

The [[enzyme]]s in thermophiles necessarily function at high temperatures. Some of these enzymes are used in [[molecular biology]], for example, heat-stable [[DNA polymerase]]s for [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]), and in washing agents.

"Thermophile" is derived from the {{lang-el|θερμότητα}} (''thermotita''), meaning heat, and {{lang-el|φίλια}} (''philia''), love.

==Classification==
Thermophiles can be classified in various ways.  One classification sorts these organisms according to their optimal growth temperatures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stetter, K.|title=History of discovery of the first hyperthermophiles|journal=Extremophiles|year=2006|volume=10|pages=357–362|doi=10.1007/s00792-006-0012-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Simply thermophiles: 50–64 °C
# Extreme thermophiles 65–79 °C
# Hyperthermophiles 80 °C and beyond, but not &lt; 50 °C.

In a related classification, thermophiles are sorted as follows: 
# Obligate thermophiles (also called extreme thermophiles) require such high temperatures for growth, whereas
# Facultative thermophiles (also called moderate thermophiles) can thrive at high temperatures, but also at lower temperatures (below {{convert|50|C}}).
# [[Hyperthermophile]]s are particularly extreme thermophiles for which the optimal temperatures are above {{convert|80|C}}.

[[File:Thermophilic bacteria.jpg|thumb|A colony of thermophiles in the outflow of [[Mickey Hot Springs]], [[Oregon]],  the water temperature is approximately 
{{convert|60|C}}.]]

Many of the hyperthermophiles Archea require elemental [[sulfur]] for growth. Some are [[anaerobe]]s that use the sulfur instead of [[oxygen]] as an [[electron acceptor]] during [[cellular respiration]]. Some are [[lithotroph]]s that oxidize sulphur to create [[sulfuric acid]] as an energy source, thus requiring the microorganism to be adapted to very low [[pH]] (i.e., it is an [[acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]] as well as thermophile). These organisms are inhabitants of hot, sulfur-rich environments usually associated with [[volcanism]], such as [[hot springs]], [[geysers]], and [[fumaroles]].  In these places, especially in Yellowstone National Park, [[wiktionary:zonation|zonation]] of microorganisms according to their temperature optima occurs. Often, these organisms are colored, due to the presence of [[photosynthetic]] pigments.

==Thermophile versus mesophile==
Thermophiles can be discriminated from [[mesophile]]s from genomic features. For example, the [[GC-content]] levels in the coding regions of some signatures genes were consistently identified as correlated with the temperature range condition when the association analysis was applied to mesophilic and thermophilic organisms regardless of their phylogeny, oxygen requirement, salinity, or habitat conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zheng H |author2=Wu H |title=Gene-centric association analysis for the correlation between the guanine-cytosine content levels and temperature range conditions of prokaryotic species |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=11 |pages=S7 |date=December 2010 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-11-S11-S7 |pmc=3024870 |pmid=21172057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene transfer and genetic exchange==
''Sulfolobus solfataricus'' and ''Sulfolobus acidocaldarius'' are hyperthermophilic archaea.  When these organisms are exposed to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced.&lt;ref name=Frols08&gt;&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=6 |author=Fröls S |author2=Ajon M |author3=Wagner M |author4=Teichmann D |author5=Zolghadr B |author6= Folea M |author7=Boekema EJ |author8=Driessen AJ |author9=Schleper C |author10=Albers SV |title=UV-inducible cellular aggregation of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is mediated by pili formation |journal=Mol.

They suggested that this process is crucial under DNA damaging conditions such as high temperature.  Also it has been suggested that DNA transfer in ''Sulfolobus'' may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are associated with species-specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage [see [[Transformation (genetics)]]].

[[File:Animation30.gif|thumb|[[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] animation of an [[Apollonian sphere packing]] with transparent background]]
'''Transparency''' is possible in a number of graphics file formats. The term '''transparency''' is used in various ways by different people, but at its simplest there is "full transparency" i.e. something that is completely invisible. Only part of a graphic should be fully transparent, or there would be nothing to see.  More complex is "partial transparency" or "translucency" where the effect is achieved that a graphic is partially transparent in the same way as colored glass. Since ultimately a printed page or computer or television screen can only be one color at a point, partial transparency is always simulated at some level by mixing colors. There are many different ways to mix colors, so in some cases transparency is ambiguous.

In addition, transparency is often an "extra" for a graphics format, and some graphics programs will ignore the transparency.
[[File:Animated PNG example bouncing beach ball.png|thumb|Animated PNG ([[APNG]]) 8-bit transparency]]
[[Raster graphics|Raster]] file formats that support transparency include [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[TIFF]], and [[JPEG 2000]], through either a ''transparent color'' or an [[alpha channel]].

Most [[Vector graphics|vector]] formats implicitly support transparency because they simply avoid putting any objects at a given point. This includes [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] and [[Windows Metafile|WMF]]. For
vector graphics this may not strictly be seen as transparency, but it requires
much of the same careful programming as transparency in raster formats.

More complex vector formats may allow transparency combinations between the elements within the graphic, as well as that above. This includes [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[portable document format|PDF]].

A suitable [[raster graphics editor]] shows transparency by a special pattern, e.g. a checkerboard pattern.

==Transparent pixels==
[[Image:Binary transparency monochrome.png|frame|This image has binary transparency (some pixels fully transparent, other pixels fully opaque). It can be transparent against any background because it is monochrome.]]

One color entry in a single GIF or PNG image's palette can be defined as "transparent" rather than an actual color. This means that when the decoder encounters a pixel with this value, it is rendered in the background color of the part of the screen where the image is placed, also if this varies pixel-by-pixel as in the case of a background [[image]].

Applications include:
* an image that is not rectangular can be filled to the required rectangle using transparent surroundings; the image can even have holes (e.g. be ring-shaped)
* in a run of text, a special symbol for which an image is used because it is not available in the character set, can be given a transparent background, resulting in a matching background.

The transparent color should be chosen carefully, to avoid items that just happen to be the same color vanishing.

Even this limited form of transparency has patchy implementation, though most popular web browsers are capable of displaying transparent GIF images. This support often does not extend to printing, especially to printing devices (such as [[PostScript]]) which do not include support for transparency in the device or driver. Outside the world of web browsers, support is fairly hit-or-miss for transparent GIF files.

===Edge limitations of transparent pixels===
[[Image:Binary transparency greyscale.png|frame|This image has binary transparency. However, it is grayscale, with [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]], so it looks good only against a white background. Set against a different background, a "ghosting" effect from the shades of gray would result.]]

The edges of characters and other images with transparent background should not have [[Grayscale|shades of gray]]: these are normally used for intermediate colors between the color of the letter/image and that of the background, typically shades of gray being intermediate between a black letter and a white background. However, with, for example, a red background the intermediate colors would be dark red. Gray edge pixels would give an ugly and unclear result. For a variable background color there are no suitable fixed intermediate colors.

==Partial transparency by alpha channels==
[[Image:Alpha transparency image.png|frame|This image has partial transparency (254 possible levels of transparency between fully transparent and fully opaque). It can be transparent against any background despite being anti-aliased.]]

PNG and TIFF also allows partial transparency, which solves the edge limitation problem. However, support is even more patchy. [[Internet Explorer]] prior to version 7 does not support partial transparency in a PNG graphic. Very few applications correctly process TIFF files with alpha channels.

A major use of partial transparency, but not the only one, is to produce "soft edges" in graphics so that they blend into their background. See also [[Typeface#Monochrome or with shades of gray|monochrome or with shades of gray]] and [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]].

The process of combining a partially transparent color with its background ("compositing") is often ill-defined and the results may not be exactly the same in all cases. For example, where color correction is in use, should the colors be composited before or after color correction?

[[Image:Transparency overlays.png|frame|This image shows the results of overlaying each of the above transparent PNG images on a background color of #6080A0. Note the gray fringes on the letters of the middle image.]]
[[Image:Transparency example.PNG|frame|This shows how the above images would look when, for example, editing them. The grey and white check pattern would be converted into transparency.]]

==Transparency by clipping path==
An alternative approach to full transparency is to use a [[Clipping path]]. A clipping path is simply a shape or outline, that is used in conjunction with the other graphics. Everything inside the path is visible, and everything outside the path is invisible. The path is inherently vector, but can potentially be used to mask both vector and bitmap data. The main usage of clipping paths is in PostScript files.

==Compositing calculations==
While some transparency specifications are vague, others may give mathematical details of how two colors are to be composited. This gives a fairly simple example of how compositing calculations can work, can produce the expected results, and can also produce surprises.

In this example, two grayscale colors are to be composited. Grayscale values are considered to be numbers between 0.0 (white) and 1.0 (black). ''To emphasize: this is only one possible rule for transparency. If working with transparency, check the rules in use for your situation.''

The color at a point, where color G1 and G2 are to be combined, is {{code|1=( G1 + G2 ) / 2}}.
Some consequences of this are:
* Where the colors are equal, the result is the same color because {{code|1=( G1 + G1 ) /2  = G1}}.
* Where one color (G1) is white (0.0), the result is {{code|1=G2 / 2}}. This will always be less than any nonzero value of G2, so the result is whiter than G2. (This is easily reversed for the case where G2 is white).
* Where one color (G1) is black (1.0), the result is {{code|1=( G2 + 1 ) / 2}}. This will always be more than G2, so the result is more black than G2.
* The formula is [[commutative]] since {{code|1=( G1 + G2 ) / 2 = ( G2 + G1 ) / 2}}. This means it does not matter which order two graphics are mixed i.e. which of the two is on the top and which is on the bottom.
* The formula is ''not'' [[associative]] since
 ( ( G1 + G2 ) / 2 + G3 ) / 2 = G1 / 4 + G2 / 4 + G3 / 2
 ( G1 + ( G2 + G3 ) / 2 ) / 2 = G1 / 2 + G2 / 4 + G3 / 4
This is important as it means that when combining three or more objects with this rule for transparency, the final color depends very much on the order of doing the calculations.

Although the formula is simple, it may not be ideal. Human perception of brightness is not linear - we do not necessarily consider that a gray value of 0.5 is halfway between black and white. Such details may not matter when transparency is used only to soften edges, but in more complex designs this may be significant. Most people working seriously with transparency will need to see the results and may fiddle with the colors or (where possible) the algorithm to arrive at the results they need.

This formula can easily be generalized to [[RGB]] color or [[CMYK]] color by applying the formula to each channel separately. For example, final {{code|1=red = ( R1 + R2 ) / 2}}. But it cannot be applied to all color models. For example, [[Lab color space|Lab color]] would produce results that were surprising.

An alternative model is that at every point in each element to be combined for transparency there is an associated color and opacity between 0 and 1. For each color channel, you might work with this model: if a channel with intensity {{code|1=G2}} and opacity {{code|1=T2}} overlays a channel with intensity {{code|1=G1}} and opacity {{code|1=T1}} the result will be a channel with intensity equal to {{code|1=(1 - T2) * G1 + G2}}, and opacity {{code|1=1 - (1 - T2) * (1 - T1)}}. Each channel must be multiplied by corresponding alpha value before composition (so called [[premultiplied alpha]]). The SVG file specification uses this type of blending, and this is one of the models that can be used in PDF.

Alpha channels may be implemented in this way, where the alpha channel provides an opacity level to be applied equally to all other channels. To work with the above formula, the opacity needs to be scaled to the range 0 to 1, whatever its external representation (often 0 to 255 if using 8 bit samples such as "RGBA").

==Transparency in PDF==

Starting with version 1.4 of the PDF standard ([[Adobe Acrobat]] version 5), transparency (including translucency) is supported. Transparency in PDF files allows creators to achieve various effects, including adding shadows to objects, making objects semi-transparent and having objects blend into each other or into text. PDF supports many different blend modes, not just the most common averaging method, and the rules for compositing many overlapping objects allow choices (such as whether a group of objects are blended before being blended with the background, or whether each object in turn is blended into the background).

PDF transparency is a very complex model, its original specification by Adobe being over 100 pages long. A key source of complication is that blending objects with different [[color spaces]] can be tricky and error-prone as well as cause [[Software incompatibility|compatibility]] issues. Transparency in PDF was designed not to cause errors in PDF viewers that did not understand it – they would simply display all elements as fully opaque. However, this was a two-edged sword as users with older viewers, PDF printers, etc. could see or print something completely different from the original design.

The fact that the PDF transparency model is so complicated means that it is not well supported. This means that RIPs and printers often have problems printing PDFs with transparency. The solution to this is either to rasterize the image or to apply vector transparency flattening to the PDF. However vector transparency flattening is extremely complex and only supported by a few specialist packages.

==Transparency in PostScript==
The [[PostScript]] language has limited support for full (not partial) transparency, depending on the PostScript level. Partial transparency is available with the pdfmark extension,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/sdk/pdf/pdf_creation_apis_and_specs/pdfmarkReference.pdf|title=pdfmark Reference Manual|last=Adobe|date=2005-10-02|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; available on many PostScript implementations.

=== Level 1 ===
Level 1 PostScript offers transparency via two methods:

* A one-bit (monochrome) image can be treated as a mask. In this case the 1-bits can be painted any single color, while the 0-bits are not painted at all. This technique cannot be generalised to more than one color, or to vector shapes.
* Clipping paths can be defined. These restrict what part of all subsequent graphics can be seen. This can be used for any kind of graphic, however in level 1, the maximum number of nodes in a path was often limited to 1500, so complex paths (e.g. cutting around the hair in a photograph of a person's head) often failed.

=== Level 2 ===
Level 2 PostScript adds no specific transparency features. However, by the use of patterns, arbitrary graphics can be painted through masks defined by any vector or text operations. This is, however, complex to implement. In addition, this too often reached implementation limits, and few if any application programs ever offered this technique.

=== Level 3 ===
Level 3 PostScript adds further transparency option for any raster image. A transparent color, or range of colors, can be applied; or a separate 1-bit mask can be used to provide an alpha channel.

===Encapsulated PostScript===
EPS files contain PostScript, which may be level 1, 2 or 3 and make use of the features above. A more subtle issue arises with the previews for EPS files that are typically used to show the view of the EPS file on screen. There are viable techniques for setting transparency in the preview. For example, a TIFF preview might use a TIFF alpha channel. However, many applications do not use this transparency information and will therefore show the preview as a rectangle. A semi-proprietary technique pioneered in [[Photoshop]] and adopted by a number of pre-press applications is to store a clipping path in a standard location of the EPS, and use that for display.

In addition, few of the programs that generate EPS previews will generate transparency information in the preview.

Some programs have sought to get around this by treating all white in the preview as transparent, but this too is problematic in the cases where some whites are ''not'' transparent.

More recently, applications have been appearing that ignore the preview altogether; they therefore get information on which parts of the preview to paint by interpreting the PostScript.

'''Transpiration''' is the process of [[water]] movement through a [[plant]] and its [[evaporation]] from aerial parts, such as [[leaf|leaves]], [[Plant stem|stems]] and [[flower]]s. Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism.  The remaining 97–99.5% is lost by transpiration and [[guttation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03S6VbTjCmUC|title=Modern Plant Physiology|last=Sinha|first=Rajiv Kumar|date=2004-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-1714-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called [[stomata]], and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage. The stomata are bordered by [[guard cell]]s and their stomatal accessory cells (together known as stomatal complex) that open and close the pore.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | publisher = Freeman, Scott| title = Biological Science| edition = 3| author = Benjamin Cummins| year = 2007| page = 215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transpiration occurs through the  stomatal apertures, and can be thought of as a necessary "cost" associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of [[carbon dioxide]] gas from the air for [[photosynthesis]]. Transpiration also cools plants, changes [[osmotic pressure]] of cells, and enables [[mass flow]] of [[Plant nutrition|mineral nutrients]] and water from roots to [[shoot]]s. Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots: the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil. Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant Physiology and Development|last=Taiz|first=Lincoln|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc|year=2015|isbn=978-1-60535-255-8|location=Sunderland, MA|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass flow of liquid water from the roots to the leaves is driven in part by [[capillary action]], but primarily driven by [[water potential]] differences. If the water potential in the ambient air is lower than the water potential in the leaf airspace of the stomatal pore, water vapor will travel down the gradient and move from the leaf airspace to the atmosphere. This movement lowers the water potential in the leaf airspace and causes evaporation of liquid water from the mesophyll cell walls. This evaporation increases the tension on the water menisci in the cell walls and decrease their radius and thus the tension that is exerted on the water in the cells. Because of the cohesive properties of water, the tension travels through the leaf cells to the leaf and stem xylem where a momentary negative pressure is created as water is pulled up the xylem from the roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Sciences|last=Freeman|first=Scott|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|isbn=978-0-321-74367-1|location=United States of America|pages=765–766}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In taller plants and trees, the force of gravity can only be overcome by the decrease in hydrostatic (water) pressure in the upper parts of the plants due to the [[diffusion]] of water out of stomata into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Water is absorbed at the roots by [[osmosis]], and any dissolved mineral nutrients travel with it through the [[xylem]].

The [[Xylem#Cohesion-tension_theory|cohesion-tension theory]] explains how leaves pull water through the xylem. Water molecules stick together, or exhibit [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]]. As a water molecule evaporates from the surface of the leaf, it pulls on the adjacent water molecule, creating a continuous flow of water through the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant Biology|last=Graham|first=Linda E.|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=978-0-13-146906-8|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458|pages=200–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
Plants regulate the rate of transpiration by controlling the size of the stomatal apertures. The rate of transpiration is also influenced by the evaporative demand of the atmosphere surrounding the leaf such as boundary layer conductance, [[humidity]], [[temperature]], wind and incident sunlight. [[Soil]] water supply and soil temperature can influence stomatal opening, and thus transpiration rate. The amount of water lost by a plant also depends on its size and the amount of water absorbed at the roots. Transpiration accounts for most of the water loss by a plant by the leaves and young stems.  Transpiration serves to evaporatively cool plants, as the evaporating water carries away heat energy due to its large [[Latent heat|latent heat of vaporization]] of 2260&amp;nbsp;kJ per litre.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Feature !! Effect on transpiration
|-
| Number of leaves || More leaves (or spines, or other photosynthesizing organs) means a bigger surface area and more stomata for gaseous exchange. This will result in greater water loss.
|-
| Number of stomata || More stomata will provide more pores for transpiration.
|-
| Size of the leaf || A leaf with a bigger surface area will transpire faster than a leaf with a smaller surface area. 
|-
| Presence of [[plant cuticle]] || A waxy cuticle is relatively impermeable to water and water vapour and reduces evaporation from the plant surface except via the stomata. A reflective cuticle will reduce solar heating and temperature rise of the leaf,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} helping to reduce the rate of evaporation. Tiny hair-like structures called [[trichome]]s on the surface of leaves also can inhibit water loss by creating a high humidity environment at the surface of leaves.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} These are some examples of the adaptations of plants for conservation of water that may be found on many [[xerophytes]]. 
|-
| Light supply || The rate of transpiration is controlled by stomatal aperture, and these small pores open especially for photosynthesis. While there are exceptions to this (such as night or "[[CAM photosynthesis]]"), in general a light supply will encourage open stomata.
|-
| Temperature || Temperature affects the rate in two ways:
1) An increased rate of evaporation due to a temperature rise will hasten the loss of water.
&lt;br/&gt; 2) Decreased ''relative'' humidity outside the leaf will increase the water [[potential gradient]].
|-
| Relative humidity || Drier surroundings gives a steeper water potential gradient, and so increases the rate of transpiration.
|-
| Wind || In still air, water lost due to transpiration can accumulate in the form of vapor close to the leaf surface. This will reduce the rate of water loss, as the water potential gradient from inside to outside of the leaf is then slightly less. Wind blows away much of this water vapor near the leaf surface, making the potential gradient steeper and speeding up the diffusion of water molecules into the surrounding air. Even in wind, though, there may be some accumulation of water vapor in a thin [[boundary layer]] of slower moving air next to the leaf surface. The stronger the wind, the thinner this layer will tend to be, and the steeper the water potential gradient.
|-
| Water supply || [[Irrigation in viticulture|Water stress]] caused by restricted water supply from the soil may result in stomatal closure and reduce the rates of transpiration.

[[Image:Xerophyte.png|thumb|300 px|Some [[xerophyte]]s will reduce the surface of their leaves during water deficiencies (left). If temperatures are cool enough and water levels are adequate the leaves expand again (right).]]
During a growing season, a leaf will transpire many times more water than its own weight. An acre of corn gives off about 3,000–4,000&amp;nbsp;gallons (11,400–15,100 liters) of water each day, and a large oak tree can transpire 40,000&amp;nbsp;gallons (151,000&amp;nbsp;liters) per year. The transpiration ratio is the ratio of the mass of water transpired to the mass of dry matter produced; the transpiration ratio of [[crops]] tends to fall between 200 and 1000 (''i.e.'', crop plants transpire 200 to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg of water for every kg of dry [[matter]] produced).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Martin |first=J. |last2=Leonard |first2=W. |last3=Stamp |first3=D. |title=Principles of Field Crop Production |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co. |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-02-376720-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transpiration rates of plants can be measured by a number of techniques, including [[potometer]]s, [[lysimeter]]s, porometers, [[photosynthesis system]]s and thermometric sap flow sensors.  Isotope measurements indicate transpiration is the larger component of [[evapotranspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasechko |first1=Scott |last2=Sharp |first2=Zachary D. |last3=Gibson |first3=John J. |last4=Birks |first4=S.

This suggests that soil water is not as well mixed as widely assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hydrology: The diversified economics of soil water |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v525/n7567/full/525043a.html |journal=Nature |date=2015-09-03 |issn=0028-0836 |pages=43–44 |volume=525 |issue=7567 |doi=10.1038/525043a |first=Gabriel |last=Bowen |pmid=26333464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desert]] plants have specially adapted structures, such as thick [[cuticles]], reduced leaf areas, sunken stomata and [[hairs]] to reduce transpiration and conserve water. Many [[cactus|cacti]] conduct [[photosynthesis]] in [[succulent]] stems, rather than leaves, so the surface area of the shoot is very low. Many desert plants have a special type of photosynthesis, termed [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] or CAM photosynthesis, in which the stomata are closed during the day and open at night when transpiration will be lower.

== Cavitation ==
To maintain the pressure gradient necessary for a plant to remain healthy they must continuously uptake water with their roots. They need to be able to meet the demands of water lost due to transpiration. If a plant is incapable of bringing in enough water to remain in equilibrium with transpiration an event known as cavitation occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yong-Jiang|date=December 2016|title=Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential "Circuit Breaker" against Cavitation|url=www.plantphysiol.org|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=172|issue=4|pages=2261–2274|via=American Society of Plant Biologists|pmid=27733514|pmc=5129713|doi=10.1104/pp.16.01191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavitation is when the plant cannot supply its xylem with adequate water so instead of being filled with water the xylem begins to be filled with water vapor. These particles of water vapor come together and form blockages within the xylem of the plant. This prevents the plant from being able to transport water throughout its vascular system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hochberg|first=Uri|date=June 2017|title=Stomatal Closure, Basal Leaf Embolism, and Shedding Protect the Hydraulic Integrity of Grape Stems|url=www.plantphysiol.org|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=174|issue=2|pages=764–775|via=American Society of Plant Biologists|pmid=28351909|pmc=5462014|doi=10.1104/pp.16.01816}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no apparent pattern of where cavitation occurs throughout the plant's xylem. If not effectively taken care of, cavitation can cause a plant to reach its permanent wilting point, and die. Therefore, the plant must have a method by which to remove this cavitation blockage, or it must create a new connection of vascular tissue throughout the plant.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holbrook|first=Michele|date=May 2001|title=In Vivo Observation of Cavitation and Embolism Repair Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=126|issue=1|pages=27–31|via=American Society of Plant Biologists|pmid=11351066|pmc=1540104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant does this by closing its stomates overnight, which halts the flow of transpiration. This then allows for the roots to generate over 0.05 mPa of pressure, and that is capable of destroying the blockage and refilling the xylem with water, reconnecting the vascular system. If a plant is unable to generate enough pressure to eradicate the blockage it must prevent the blockage from spreading with the use of pit pears and then create new xylem that can re-connect the vascular system of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant Physiology and Development|last=Tiaz|first=Lincoln|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|year=2015|isbn=978-1605352558|location=Massachusetts|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have begun using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to monitor the internal status of the xylem during transpiration, in a non invasive manner. This method of imaging allows for scientists to visualize the movement of water throughout the entirety of the plant. It also is capable of viewing what phase the water is in while in the xylem, which makes it possible to visualize cavitation events. Scientists were able to see that over the course of 20 hours of sunlight more than 10 xylem vessels began filling with gas particles becoming cavitated. MRI technology also made is possible to view the process by which the plant was able to repair these xylem structures. After 3 hours in darkness it was seen that the plant was able to resupply its vascular tissue with liquid water. This was possible because in darkness the stomates of the plant are closed and transpiration no longer occurs. When transpiration is halted the plant can destroy the cavitation bubbles with the use of pressure generated by the roots. These observations suggest that MRI's are capable of monitoring the functional status of xylem and allows scientists to view cavitation events for the first time.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

[[Image:UniversityOfVenda.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the University of Venda]]

The '''University of Venda''' ('''UNIVEN''') is a [[South Africa]]n Comprehensive rural based [[university]], located in [[Thohoyandou]] in [[Limpopo]] province. It was established in 1982 under the then Republic of Venda government.

==History==

It was established in 1982 to serve the inhabitants of the [[Venda]] [[bantustan]], however, the student body at Univen never consisted of Venda students only, student from all over the Northern Transvaal attended the Institution. After the end of [[apartheid]] and the re-integration of the bantustans into South Africa, Univen student body were drawn from all over South Africa. With the South African government's programme of tertiary education reform in the new millennium, Univen became a "[[comprehensive university]]", offering both theoretically oriented and practically oriented courses.

==Campus==
The University of Venda has one main Campus in [[Thohoyandou]]. The Campus houses all seven faculties of the institution namely 
*The School of Agriculture, 
*School of Education, 
*School of Environmental Science, 
*School of Health Sciences, 
*School of Human and Social Sciences, 
*School of Management Sciences, 
*School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences,
*The Univen School of Law.

The campus also houses the Art Gallery, which has a display of carvings, paintings and clay pots made by both students and local community members. Furthermore, the campus has a full-time Sport Center that is used for indoor Sports as well as other recreational activities such as drama and dance.

The main campus houses nine of the eleven official residences, namely Bernard Ncube, Carousel, F3, F4, F5, Lost City Boys, Lost City Girls, Mango Groove, Riverside and Prefab.

==Student Representative Assembly==
The representative student body of the University of Venda is made up an 84-member [[parliament]] styled structure. it is led by a 14-member cabinet also known as the SRC executive. The assembly can be further divided into three: the first sub-division is the cabinet that is led by the president, then the deputy president, the secretary-general, the deputy secretary general, there are nine ministerial portfolios as followed; Ministry of Campus and off Campus Housing, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Bursaries and Projects, Ministry of Gender and people with Disabilities, Ministry of Health, Safety and Security, Ministry of Information, External Affairs and International Relations, Ministry of Legal, Policies, and Constitutional Affairs, Ministry of Religion, Culture, Arts and Heritage, Ministry of Sports and Recreation, and with the equivanlence of a ministry there is the Chairperson of the Post Graduate Council. the second sub-division of the SRA is the Structures, these are made up of four-person executives of the Disabled Student Council (DSC), the Housing Representative Council (HRC), the Sports, Recreation and Cultural Committee (SRCC) and the School Councils from all seven faculties of the University. The third sub-division is the parliament which is composed of committees under each ministerial position.

Each member of the SRC is forwarded to parliament by a student formation they belong to except the third sub-division of the [[Student Representative Council]] who campaign independently. the [[Speaker of Parliament]] is voted in on the first sitting of Parliament by the house. the student parliament sits four times a year, once each quarter of the year.
The Univen SRA is composed of members from different formations, the recognized [[student formations]] on campus are: [[AZAPO]] Student Convention (AZASCO), [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] Student Organization, [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] Student Command (EFFSC), [[Pan-Africanist]] Student Movement of Azania (PASMA), [[South African Student Congress]] (SASCO) and the Student Christian Organization (SCO).

Each organization contests in the general elections to deploy members to the SRA, the term of office is one year, the period begins after annual election that are held during late September or early October.
The current head of the SRA is acting President Miss Nokuthula Mabuza after the suspension of the president in the beginning of the second semester.

The '''''Zone Rouge''''' (English: '''Red Zone''') is a chain of non-contiguous areas throughout northeastern [[France]] that the French government isolated after the [[First World War]]. The land, which originally covered more than {{convert|1200|km2|sqmi}}, was deemed too physically and environmentally damaged by conflict for human habitation. Rather than attempt to immediately clean up the former battlefields, the land was allowed to return to nature. Restrictions within the ''zone rouge'' still exist today although the control areas have been greatly reduced.

The ''zone rouge'' was defined just after the war as "Completely devastated. Damage to properties: 100%. Damage to Agriculture: 100%. Impossible to clean. Human life impossible".&lt;ref name=nogo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.messynessychic.com/2015/05/26/the-real-no-go-zone-of-france-a-forbidden-no-mans-land-poisoned-by-war/|title=The Real "No-Go Zone" of France: A Forbidden No Man's Land Poisoned by War|date=26 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under French law, activities such as [[housing]], [[Agriculture|farming]] or [[forestry]] were temporarily or permanently forbidden in the ''zone rouge''. This was because of the vast amounts of human and animal remains and millions of items of [[unexploded ordnance]] contaminating the land. Some towns and villages were never permitted to be rebuilt after the war.

==Main dangers==
The area is saturated with [[unexploded ordnance|unexploded shells]] (including many gas shells), [[grenades]], and rusty ammunition. Soils were heavily polluted by [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[chlorine]], [[arsenic]], various dangerous gases, acids, and human and animal remains.&lt;ref name=nogo/&gt; The area was also littered with ammunition depots and chemical plants.

Each year dozens of tons of unexploded shells are recovered. According to the Sécurité Civile agency in charge, at the current rate no fewer than 700 more years will be needed to clean the area completely. Some experiments conducted in 2005–06 discovered up to 300 shells/{{formatnum:10000}} m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the top 15&amp;nbsp;cm of soil in the worst areas.&lt;ref name=nogo/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2016}}

Some areas where 99% of all plants still die remain off limits (for example two small pieces of land close to [[Ypres]] and [[Woëvre]]), as arsenic constitutes up to 176&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of soil samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-09-01|title=Exposure assessment of a burning ground for chemical ammunition on the Great War battlefields of Verdun|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969707004986|journal=Science of the Total Environment|language=en|volume=382|issue=2-3|pages=259–271|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.04.029|issn=0048-9697}}&lt;/ref&gt;
