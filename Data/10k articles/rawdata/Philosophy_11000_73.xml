The '''African People's Convention''' is a [[South Africa|South African]] political party formed by [[Themba Godi]], former deputy leader of the [[Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania]] via [[Floor crossing (South Africa)|floor-crossing legislation]], on 4 September 2007. Godi defected along with the PAC's only two provincial representatives, [[Eastern Cape]] MPL Zingisa Mkabile and [[Gauteng]] MPL Malesela Ledwaba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-09-04-godi-leaves-pac-for-african-peoples-convention|title=Godi leaves PAC for African People's Convention|author=Jacques Keet|date=4 September 2007 |work=The M&amp;G Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godi is the current leader of the APC in parliament. The party retained its seat in the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] in the 2009 elections, although it lost both of its representatives in the provincial legislatures of Gauteng and Eastern Cape. 

It retained its seat in the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 election]].

Like the PAC, the party's ideology officially appeals to "Africanists, Pan Africanists and socialists".

[[Image:eeg alpha.svg|thumb|Alpha waves |400px|right]]
'''Alpha waves''' are [[neural oscillations]] in the frequency range of 7.5–12.5 [[Hertz|Hz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2654794 | pmid=19300566 | volume=3 | title=Mechanisms of modafinil: A review of current research | date=June 2007 | vauthors=Gerrard P, Malcolm R | journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | pages=349–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; arising from synchronous and coherent (in phase or constructive) electrical activity of [[Human thalamus|thalamic]] pacemaker cells in humans. They are also called [[Hans Berger|Berger]]'s wave after the founder of EEG.

Alpha waves are one type of [[Neural oscillations|brain waves]] detected either by [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) or [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), and can be quantified using [[quantitative electroencephalography]] (qEEG). They predominantly originate from the [[occipital lobe]] during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. Alpha waves are reduced with open eyes, drowsiness and sleep. Historically, they were thought to represent the activity of the visual cortex in an idle state.  More recent papers have argued that they inhibit areas of the cortex not in use, or alternatively that they play an active role in network coordination and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Palva S. | author2 = Palva J.M. | year = 2007 | title = New vistas for a-frequency band oscillations | url = | journal = Trends Neurosci | volume =  30| issue = | pages =  150–158| doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2007.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occipital alpha waves during periods of eyes closed are the strongest EEG brain signals.

An alpha-like variant called [[Mu rhythm|mu (μ)]] can be found over the motor cortex (central scalp) that is reduced with movement, or the intention to move. Alpha waves seem not to appear until three years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 8050866 | volume=75 | title=EEG rhythmicities evoked by visual stimuli in three-year-old children | date=April 1994 | vauthors=Kolev V, Başar-Eroglu C, Aksu F, Başar E | journal=Int. J. Neurosci. | pages=257–70 | doi=10.3109/00207459408986308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of alpha waves==
[[File:Human EEG with prominent alpha-rhythm.png|alt= The sample of human EEG with prominent alpha-rhythm in occipital sites|thumb|The sample of human EEG with prominent alpha-rhythm in occipital sites]]
Alpha waves were discovered by German [[neurologist]] [[Hans Berger]], most famous for his invention of the EEG. Alpha waves were among the first waves documented by Berger, along with [[beta wave]]s, and he displayed an interest in "alpha blockage", the process by which alpha waves decrease and beta waves increase upon a subject opening their eyes. This distinction earned the alpha wave the alternate title of "Berger's Wave".

Berger took a cue from Ukrainian physiologist [[Vladimir Pravdich-Neminsky]], who used a [[string galvanometer]] to create a photograph of the electrical activity of a dog's brain. Using similar techniques, Berger confirmed the existence of electrical activity in the human brain. He first did this by presenting a stimulus to hospital patients with skull damage and measuring the electrical activity in their brains. Later he ceased the stimulus method and began measuring the natural rhythmic electrical cycles in the brain. The first natural rhythm he documented was what would become known as the alpha wave. Berger was very thorough and meticulous in his data-gathering, but despite his brilliance, he did not feel confident enough to publish his discoveries until at least five years after he had made them. In 1929, he published his first findings on alpha waves in the journal ''Archiv für Psychiatrie''. He was originally met with derision for his EEG technique and his subsequent alpha and beta wave discoveries. His technique and findings did not gain widespread acceptance in the psychological community until 1937, when he gained the approval of the famous physiologist [[Edgar Douglas Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian|Lord Adrian]], who took a particular interest in alpha waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karbowski K | year = | title = Hans Berger (1873-194) | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology | volume = 249 | issue = 8| pages = 1130–1131 | doi = 10.1007/s00415-002-0872-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpha waves again gained recognition in the early 1960s and 1970s with the creation of a [[biofeedback]] theory relating to brain waves (see below). Such biofeedback, referred to as a kind of [[neurofeedback]], relating to alpha waves is the conscious elicitation of alpha brainwaves by a subject. Two researchers in the United States explored this concept through unrelated experiments. Joe Kamiya, of the University of Chicago, discovered that some individuals had the conscious ability to recognize when they were creating alpha waves, and could increase their alpha activity. These individuals were motivated through a reward system from Kamiya. The second progenitor of biofeedback is Barry Sterman, from the University of California, Los Angeles. He was working with monitoring brain waves in cats and found that, when the cats were trained to withhold motor movement, they released [[Mu wave|SMR, or mu, waves]], a wave similar to alpha waves. Using a reward system, he further trained these cats to enter this state more easily. Later, he was approached by the United States Air Force to test the effects of a jet fuel that was known to cause seizures in humans. Sterman tested the effects of this fuel on the previously-trained cats, and discovered that they had a higher resistance to seizures than non-trained cats.

Alpha wave biofeedback has gained interest for having some successes in humans for seizure suppression and for treatment of depression.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Kraft. Train Your Brain-Mental exercises with neurofeedback may ease symptoms of attention-deficit disorder, epilepsy and depression--and even boost cognition in healthy brains. Scientific American. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of alpha waves==

Some researchers posit that there are at least two forms of alpha waves, which may have different functions in the wake-sleep cycle.

Alpha waves are present at different stages of the wake-sleep cycle. The most widely researched is during the relaxed mental state, where the subject is at rest with eyes closed, but is not tired or asleep. This alpha activity is centered in the [[occipital lobe]], and is presumed to originate there, although there has been recent speculation that it instead has a thalamic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Domino E. F. | author2 = Ni L. S. | display-authors = etal | year = 2009 | title = Tobacco smoking produces widespread dominant brainwave alpha frequency increases | url = | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 192–198 | doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2009.08.011| pmc = 2788071}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wave begins appearing at around four months, and is initially a frequency of 4 waves per second. The mature alpha wave, at 10 waves per second, is firmly established by age 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Niedermeyer E | year = 1997 | title = Alpha rhythms as physiological and abnormal phenomena | url = | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 26 | issue = 1-3| pages = 31–49 | doi=10.1016/s0167-8760(97)00754-x | pmid=9202993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second occurrence of alpha wave activity is during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]. As opposed to the awake form of alpha activity, this form is located in a frontal-central location in the brain. The purpose of alpha activity during REM sleep has yet to be fully understood. Currently, there are arguments that alpha patterns are a normal part of REM sleep, and for the notion that it indicates a semi-arousal period. It has been suggested that this alpha activity is inversely related to REM sleep pressure.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=May 2016}}

It has long been believed that alpha waves indicate a wakeful period during sleep.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=May 2016}} This has been attributed to studies where subjects report non-refreshing sleep and have EEG records reporting high levels of alpha intrusion into sleep. This occurrence is known as alpha wave intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Task Force Allas | year = 1992 | title = ASDA report on EEG arousals: scoring rules and examples | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 173–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that these explanations may be misleading, as they only focus on alpha waves being generated from the occipital lobe.

==Alpha wave intrusion==

Alpha wave intrusion occurs when alpha waves appear with non-REM sleep when delta activity is expected.  It is hypothesized to be associated with [[fibromyalgia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Germanowicz D, Lumertz MS, Martinez D, Margarites AF |title=Sleep disordered breathing concomitant with fibromyalgia syndrome |journal=J Bras Pneumol |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=333–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17268733 |doi= 10.1590/s1806-37132006001100012|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the study may be inadequate due to a small sampling size.

Despite this, alpha wave intrusion has not been significantly linked to any major [[sleep disorder]], including fibromyalgia, [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], and [[major depression]]. However, it is common in chronic fatigued patients, and may amplify the effects of other sleep disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1994 | title = Alpha-delta sleep in patients with a chief complaint of chronic fatigue | doi = 10.1097/00007611-199404000-00008 | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 87 | issue = 4| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mistake prediction==
Following this lapse-of-attention line of thought, a recent study indicates that alpha waves may be used to predict mistakes. In it, MEGs measured increases of up to 25% in alpha brain wave activity before mistakes occurred. This study used common sense: alpha waves indicate idleness, and mistakes are often made when a person is doing something automatically, or "on auto-pilot", and not paying attention to the task they are performing. After the mistake was noticed by the subject, there was a decrease in alpha waves as the subject began paying more attention. This study hopes to promote the use of wireless EEG technology on employees in high-risk fields, such as air traffic controlling, to monitor alpha wave activity and gauge the attention level of the employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brain Wave Patterns Can Predict Blunders, New Study Finds|url=http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=9031|work=UC Davis News and Information|publisher=University of California, Davis campus|date=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alpha wave artifacts==

As demonstrated by Adrian Upton {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}, it is possible for extraneous sources (ambient fluctuations detected with a mound of [[Jell-O]] in Upton's experiments) to cause signals to appear on an EEG readout, causing false signals to be interpreted as healthy alpha waves.  This finding suggests that it is possible that a non-flat EEG could lead to the interpretation that a patient is still living when in fact he or she is long dead.

Cecil Adams from The Straight Dope discusses this scenario:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sometimes it's claimed Jell-O brainwaves are identical to a healthy adult's. That's clearly a stretch, but the Jell-O EEG readings do look pretty similar to a normal human alpha rhythm. Alpha waves are observed when a patient is awake and resting with eyes closed, and in some kinds of sleep and reversible coma. True, the Jell-O waves are a little slower and of much lower amplitude, barely within normal human limits, but that doesn't tell you much by itself. Hypoxia, encephalitis, and other medical conditions can cause reduced frequency and amplitude, as can drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2942/can-brainwaves-be-detected-in-lime-jell-o|title=Can brainwaves be detected in lime Jell-O?|author=|date=11 June 2010|website=straightdope.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apatrapya''' (Sanskrit, also ''apatrāpya''; Pali: ''ottappa''; Tibetan Wylie: ''khrel yod pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "decorum"  or "shame". It is defined as shunning unwholesome actions so as to not be reproached by others of good character.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 528-531.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the virtuous [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is apatrapya? It is to avoid what is objectionable in the eyes of others.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

The difference between [[Hri (Buddhism)|hri]] (self-respect) and ''apatrapya'' (decorum) is that ''hri'' means to refrain from unwholesome actions due to one's own conscious, while ''apatrapya'' means to refrain from unwholesome actions to avoid being reproached by others.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eric1"/&gt;

'''Boetius de Dacia''', [[Dominican Order|OP]] (also spelled '''Boethius de Dacia''') was a 13th-century [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]]. 

==Name==
The rendering of his name ''Danske Bo'' ("[[Bo (given name)|Bo]] the Dane") into Medieval Latin as ''Boetius de Dacia'' stems from the fact that the toponym ''[[Denmark|Dania]]'', meaning Denmark, was occasionally confused with ''[[Dacia (disambiguation)|Dacia]]'' during the Middle Ages.

==Life and accomplishments==
Boetius was born in the first half of the 13th century.  Not much is known of his early life. The attempt to connect him to known persons from Denmark or [[Sweden]] has been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius de Dacia, ''Verdens evighed'', Det lille forlag, 2001, p. 8 (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=July 2017}} All that is known is that he went to France to teach philosophy at the [[University of Paris]]. At the university, he associated with [[Siger of Brabant]]. He continued to teach for some time as arts masters rather than quickly moving on to study in the theology faculty or finding non-academic employment. He shared this unusual career path with Siger and others like [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. He was [[Condemnations (University of Paris)|condemned]] by [[Stephen Tempier]] in 1277 for being a leading member of the [[Averroism|Averroist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maurer|first=Armand|date=1955-01-01|title=Boetius of Dacia and the Double Truth|url=http://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.MS.2.306768|journal=Mediaeval Studies|volume=17|pages=233–239|doi=10.1484/J.MS.2.306768|issn=0076-5872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boetius fled [[Paris]] with Siger and appealed to [[Pope Nicholas III]]. He was detained at the pontifical [[curia]] at [[Orvieto]]. He went on to join the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s in Denmark.

Boetius was a follower of [[Aristotle]] and [[Averroes]]. He wrote on [[logic]], [[natural philosophy]], [[metaphysics]], and [[ethics]], though some of his works have not survived. His central position was that philosophy had to follow where the arguments led, regardless of their conflict with religious faith. For him, philosophy was the supreme human activity, and in this world only philosophers attained wisdom. In his book ''On the Highest Good, or On the Life of the Philosopher'' he offers a fervently Aristotelian description of man's [[highest good]] as the rational contemplation of truth and virtue. Among the controversial conclusions that he reached are the impossibility of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'', the [[eternity of the world]] and of the human race, and that there could be no [[resurrection of the dead]].

Despite his radical views, Boetius remained a [[Christianity|Christian]]; he attempted to reconcile his religious beliefs with his philosophical positions by assigning the investigation of the world and of [[human nature]] to philosophy, while to religion he assigned supernatural [[revelation]] and divine [[miracle]]s. He was condemned for holding the doctrine of [[Truth#Double truth|double truth]], though he was careful to avoid calling philosophical conclusions that ran contrary to religion true ''simpliciter'': in each branch of knowledge, one must be careful to qualify one's conclusions. The conclusions that the philosopher reaches are true "according to natural causes and principles" (''De Aeternitate Mundi'', p.&amp;nbsp;351).{{primary inline|date=July 2017}}

'''Brynjólfur Bjarnason''' (26 May 1898 – 16 April 1989) was an [[Iceland]]ic communist politician. He became a student at the [[University of Copenhagen]], and in 1923 he became a communist during a stay in Berlin. After returning to Iceland, he became a teacher. In 1930 he became the chairman of the [[Communist Party of Iceland]] when it was founded.&lt;ref name="lazi"&gt;Lazitch, Branko. ''Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern''. [[Stanford]]: [[The Hoover Institution Press]], 1986. p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Bjarnason attended the 2nd congress of the [[Communist International]] in 1920 and the 5th congress in 1924, as the representative of the Icelandic League of young communists. In 1935 he represented the Icelandic party at the 7th congress of the [[Communist International]]. In 1938 he became general secretary of the [[Popular Unity Party - Socialist Party]] (formed through the unification of communists and socialists).&lt;ref name="lazi"/&gt;

Bjarnason was elected to the Icelandic parliament [[Alþingi]] in 1937 and was a member until 1956. He served as Minister of Education 1944–1947.&lt;ref name="lazi"/&gt;

After his retirement from politics he wrote several books on philosophy.

[[Rhetoric]] was the most important and difficult topic studied in the Byzantine education system, beginning at the  ''[[Pandidakterion]]'' in early fifth century [[Constantinople]], where the school emphasized the study of rhetoric with eight teaching chairs, five in Greek and three in Latin.&lt;ref name=jeffreys&gt;{{cite book|title=Rhetoric in Byzantium: Papers from the Thirty-Fifth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies |first=Elizabeth |last=Jeffreys |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |pages=39–43 |isbn=0-7546-3453-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causalism is in accord with how most people have traditionally explained their actions, but critics point out that certain habitual actions such as scratching an itch are only noticed during or after the fact, if at all, making the causalist explanation that such behaviors have a mental antecedent that is not recalled seem ad hoc.

'''Charles Frederick Chandler''' (December 6, 1836 – August 25, 1925) was an [[United States|American]] [[chemist]], best known for his regulatory work in [[public health]], [[sanitation]], and [[consumer safety]] in [[New York City]], as well as his work in chemical education—first at [[Union College]] and then, for the majority of his career, at [[Columbia University]], where he taught in the Chemical Department, the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons]], and served as the first Dean of Columbia University's [[Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Mines]].

==Early life==

Charles Frederick Chandler was born in [[Lancaster, Massachusetts]] on December 6, 1836.  His family moved shortly after his birth to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], where he spent most of his formative years and engaged in his earliest formal education.  As a child he devoted nearly all of his free time to scientific and geological explorations and attending public lectures on scientific subjects.  These public lectures at the New Bedford Lyceum, and in particular a series of lectures given by the geologist and naturalist [[Louis Agassiz]], sparked his lifelong interest in science.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;"Looking Backward: A Chat with Professor Charles Frederick Chandler by 'Quip'" Medical Quip; January, 1923; Charles F. Chandler Papers; Box 6 folder 4; Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, Columbia University Library.&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly interested in mineralogy and collected rock and mineral samples that he found around his grandfather's Lancaster home.

Upon completion of his studies at New Bedford High School, Chandler spent a year in private study, learning Latin and Greek and conducting chemical experiments in a laboratory he set up in his father's attic to prepare himself for more advanced chemical study.  He then left his home in New Bedford and enrolled in the [[Lawrence Scientific School]] of [[Harvard University]].  While at Harvard he studied Industrial Chemistry, but he was encouraged to continue his studies in Industrial Chemistry and Geology in Germany, which was at the forefront of scientific education at the time.  He enrolled in the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1854 to study with [[Friedrich Wöhler]], and after studying under Wöhler and working as an assistant in the lab of [[Heinrich Rose]], the father of analytic chemistry, he earned his PhD from the University of Göttingen in 1856.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

==Academic career==

After completing his degree, Chandler returned to the United States to pursue his own scientific career.  Upon his return, in 1857, Chandler became the chemical assistant at Professor Charles Joy's laboratory at [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], and shortly thereafter began to lecture on Mineralogy and Geology at the College as well as manage the laboratory.  He became an associate professor at the College in 1857 at the age of 21.  Shortly after, he and his younger brother [[William Henry Chandler (chemist)|William]] became members of [[The Kappa Alpha Society]], of which Joy was also a member. He remained at Union College for the next 7 years during which time he ran the chemistry lab and married his first wife, Anna Craig Chandler.

His tenure at Union College ended in 1864 when Chandler was asked by his former colleague, Professor Joy, to consider taking on the Chair of Chemistry at the newly formed Columbia University School of Mines that Professor Thomas Egleston and General Vinton were attempting to start under Columbia [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard|President Barnard]].  Chandler gladly took the opportunity to move to New York, and begin his long relationship with Columbia University.

The School of Mines, later to develop into the School of Engineering and Applied Science, consisted at this time of one room in the basement of a Madison Avenue academic building.  Within the first year of the School's existence, Chandler took on the position of Dean, and under his leadership in that first year the school moved to a larger four floor building and doubled the number of students enrolled in its program of study.  Chandler was to remain dean of the School of Mines for the next 33 years, through its move to its new home on Columbia's [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside]] Campus and into [[Havemeyer Hall]], the state-of-the-art Chemistry building that he helped to design and raise funds.

During the period he was the organizer of the American Chemical Society and its president from 1881 to 1889.

Though he stepped down as the Dean of the School of Mines in 1897, he continued to teach chemistry at Columbia University until 1910, and proved to be an extremely popular and engaging instructor.  One of his former pupils provided the testimony that "He was the most popular professor at Columbia for the forty-seven years he was active.  This was due to his ability to place himself on a level and equality with his hearers, or indeed anyone he met… He was a child among children, a man of science among scientific men, but more particularly, he was a real man among his fellow men."  This sentiment is echoed in the [[Jester of Columbia|Columbia College Jester]] piece that commemorates him upon his retirement, "Year after year he has taken the entering classes by the hand and led them through a course of Chemistry, Ethics, and Humor so cleverly combined that it has made men of them.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Jester, page 120; Charles F. Chandler Papers; Box 6 folder 4; Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, Columbia University Library.&lt;/ref&gt;"

Though Chandler is perhaps most associated with the School of Mines, he also, starting in 1867, began lecturing in Chemistry for the New York College of Pharmacy.  He acted as president of this school until 1897 when it formalized its relationship to Columbia University and was incorporated as a University Faculty in 1897.  He also lectured in Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1872 where he taught chemistry and medical jurisprudence and called for a more rigorous scientific training for medical professionals.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Typescript Autobiography; Charles F. Chandler Papers, Box 6, folder 3; Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, Columbia University Library.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his instructional and administrative duties, Chandler also started a Chemical Museum, later named the Chandler Chemical Museum in his honor, to highlight the accomplishments of modern industrial and analytic chemistry.

While Chandler was a very popular instructor, he was not always so popular among his colleagues.  He spent much of his time acting as an expert witness in various legal cases and patent disputes, and performed independent consulting work for companies such as [[Standard Oil]].  Many of Chandler's colleagues had concerns that Chandler was more focused on his profitable, outside consulting work than he was on his academic and administrative duties.

Though he was not entirely without controversy, Chandler remained an integral part chemical education at Columbia University until 1911 when he finally, after 46 years of service at Columbia and 54 years of college teaching, retired from teaching.  Upon retirement he and his second wife Augusta Berard Chandler continued to reside in New York City, but spent more and more time at their summer home in [[Westhampton, New York|Westhampton]] and at her family's home in [[New Hartford, Connecticut]], where Chandler died in 1925.

==New York Metropolitan Board of Health==
[[File:ChandlerPortrait.jpg|thumb|Charles Chandler]]
While chemical instruction made up much of Charles Chandler's career, he was also an energetic public health advocate and sanitation reformer.  His career in public service began in 1866 when the Secretary of the [[Metropolitan Board of Health]] asked Chandler to perform some chemical work for the board, ex officio.  The Board soon realized the value of having a chemist as part of the organization and later that year Chandler was appointed as chemist to the Board of Health.  In 1873 [[William Frederick Havemeyer|Mayor Havemeyer]] appointed Chandler to the Presidency of the Metropolitan Board of Health, a position he held until 1883.

His work with the New York City Municipal Board of Health led to a number of important sanitary reforms in the city.  When he began his services on the Board of Health in 1866, 53 out of every 100 deaths in the city were children under the age of 5.  He implemented major reforms to improve infant nutrition, including stopping the sale of watered-down milk, and instituted a corps of traveling physicians to tend to the residents of tenements. By the time he left the Board, the child mortality rate had fallen to 46 out of every 100 deaths, an estimated saving of 8000 lives and 5000 children per annum.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; He was a strong advocate for tenement reform, designing tenement houses that were cleaner and brighter than those most prevalent in the City, and pushing a "Tenement House Act" through legislature.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;  This is all in addition to the more mundane tasks of testing household goods such as cosmetics, patent medicine, and wallpaper for toxic and potentially harmful additives.  The Board of Health, under his leadership is credited with preventing a [[cholera]] epidemic in 1883.  He, himself, thought his most important work with the Board of Health was his work in reducing fatal kerosene related accidents through informing the public about the dangers of kerosene with naphtha and gasoline added (making combustible vapors).&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; All in all, Chandler's leadership of the Board of Health marks an important chapter in the history of sanitation in New York.

==Professional activities and honors==

Chandler was very active in professional and social organizations, belonging to several Chemical Clubs and Organizations.  While some of his clubs were purely or primarily social, other such as The Chemists' Club, which Chandler founded, were intended to build professional connections among scientists in New York.  He also founded the [[American Chemical Society]], and served twice as its president, first in 1881 and again in 1889.  He was the president of both the [[Society of Chemical Industry (American Section)|American Section]] of the Society of Chemical Industry in New York, and the first American president of the parent association, the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] in London.&lt;ref name="Meeting"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Meeting of Industrial Chemists|journal=American Druggist and Pharmaceutical Record|date=1900|volume=37|pages=82–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NAAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Mary Ellen|last2=Smith|first2=John Kenly|title=American chemical enterprise : a perspective on 100 years of innovation to commemorate the centennial of the Society of Chemical Industry (American Section)|date=1994|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780941901130|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1870 he and his brother [[William Henry Chandler (chemist)|William Henry Chandler]], a chemistry professor at [[Lehigh University]], started the journal ''The American Chemist'', the first chemical journal in America. They both edited the journal until it was discontinued in 1877.&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Chandler, William Frederick|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a number of honorary degrees, the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences, and the prestigious [[Perkin Medal]] from the American Section of the Society of Chemical Industry.  After he retired from Columbia University, the alumni of that University set up an endowment for the Chandler lectureship and the Chandler Medal in his honor.

'''Communal reinforcement''' is a [[Socialization|social phenomenon]] in which a concept or idea is repeatedly asserted in a [[community]], regardless of whether sufficient [[empirical evidence]] has been presented to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=6FPqDFx40vYC |page=80 |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the concept or idea is reinforced to become a strong [[belief]] in many people's minds, and may be regarded by the members of the community as fact. Often, the concept or idea may be further reinforced by publications in the [[mass media]], [[literature|books]], or other means of communication.  The phrase "millions of people can't all be wrong" is indicative of the common tendency to accept a communally reinforced idea without question, which often aids in the widespread acceptance of [[factoids]]. A very similar term to this term is '''community-reinforcement''', which is a [[behavioral]] method to stop drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=yhWB-JOQMUgC |page=149 |title=Introduction to Addictive Behaviors }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community-reinforcement (behaviourism)==
The community-reinforcement approach (CRA) is an [[alcoholism]] [[therapy|treatment]] approach that aims to achieve abstinence by eliminating [[positive reinforcement]] for drinking and enhancing positive reinforcement for sobriety. CRA integrates several treatment components, including building the client's motivation to quit drinking, helping the client initiate sobriety, analyzing the client's drinking pattern, increasing positive reinforcement, learning new coping behaviors, and involving significant others in the recovery process. These components can be adjusted to the individual client's needs to achieve optimal treatment outcome. In addition, treatment outcome can be influenced by factors such as therapist style and initial treatment intensity. Several studies have provided evidence for CRA's effectiveness in achieving abstinence. Furthermore, CRA has been successfully integrated with a variety of other treatment approaches, such as family therapy and motivational interviewing, and has been tested in the treatment of other drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/116-121.pdf.html{{dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chris Stout (psychologist)|Chris E. Stout]]'s book ''The Psychology of Terrorism: Theoretical Understandings and Perspective'', Stout explains how community reinforcement is present in the psychotic state of [[terrorists]]. "The individual would feel less charged, validated, courageous, sanctified, and zealous, and would feel exposed as an individual." It is believed that the group mentality of a [[terrorist organization]] solidifies the mission of the group through communal reinforcement. Members are more likely to stay dedicated and follow through with the event of terror if they receive support from fellow terrorist members. An individual might abandon the mission in terror, but with the reinforcement of his peers, a member is more likely to stay involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=5BHgVzlHGYUC |page=131 |title=The Psychology of Terrorism: Theoretical Understandings and Perspectives }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered at the organisational level, CSR is an organisational policy. As such, it must align with and be integrated into a [[business model]] to be successful.  With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance with regulatory  requirements, and  engages in "actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law".&lt;ref name=CPRtheory2001&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corporate social responsibility: A theory of the firm perspective |first1=Abagail |last1=McWilliams |first2=Donald |last2=Siegel |year=2001 |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=117–127 |doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSRinternational2005&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choices of 'complying' with the law, failing to comply, and 'going beyond' are three distinct strategic organisational choices. While in many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers may choose to comply with the law, or go beyond the law, other organisations may choose to flout the law. These organisations are taking on clear legal risks.  The nature of the legal risk, however, changes when attention is paid to [[soft law]].&lt;ref&gt;Klarsfeld, A., Delpuech, C. (2008). Hard law, soft law, weak law: the implications of the neo-institutional and social regulation theories on CSR and the distinction between hard and soft law, Working Paper, Toulouse Business School&lt;/ref&gt; Soft law may incur legal liability particularly when businesses make misleading claims about their sustainability or other ethical credentials and practices.  Overall, businesses may engage in CSR for strategic or ethical purposes. From a strategic perspective, the aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions. CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas |last=Farrington |first2=Ross |last2=Curran |first3=Keith |last3=Gori |first4=Kevin D. |last4=O'Gorman |first5=C.

For example, a CEO may believe that harming the environment is ethically objectionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/patagonias-philosopher-king|title=Patagonia’s Philosopher-King|last=Paumgarten|first=Nick|date=2016-09-12|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents argue that [[corporation]]s increase long-term profits by operating with a CSR perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from businesses' economic role. A 2000 study compared existing [[econometric]] studies of the relationship between social and financial performance, concluding that the contradictory results of previous studies reporting positive, negative, and neutral financial impact, were due to flawed [[empirical analysis]] and claimed when the study is properly specified, CSR has a neutral impact on financial outcomes.&lt;ref name=CPRneutral2000&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that CSR is merely [[Display window|window-dressing]], or an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful [[multinational corporations]]. In line with this critical perspective, political and sociological [[New institutionalism|institutionalists]] became interested in CSR in the context of theories of [[globalization]], [[neoliberalism]] and [[late capitalism]]. Some institutionalists viewed CSR as a form of capitalist legitimacy and in particular point out that what began as a social movement against uninhibited [[corporate power]] was transformed by corporations into a 'business model' and a 'risk management' device, often with questionable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5893.2011.00439.x| title = Socially Responsible Private Regulation: World-Culture or World-Capitalism?| journal = Law &amp; Society Review| volume = 45| issue = 2| pages = 313–336| year = 2011| last1 = Shamir | first1 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSR is titled to aid an organization's mission as well as serve as a guide to what the company represents for its consumers. [[Business ethics]] is the part of [[applied ethics]] that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment. [[ISO 26000]] is the recognized international standard for CSR. Public sector organizations (the United Nations for example) adhere to the [[triple bottom line]] (TBL). It is widely accepted that CSR adheres to similar principles, but with no formal act of legislation.

== Definition ==

Since the 1960s,{{sfn |De George |2011}} corporate social responsibility has attracted attention from a range of businesses and stakeholders. A wide variety of definitions have been developed but with little consensus. Part of the problem with definitions has arisen because of the different interests represented. A business person may define CSR as a business strategy, an NGO activist may see it as 'greenwash' while a government official may see it as voluntary regulation."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheehy|first=Benedict|date=2015-10-01|title=Defining CSR: Problems and Solutions|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=131|issue=3|pages=625–648|doi=10.1007/s10551-014-2281-x|issn=0167-4544}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, disagreement about the definition will arise from the disciplinary approach."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For example, while an economist might consider the director's discretion necessary for CSR to be implemented a risk of agency costs, a law academic may consider that discretion to be an appropriate expression of what the law demands from directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommer|first=A.A.

Corporate social responsibility has recently been defined by Sheehy as "international private business self-regulation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sheehy examined a range of different disciplinary approaches to defining CSR. The definitions reviewed included the economic definition of "sacrificing profits," a management definition of "beyond compliance", institutionalist views of CSR as a "socio-political movement" and law's own focus on directors' duties. Further, Sheehy considered Carroll's widely used description of CSR as a pyramid of responsibilities, namely, economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Archie B.|date=July 1991|title=The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: Toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders|journal=Business Horizons|volume=34|issue=4|pages=39–48|doi=10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-g|issn=0007-6813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, while Carroll was not defining CSR but simply arguing for classification of activities, Sheehy developed a definition differently following the philosophy of science—the branch of philosophy used for defining phenomena.

Carroll 1991 extended corporate social responsibility from the traditional economic and legal responsibility to ethical and philanthropic responsibility in response to the rising concerns on ethical issues in businesses, .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Archie B. |date=1991|title=The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: toward moral management of organizational stakeholders|url=|journal=Business Horizons|volume=34 |issue=4|pages=39–48|doi=10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is reflected in the ''Business Dictionary'' which defines CSR as "A company's sense of responsibility towards the community and environment (both ecological and social) in which it operates. Companies express this citizenship (1) through their waste and pollution reduction processes, (2) by contributing educational and social programs and (3) by earning adequate returns on the employed resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/corporate-social-responsibility.html |title=Definition of CSR |accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most consumers agree that while achieving business targets, companies should engage in CSR efforts at the same time.{{sfn |Epstein-Reeves |2010}} Most consumers believe companies doing charity work will receive a positive response.{{sfn |Somerville |2013}} Somerville also found that consumers are loyal and willing to spend more on retailers that support charity. Consumers also believe that retailers selling local products will gain loyalty.{{sfn |Kardashian |2013}} Smith (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Nicola |title=Corporate social responsibility: Power to the people |url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/trends/corporate-social-responsibility-power-to-the-people/4006810.article |date=2013 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; shares the belief that marketing local products will gain consumer trust.

A more common approach to CSR is corporate [[philanthropy]]. This includes monetary donations and aid given to nonprofit organizations and communities. Donations are made in areas such as the arts, education, housing, health, social welfare and the environment, among others, but excluding political contributions and commercial event sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tilcsik |first=András |last2=Marquis |first2=Christopher |title=Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities |journal=Administrative Science Quarterly |date=1 February 2013 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=111–148 |url= https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |accessdate=19 January 2018 |doi=10.1177/0001839213475800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to CSR is to incorporate the CSR strategy directly into operations, such as procurement of [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] tea and coffee.

[[Creating shared value]] or CSV is based on the idea that corporate success and social welfare are interdependent. A business needs a healthy, educated workforce, sustainable resources and adept government to compete effectively. For society to thrive, profitable and competitive businesses must be developed and supported to create income, wealth, tax revenues and philanthropy. The Harvard Business Review article ''Strategy &amp; Society: The Link between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility'' provided examples of companies that have developed deep linkages between their business strategies and CSR.{{sfn |Porter |Kramer |2006}} CSV acknowledges trade-offs between short-term profitability and social or environmental goals, but emphasizes the opportunities for competitive advantage from building a social value proposition into corporate strategy. CSV gives the impression that only two stakeholders are important - shareholders and consumers.

Many companies employ [[benchmarking]] to assess their CSR policy, implementation and effectiveness. Benchmarking involves reviewing competitor initiatives, as well as measuring and evaluating the impact that those policies have on society and the environment, and how others perceive competitor CSR strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoessle|first= Ulrike|title= Ten Steps Toward a Sustainable Business (WWS Series 1 Seattle 2013)| isbn =978-0-9898270-0-3|url= http://www.wwsworldwide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost-benefit analysis ===

In competitive markets [[cost-benefit analysis]] of CSR initiatives can be examined using a [[resource-based view]] (RBV). According to Barney (1990), "formulation of the RBV, sustainable competitive advantage requires that resources be valuable (V), rare (R), inimitable (I) and non-substitutable (S)."&lt;ref name=BarneyRBV&gt;
{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/014920639101700108| title = Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage| journal = Journal of Management| volume = 17| pages = 99–120| year = 1991| last1 = Barney | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RBV&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/smj.4250050207| title = A resource-based view of the firm| journal = Strategic Management Journal| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 171–180| year = 1984| last1 = Wernerfelt | first1 = B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A firm introducing a CSR-based strategy might only sustain high returns on their investment if their CSR-based strategy could not be copied (I). However, should competitors imitate such a strategy, that might increase overall social benefits. Firms that choose CSR for strategic financial gain are also acting responsibly.

RBV presumes that firms are bundles of heterogeneous resources and capabilities that are imperfectly mobile across firms. This imperfect mobility can produce competitive advantages for firms that acquire immobile resources. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) examined CSR activities and attributes as a differentiation strategy. They concluded that managers can determine the appropriate level of investment in CSR by conducting cost benefit analysis in the same way that they analyze other investments. Reinhardt (1998) found that a firm engaging in a CSR-based strategy could only sustain an abnormal return if it could prevent competitors from imitating its strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siegel |first=Donald S. |year=2009 |title=Green Management Matters Only If It Yields More Green: An Economic/Strategic Perspective |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/jmswpaper/8.htm |publisher= Academy of Management Perspectives |volume= 23 |issue=3 |pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moreover, when it comes to cost benefit analysis, you should look at Waddock and Graves (1997), who showed that corporate social performance was positively linked to financial performance, meaning that the benefit of being socially responsible outweigh the costs.  McWilliams and Siegel (2000) noted that Waddock and Graves hadn’t taken innovation into account, that companies that did CSR were also very innovative, and that the innovation drove financial performance, not CSR. Hull and Rothenberg (2007) then found that when companies are not innovative, a history of CSR does in fact help financial performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hull|first=Clyde|last2=ROTHENBERG|first2=SANDRA|date=February 2008|title=Firm Performance: The Interactions of Corporate Social Performance with Innovation and Industry Differentiation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bd04/2027709bca590b8c2b68bf74be39148f64d9.pdf|journal=Strategic Management Journal|volume=Strat. Mgmt. J. , 29 : 781 – 789|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

Initially, CSR emphasized the official behaviour of individual firms. Later, it expanded to include supplier behaviour and the uses to which products were put and how they were disposed of after they lost value.

=== Supply chain ===
In the 21st century, corporate social responsibility in the supply chain has attracted attention from businesses and stakeholders. Corporations' supply chain is the process by which several organizations including suppliers, customers and logistics providers work together to provide a value package of products and services to the end user, who is the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Designing and managing the supply chain|last=Simchi-Levi;kaminsky, D.P|first=Levi;D., P|publisher=McGraw Hill/Irwin|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate social irresponsibility in the supply chain has greatly affected the reputation of companies, leading to a lot of cost to solve the problems. For instance, incidents like the [[2013 Savar building collapse]], which killed over 1000 people, pushed companies to consider the impacts of their operations on society and environment. On the other side, the horse meat scandal of 2013 in the United Kingdom affected many food retailers, including Tesco, the largest retailer in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9891296/Horsemeat-scandal-supermarkets-have-failed-to-check-meat-suppliers-MPs-told.html |title=Horsemeat scandal: supermarkets have failed to check meat suppliers, MPs told|first=Rowena|last=Mason|date=24 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the dismissal of the supplier. Corporate social irresponsibility from both the suppliers and the retailers has greatly affected the stakeholders who lost trust for the affected business entities, and despite the fact that sometimes it's not directly undertaken by the companies, they become accountable to the stakeholders. These surrounding issues have prompted [[supply chain management]] to consider the corporate social responsibility context. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggested that companies need to include social responsibility in their reviews of component quality. They highlighted the use of technology in improving visibility across the [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andreas |last=Wieland |first2=Robert B. |last2=Handfield |year=2013 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=90423931&amp;site=ehost-live |title=The Socially Responsible Supply Chain: An Imperative for Global Corporations |journal=Supply Chain Management Review |volume= 17 |issue= 5 |pages=22–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate social initiatives===
Corporate social responsibility includes six types of corporate social initiatives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Nancy|last2=Kotler|first2=Philip|title=Corporate social responsibility doing the most good for your company and your cause|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118045770}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corporate philanthropy: company donations to charity, including cash, goods, and services, sometimes via a corporate foundation
* Community volunteering: company-organized volunteer activities, sometimes while an employee receives pay for pro-bono work on behalf of a non-profit organization
* Socially-responsible business practices: ethically produced products which appeal to a customer segment
* Cause promotions: company-funded advocacy campaigns
* Cause-related marketing: donations to charity based on product sales
* Corporate social marketing: company-funded behavior-change campaigns

All six of the corporate initiatives are forms of corporate citizenship. However, only some of these CSR activities rise to the level of [[cause marketing]], defined as "a type of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in which a company's promotional campaign has the dual purpose of increasing profitability while bettering society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Organ|first1=Michael|title=Cause Marketing — Definition|url=https://causemarketing.com/research/cause-marketing-definition/|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies generally do not have a [[profit motive]] when participating in corporate philanthropy and community volunteering. On the other hand, the remaining corporate social initiatives can be examples of cause marketing, in which there is both a societal interest and profit motive.

== Implementation ==

CSR may be based within the [[human resources]], [[business development]] or [[public relations]] departments of an organisation,&lt;ref name=careers&gt;{{cite web
 |url= http://www.careers.ed.ac.uk/STUDENTS/Careers/Corporate%20Social%20Responsibility%20and%20Ethical%20Careers.html

 |publisher=University of Edinburgh Careers Service
 |accessdate= 2008-03-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may be a separate unit reporting to the [[CEO]] or the [[board of directors]].

=== Engagement plan ===

An engagement plan can assist in reaching a desired audience. A corporate social responsibility individual or team plans the [[goal]]s and [[Goal|objectives]] of the organization. As with any corporate activity, a defined budget demonstrates commitment and scales the program's relative importance.

=== Accounting, auditing and reporting ===
{{Main |Social accounting}}

[[Social accounting]] is the communication of social and environmental effects of a company's economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-02630-0_2| chapter = Corporate Responsibility, Accounting and Accountants| title = Professionals' Perspectives of Corporate Social Responsibility| pages = 11–32| year = 2009| last1 = Tilt | first1 = C. A. | isbn = 978-3-642-02629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social accounting emphasizes the notion of corporate [[accountability]]. Crowther defines social accounting as "an approach to reporting a firm's activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behavior, the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques."&lt;ref name="Crowther2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Crowther |title=Social and Environmental Accounting |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=QLYCAAAACAAJ |p=20}} |year=2000 |publisher=Financial Times/Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-273-65092-8 |p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nations such as France, legal requirements for social accounting, auditing and reporting exist, though international or national agreement on meaningful measurements of social and environmental performance has not been achieved. Many companies produce externally audited annual reports that cover [[Sustainable Development]] and CSR issues ("Triple Bottom Line Reports"), but the reports vary widely in format, style, and [[evaluation]] [[methodology]] (even within the same industry). Critics dismiss these reports as lip service, citing examples such as [[Enron]]'s yearly "Corporate Responsibility Annual Report" and tobacco companies' social reports.

In South Africa, as of June 2010, all companies listed on the [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange]] (JSE) were required to produce an [[Integrated reporting|integrated report]] in place of an annual financial report and sustainability report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pr |url= https://www.saica.co.za/tabid/695/itemid/2344/language/en-ZA/An-integrated-report-is-a-new-requirement-for-list.aspx |title=News Articles and Press &amp; media releases |publisher=South African Institute of Chartered Accountants |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An integrated report reviews environmental, social and economic performance alongside financial performance. This requirement was implemented in the absence of formal or legal standards. An Integrated Reporting Committee (IRC) was established to issue guidelines for good practice.

One of the reputable institutions that capital markets turn to for credible sustainability reports is the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]], or CDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.esg.adec-innovations.com/blog/bid/311299/the-benefit-of-corporate-social-responsibility-csr-reporting The Benefit of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Reporting]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verification ===
Corporate social responsibility and its resulting reports and efforts should be verified by the consumer of the goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verifying Delivery of Sustainable Products and Services - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool |url=https://sftool.gov/plan/541/verifying-delivery-sustainable-products-services |publisher=U.S. General Services Administration |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accounting, auditing and reporting resources provide a foundation for consumers to verify that their products are [[Social sustainability|socially sustainable]]. Due to an increased awareness of the need for CSR, many industries have their own verification resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/542/resources-verifying-sustainable-products |title=Resources for Verifying Sustainable Products  - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool |publisher=U.S. General Services Administration |access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The include organizations like the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (paper and forest products), [http://www.cocoainitiative.org/ International Cocoa Initiative], and [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberly Process]] (diamonds). The United Nations also provides frameworks not only for verification, but for reporting of human rights violations in corporate supply chains.

=== Ethics training ===

The rise of ethics training inside corporations, some of it required by government regulation, has helped CSR to spread. The aim of such training is to help employees make ethical decisions when the answers are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tullberg |first1=J. |last2=Tullberg |first2=S. |year=1996 |title=On Human Altruism: The Discrepancy between Normative and Factual Conclusions |journal=Oikos |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=327–329 |publisher= |doi= 10.2307/3546259 |jstor=3546259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most direct benefit is reducing the likelihood of "dirty hands",{{sfn |Grace |Cohen |2004}} fines and damaged reputations for breaching laws or moral norms. Organizations see increased employee loyalty and pride in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/publications/hrmagazine/editorialcontent/pages/0907agenda_training.aspx|title=Supporting Ethical Employees|last=Thilmany|first=Jean|date=2007|website=HR Magazine|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Environmental sustainability: recycling, waste management, water management, renewable energy, reusable materials, 'greener' supply chains, reducing paper use and adopting [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) building standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Richard |title=The Green Market Oracle |url=http://thegreenmarketoracle.com/2012/01/top-sustainability-trends-for.html |work=Top Business Sustainability Trends for 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-19 |date=2012-01-26 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Forest"&gt;{{cite web |title=Great Forest |url=http://www.greatforest.com/services.html |work=Services |accessdate=2013-11-19 |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001152417/http://greatforest.com/services.html |archivedate=2013-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Environmental Leader |url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/01/14/microsoft-kpmg-ey-lead-sustainability-survey/ |work=Top Sustainability Consultants Revealed |accessdate=2013-11-19 |date=2013-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006160850/http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/01/14/microsoft-kpmg-ey-lead-sustainability-survey/ |archivedate=2013-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community involvement: This can include raising money for local charities, providing volunteers, sponsoring local events, employing local workers, supporting local economic growth, engaging in fair trade practices, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Camden Community Empowerment Network |url=http://www.camdencen.org.uk/jargonbuster.htm |work=Camden Community Empowerment Network Jargon Buster |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Workforce Management |url=http://www.workforce.com/articles/starbucks-is-pleasing-employees-and-pouring-profits |work=Starbucks is Pleasing Employees and Pouring Profits |accessdate=2013-11-19 |pages=58–59 |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethical marketing]]: Companies that ethically market to consumers are placing a higher value on their customers and respecting them as people who are ends in themselves. They do not try to manipulate or falsely advertise to potential consumers. This is important for companies that want to be viewed as ethical.

=== Social license to operate ===

Social License to Operate can be determined as a contractual grounds for the legitimacy of activities and projects company is involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Demuijnck|first=Geert|last2=Fasterling|first2=Björn|date=2016-01-15|title=The Social License to Operate|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-015-2976-7|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=136|issue=4|pages=675–685|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2976-7|issn=0167-4544}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the level of support and approval of a company’s activities by its stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gehman|first=Joel|last2=Lefsrud|first2=Lianne M.|last3=Fast|first3=Stewart|date=2017-06-01|title=Social license to operate: Legitimacy by another name?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/capa.12218/epdf|journal=Canadian Public Administration|language=en|volume=60|issue=2|doi=10.1111/capa.12218/epdf|issn=1754-7121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displaying commitment to CSR is one way to achieve social license, by enhancing a company's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbr.org/downloads/pdfs/eta/PES_2013_summitpaper_Yates_Horvath.pdf|title=Social License to Operate: How to Get It, and How to Keep It|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated in ''Enduring value:'' the Australian minerals industry framework for sustainable development the concept of the 'social license to operate', then defined simply as obtaining and maintaining broad community support and acceptance. Unless a company earns and maintains that license social license holders may intend to block project developments; employees may leave the company for a company that is a better corporate citizen: and companies may be under ongoing legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.minerals.org.au/enduring-value-framework|title=Enduring Value Framework|date=2017-04-10|work=Minerals Council of Australia|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In research of [[Requisite organization|Requisite Organization]] Dr [[Elliott Jaques]] defines Social License to Operate for the company as the social contract the company has with the social license holders (employees, trade unions, communities, government)  for them to manifest positive intention to support the business short- and long-term objectives by ''“providing managerial leadership that nurtures the social good and also gives the foundation for sustainable growth in organizational results.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/478621081|title=Social power and the CEO : leadership and trust in a sustainable free enterprise system|last=Elliott|first=Jaques,|date=2002|publisher=Quorum Books|isbn=1567205518|oclc=478621081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective for the companies is to obtain and maintain the Social License to Operate. Based on the [[Requisite organization|Requisite Organization]] research of Dr. Elliott Jaques to achieve this goal a company needs to:
* Identify the business strategy and business objectives
* Identify the social license holders (employees of a company, labour unions, local and national governments, communities, activist groups, etc.) for every business objectives
* Identify the support that the company desires to achieve from the social license holders by specifying for every business objective social license elements (target of support, context of support, time of support, action of support)
* Quantitatively measure the intention (positive or negative) of the social license holders to support the business objectives
* Identify the factors that negatively impact the intention of the social license holders to support the business objectives (strength of their belief in support, their evaluation of support outcomes, pressure to provide support, enablers / disablers of support, etc.)
* Develop the Social License Development Strategy to remove the negative factors and ensure positive intention of all the social license holders to support all the business objectives of the company.
* Perform ongoing monitoring and quantitative measurement of changes in the Social License to Operate of the company   

== Potential business benefits ==

A large body of literature exhorts business to adopt non-financial measures of success (e.g., [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]]'s Fourteen Points, [[balanced scorecard]]s). While CSR benefits are hard to quantify, Orlitzky, Schmidt and Rynes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.finanzasostenibile.it/finanza/moskowitz2004.pdf |title=Corporate Social and Financial Performance: A Meta-analysis |first=Marc |last=Orlitzky |author2=Frank L. Schmidt |author3=Sara L. Rynes |journal=Organization Studies |year=2003 |format=PDF |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=403–441 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location=London |accessdate=2008-03-07 |doi=10.1177/0170840603024003910 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929182545/http://www.finanzasostenibile.it/finanza/moskowitz2004.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a correlation between social/environmental performance and financial performance.

The [[business case]] for CSR{{sfn |Bhattacharya |Sen |Korschun |2011}} within a company employs one or more of these arguments:

=== Triple bottom line ===

"People, planet and profit", also known as the triple bottom line, form one way to evaluate CSR.
"People" refers to fair labour practices, the community and region where the business operates.
"Planet" refers to sustainable environmental practices. [[Profit (economics)|Profit]] is the economic value created by the organization after deducting the cost of all inputs, including the cost of the capital (unlike accounting definitions of profit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gopal K. |last=Kanj |first2=Parvesh K. |last2=Chopra |year=2010 |title=Corporate Social Responsibility in a Global Economy |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news

 | title=Idea: Triple bottom line
 | date= 2009-11-17
 | accessdate= 2016-01-07
 | work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was claimed to help some companies be more conscious of their social and moral responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility/|title=Moral Responsibility|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics claim that it is selective and substitutes a company's perspective for that of the community. Another criticism is about the absence of a standard auditing procedure.{{sfn |De George |2011 |p=205}}

The term was coined by John Elkington in 1994.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;

=== Human resources ===

A CSR program can be an aid to [[recruitment]] and [[Employee retention|retention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhattacharya |first1=C.B. |first2=Sankar |last2=Sen |first3=Daniel |last3=Korschun |year=2008 |title=Using Corporate Social Responsibility to Win the War for Talent |publisher=MIT Sloan Management Review |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=37–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly within the competitive [[graduate school|graduate]] student market. Potential recruits often consider a firm's CSR policy. CSR can also help improve the perception of a company among its staff, particularly when staff can become involved through [[payroll giving]], [[fundraising]] activities or community volunteering. CSR has been credited with encouraging customer orientation among customer-facing employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1509/jm.11.0245| title = Corporate Social Responsibility, Customer Orientation, and the Job Performance of Frontline Employees| journal = Journal of Marketing| volume = 78| issue = 3| pages = 20–37| year = 2014| last1 = Korschun | first1 = D. | last2 = Bhattacharya | first2 = C. B. | last3 = Swain | first3 = S. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSR is known for impacting [[employee turnover]]. Several executives suggest that employees are their most valuable asset and that the ability to retain them leads to organization success. Socially responsible activities promote fairness, which in turn generate lower employee turnover. On the other hand, if an irresponsible behavior is demonstrated by a firm, employees may view this behavior as negative. Proponents argue that treating employees well with competitive pay and good benefits is seen as a socially responsible behavior and therefore reduces employee turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Galbreath (2010-06-29). "How does corporate social responsibility benefit firms? Evidence from Australia". ''European Business Review''. 22 (4): 411-431. doi:10.1108/09555341011056186. ISSN 0955-534X.&lt;/ref&gt; Executives have a strong desire for building a positive work context that benefits CSR and the company as a whole. This interest is driven particularly by the realization that a positive work environment can result in desirable outcomes such as more favorable job attitudes and increased work performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valentine | first1 = S. | last2 = Godkin | first2 = L. | last3 = Fleischman | first3 = G.

The [[Institute for Business Value|IBM Institute for Business Value]] conducted a survey of 250 business leaders worldwide in 2008. The survey found out that businesses have assimilated a much more strategic view, and that 68% companies reported are utilizing CSR as an opportunity and part of a sustainable growth strategy. The authors noted that while developing and implementing a CSR strategy represents a unique opportunity to benefit the company. However, only 31% of businesses surveyed engaged their employees on the company's CSR objectives and initiatives. The survey's authors also stated that employee engagement on CSR initiatives can be a powerful recruitment and retention tool. As a result, employees tend to discard employers with a bad reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mandrake.ca/bill/images/corporate_responsibility_white_paper.pdf |title=Corporate Social Responsibility and Employee Engagement: Making the Connection |first=Rob |last=Gross |work=www.mandrake.ca |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk management ===

Managing [[risk]] is an important executive responsibility. Reputations that take decades to build up can be ruined in hours through corruption scandals or environmental accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=A.B. |last2=Ghardwaj |first2=G. |year=2011 |title= Corporate Social Responsibility: Does Social Responsibility Help Protect a Company's Reputation? |journal=MIT Sloan Management Review |volume=52 (March) |pages=18–18 |url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/the-magazine/2011-spring/52313/does-social-responsibility-help-protect-a-companys-reputation/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These draw unwanted attention from regulators, courts, governments and media. CSR can limit these risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies use their commitment to CSR as their primary positioning tool, e.g., [[The Co-operative Group]], [[The Body Shop]] and [[American Apparel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/03/28/dr-tantillos-30second-how-to.aspx Dr. Tantillo's 30-Second 'How To': How To Brand CSR The American Apparel Way"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429132810/http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/03/28/dr-tantillos-30second-how-to.aspx |date=April 29, 2013 }} Marketing Doctor Blog. March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies use CSR methodologies as a strategic tactic to gain public support for their presence in global markets, helping them sustain a competitive advantage by using their social contributions as another form of advertising.{{sfn|Fry|Keim|Meiners|1982|p=105}}

Companies that operate strong CSR activities tend to drive customer's attention to buy products or services regardless of the price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers are aware of the company's CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not only add value to the company, but also to the products or services. Furthermore, firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm's performance. Lowering the carbon footprint of a firm's distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company's commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kemper | first1 = J. | last2 = Shilke | first2 = O. | last3 = Reimann | first3 = M. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Brettel | first5 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Competition-motivated corporate social responsibility | url = | journal = Journal of Business Research | volume = 66 | issue = 10| page = 1954 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.02.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whole Foods]]' marketing and promotion of organic foods have had a positive effect on the supermarket industry. Proponents assert that Whole Foods has been able to work with its suppliers to improve animal treatment and quality of meat offered in their stores. They also promote local agricultures in over 2,400 independent farms to maintain their line of sustainable organic produce. As a result, Whole Foods' high prices do not turn customers away from shopping. In fact, they are pleased buying organic products that come from sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, J., &amp; Vivari, B. (2009). Chapter 11: United States of America: Internal Commitments and External Pressures. In Global Practices of Corporate Social Responsibility (pp. 235-250). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, there are three theaters of practice in which CSR can be divided. Theater one focuses on philanthropy, which includes donations of money or equipment to non-profit organizations, engagement with communities' initiatives and employee volunteering. This is characterized as the "soul" of a company, expressing the social and environmental priorities of the founders. The authors assert that companies engage in CSR because they are an integral part of the society. The [[Coca-Cola Company]] contributes with $88.1 million annually to a variety of environmental educational and humanitarian organization. Another example is [[PNC Financial Services]]' "Grow Up Great" childhood education program. This program provides critical school readiness resources to underserved communities where PNC operates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rangan, Kasturi; Chase, Lisa; Karim, Sohel. [https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-truth-about-csr "The Truth About CSR"]. ''www.hbr.org''. Harvard Business Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, theater two focuses on improving operational effectiveness in the workplace. The researchers assert that programs in this theater strive to deliver social or environmental benefits to support a company's operation across the value chain by improving efficiency. Some of the examples mentioned include sustainability initiatives to reduce resource use, waste, and emission that could potentially reduce costs. It also calls for investing in employee work conditions such as health care and education which may enhance productivity and retention. Unlike philanthropic giving, which is evaluated by its social and environmental return, initiatives in the second theater are predicted to improve the corporate bottom line with social value. [[Bimbo]], the largest bakery in [[Mexico]], is an excellent example of this theater. The company strives to meet social welfare needs. It offers free educational service to help employees complete high school. Bimbo also provides supplementary medical care and financial assistance to close gaps in the government health coverage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Moreover, the third theater program aims to transform the business model. Basically, companies create new forms of business to address social or environmental challenges that will lead to financial returns in the long run. One example can be seen in [[Unilever|Unilever's]] Project Shakti in India. The authors describe that the company hires women in villages and provides them with micro-finance loans to sell soaps, oils, detergents, and other products door-to-door. This research indicates that more than 65,000 women entrepreneurs are doubling their incomes while increasing rural access and hygiene in Indian villages. Another example is [[IKEA|IKEA's]] People and Planet initiative to be 100% sustainable by 2020. As a consequence, the company wants to introduce a new model to collect and recycle old furniture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Reduced scrutiny ===
Corporations are keen to avoid interference in their business through [[taxation]] or [[regulations]]. A CSR program can persuade governments and the public that a company takes [[health and safety]], diversity and the environment seriously, reducing the likelihood that company practices will be closely monitored.

=== Supplier relations ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Appropriate CSR programs can increase the attractiveness of supplier firms to potential customer corporations. E.g., a fashion merchandiser may find value in an overseas manufacturer that uses CSR to establish a positive image—and to reduce the risks of bad publicity from uncovered misbehavior.

== Criticisms and concerns ==

CSR concerns include its relationship to the purpose of business and the motives for engaging in it.

=== Nature of business ===

[[Milton Friedman]] and others argued that a corporation's purpose is to maximize returns to its shareholders and that obeying the laws of the jurisdictions within which it operates constitutes socially responsible behavior.&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite news

While some CSR supporters claim that companies practicing CSR, especially in developing countries, are less likely to exploit workers and communities, critics claim that CSR itself imposes outside values on local communities with unpredictable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;c.f., Aquino, M.P., Nuestro Clamor por la Vida. Teología Latinoamericana desde la Perspectiva de la Mujer (San José, Costa Rica: Departamento Ecuménico de Investigaciones, 1992), et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Better governmental regulation and enforcement, rather than voluntary measures, are an alternative to CSR that moves decision-making and resource allocation from public to private bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganguly | first1 = S | year = 1999 | title = The Investor-State Dispute Mechanism (ISDM) and a Sovereign's power to protect public health | url = | journal = Columbia Journal of Transnational Law | volume = 38 | issue = | page = 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics claim that effective CSR must be voluntary as mandatory social responsibility programs regulated by the government interferes with people's own plans and preferences, distorts the allocation of resources, and increases the likelihood of irresponsible decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motives ===

Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies to distract the public from ethical questions posed by their core operations. They argue that the reputational benefits that CSR companies receive (cited above as a benefit to the corporation) demonstrate the hypocrisy of the approach.&lt;ref name="McKibben"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some studies find that CSR programs are motivated by corporate managers' personal interests at the cost of the shareholders so they are a type of an [[Principal–agent problem|agency problem]] in corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Ing-Haw|last2=Hong|first2=Harrison|last3=Shue|first3=Kelly|title=Do Managers Do Good with Other People's Money? |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 19432 |doi=10.3386/w19432|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Binay K.|date=2016-12-01|title=Causal effect of analyst following on corporate social responsibility |journal=Journal of Corporate Finance|volume=41|pages=201–216|doi=10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, it has been argued that there is a "halo effect" in terms of CSR spending. Research has found that firms which had been convicted of bribery in the USA under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) received more lenient fines if they had been seen to be actively engaging in comprehensive CSR practices. It was found that typically either a 20% increase in corporate giving or a commitment to eradicating a significant labour issue, such as child labour, was equated to a 40% lower fine in the case of bribing foreign officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21656218-do-gooding-policies-help-firms-when-they-get-prosecuted-halo-effect|title=The halo effect|journal=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-29|date=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguinis and Glavas conducted a comprehensive review of CSR literature, covering 700 academic sources from numerous fields including [[Organizational behavior|organizational behaviour]], [[strategic management|corporate strategy]], [[marketing]] and [[human resource management|HRM]]. It was found that the primary reason for firms to engage in CSR were the expected financial benefits associated with CSR, rather than being motivated a desire to be responsible to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aguinis|first=Herman|last2=Glavas|first2=Ante|date=2012-07-01|title=What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda|journal=Journal of Management|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=932–968|doi=10.1177/0149206311436079|issn=0149-2063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical ideologies ===
CEOs' political ideologies are evident manifestations of their different personal views. Each CEO may exercise different powers according to their organizational outcomes. In fact, their political ideologies are expected to influence their preferences for the CSR outcomes. Proponents argue that politically liberal CEOs will envision the practice of CSR as beneficial and desirable to increase a firm's reputation. They tend to focus more on how the firm can meet the needs of the society. As a consequence, they will advance with the practice of CSR while adding value to the firm. On the other hand, property rights may be more relevant to conservative CEOs. Since conservatives tend to value free markets, individualism and call for a respect of authority, they will not likely envision this practice as often as those identifying as liberals might.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Chin, M.K.; Treviño, Linda; Hambrick, Donald (2013). "Political Ideologies of CEOs: The Influence of Executives' Values on Corporate Social Responsibility" (PDF). ''SAGE Journals''. Johnson Cornell University. 58 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The financials of the company and the practice of CSR also have a positive relationship. Moreover, the performance of a company tends to influence conservatives more likely than liberals. While not seeing it from the financial performance point of view, liberals tend to hold a view that CSR adds to the business triple bottom line. For instance, when the company is performing well, they will most likely promote CSR. If the company is not performing as expected, they will rather tend to emphasize this practice because they will potentially envision it as a way to add value to the business. In contrast, politically conservative CEOs will tend to support the practice of CSR if they hold a view that it will provide a good return to the financials of the company. In other words, this type of executives tend to not see the outcome of CSR as a value to the company if it does not provide anything in exchange.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Misdirection ===
There have been unsubstantiated social efforts, ethical claims, and outright [[greenwashing]] by some companies that has resulted in increasing consumer cynicism and mistrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahdi |first1=Khosro S. |last2=Acikdilli |first2=Gaye |title=Marketing Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Marriage of Convenience or Shotgun Wedding? |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=August 2009 |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=103–113 |doi=10.1007/s10551-009-0113-1 |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0113-1?LI=true |issn=0167-4544 |language=en |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes companies use CSR to direct public attention away from other, harmful business practices. For example, [[McDonald's Corporation]] positioned its association with [[Ronald McDonald House]] and other children's charities as CSR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Responsibility - U.S. Perspective |url= http://mcdonalds.com/usa/good/report.RowPar.0002.ContentPar.0002.ColumnPar.0001.File.tmp/2006%20U.S.%20CR%20Brochure%20(English).pdf |publisher=McDonald's USA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230235955/http://mcdonalds.com/usa/good/report.RowPar.0002.ContentPar.0002.ColumnPar.0001.File.tmp/2006%20U.S.%20CR%20Brochure%20(English).pdf |dead-url=yes |archivedate=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its meals have been accused of promoting poor eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment p264&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts which may initially appear to be altruistic CSR may have ulterior motives. The funding of scientific research projects has been used as a source of misdirection by firms. [[Stanley B. Prusiner|Prusiner]], who discovered the protein responsible of [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|CJD]] and won of the 1997 Nobel prize in Medicine, thanks the tobacco company [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|RJ Reynolds]] for their crucial support. RJ Reynolds funded the research into CJD. [[Robert N. Proctor|Proctor]] states that "the tobacco industry was the leading funder of research into genetics, viruses, immunology, air pollution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tim |last=Harford |date=2017-03-09 |url= https://www.ft.com/content/eef2e2f8-0383-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9 |title=The problem with facts |website=Financial Times |access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; anything which formed a distraction from the well-established research linking smoking and cancer.

Research has also found that corporate [[social marketing]], a form of CSR promoting societal good, is being used to direct criticism away from the damaging practices of the alcohol industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones |first=Sandra C. |last2=Wyatt |first2=Austin |last3=Daube |first3=Mike |date=2016-12-01 |title=Smokescreens and Beer Goggles: How Alcohol Industry CSM Protects the Industry |url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1524500415621558 |journal=Social Marketing Quarterly |language=en |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=264–279 |doi=10.1177/1524500415621558 |issn=1524-5004 |access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that adverts which supposedly encourage responsible drinking simultaneously aim to promote drinking as a [[Social norms approach|social norm]]. Companies may engage in CSR and social marketing in this case to prevent more stringent government legislation on alcohol marketing.

=== Controversial industries ===

Industries such as tobacco, alcohol or munitions firms make products that damage their consumers or the environment. Such firms may engage in the same philanthropic activities as those in other industries. This duality complicates assessments of such firms with respect to CSR.{{sfn |Halpern |Snider |2012 |pages=604–624}}

===The Kizhakkambalam takeover===
[[Textile company]] Kitex has taken over the administration of an entire Indian village called [[Kizhakkambalam]] near Cochin by winning the local body elections. Environmentalists and mainstream politicians of India point out that this can lead to a dangerous precedent because the company got actively involved in CSR only after they were caught red-handed in [[pollution|polluting]] the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ittyipe |first=Minu |title=A Corp’s New Clothes |url= https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/a-corps-new-clothes/295855 |publisher=Outlook |date=25 November 2015 |location=India |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stakeholder influence ==

One motivation for corporations to adopt CSR is to satisfy stakeholders.

Branco and Rodrigues (2007) describe the stakeholder perspective of CSR as the set of views of corporate responsibility held by all groups or constituents with a relationship to the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Branco |first=M.C. |author2=Rodrigues, L.L. |title=Positioning stakeholder theory within the debate on corporate social responsibility |journal=Electronic Journal of Business Ethics and Organization Studies |year=2007 |volume=12 |pages=5–15 |url=http://ejbo.jyu.fi/pdf/ejbo_vol12_no1_pages_5-15.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their normative model the company accepts these views as long as they do not hinder the organization. The stakeholder perspective fails to acknowledge the complexity of network interactions that can occur in cross-sector partnerships. It relegates communication to a maintenance function, similar to the exchange perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shumate |first=M |author2=O'Conner, A. |title=The symbiotic sustainability model: Conceptualizing NGO-corporate alliance communication |journal=Journal of Communication |year=2010 |volume=60 |pages=577–609 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01498.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical consumerism ===

The rise in popularity of [[ethical consumerism]] over the last two decades can be linked to the rise of CSR.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus |last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental and social implications of their day-to-day consumption decisions and in some cases make purchasing decisions related to their environmental and ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=A.B. |last2=Rubera |first2=G. |last3=Seifert |first3=M. |last4=Bhardwaj |first4=G. |year=2011 |title=Doing Good and Doing Better Despite Negative Information? The Role of Corporate Social Responsibility in Consumer Resistance to Negative Information |journal=Journal of Service Research |volume=14 (February) |pages=60–75 |url=http://jsr.sagepub.com/content/14/1/60.abstract |doi=10.1177/1094670510389164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue with the consumer's relationship with CSR is that it is much more complex than it first appears. In their paper on the consumer and CSR, Janssen and Vanhamme looked into a phenomenon that they termed the "CSR-Consumer Paradox".&lt;sup&gt;[[Corporate social responsibility#cite note-104|[104]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This describes the mismatch that occurs where consumers report that they would only buy from companies with good social responsibility. A survey by Cohn &amp; Wolfe found that globally over 60% of consumers want to buy from responsible companies.&lt;sup&gt;[[Corporate social responsibility#cite note-105|[105]]]&lt;/sup&gt; However, Janssen and Vanhamme reported that less than 4% of average household expenditure in the UK in 2010 was ethical. This indicates that there is a clear discrepancy between consumer beliefs and intentions, and actual consumer behaviour, so that when it comes down to their actual purchase behaviour, CSR has a much lesser impact than consumers initially say it does.

One theory put forward for explaining the "CSR-Consumer Paradox" is that of "bystander apathy" or the [[bystander effect]]. This theory stems from the social psychology works of Darley and Latané&lt;sup&gt;[[Corporate social responsibility#cite note-106|[106]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and states that the likelihood of an individual acting in a given situation is greatly reduced if other bystanders do nothing even if that individual strongly believes in a certain course of action. In terms of explaining the CSR-Consumer Paradox, this theory would suggest an "If they do not care then why should I?" mentality. So even if a consumer is against the use of sweatshops or wants to support green causes, they may continue to make purchases from companies that are socially irresponsible just because other consumers seem apathetic towards the issue.

A second explanation issued by Janssen and Vanhamme is that of [[reciprocal altruism]]. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something if they can get something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.

=== Socially responsible investing ===
{{main|Socially responsible investing}}

Shareholders and investors, through [[socially responsible investing]], are using their capital to encourage behavior they consider responsible. However, definitions of what constitutes ethical behavior vary. For example, some religious investors in the US have withdrawn investment from companies that violate their religious views, while secular investors divest from companies that they see as imposing religious views on workers or customers.&lt;ref name="responsibility945"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Laughlin |first=Bridget |title=Governing Capital? Corporate Social Responsibility and the Limits of Regulation |journal=Development and Change |date=November 2008 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=945–957 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.2008.00522.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public policies ===

Some national governments promote socially and environmentally responsible corporate practices. The heightened role of government in CSR has facilitated the development of numerous CSR programs and policies.&lt;ref name="Public Policies on Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of Governments in Europe"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10551-007-9514-1| jstor = 25075478| title = Public Policies on Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of Governments in Europe| journal = Journal of Business Ethics| volume = 74| issue = 4| pages = 391–407| year = 2007| last1 = Albareda| first1 = Laura| last2 = Lozano| first2 = Josep M.| last3 = Ysa| first3 = Tamyko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various European governments have pushed companies to develop sustainable corporate practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; CSR critics such as [[Robert Reich]] argued that governments should set the agenda for social responsibility with laws and regulation that describe how to conduct business responsibly.

==== Regulation ====

Fifteen [[European Union]] countries are actively engaged in CSR regulation and public policy development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/corporate-social-responsibility-national-public-policies-european-union-compendium-2014|title=Corporate Social Responsibility National Public Policies in the European Union - Compendium 2014 - Digital Single Market - European Commission|website=Digital Single Market|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSR efforts and policies are different among countries, responding to the complexity and diversity of governmental, corporate and societal roles. Some studies have claimed that the role and effectiveness of these actors were case-specific.&lt;ref name="Public Policies on Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of Governments in Europe"/&gt; This variety among company approaches to CSR can complicate regulatory processes.{{sfn |Sacconi |2004}}

Canada adopted CSR in 2007. [[Prime Minister Harper]] encouraged Canadian mining companies to meet Canada's newly developed CSR standards.&lt;ref name="Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada"&gt;{{cite web |last=Government |first=Canada |title=Corporate Social Responsibility Building the Canadian Advantage: A Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Strategy for the Canadian International Extractive Sector |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/topics-domaines/other-autre/csr-strat-rse.aspx?view=d |work=Government Policy |publisher=Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada |accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Heilbronn Declaration' is a voluntary agreement of enterprises and institutions in Germany especially of the Heilbronn-Franconia region signed the 15th of September 2012. The approach of the 'Heilbronn Declaration' targets the decisive factors of success or failure, the achievements of the implementation and best practices regarding CSR. A form of responsible entrepreneurship shall be initiated to meet the requirements of stakeholders' trust in economy. It is an approach to make voluntary commitments more binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stehr|first1=Christopher|last2=Jakob|first2=Benjamin E.|title=Corporate Social Responsibility th rough Voluntary Commitment in Small and Medium Sized Enterprises – the Case of the 'Heilbronn Declaration'|journal=European Journal of Sustainable Development|date=September 2014|volume=3|issue=4|pages=135–150|doi=10.14207/ejsd.2014.v3n4p135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to mandated CSR regulation, Researchers Armstrong &amp; Green suggest that all regulation is "harmful", citing regulation as the cause for North Korea's low economic freedom and per capita GDP. They further claim without source that "There is no form of market failure, however egregious, which is not eventually made worse by the political interventions intended to fix it," and conclude "there is no need for further research on regulation in the name of social responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J.

==== Laws ====

In the 1800s, the US government could take away a firm's license if it acted irresponsibly. Corporations were viewed as "creatures of the state" under the law. In 1819, the [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[Dartmouth College vs. Woodward]] established a corporation as a legal person in specific contexts. This ruling allowed corporations to be protected under the Constitution and prevented states from regulating firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banerjee |journal= Critical Sociology |year=2008 |pages=51–75 |doi=10.1177/0896920507084623 |title=Corporate Social Responsibility: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly |volume=34 |issue=1 |first=S. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently countries included CSR policies in government agendas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 16 December 2008, the Danish parliament adopted a bill making it mandatory for the 1100 largest Danish companies, investors and state-owned companies to include CSR information in their financial reports. The reporting requirements became effective on 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrgov.dk/sw51190.asp Danish Centre for CSR's official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703215633/http://www.csrgov.dk/sw51190.asp |date=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The required information included:
* CSR/SRI policies
* How such policies are implemented in practice
* Results and management expectations

CSR/SRI is voluntary in Denmark, but if a company has no policy on this it must state its positioning on CSR in financial reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrgov.dk/home/0/2|title=Home - CSRgov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, item S50K of the Income Tax Act of Mauritius mandated that companies registered in Mauritius paid 2% of their annual book profit to contribute to the social and environmental development of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/Ramtohul/corporate-social-responsibility-in-mauritius|title=Corporate Social Responsibility in Mauritius|author=Yoganand Ramtohul|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Evolution of corporate social responsibility in India|India]] also enacted a mandatory minimum CSR spending law. Under [[Companies Act, 2013]], any company having a net worth of 500 [[crore]] or more or a turnover of 1,000 crore or a net profit of 5 crore must spend 2% of their net profits on CSR activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Implications of Companies Act, 2013 Corporate Social Responsibility |url=http://gtw3.grantthornton.in/assets/Companies_Act-CSR.pdf |publisher=Grant Thornton India LLP |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules came into effect from 1 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Flag Off of CSR Rules: India Inc.'s To-Do List for Compliance to Section-135 |url=http://forbesindia.com/blog/the-good-company/the-flag-off-of-csr-rules-india-inc-s-to-do-list-for-compliance-to-section-135/ |accessdate=7 March 2014 |newspaper=Forbes |date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only mandatory CSR law in the world thus far was passed by the Indian parliament in 2013 as Article 135 of the Companies Law.  According to that bill, all firms with net worth above $75 million, turnover over $150 million, or net profit over $750,000 are required to spend at least 2% of their annual profits (averaged over three years). The law requires that all businesses affected establish a CSR committee to oversee the spending. Prior to this law’s passage, CSR laws applied to public sector companies only.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gatewayhouse.in/a-brief-history-of-indian-csr//&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crises and their consequences ===

Crises have encouraged the adoption of CSR. The [[Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies|CERES]] principles were adopted following the 1989 ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' incident.{{sfn |Grace |Cohen |2004}} Other examples include the [[lead paint]] used by toy maker [[Mattel]], which required the recall of millions of toys and caused the company to initiate new risk management and quality control processes. [[Magellan Metals]] was found responsible for lead contamination killing thousands of birds in Australia. The company ceased business immediately and had to work with independent regulatory bodies to execute a cleanup. [[Odwalla]] experienced a crisis with sales dropping 90% and its stock price dropping 34% due to cases of [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]. The company recalled all apple or [[carrot]] juice products and introduced a new process called "flash pasteurization" as well as maintaining lines of communication constantly open with customers.

== Geography ==

Corporations that employ CSR behaviors do not always behave consistently in all parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Alan |author2=Gail Whiteman |title=Exploring the Geography of Corporate Philanthropic Disaster Response: A Study of Fortune Global 500 Firms |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=February 2009 |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=589–603 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/198172266 |accessdate=11 February 2013 |doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9710-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a single behavior may not be considered ethical in all jurisdictions. E.g., some jurisdictions forbid women from driving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/26/world/meast/saudi-arabia-women-drivers|title=Saudi Arabia women defy authorities over female driving ban|author=Mohammed Jamjoom and Laura Smith-Spark, CNN|date=26 October 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others require women to be treated equally in employment decisions.

=== UK retail sector ===

A 2006 study{{sfn |Oppewal |2006}} found that the UK retail sector showed the greatest rate of CSR involvement. Many of the big retail companies in the UK joined the [[Ethical Trading Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethicaltrade.org/ |title=Ethical trading Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; an association established to improve working conditions and worker health.

[[Tesco]] (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tescoplc.com/ |accessdate=24 February 2014 |title=Tesco CSR report}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that their 'essentials' are 'Trading responsibility', 'Reducing our Impact on the Environment', 'Being a Great Employer' and 'Supporting Local Communities'. [[J Sainsbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/sol/index.jsp |title=Sainsbury CSR Report |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; employs the headings 'Best for food and health', 'Sourcing with integrity', 'Respect for our environment', 'Making a difference to our community', and 'A great place to work', etc.
The four main issues to which UK retail these companies committed are environment, social welfare, ethical trading and becoming an attractive workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=P. |author2=Wynn, M., Comfort, D. and Hillier, D. |title=Corporate Social Responsibility and UK Retailers |journal=Issues in Social &amp; Environmental Accounting |year=2007 |volume=1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whooley |first=Niamh |title=The corporate responsibility report |year=2003 |volume=1 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martinuzzi et al. described the terms, writing that human responsibility is "the company deals with suppliers who adhere to principles of natural and good breeding and farming of animals, and also maintains fair and positive working conditions and work-place environments for their own employees. Product responsibility means that all products come with a full and complete list of content, that country of origin is stated, that the company will uphold its declarations of intent and assume liability for its products.

'''Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration''' ('''DDR'''), or '''disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation, reintegration and resettlement''' ('''DDRRR''') are applied strategies for executing successful [[peacekeeping]] operations, and is generally the strategy employed by all [[UN Peacekeeping Operations]] following civil wars. '''Disarmament''' entails the physical removal of the means of combat from ex-belligerents (weapons, ammunition, etc.); '''demobilization''' entails the disbanding of armed groups; while '''reintegration''' describes the process of reintegrating former combatants into civilian society, ensuring against the possibility of a resurgence of armed conflict.

== Factors for successful DDR ==

DDR is somewhat different from the blanket term "peacekeeping", in that DDR requires certain conditions to be effectively implemented. For demobilisation and reintegration to occur, there must first be a successful disarmament of armed groups. In general terms, parties to a conflict must be willing to negotiate a peace settlement and bring an end to the conflict. If there is no end in sight, or not all parties are willing to negotiate a peace, this will make it difficult to establish trust between each party. Disarmament measures must also be applied to all parties of a conflict. One case that highlights both these elements is that of [[Somalia]]. The [[UN]] and [[US]] began disarming selected armed groups but not all, and there was no peace agreement agreed or on-going. Those groups who had been disarmed were then targeted by groups who had not been disarmed, and the violence continued.

As mentioned above, trust is also a key factor of successful DDR, specifically in relation to disarming armed groups. Small scale acts may help engender trust on both sides, such as public appearances of group leaders together with international mediators. To strengthen trust, public bonfires of weapons taken from all parties to violence will show the disarming groups that the other groups are also handing over their weapons.

==Challenges of DDR==

One challenge or difficulty, as highlighted above, is that of forming trust between the different armed groups. If no peace agreement has already been reached but armed groups wish to start the DDR process, then the underlying issues that led to the violence in the first instance must be addressed. DDR cannot be approached as a purely technocratic exercise, and to not address the grievances of each group may seriously undermine or negatively influence the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/05679329608449368?instName=King%2527s+College+London|journal = The Adelphi Papers|pages = 5–8|volume = 36|issue = 303|doi = 10.1080/05679329608449368|first = Mats R.|last = Berdal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further challenges appear when we consider reintegration of ex-combatants. Unlike other aspects of peace agreements such as strengthening democratic institutions, introducing fair elections and governmental structures, the reintegration of ex-combatants back into civilian society may be difficult to accurately monitor. This in part is due to its social nature: how do you measure how ex-combatants have integrated with society? How can you measure the societal cohesion that DDR aims to promote throughout the affected region?

[[Civil war]] often involves high degrees of [[communal violence]], and this poses a particular challenge for fighters who may have joined armed groups that committed violent acts in the ex-combatants communities. Even if the individual ex-combatant in question did not commit violent acts against their own community, they may still face difficulties being accepted back if associated with a group that did. This may lead to disjointed familial ties, communal tensions, or ex-fighters choosing not to return home altogether. As such, it may be possible to successfully reintegrate fighters back into civilian society, but reintegrating them back into their own communities may be a much harder task.

==Requirements for successful DDR implementation==

There are 6 aspects to a successful DDR conversion:

# Reduction of military expenditure
# Reorientation of military research and development
# Conversion of the [[arms industry]]
# [[Demobilization]] and reintegration
# Redevelopment of troops
# Safe disposal and management of "surplus weapons"

Demobilization is one aspect of conversion.

==Conclusion==

To assess the impact of demobilization one has to consider the resources involved, the dynamic processes of production, redistribution and the different factors and actors in policy making and implementation. The ultimate objective of demobilization and reintegration efforts should be to improve the welfare of people. Demobilization of combatants frees human potential that can contribute to achieving these objectives.

'''Eidetic reduction''' is a technique in the study of [[essence]]s in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] whose goal is to identify the basic components of phenomena. Eidetic reduction requires that a phenomenologist examine the essence of a mental object, be it a simple mental act, or the unity of consciousness itself, with the intention of drawing out the absolutely necessary and invariable components that make the mental object what it is.  This reduction is done with the intention of removing what is perceived, and leaving only what is required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/cas/sociology/ast/upload/Outline_e.pdf Gert H. Mueller. ''Analytical Sociology: An Outline'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
One can take for example [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s [[Wax argument|piece of wax]] (not as a mental object, but as a demonstration of the concept of reduction). It appears to be opaque, flat, hard, extended to certain dimensions in space. It has a certain feel, smell, taste. Most of these qualities can be negated as necessary to the piece of wax continuing to be a piece of wax; the smell, taste, texture, opacity. If heated, it will continue to be the same piece of wax, the same molecules. However, the taste may change, the smell may become more noticeable, the texture will obviously change, it will become clear if heated to the point of melting, etc. The only things that remain (its extension into space, chemical makeup, and mass) are the things that are required for the existence of that piece of wax. 

Eidetic reduction is a form of [[imaginative variation]] by which one attempts to reduce a phenomenon into its necessary essences. This is done by theoretically changing different elements (while mentally observing whether or not the phenomenon changes) of a practical object to learn which characteristics are necessary for it to be it without being something else. If a characteristic is changed, and the object remains unchanged, the characteristic is unnecessary to the essence of the object, and vice versa.

The basic steps of an eidetic reduction are threefold: first, choose some specific example (e.g., Descartes' wax). Then, vary the example imaginatively. The third step involves figuring out that which cannot be eliminated while the example remains itself. That which cannot be eliminated is part of the example's essence.

As an instructive process, eidetic reduction might be viewed as processes of abstraction; the works of [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' could give one a taste of those processes, or even the simple contemplation of mathematics itself in use: "How many ideas have you?" and the respondent may claim, "Just two."

'''Emmanuel George Cefai''' (born 1955) is a Maltese [[Doctor of Law]], [[poet]] and [[philosopher]]. His poems are published {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. In the philosophical field he is acknowledged within professional circles as ‘promising’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophysharing.org&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly due to the fact that, as yet, he has published very little of his intellectual production.

==Poetry==

Cefai’s poetry is mainly composed in English. His poems are regularly published in reputable sites and frequently acclaimed by connoisseurs {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. In August 2011 he published an [[ebook]] with a collection of forty selected poems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poemhunter.com/ebooks/redir.asp?ebook=50777&amp;filename=emmanuel_george_cefai_2011_8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His creative production, mostly unpublished, includes lyric and epic poetry, drama, and short stories{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

==Philosophy==

Cefai began publishing writings about his philosophical interests in 1978 {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Nevertheless, the greater part of his extensive philosophical works are, as yet, still unpublished, mainly due to editorial reasons {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. He has posted a few draft productions on his own website.&lt;ref&gt;emmanuelgeorgecefai.weebly.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Cefai published ''The Spirit of Metaphysics: A philosophical monograph on a logical theory of the universe'', of which he presented his conclusions to the [[Philosophy Sharing Foundation]] in April 2015.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FttjSZql9UY]

The '''entrenched player's dilemma''' is a concept featured in ''[[Wikinomics]].'' It is the choice faced by existing businesses in a changing marketplace. To embrace new ideas fully, they must abandon their current revenue streams.

Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams explain the concept:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The problem with mature companies is that the very commercial success of their products increases their dependency on them. Making radical changes in the product's capabilities, underlying architecture or associated business models could cannibalize sales or lead to costly realignments of strategy and business infrastructure. It's as though popular and widely adopted products become ossified, hardened by the inherent incentives to build on their own success. The result is that entrenched industry players are generally not motivated to develop or deploy disruptive technologies."&lt;ref&gt;Tapscott, Don ''[[Wikinomics]]'' (New York 2006) 174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''evolution of biological complexity''' is one important outcome of the process of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Werner |first1=Andreas |last2=Piatek |first2=Monica J. |last3=Mattick |first3=John S. |title=Transpositional shuffling and quality control in male germ cells to enhance evolution of complex organisms |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=April 2015 |volume=1341 |issue=1 |pages=156–163 |doi=10.1111/nyas.12608 |pmid=25557795 |pmc=4390386|bibcode=2015NYASA1341..156W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution has produced some remarkably complex organisms - although the actual level of complexity is very hard to define or measure accurately in biology, with properties such as gene content, the number of [[cell type]]s or [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] all proposed as possible metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adami, C. |title=What is complexity? |journal=BioEssays |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1085–94 |year=2002 |pmid=12447974 |doi=10.1002/bies.10192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waldrop, M. |title=Language: Disputed definitions |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1023–1028 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/4551023a |pmid=18948925 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/11720591/Randomness_increases_order_in_biological_evolution |title=Computation, Physics and Beyond |last=Longo |first=Giuseppe |last2=Montévil |first2=Maël |date=2012-01-01 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |year= |isbn=9783642276538 |editor-last=Dinneen |editor-first=Michael J. |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |location= |pages=289–308 |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-27654-5_22 |quote= |editor-last2=Khoussainov |editor-first2=Bakhadyr |editor-last3=Nies |editor-first3=André |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many biologists used to believe that [[Orthogenesis|evolution was progressive (orthogenesis)]] and had a direction that led towards so-called "higher organisms," despite a lack of evidence for this viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McShea, D. |title=Complexity and evolution: What everybody knows |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=303–324 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00132234}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of "progression" and "higher organisms" in evolution is now regarded as misleading, with [[natural selection]] having no intrinsic direction and organisms selected for either increased or decreased complexity in response to local environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Ayala"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayala, F. J. |title=Darwin's greatest discovery: design without designer |journal=PNAS |volume=104 |issue= Suppl 1|pages=8567–73 |year=2007 |pmid=17494753 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/104/suppl_1/8567 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701072104 |pmc=1876431|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.8567A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been an increase in the maximum level of complexity over the [[history of life]], there has always been a large majority of small and simple organisms and the [[mode (statistics)|most common]] level of complexity appears to have remained relatively constant.

==Selection for simplicity and complexity==

Usually organisms that have a higher rate of reproduction than their competitors have an evolutionary advantage. Consequently, organisms can evolve to become simpler and thus multiply faster and produce more offspring, as they require fewer resources to reproduce. A good example are parasites such as Plasmodium - the parasite responsible for [[malaria]] - and [[mycoplasma]]; these organisms often dispense with traits that are made unnecessary through parasitism on a host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sirand-Pugnet, P.; Lartigue, C.; Marenda, M. |title=Being Pathogenic, Plastic, and Sexual while Living with a Nearly Minimal Bacterial Genome |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e75 |year=2007 |pmid=17511520 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030075 |pmc=1868952 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lineage can also dispense with complexity when a particular complex trait merely provides no selective advantage in a particular environment. Loss of this trait need not necessarily confer a selective advantage, but may be lost due to the accumulation of mutations if its loss does not confer an immediate selective disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maughan, H.; Masel, J.; Birky, W. C.; Nicholson, W. L. |title=The roles of mutation accumulation and selection in loss of sporulation in experimental populations of Bacillus subtilis |doi=10.1534/genetics.107.075663 |journal=Genetics |volume=177 |pages=937–948 |year=2007 |pmid=17720926 |pmc=2034656 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[parasitic organisms|parasitic organism]] may dispense with the synthetic pathway of a metabolite where it can readily scavenge that metabolite from its host. Discarding this synthesis may not necessarily allow the parasite to conserve significant energy or resources and grow faster, but the loss may be fixed in the population through mutation accumulation if no disadvantage is incurred by loss of that pathway. Mutations causing loss of a complex trait occur more often than mutations causing gain of a complex trait.

With selection, evolution can also produce more complex organisms. Complexity often arises in the co-evolution of hosts and pathogens,&lt;ref name="arms_race"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dawkins, Richard  |author1link=Richard Dawkins |author2=Krebs, J. R. |title=Arms Races between and within Species |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=205 |issue=1161 |pages=489–511 |year=1979 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081 |pmid=42057 |bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt; with each side developing ever more sophisticated adaptations, such as the [[immune system]] and the many techniques pathogens have developed to evade it. For example, the parasite ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'', which causes [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], has evolved so many copies of its major surface [[antigen]] that about 10% of its genome is devoted to different versions of this one gene. This tremendous complexity allows the parasite to constantly change its surface and thus evade the immune system through [[antigenic variation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pays, E. |title=Regulation of antigen gene expression in Trypanosoma brucei |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=517–20 |year=2005 |pmid=16126458 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2005.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the growth of complexity may be driven by the [[co-evolution]] between an organism and the [[ecosystem]] of [[predator]]s, [[prey]] and [[parasite]]s to which it tries to stay adapted: as any of these become more complex in order to cope better with the diversity of threats offered by the ecosystem formed by the others, the others too will have to adapt by becoming more complex, thus triggering an ongoing [[evolutionary arms race]]&lt;ref name="arms_race"/&gt; towards more complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Heylighen|Heylighen, F.]] (1999a) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BQWrppy8ooIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22Heylighen%22+%22The+growth+of+structural+and+functional+complexity+...%22+&amp;ots=p2cUiyexLo&amp;sig=T6Dk_PTHRocBj8Lou81w_mHtJZA "The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution]", in F. Heylighen, J. Bollen &amp; A. Riegler (eds.) The Evolution of Complexity Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, 17-44.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend may be reinforced by the fact that ecosystems themselves tend to become more complex over time, as [[species diversity]] increases, together with the linkages or dependencies between species.

==Types of trends in complexity==
[[File:Evolution of complexity.svg|thumb|left|200px|Passive versus active trends in complexity. Organisms at the beginning are red. Numbers are shown by height with time moving up in a series.]]

If evolution possessed an active trend toward complexity ([[orthogenesis]]), as was widely believed in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pages=526–529 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; then we would expect to see an active trend&lt;!--right hand column in figure--&gt; of increase over time in the most common value [[mode (statistics)|(the mode)]] of complexity among organisms.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carroll SB |title=Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6823 |pages=1102–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11234024 |doi=10.1038/35059227|bibcode=2001Natur.409.1102C }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, an increase in complexity can also be explained through a passive process.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; Assuming unbiased random changes of complexity and the existence of a minimum complexity leads to an increase over time of the average complexity of the biosphere.This involves an increase in [[variance]], but the mode does not change. The trend towards the creation of some organisms with higher complexity over time exists, but it involves increasingly small percentages of living things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In this hypothesis, any appearance of evolution acting with an intrinsic direction towards increasingly complex organisms is a result of people concentrating on the small number of large, complex organisms that inhabit the [[Skewness|right-hand tail]] of the complexity distribution and ignoring simpler and much more common organisms. This passive model predicts that the majority of species are [[microorganism|microscopic]] [[prokaryote]]s, which is supported by estimates of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; extant prokaryotes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oren, A. |title=Prokaryote diversity and taxonomy: current status and future challenges |journal=Philos.

==Constructive neutral evolution==

Recently work in evolution theory has proposed that by relaxing [[selection pressure]], which typically acts to streamline [[genome]]s, the complexity of an organism increases by a process called constructive neutral evolution.&lt;ref name="Stoltzfus1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Arlin |title=On the Possibility of Constructive Neutral Evolution |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=49 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=169–181 |doi=10.1007/PL00006540|issn=0022-2844|bibcode=1999JMolE..49..169S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[effective population size]] in eukaryotes (especially multi-cellular organisms) is much smaller than in prokaryotes,&lt;ref name="SungAckerman2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=W. |last2=Ackerman |first2=M. S. |last3=Miller |first3=S. F. |last4=Doak |first4=T. G. |last5=Lynch |first5=M. |title=Drift-barrier hypothesis and mutation-rate evolution |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=109 |issue=45 |year=2012 |pages=18488–18492 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1216223109|pmc=3494944 |bibcode=2012PNAS..10918488S |pmid=23077252}}&lt;/ref&gt; they experience [[nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution|lower selection constraints]].

According to this model, new genes are created by non-[[adaptation (biology)|adaptive]] processes, such as by random [[gene duplication]]. These novel entities, although not required for viability, do give the organism excess capacity that can facilitate the mutational decay of functional subunits. If this decay results in a situation where all of the genes are now required, the organism has been trapped in a new state where the number of genes has increased. This process has been sometimes described as a complexifying ratchet.&lt;ref name="LukešArchibald2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukeš |first1=Julius |last2=Archibald |first2=John M. |last3=Keeling |first3=Patrick J. |last4=Doolittle |first4=W.

In other instances constructive neutral evolution does not promote the creation of new parts, but rather promotes novel interactions between existing players, which then take on new moonlighting roles.&lt;ref name="LukešArchibald2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukeš |first1=Julius |last2=Archibald |first2=John M. |last3=Keeling |first3=Patrick J. |last4=Doolittle |first4=W.

Constructive neutral evolution has also been used to explain how ancient complexes, such as the spliceosome and the ribosome, have gained new subunits over time, how new alternative spliced isoforms of genes arise, how [[Ciliate#DNA_rearrangements_(gene_scrambling)|gene scrambling]] in [[ciliates]] evolved, and how pervasive pan-[[RNA editing]] may have arisen in ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]''.&lt;ref name="Stoltzfus1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GrayLukes2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=M.

==History==
{{further|Orthogenesis}}

In the 19th century, some scientists such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829) and [[Ray Lankester]] (1847–1929) believed that nature had an innate striving to become more complex with evolution. This belief may reflect then-current ideas of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) and of [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903) which envisaged the universe gradually evolving to a higher, more perfect state.

This view regarded the evolution of parasites from independent organisms to a parasitic species as "[[Devolution (biology)|devolution]]" or "degeneration", and contrary to nature. Social theorists have sometimes interpreted this approach metaphorically to decry certain categories of people as "degenerate parasites". Later scientists regarded biological devolution as nonsense; rather, lineages become simpler or more complicated according to whatever forms had a selective advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dougherty, Michael J. | title=Is the human race evolving or devolving? | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-human-race-evolvin/ | journal=Scientific American |date=July 1998 | quote=From a biological perspective, there is no such thing as devolution. All changes in the gene frequencies of populations--and quite often in the traits those genes influence--are by definition evolutionary changes. [...] When species do evolve, it is not out of need but rather because their populations contain organisms with variants of traits that offer a reproductive advantage in a changing environment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''feminist method''' is a means of conducting of scientific investigations and generating theory from an explicitly [[feminism|feminist]] standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reinharz |first=Shulamit |last2=Davidman |first2=Lynn |date=April 30, 1992 |title=Feminist Methods in Social Research |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=241 |isbn=978-0-19-507386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist methodologies are varied, but tend to have a few common aims or characteristics, including seeking to overcome biases in research, bringing about social change, displaying human diversity, and acknowledging the position of the researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reinharz |first=Shulamit |last2=Davidman |first2=Lynn |date=April 30, 1992 |title=Feminist Methods in Social Research |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=249-269 |isbn=978-0-19-507386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questioning normal scientific reasoning is another form of the feminist method..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reinharz |first=Shulamit |last2=Davidman |first2=Lynn |date=April 30, 1992 |title=Feminist Methods in Social Research |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=247 |isbn=978-0-19-507386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these methods must consist of different parts including: collection of evidence, testing of theories, presentation of data, and room for rebuttals.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} How research is scientifically backed up affects the results. Like consciousness raising, some feminist methods affect the collective emotions of women, when things like political statistics are more of a structural result When knowledge is either constructed by experiences, or discovered, it needs to both be reliable and valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird|first=Sharon|title=Feminist Methods of Research|journal=Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong feminist supporters of this are [[Nancy Hartsock]], [[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]], and finally [[Sandra Harding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Code |first=Lorriane |title=Feminist Epistomology |url=http://www.rep.routlage.com/article/P020SECT3 |publisher=Routlage Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=19 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503020145/http://www.rep.routlage.com/article/P020SECT3 |archivedate=3 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist sociologists have made important contributions to this debate as they began to criticize positivism as a philosophical framework and, more specifically, its most acute methodological instrument—that of quantitative methods for its practice of detached and objective scientific research and the objectification of research subjects (Graham 1983b; Reinharz 1979). These methodological critiques were well placed against a backdrop of feminist scholarship struggling to find a place for alternative values within the academy. Such concerns emerged from a sense of despair and anger that knowledge, both academic and popular, was based on men’s lives, male ways of thinking, and directed toward the problems articulated by men. Dorothy Smith (1974) argued that “sociology . . . has been based on and built up within the male social universe”

==Objectivity and the construction of the Other==
Feminist methods have, in large part, been scaffolded as a rebuttal to existing research methods that operate under imperialist, racist, and patriarchal assumptions about the research subject. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Linda |date=May 10, 2012 |title=Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples |location=London |publisher=Zed Books |page=1 |isbn=978-1-84813-950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By pointing out the biased perspectives and assumptions of researchers, feminist scholars work to elucidate the ways in which the idea of objectivity has operated merely as a stand-in for the white, male perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reinharz |first=Shulamit |last2=Davidman |first2=Lynn |date=April 30, 1992 |title=Feminist Methods in Social Research |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=261 |isbn=978-0-19-507386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how feminist methods, in contrast, work to produce knowledge in which “the researcher appears to us not as an invisible, anonymous voice of authority, but as a real, historical individual with concrete, specific desires and interests.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=Sarah |date=January 22, 1988 |title=Feminism and Methodology: Social Science Issues |location=Bloomington, Ind. |publisher=Indiana University Press |page=9 |isbn=978-0-253-20444-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also inherent in the traditional researcher-subject relationship is the subject-object relationship, for the researcher becomes the autonomous subject when they study other humans as objects, as in this case the “subject” is ironically objectified through the process of scientific investigation, which does not take into account their agency or the will of their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reinharz |first=Shulamit |last2=Davidman |first2=Lynn |date=April 30, 1992 |title=Feminist Methods in Social Research |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=263 |isbn=978-0-19-507386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects are also simultaneously “Othered” by Western researchers who exotify their ways of life through “a Western discourse about the Other which is supported by ‘institutions, vocabulary, scholarship, imagery, doctrines, even colonial bureaucracies and colonial styles.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Linda |date=May 10, 2012 |title=Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples |location=London |publisher=Zed Books |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84813-950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinharz therefore posits that the destruction of the Other and the remodeling of the traditional subject-object relationship must occur simultaneously through explicit engagement with three different actors in feminist research: the researcher, the reader, and the people being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reinharz |first=Shulamit |last2=Davidman |first2=Lynn |date=April 30, 1992 |title=Feminist Methods in Social Research |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=258-268 |isbn=978-0-19-507386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, productive, feminist methods attempt to “demystify” and “decolonize” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Linda |date=May 10, 2012 |title=Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples |location=London |publisher=Zed Books |page=17 |isbn=978-1-84813-950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; research through recognizing how traditional methods construct the Other and are cloaked in a false objectivity, and subsequently to deconstruct these narratives in order to “talk more creatively about research with particular groups and communities – women, the economically oppressed, ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Linda |date=May 10, 2012 |title=Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples |location=London |publisher=Zed Books |page=10 |isbn=978-1-84813-950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questioning gender as a scientific construct==
Through questioning science [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] came up with alternatives to the concept of having only two sexes, male and female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=The Five Sexes|journal=The Sciences|date=Mar–Apr 1993|volume=33|issue=2|pages=20–26|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.1993.tb03081.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that through biological development there is a possibility of having five sexes instead of two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=The Five Sexes|journal=The Sciences|date=Mar–Apr 1993|volume=33|issue=2|pages=20–26|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.1993.tb03081.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes there are male, female, merm (male [[Pseudohermaphroditism|pseudohermaphrodites]], i.e. when testicular tissue is present), ferm (female [[Pseudohermaphroditism|pseudohermaphrodites]], i.e. when ovarian tissue is present), and herm ([[True hermaphroditism|true hermaphrodites]], i.e. when both testicular and ovarian tissue is present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=The Five Sexes|journal=The Sciences|date=Mar–Apr 1993|volume=33|issue=2|pages=20–26|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.1993.tb03081.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==
[[Alison Jaggar]] disputes the dichotomy between reason and emotion and argues that rationality needs emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaggar|first1=Allison|title=Love and knowledge: Emotion in feminist epistemology|journal=Inquiry|date=1989|doi=10.1080/00201748908602185|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00201748908602185|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states emotions are normally associated with women and rationality is associated with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaggar|first1=Allison|title=Love and knowledge: Emotion in feminist epistemology|journal=Inquiry|date=1989|doi=10.1080/00201748908602185|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00201748908602185|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also claims that there are many theories as to the origins of emotions, and in the long run listening to emotions might lead to better decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaggar|first1=Allison|title=Love and knowledge: Emotion in feminist epistemology|journal=Inquiry|date=1989|doi=10.1080/00201748908602185|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00201748908602185|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Four Upbuilding Discourses''''' (1844) is the last of the ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' published during the years 1843–1844 by [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. He published three more discourses on "crucial situations in life" (''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'') in 1845, the situations being confession, marriage, and death. These three areas of life require a "decision made in time".&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling, Hong p. 15ff&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The book is about making decisions. Søren Kierkegaard had to make some decision. He had to decide if he wanted to get married after having already made the "sacred pledge". He had to decide if he would carry out the wishes of his father, Michael, and become a Lutheran preacher or teacher. He made "negative" resolutions regarding these promises he had made. Perhaps some thought he should remain true to his word.

This word "resolution" is the core of Kierkegaard's idea behind the [[leap of faith]]. His question is: Who can make a positive or negative resolution for another? A resolution is best made by the single individual in the quietness of his or her soul through the inward struggle rather than the struggle with external forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Either/O''r p. 108ff ''Stages on Life’s Way'', Hong p. 108-112, 363-365, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', To Need God Is A Human Being’s Highest Perfection p. 297-326, ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Life'', 1845 Swenson translation 11&lt;/ref&gt;

This discourse has to do with a psychological view regarding the process of decision making and making of vows for "existing" single individuals and has nothing to do with the crowd or with "noisy voting".&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 620-621&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:The Journals of Soren Kierkegaard 1905 German Edition.JPG|thumb|left|125opx|Buch des Richters: Seine Tagebücher 1833-1855 (1905) (The Journals of Søren Kierkegaard)]]Søren Kierkegaard was born on May 5, 1813 and died on November 11, 1855. He kept a [[Søren Kierkegaard#Journals|journal]] and he mentions a "Diary" in ''Either/Or'' and another in "Stages on Life's Way" with dates listed here and there. His preface to "Either/Or" says the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Diary has a date here and there, but the year is always omitted. This might seem to preclude further inquiry, but by studying the individual dates, I believe I have found a clue. Of course every year has a seventh of April, a third of July, a second of August and so forth; but it is not true that the seventh of April falls every year on Monday. I therefore have made certain calculations and have found that this combination fits the year 1834." ''Either/Or, Part I'', Preface, p. 10 Swenson&lt;/blockquote&gt; Later, in ''Stages on Life's Way'' he wrote a "Morning" entry in the diary on May 4 about birth and on May 5 at "Midnight" an entry on [[Periander]]. Then on "June 18 at Midnight" he wrote about guilt. His mother Ane Kierkegaard was born on June 18. Then on July 7 at midnight he wrote about Regine.&lt;ref&gt;''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong p.322ff, 380-382, 396-397&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[genealogy]] of his family on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.com/people/Michael-Kierkegaard/4976513953430126612 geni.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He used dates in his discourses also.

[[File:Mikael Pedersen Kierkegaard b.jpg|thumb|100px|Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard]] [[File:Ane Sørensdatter Lund.jpg|thumb|100px|Ane Sørensdatter Lund Kierkegaard]]The ''Four Upbuilding Discourses'' begin with a Preface, Kierkegaard had just published a book called ''[[Prefaces]]'' on Jun 17, 1844 and now he's publishing these discourses on August 31, 1844. He had published a preface for his ''[[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843|Two Upbuilding Discourses]]'' and dated it May 5, 1843, his birthday, for which he gives God thanks for another year in which he can have "his spirit tested". He later dated the Preface to his ''Lilies of the Field and The Birds of the Air'' May 5, 1849.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Discourses'', Lowrie translation, 1961 p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; Is he placing markers to show the slow but steady process of his own conversion to Christianity?

The preface for this, his last discourses published in this two-year period, was dated August 9, 1844, the date of or after the death of his father, Mikael Pedersen Kierkegaard, (August 9, 1838). It could be possible that these ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' was his way of getting over the loss of his father and his mother, Ane Sørensdatter Lund Kierkegaard, and brothers and sisters too. Soren lost all of his brothers and sisters (Nicholene, Niels, Petrea, Soren Michael, Marin Kristine), as well as his mother and father by August 9, 1838. Only his brother Peter Christian was left. Soren died November 11, 1855 and Peter on February 24, 1888). Perhaps it was his way of [[grieving]]. But it's not grieving in a spectacular way. It's grieving as indirectly as possible. And doing it in a thoroughly Christian way by honoring his father and mother even though they were both dead. He wrote about death in his 1845 book ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life'', which was translated by David F. Swenson in 1941 and also translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong as ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' in 1993. He wrote: {{Quotation|A pagan has said that death is nothing to be feared, for “when it is, I am not, and when I am, it is not.” This is the jest through which the subtle observer places himself outside. (...) There is a longing after the eternal when death has taken and taken again, and has taken the last of the distinguished men you knew; there is a feverish heat in sickness of soul, or its cold burning, when anyone becomes so familiar with death and with the loss of his nearest and dearest, that life for him becomes a vexation of spirit. It is sheer sorrow when the deceased was yours; it is the birth-pangs of an immortal hope when it was your beloved; it is the trembling breaking forth of earnestness when it was your only counsellor, and solitude lays hold of you; but if it were your child or your beloved, or your only guide in life, it is still a mood; and even if you would gladly die instead of them, this, too, is a mood. The earnestness consists in the fact that it is death that you think, and then that you think it as your own lot, and then that you do what death cannot do, so that you are and death also is. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life'', Swenson 78-81}}

He kept to his familiar formula while writing his preface by dedicating his discourse to his father, who was a clothing merchant living in [[Copenhagen]] and writing to ''my reader'', not my readers, because his books were for each single individual to read if she or he wanted to read it. His preface said, in part, &lt;blockquote&gt;"although this little book (which is called “[[discourse]]s,” not [[sermon]]s, because its author does not have authority to ''preach'', “upbuilding” discourses, not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a ''teacher'') is once again going out into the world, it is even less fearful of drawing any impeding attention to itself than it was the first time it started on the journey; it hopes rather that because of the repetition the passersby will scarcely notice it, or if at all only to let it shift for itself.  It seeks that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call ''my reader'', in order to pay him a visit, indeed, to stay with him, because one goes to the person one loves, makes one’s home with him, and remains with him if this is allowed." Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 295 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The discourses are titled,
*''To Need God Is a Human Being's Highest Perfection''
*''The Thorn in the Flesh''
*''Against Cowardliness''
*''One Who Prays Aright Struggles in Prayer and Is Victorious—in That God Is Victorious''

===To Need God Is a Human Being's Highest Perfection===
Kierkegaard "felt inclined to doubt a little the correctness of the familiar philosophic maxim that the external is the internal and the internal the external and was always [[heretic]]ally-minded on this point in philosophy." The external would be [[experience]] and the internal revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or, Part I'', Swenson Preface, Fear and Trembling, Hong p. 27-28; The argument between A (the esthete) and B (the ethicist) in [[Either/Or]] resulted in the revelation that both of them was wrong (the discourse at the end). Moses in [[Fear and Trembling]] argued with God for three days in a completely internal way. The Young Man in [[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]] argued externally with everyone and used Job as a guide for arguing with God. But Job didn't argue with everyone, everyone argued with him while he kept quiet and listened and then argued with God. ([[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]) And Mary, the mother of Jesus, repeated everything the angel of the Lord said to her, but internally, to herself, rather than externally to everyone else.(''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'' Volume I, 259-260)&lt;/ref&gt;  This developed into the discussions about the primacy of [[Revelation]] or of [[Reason]] in religious matters.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Irony'', (1841) Hong translation p. 333ff notes on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling#Berlin period|Schelling]]'s ''Philosophy of Revelation''&lt;/ref&gt; At this time a new [[Media (communication)|medium]] for knowledge was coming of age, [[History of newspapers and magazines#Newspapers|newspapers]]. Kierkegaard wrote about them on November 28, 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/I_B.html Journals of Soren Kierkegaard IB 2''Our Journalistic Literature'']  ''A Study from Nature in Noonday Light.'' Talk given to the Student Association&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers came to be regarded as another form of knowledge. But is this knowledge given by the newspapers an external or an internal form of knowledge or of revelation? Kierkegaard wondered about that.

[[File:El Greco - The Penitent Magdalene - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Mary as a hermit, by [[El Greco]]]]He many times referred to "the one thing needful" throughout his writings.&lt;ref&gt;I have indicated a few places he discussed this one thing in the second part of ''Either/Or'': "What you lack, altogether lack, is faith. Instead of saving your soul by entrusting everything to God. when I declare that God is incomprehensible, my soul raises itself up to the highest  ''Either/Or'', Part II Hong p. 14-16;  A religiously developed person makes a practice of referring everything to God, of permeating and saturating every finite relation with the thought of God, and thereby consecrating and ennobling it. ''Either/Or II'', p. 43; Like every human life, every marriage is simultaneously this particular and nevertheless the whole, simultaneously individual and symbol. Consequently, it gives the lovers the most beautiful picture of two human beings who are not disturbed by reflection about others; it says to the two individuals: you also are a couple just like them [Adam and Eve]; the same event is being repeated here in you, and you also are standing here alone in the infinite world, alone in the presence of God. ''Either/Or, Part II'', p. 90; His self is, so to speak, outside him, and it has to be acquired, and repentance is his love for it, because he chooses it absolutely from the hand of God. ''Either/Or, Part II'', p. 217; It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam. ''Either/Or, Part II'', p. 237-238; The mystic has chosen himself absolutely, and consequently according to his freedom, and consequently is ''eo ipso'' acting, but his action is internal action. The mystic chooses himself in his perfect isolation; for him the whole world is dead and exterminated, and the wearied soul chooses God or himself. This expression, “the wearied soul,” must not be misunderstood. Must not be misused to the disparagement of the mystic, as if it were a dubious matter that the soul did not choose God until it was weary of the world. By this expression, the mystic undoubtedly means his repentance over not having chosen God before, and his weariness must not be regarded as identical with boredom with life. Already here you will perceive how little the mystic’s life is ethically structured, since the supreme expression of repentance is to repent that he did not choose God earlier, before he became concrete in the world, while his soul was only abstractly defined, consequently as a child." ''Either/Or, Part II'', p. 241-245, "The ignorant person can gradually acquire wisdom and knowledge, but the self-deceived person, if he won the one thing needful, would have won purity of heart." ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993 p. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Now he says "to need God is a human being's highest perfection." This is direct communication instead of the indirect method he chose for most of his [[pseudonymous]] writings. He has discussed the goods of the world in comparison to the goods of the spirit which indicates the same external and internal relationship. This fragment of the Bible, "one thing needful", is found in the story of [[Martha|Martha of Bethany]] and [[Mary Magdalene]] from the ''[[New Testament]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10&amp;version=rsv Luke chapter 10]  and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11&amp;version=rsv John chapter 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Mary knew she was a sinner&lt;ref&gt;Mark 16:9; Luke 8:2,3&lt;/ref&gt; and thanked Christ for saving her from her sins, while Martha was busy serving Him. Martha said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.”  But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion, which shall not be taken away from her.”&lt;ref&gt;Luke 10:38-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, wrote similarly about Martha and Mary in his 1955 book, The New Being: &lt;blockquote&gt;"What, then, is the one thing that we need? What is the right thing that Mary has chosen? Like our story, I hesitate to answer, for almost any answer will be misunderstood. If the answer is "religion," this will be misunderstood as meaning a set of beliefs and activities. But, as other New Testament stories show, Martha was at least as religious as Mary. Religion can be a human concern on the same level as the others, creating the same anxiety as the others. Every page of the history and psychology of religion demonstrates this. There are even special people who are supposed to cultivate this particular human concern. They are called by a highly blasphemous name: religionists—a word that reveals more about the decay of religion in our time than does anything else. If religion is the special concern of special people and not the ultimate concern of everybody, it is nonsense or blasphemy. So we ask again, what is the one thing we need? And again it is difficult to answer. If we answer "God," this will also be misunderstood. Even God can be made a finite concern, an object among other objects; in whose existence some people believe and some do not. Such a God, of course, cannot be our ultimate concern. Or we make Him a person like other persons with whom it is useful to have a relationship. Such a person may support our finite concerns, but He certainly cannot be our ultimate concern. The one thing needed—this is the first and in some sense the last answer I can give—is to be concerned ultimately, unconditionally, infinitely. This is what Mary was. It is this that Martha felt and what made her angry, and it is what Jesus praises in Mary. Beyond this, not much has been said or could be said about Mary, and it is less than what has been said about Martha. But Mary was infinitely concerned. This is the one thing needed." (See link in secondary sources for the chapter in Tillich's book)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mary represents the one who is related to Christ in an internal way and Martha the external. Speculation might say that Mary is [[William Blake]] or [[Johann Goethe]] and Martha is [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] or [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;''Blake, Kierkegaard, and the Spectre of the Dialectic'', Lorraine Clark, [[Trent University]] 1991, Cambridge University Press p. 1ff&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard uses these single individuals to help him "teach his age what it is 'to become a Christian'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediaofr07hast#page/696/mode/2up ''Encyclopaedia of religion and ethics'' Vol 7 (1908)] p. 696ff&lt;/ref&gt; Can a single individual be seduced by the religious in such a way that he or she becomes in danger of developing into extreme examples of the internal (mystic) and the external (Don Quixote)?&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or, Part II'', Hong p. 241-245, ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong p. 402ff&lt;/ref&gt;
What, then, was the one thing ' that he willed? As he makes clear in ''Om min Forfatter- Virksomhed'' (''My Literary Activity'' 1851, p.&amp;nbsp;35ff), it was religion; or, more definitely, his one aim was to teach his age what it is ' to become a Christian' or at least "compel the age to take notice." He discussed this further in his 1848 unpublished book, ''The Point of View For my Work as an Author'', where he discusses a ''[[factum]]'' that made him into a poet and his esthetic production moved him forward to a different place. He wrote: {{Quotation|in this thing of becoming a poet I did not recognize myself in a deeper sense, but rather in the religious awakening.  Here the reader can easily perceive the explanation of all the difficulty of the authorship, but he must not &lt;sup&gt;['think'?]&lt;/sup&gt; that the author was at the same time conscious of this. What was to be done?  Well, obviously the poetical had to be evacuated,&lt;sup&gt;['evaluated'?]&lt;/sup&gt; anything else was impossible for me. But the whole esthetic production was put under arrest by the religious. The religious agreed to this elimination but incessantly spurred it on, as though it were saying, Are you not now through with that? While the poetical works were being produced the author was living under strict religious rules. ''The Point of View For my Work as an Author'' 84-85, Lowrie translation 1962 Harper and Row}}

Kierkegaard goes on to tell "the secret of perfection: that to need God is nothing to be ashamed of but is perfection itself."&lt;ref&gt;Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 302-303&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to say that is we become perfect when we learn that we are not perfect. Once that happens the individual struggles with himself rather than with the world. He uses [[Moses]] as an example of an individual who knew he was capable of nothing at all but he was confronted by the crowd that demanded a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 310-312&lt;/ref&gt; He sums up this battle for the [[self]] this way: {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;When man turns about, so as to confront himself in order to acquire an understanding of himself, it is as if he blocked the way for that first self of which we have been speaking. He interferes with its movement outwards, with its yearning for the surrounding world which is its object, and with its pursuit of it; he calls the first self away from external things. For the purpose of inducing the first self to acquiesce in this recall, the deeper self makes the surrounding world reveal itself as it really is, namely as uncertain and precarious. It is indeed the truth that the world about us is unstable, every moment admitting of a change to its very opposite. The man has never lived who by the exercise of his power or by the magic of his wish could hold this variableness within the bonds of restraint. The deeper self thus proceeds to picture the outer world, with its elusiveness and its mutability, in such terms that it no longer seems desirable to the first self. Either the first self must contrive to slay the deeper self, to plunge it into oblivion, when all is lost; or it must admit that the deeper self is right. For to assert stability of that which constantly changes is a contradiction. As soon as it is admitted that it is of the nature of the outer world to change, it follows that it may change at any moment. ''Edifying Discourses'' (1843-1844), Swenson translation Vol IV 1958 p. 159&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The greatest difficulty seems to be just to get the task firmly set or actually to get set firmly on what the task is. Perhaps people are really not unwilling to spend time and energy and are not incompetent either-if only it could become unmistakably clear to them what the task is. But the point is that this communication cannot in any decisive way come to them from the outside; it has to go through the person who is himself involved. The adult is indeed of age; he is to be his own master. But it is the lord and master who is to assign the task, just as parents and superiors do it for the child. Thus the adult is simultaneously master and servant; the one who is to command and the one who is to obey are one and the same. This is unquestioningly a difficult situation, that the one giving the command and the one obeying the command are the same. It can so easily happen that the servant meddles in the deliberation about the task, and conversely, that the master pays too much attention to the servant’s complaints about the difficulties in carrying out the task. Then, alas, confusion develops; then instead of becoming one’s own master a person becomes unstable, irresolute, vacillating; he runs from one thing to another, tears down and builds up and begins again from the beginning. He is tossed about by every breeze, but without moving from the spot. Finally the situation becomes so awkward that all his energy is expended in thinking up ever new changes in the task-just as a plant goes to seed, so he goes to seed in busy trifling deliberation or in fruitless wishing. In a certain sense he uses much time, much diligence, and much energy, and it is all as good as wasted, because the task does not remain fixed, because there is no master, since he, of course, should be his own master. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong p. 294-295&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

[[File:Giuliano amidei, pie donne al sepolcro.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Either, Martha and Mary at the tomb, Or?]]The outer world is constantly in a state of flux but if a single individual wants to be able to function in such a world he or she must be able to allow the change but stay constant in the inner being through a strengthening process. Kierkegaard believed the world of the spirit is opposed to the world of change because God never changes. And God strengthens in the inner being before asking for external action. Then "when the first self submits to the deeper self, they are [[Reconciliation (theology)|reconciled]] and walk on together."&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; (''Edifying Discourses'', p.&amp;nbsp;253ff)

===The Thorn in the Flesh===
Kierkegaard discusses other Biblical phrases that have been turned into [[Speculative reason|speculative]] enterprises for [[scholars]] as well as [[lay minister]]s. Here he discusses "the thorn in the flesh" and "caught up in the third heaven."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2012&amp;version=RSV ''2 Corinthians 12'',] ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 327ff, 334ff, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 454-455&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apostle Paul]] had experience and an assured spirit yet he had this thorn in the side and the order not to discuss being caught up in the third heaven. This unsettled Paul, since he wanted to know all things, and had conflict in his [[soul]]. Kierkegaard writes elegantly about Paul's search for peace. {{Quotation|
[[File:Ravissement de saint Paul - Poussin - J&amp;MRinglingMuseumofArt.jpg|thumb|left|100px|''Ecstasy of Saint Paul'' [[Nicolas Poussin]] 1643]] A person is looking for peace, but there is change: day and night, summer and winter, life and death; a person is looking for peace, but there is a change: fortune and misfortune, joy and sorrow; a person is looking for peace and constancy, but there is a change: the ardor of purpose and the disgust of weakness, the greenwood of expectation and the withered splendor of fulfillment; a person is looking for peace-where did he look for it-even in the disquietude of distraction-where did he look for it in vain-even in the grave! But an apostle-he uses the strongest expression about a thorn in the flesh, about an angel of Satan who strikes him on the mouth and thereby prevents him from declaring that inexpressible blessedness. So it is so, then, that the more zealously one presses forward, the more dangerous everything becomes? No, the apostle does not speak like an incited man who is merely a desperate witness to how he himself has been tumbled about and at best knows how to describe his ups and downs. That he is not permitted to remain in the third heaven, indeed, that it is an angel of Satan who fetches him down again and strikes him on the mouth-this he knows. He knows that in a certain sense the joining of earthly life with [[beatitude]] is always an unhappy marriage and that the truly beatific union is concluded only in heaven, just as it was concluded there in the beginning; but he also knows that it is beneficial to him, and that this thorn in the flesh is given him so that he will not be arrogant. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 328&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' Vol I, 1846, Hong translation p. 220-221&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Those who interpret the Bible can do harm to the single individual who is reading the interpretation because of the way that individual is constituted. Paul learned he would not be able to know everything and said it was beneficial for him that this is the way it is. Kierkegaard says, "he had experienced the beatitude of heaven and had kept the pledge of the spirit, but there was nevertheless a memory. And a memory is difficult to manage. At one time it is far away, and then, presto, it is right there as if it had never been forgotten. Paul had memories of stoning [[Stephen]] and persecuting Christians and wandered about in "the fog of unintelligibility."&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 336ff&lt;/ref&gt;

His intent was exemplified in his 1846 book, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'': {{Quotation|The issue is raised objectively; the solid, sensible subject thinks this way: “Just let there be clarity and certainty about the truth of Christianity and I will surely be man enough to accept it; that will follow as a matter of course. “The trouble, however, is that in its paradoxical from the truth of Christianity has something in common with the nettle: the solid, sensible subject only stings himself when he wants to grasp it summarily this way, or rather (since it is a spiritual relationship, the stinging can be understood only in a figurative sense) he does not grasp it at all; he grasps its objective truth so objectively that he himself remains outside. 
Soren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' V. I 46-47 Hong}}

Kierkegaard challenges the reader with the question, "Do you know what the discourse is about?" Paul had been given Roman citizenship as a gift from God, he had been given this challenge of trying to guide an infant church into existence along with others chosen by [[Christ]]. What do we do about the positive gifts we have been given by God? These gifts become thorns if you don't use them. Martin Luther had commented about thorns much in the same way Kierkegaard does here when he wrote to his wife, "Thou mayest tell M. Philipps to correct his postil. He never understood why our Lord, in the gospel, calls riches thorns. Here is the school to learn that. But I shudder to think that thorns, in the Scripture, are always threatened with fire. Wherefore I have the greater patience, if haply, by the help of God, I may be able to bring some good to pass." (Martin Luther, To His Wife 1546)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/prosewritersofge00hedg ''Martin Luther, To his Wife'' 1546, p. 26 (''Prose Writers of Germany'' 1847]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kierkegaard was grateful for the free gift of intellectual ability, imagination, and dialectical skills and he took these gifts as gifts that should be used in the service of God. Is it better to examine your own positive qualities or the negative qualities associated to your own self? Can knowledge become a thorn in the side? Here is how he said it in 1847 and then 1848, {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;[Christ] learned obedience from what he suffered-what he suffered when he who possesses the blessing was like a curse for everyone who came near him and for everyone who avoided him, an affliction for his contemporaries, like an affliction for those few who loved him, so that he had to wrench them out into the most terrible decision, so that for his mother he had to be the sword that pierced her heart, for the disciples a crucified love; an affliction for the vacillators, who basically perhaps in the hiddenness of a secret desire grasped the truth of his words but did not dare to join him but for that very reason also kept a thorn in their souls, a split in their inner being, a painful mark of having been his contemporaries; an affliction for the wicked, that he by his purity and holiness had to expose their hearts and make them guiltier than ever. What heavy suffering: to have to be the stumbling stone in order to be the Savior of the world! Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' 1847 Hong 1993 p. 254&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;An observer will perceive how everything was set in motion and how dialectically: I had a thorn in the flesh, intellectual gifts (especially imagination) and culture in superabundance, an enormous development as an observer, a Christian upbringing that was certainly very unusual, a dialectical relationship to Christianity which was peculiarly my own, and in addition to this I had from childhood a training obedience, obedience absolute, and I was armed with an almost foolhardy faith that I was able to do anything, only one thing excepted, to be a free bird, though but for a whole day, or to slip out of the fetters of melancholy in which another power held me bound. Finally in my own eyes I was a penitent. The impression this now makes upon me is as if there were a Power which form the first instant had been observant of this and said, as a fisherman says of the fish, Let it run awhile, it is not yet the moment to pull it in. And strangely enough there is something that reaches back in my recollection, impossible as it is for me to say when I began this practice or why such a thing ever occurred to me: I prayed to God regularly, every day, that He would give me zeal and patience to perform the work He would assign me. Thus I became an author. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''The Point of View of My Work as an Author'' Lowrie translation, 1939, 1962 p. 82-83&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

===Against Cowardliness===
[[File:Morrison translating the Bible.png|thumb|right|130 px|[[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] translating the Bible into Chinese (1813)]]Kierkegaard begins with a passage from the Bible in this discourse, "For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control." 2 Timothy 1:7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20timothy%201&amp;version=RSV ''2 Timothy chapter 1'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Kierkegaard returns to the subject of ''[[Either/Or]]'' and writes in "praise of the resolution". The decision to make a resolution is the ''[[leap of faith]]'' because the resolution always leads the person forward. Scholars can interpret this passage and write whole books about it but it seems that there would be "an abundance of interpretations and a poverty of action."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 347-350&lt;/ref&gt;

His discourse is against cowardliness not against pride because the single individual aught to be able to "acknowledge the good that he does do". But the single individual evades action by using cowardliness and time. He says the spirit enters into the service of the good so it can build a tower to the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 369-370 [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2014&amp;version=RSV Luke 14:28] ''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 209ff&lt;/ref&gt; But cowardliness gets in the way. What is cowardliness and does everyone possess it or is it only possessed by the weak and anxious? Kierkegaard answers in this way, "take it for granted that everyone is somewhat cowardly, and in particular it can safely be assumed that anyone who seeks to know himself better will be willing to acknowledge that he has not infrequently caught himself in it, and for that reason he is always a bit dubious about even his boldest enterprise." So remember "the one thing needful".&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 355-356&lt;/ref&gt;

The single individual can know very many things but not do much of anything that relates to the knowing. One can reflect on what the Bible says or one could decide to do something in relation to what they know. Kierkegaard put it this way in his ''Concluding Postscript'' (1846) and again in his journals. {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;The ethical is not only a knowing; it is also a doing that is related to a knowing, and a doing of such a nature that the repetition of it can at times and in more ways than one become more difficult than the first doing. .... People know everything, and in order not to stop with that, they know also that they are not to do the least of what they know, because with the aid of external knowledge they are in [[Seven Heavens|seventh heaven]], and if one must begin to do it, one will become a poor, wretched existing individual who stumbles again and again and progresses very slowly from year to year. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Vol I, Hong pages 160-161, 254-256&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;At the happy moment everyone received a copy of Holy Scriptures, in which there was one book which was almost always too brief and sometimes almost invisible, and this was, I regret — the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. ''Journals'' IA 328 1836 or 1837&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Kierkegaard wanted to get married but he took his time about making his decision, even after he had made a promise to marry. He consulted with himself and with God and made a negative resolution about marriage. But someone might come along in the future. He learned not to lean on an imagined view of what a woman is through his contact with [[Regine Olsen]] and didn't form an opinion of what he wanted. He didn't want to compare girl with girl and find out through comparison that his tower was higher or lower than others.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 361-363&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|No wonder one hears so much silly talk about love, since to hear so much talk is already an indication that reflection is universally forcing its way in to disturb the quiet, more modest life where love prefers to reside because in its modesty it is so close to piety. Thus I am well aware that Messrs. Esthetes will promptly declare me incompetent for discussion, and all the more so when I do not conceal that despite being married for eight years I still do not definitely know in a critical sense what my wife looks like. To love is not to criticize, and marital faithfulness does not consist of detailed criticism. Yet this ignorance of mine is not entirely due to my being uncultured; I, too, am able to observe the beautiful, but I observe a portrait, a statue, in that way, not a wife. … as far as my wife is concerned, I am not sure to this day whether she is slim. ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong p. 125}}

[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|thumb|left|130px|A Bible handwritten in Latin, 1407AD]]The rest of the discourse discusses how cowardliness, false pride, sagacity, and time conspire to keep us out of the world of the spirit and from acting there. But he keeps reminding every single individual that all are equal in the world of the spirit. Kierkegaard preferred to study the Bible alone so he could have a clear understanding of where he stood. Others can't do that and need help or to hear it read aloud in Church. Kierkegaard had to make his own resolution about the world of the spirit. He wrote the following in 1848. "I had to either cast myself into perdition and sensuality, or to choose the religious absolutely as the one thing-either the world in a measure that would be dreadful, or the cloister."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Point of View, Walter'' Lowrie, 1962 p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In this resolution he maintained, as the apostles had, that he was only an "unworthy servant".&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 372, Luke 17:10&lt;/ref&gt; He strove to keep his resolution and asked others the following question. "Where does the fault lie if the person and his resolution no longer live together in harmony?"&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;So banish all curiosity, which is doomed without even knowing it, since its doom is either that he it is unable to understand it or that it will be able to understand it, and its sin is either it neglects lesser matters in order to drop off into reverie about riddles or that it craftily applies its talents to making them ununderstandable and hypocritically pretends that this is a desire for understanding. Let everyone test himself. With regard to what he has experienced, let him be true to himself, but let no one forget that blessedness of the spirit and suffering of the spirit are not something external of which one can honestly and truly say: The circumstances of my life did not provide me the opportunity to experience this. In the world of the spirit, there is neither sport nor spook; there luck and chance do not make one person a king, another a beggar, one person as beautiful as an Oriental queen, another more wretched than Lazarus. In the world of the spirit, the only one who is shut out is the one who shuts himself out; in the world of the spirit, all are invited and therefore what is said about it can be said safely and undauntedly; if it pertains to one single individual it pertains to all.  Why, then, this curiosity about what God has given every human being the opportunity to experience, indeed, has been made so available that it even may be said: He must have understood it. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 334ff&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;consider someone who wants to do an act of mercy-can he do more than give all that he possesses-and did not the widow give infinitely more than the rich man gave out of his abundance! At times the circumstances can determine that a penny signifies little more than it usually signifies, but if someone wants to do something marvelous, he can make the one penny signify just as much as all the world’s gold put together if he gives it out of compassion and the penny is the only one he has. Indeed, someone who has an ear for judging how large the gift is detects the difference just by hearing the jingle of the coins, but compassion and the temple box understand it differently. When someone who enjoys health and strength and who possesses the best gifts of the spirit enters the service of the good with all that he has, with the range of years that seem to stretch out before him, with expectancy’s every demand upon life, every claim expected and demanded only for the sake of the good-and when, on the other hand, someone who sadly sees his earthly frailty and the day of disintegration so close that he is tempted to speak of the time granted him as the pastor speaks of it, when in the hour of resolution a person like that promises with the pastor’s words “to dedicate these moments” to the service to the good-whose tower then becomes higher? Do they not both reach heaven? Or when one person, a stranger to internal enemies, aggressively directs his mind and thoughts toward humankind in the service of the good and wins thousands, and when another, retreating in internal battles, in the moment of resolution saves himself, whose tower then becomes higher? If cowardliness could understand this, it would not be so opposed to resolution, because this is the secret of resolution. It demands everything, that is true; it does not allow itself to be deceived, it tolerates no dishonesty, it is closefisted down to the last penny toward the person who wants to give almost everything. But it is not petty; it relishes the sight of someone who gives away the little he has and is angry only if he wants to hold back, if he wants to put blame on his poverty, if he sophistically wants to delude himself into thinking that it is impossible for him to give away everything since he possesses nothing, if he wants to divert himself by wishing that he had much to give away, if he wants to entertain himself by thinking how magnanimous he then would be, wants to satisfy his urge for resolution with dreams until the urge passes. All this is just cowardliness and concealed pride, which desires to become in obscurity a little more than one is and to put off the resolution with feigned approval. Søren Kierkegaard, Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 361-363 &lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

===One Who Prays Aright Struggles in Prayer and Is Victorious—in That God Is Victorious===
[[File:Maria Magdalene praying.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Mary Magdalene praying]]Now Kierkegaard takes the reader where he wanted to take him. To [[prayer]], specifically to the "struggle" involved in prayer. And the prayer hopes for the "reward". Is to struggle in prayer a "contradiction" in terms?&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 377-381&lt;/ref&gt; Can it be shown artistically and scientifically? It all gets confused and "the strong man is warned not to misuse his power against the weak, but the weak man is also warned not to misuse the power of prayer against the strong."&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 384, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' Vol 1 p. 89-92&lt;/ref&gt; Every single individual prays in his or her own particular way and there is no "[[scientific method]]" for praying. But what are we praying about? {{Quotation|One person contends in prayer for his share of the good things that fail to come, another for the honor that beckons, another for the happiness he wants to create for his beloved, another for the happiness that will flourish for him at his beloved’s side. One person contends in prayer against the horror of the past from which he is fleeing, another against the terror of the future into which he is staring, another with the secret horror that resides in solitude, another with the danger everyone sees. One person contends for the fulfillment of the wish, another against the fulfilled wish, since it was precipitous. One person strains every nerve even though he keeps on praying; another is expecting everything from the prayer even though he keeps on working; one ponders the relation of the fulfillment to the work; another ponders the misrelation. Alas, even though there is peace in the land, health and abundance, alas, even though the sun smiles bright and warm, there is still so much struggle. Alas, even when the overarching night sky is silent and starlit and the fields are at rest, there is still so much struggle! Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 387-388}} {{Quotation|It seems just as ridiculous as for a Hercules of a pastor to take gladiator positions when he prays in order to demonstrate by the rippling muscles of his arms how fervently he is praying etc. It is not muscles that are needed in order to pray and to pray fervently — nor is this the kind of trembling that is of the spirit and inwardness. ''Journals of Soren Kierkegaard'', VA 94}}

Many Christians as well as individuals associated with other religious bodies pray. It seems to be something everyone does. All struggle but Kierkegaard asks, "But what is the issue in the struggle?" Is it the outcome or result that is the issue?&lt;ref&gt;Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 388ff&lt;/ref&gt; What happens if the praying individual becomes "lukewarm and cold and indifferent"?&lt;ref&gt;Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 391ff&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "One says: To renounce everything is an enormous abstraction-that is why one must proceed to hold on to something. But if the task is to [[Renunciation|renounce]] everything, what if one began by renouncing something?"&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

He's been discussing the relationship of human being to human being, the relationship of a human being with the soul, and a human being in relationship with God. And he's been discussing change. One human being can change another but it can cause many difficulties. The human being who is aware that a soul exists within the inner being can consider it as an individual. "Worship is the maximum for a human being’s relationship with God, and thereby for his likeness to God, since the qualities are absolutely different."&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', p. 162-163, 278-279, 412ff&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Study of an Apostle's Hands (Praying Hands) - WGA07062.jpg|thumb|left|130px|''Praying Hands'' [[Albrecht Dürer]] 1508]] So we pray to God about what we [[want]] and [[need]]. Kierkegaard's first discourse says this about needs, &lt;blockquote&gt;"MAN wants but little here below, nor wants that little long" is a high-minded saying, well worthy of acceptance, and worthy also of being accepted as it desires to be accepted. Let us then take it away from him: wealth and power and influence, and the deceitful service of false friendship, and the obedient subjection of his pleasures to the whim of his desires, and the triumphs of his vanity over the admiration of his worshipers, and the flattering attention of the throngs, and the envied magnificence of his entire presence. Now he has lost it, and is content with less. Just as the world cannot recognize him on account of the great alteration in his circumstances, so he finds it hard to recognize himself— so changed is he: that he who once needed so much now needs so little." ''Edifying Discourses'', a selection, Swenson p. 136-138&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How does the crowd decide what it wants and needs compared with the decision of the single individual? The crowd hears stories and wonders if they are true. Repetition of the story increases its validity. Kierkegaard thinks people should reflect on those stories for a longer period of time and choose for themselves if they are believable. He wrote the following in 1846: {{Quotation|“It is spirit to ask about two things. (1) Is what is being said possible? (2) Am I able to do it? It is to lack spirit to ask about two things: (1) Did it actually happen? (2) Has my neighbor done it; has he actually done it? In asking with regard to my own actuality, I am asking about its possibility, except that this possibility is not esthetically and intellectually disinterested but is a thought-actuality that is related to my own personal actuality-namely that I am able to carry it out. The how of the truth is precisely the truth. ''Concluding Postscript'', Hong p. 322-323 [[File:Q 2008-05-05 Søren Kierkegaard.ogg|So venture]] 
At the distance of a dispute from action, at the distance of a noble resolve from action, at the distance of a solemn vow, of repentance, from action-everyone understands the highest. To understand, within the security of conditions unchanged through ancient custom, that a change should be made-everyone can do that, since this understanding is at a distance-is not unchanginess an enormous distance from change? Alas, in the world there is incessantly the pressing question about what this one can do, what that one can do, and what that one cannot do; eternity, which speaks the highest, calmly assumes that every person can do it and therefore asks only if he did it. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', 1847, Hong p. 79}}

Søren Kierkegaard made many wishes in his life and had them "die in being born". He also hoped much but started out with "a short-lived hope, that tomorrow is forgotten; a childish hope, that old age does not recognize". He was just a young man and young men like to wish and hope and love. He found that his "faith was disappointed and vanished because of the pain of the wish". He wished for happiness and good health and to have money and the possibility of a family; and he wanted to know what he needed for his wish to come true. He hoped that somehow the conditions would be right so he could be happy. That's all he wanted.&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or, Part II'', Hong p. 184ff, ''Purity of Heart'', Steere p. 49-51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Wanderer above the sea of fog.jpg|thumb|right|130px|The wanderer above the sea of fog]]When he was young he complained to the Greek gods [[Prometheus]] and [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] because they equipped human beings so gloriously and yet it did not occur to them to give them money also.&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or, Part II'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Here he was the [[ethicist]] like Martha. What service she could have done if she only had the money. Earlier, as the [[esthete]], he had asked for an internal good, a [[sense of humor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or Vol I'', Swenson p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Mary knew she was a sinner, that she was unethical and yet she was saved. Imagine what Mary could have done with a sense of humor. One could make prayer an external, scientific act while the other could make it into a suffocating internal private act with no other communication. But neither way, if taken to extremes, would result in faith. He visits this theme again in 1850 with his discourse ''The Woman Who Was a Sinner'' where he says, "from a woman you learn concern for the one thing needful, from Mary, sister of Lazarus, who sat silent at Christ's feet with her heart's choice: the one thing needful."&lt;ref&gt;''Without Authority'', Hong translation p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Kierkegaard said he could describe the movements of faith but he couldn't make them&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling, Hong p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; because he couldn't understand Abraham. It's difficult to understand each other in the physical world. Sometimes its a miracle.&lt;ref&gt;''Johannes Climacus'', by Søren Kierkegaard, Edited and Introduced by Jane Chamberlain, Translated by T.H. Croxall 2001 p. 20-21, 75, 79-80, ''Either/Or, Part 2'', p. 96-97, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', p. 41, 83-84, .243, ''Philosophical Fragments'', p. 26-28, 38, 49, 71, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Note p. 12, ''Three Discourses on Imaged Occasions'', On the Occasion of a Wedding,  Søren Kierkegaard, June 17, 1844,  Hong 1993 p. 59-62, ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong p. 90-91, ''Purity of Heart'', p. 174, ''The Sickness Unto Death'', Hannay 68&lt;/ref&gt; Isn't it much more difficult to understand each other in the world of the spirit, because each single individual in a group of people praying is standing before God? And the secret given through prayer by God is a gift for the individual concerned according to Kierkegaard's view of the Bible. {{Quotation|"How numerous the struggles are, how varied the struggle in which one who prays tries himself ''with'' God (since someone who tries himself ''against'' God does not struggle in prayer), how varied the means of prayer, the special nature of the prayer, with which the struggler seeks to overcome God! The struggler is indeed so inclined; it is his intention that the struggle be fruitful, that it end with a glorious result, and if anyone were to say to him, in order to calm him down, that God is the unchanging, that God only lives far off in heaven but is even further away from every human being in his changelessness, this kind of talk would certainly upset the struggler. Just as the worst thing that can be said of a person is that he is an inhuman brute, so it is the worst and the most revolting blasphemy to say of God that he is inhuman, no matter if it is supposed to be very fashionable or bold to talk that way.

No the God to whom he prays is human, has the heart to feel humanly, the ear to hear a human being’s complaint; the even though he does not fulfill every wish, he still lives close to us and is moved by the struggler’s cry, by his humble request, by his wretchedness when he sits abandoned and as if in prison, by his speedy joy over the fulfillment when in hope he anticipates it. Indeed, this God is moved by the struggler’s lament when he is perishing in despondency, by his shout when he is sinking in the maelstrom of change, by the thanksgiving he promises for all time; he is moved, if not earlier, then by the final sigh when, humanly speaking, it already seems to be too late."

== Reception ==
Kierkegaard was noticed by ''The Western Literary Messenger'', Sept 1849, which wrote that everything exists for Kierkegaard in this one point, the human heart and as he reflects this changing heart in the eternal unchangeable, in that which became flesh and dwelt among us he has found a lively group of readers among the ladies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yvXVAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=kierkegaard ''Living Philosophers in Denmark'' pp. 182–183]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Kierkegaard wrote:  "I almost never made a visit, and at home the rule was strictly observed to receive no one except the poor who came to seek help."&lt;ref&gt;''Point of View'', Lowrie, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; One could speculate that each time a poor single individual came to his door his first self shouted "Me wants"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard carried his ideas forward to his other works. He wrote the following in 1847 "It is a mark of childishness to say: Me wants, me-me; a mark of adolescence to say I-and I; the sign of maturity and the devotion of the eternal is to will to understand that this I has no significance unless it become the you to whom eternity incessantly speaks and says: You shall, you shall, you shall. Youthfulness wants to be the only I in the whole world; maturity is to understand this you personally, even if it were not even addressed to a single other person. You shall, you shall love the neighbor."  ''Works of Love'', Hong p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the money he gave away. This corresponds with what Andrew Hamilton, a member of the Royal Society of [[Antiquaries]] of the North, Copenhagen, wrote about Søren Kierkegaard in 1852 in his book ''Sixteen Months in the Danish Isles'' (1852).&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GjcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;pg=GBS.PA268  ''Sixteen Months in the Danish Isles'' (1852)]&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard did his research among the living in the streets of Copenhagen during the day and among the dead in books during the evening hours. This author does not mention the discourses he wrote from 1843 to 1844. Yet his discourses always seem to finally meet that single individual whom he with joy and gratitude called his reader, sometimes in the second, third or fourth hour. The reader who takes with the right hand what was offered with the right hand and takes an interest in the seeker. This reader transforms the discourse into a conversation even though many will scarcely notice the discourses because of the repetition.&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p 5, 107, 179, 231, 259&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|There is a man whom it is impossible to omit in any account of Denmark, but whose place it might be more difficult to fix; I mean Søren Kierkegaard. But as his works have, at all events for the most part, a religious tendency, he may find a place among the theologians. He is a philosophical Christian writer, evermore dwelling, one might almost say harping, on the theme of the human heart. There is no Danish writer more in earnest than he, yet there is no one in whose way stand more things to prevent his becoming popular. He writes at times with an unearthly beauty, but too often with an exaggerated display of logic that disgusts the public. All very well, if he were not a popular author, but it is for this he intends himself. I have received the highest delight from some of his books. But no one of them could I read with pleasure all through. His “[[Works of Love]]” has, I suppose, been the most popular, or, perhaps, his "[[Either/Or|Either — Or]]," a very singular book. A little thing published during my stay, gave me much pleasure, “[[Sickness unto Death]]." Kierkegaard's habits of life are singular enough to lend a (perhaps false) interest to his proceedings. He goes into no company, and sees nobody in his own house, which answers all the ends of an invisible dwelling; I could never learn that anyone had been inside of it. Yet his one great study is human nature; no one knows more people than he. The fact is he walks about town all day, and generally in some person's company; only in the evening does he write and read. When walking, he is very communicative, and at the same time manages to draw everything out of his companion that is likely to be profitable to himself. I do not know him. I saw him almost daily in the streets, and when he was alone I often felt much inclined to accost him, but never put it into execution. I was told his "talk" was very fine. Could I have enjoyed it, without the feeling that I was myself being mercilessly pumped and sifted, I should have liked very much. 
* Andrew Hamilton, ''Sixteen Months in the Danish Isles'' (1852) p. 268-270}}

The year Kierkegaard died, 1855, The Journal, ''Evangelical Christendom'' published a work entitled, ''Christian Work and the News of the Churches'' which stated that Kierkegaard wrote against the use of the arts and sciences in religion. [[Hans Lassen Martensen]] wrote about Kierkegaard's ideas in his book, ''Christian Ethics'', and said Kierkegaard claimed himself as the inventor of the category of the "single individual" and saw only [[Socrates]] as his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/christianethicsg00mart#page/215/mode/1up Christian Ethics, General Part] (1871) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; But Kierkegaard may have been reacting to [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s (1762 - 1814) category of the race over the individual in his lecture, ''Idea of Universal History'', or of his discussion of ''pure Ego'' and ''Non Ego'' in his 1794 book ''The Vocation of the Scholar'' or even of [[Johann Goethe]]'s view of [[Shakespeare]] as the self-made man, or possibly of George Brandes account of [[Ludwig Tieck]]'s (1773 - 1853) poem ''Love/I'' in his ''Main Currents of Nineteenth Century Literature'', Volume 2. But Kierkegaard was most interested in finding a way to get along with himself.{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, I say, and in these discourses only, shall this be so ; for, strictly speaking, and in the higher flights of speculation, Human Life on Earth, and Earthly Time itself, are but necessary Epochs of the ONE TIME and of the ONE ETERNAL LIFE; and this Earthly Life with all its subordinate divisions may be deduced from the fundamental Idea of the ETERNAL LIFE already accessible to us here below. It is our present voluntary limitation alone which forbids us to undertake this strictly demonstrable deduction, and permits us here only to declare the fundamental Idea of the Earthly Life, requesting every hearer to bring this Idea to the test of his own sense of truth, and, if he can, to approve it thereby. Life of MANKIND on Earth, we have said, and Epochs of this Life. We speak here only of the progressive Life of the Race, not of the Individual, which last in all these discourses shall remain untouched, and I beg of you never to lose sight of this our proper point of view. The Idea of a World-Plan is thus implied in our inquiry, which, however, I am not at this time to deduce from the fundamental Idea indicated above, but only to point out. I say therefore, and so lay the foundation of our rising edifice, the End of the Life of Mankind on Earth is this, that in this Life they may order all their relations with FREEDOM according to REASON. Fichte, Johann Gottlieb, 1762-1814; Popular works; (1889)  translated by Smith, William, 1816-1896 P. 4-5 ''Idea of Universal History'', Lecture I&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/popularworks02fichuoft#page/1/mode/1up ''Idea of Universal History'', Lecture I]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''pure Ego'' can only be conceived of negatively,- as the opposite of the ''Non-Ego'', the character of which is multiplicity, - consequently as perfect and absolute Unity; - it is thus always one and the same,-always identical with itself. Hence the above formula may also be expressed thus, - ''Man should always be at one with himself,-he should never contradict his own being.'' The ''pure Ego'' can never stand in opposition with itself, for there is in it no diversity, but it constantly remains one and the same; but the ''empirical Ego'', determined and determinable by outward things, may contradict itself; and as often as it does so, it is a sure sign that it is not determined according to the form of the ''pure Ego'',-not by itself, but by something external to itself. It should not be so; - for man is his own end, - he should determine himself, and never allow himself to be determined by anything foreign to himself; - he should be what he is, because he wills it, and ought to will it. The determination of the ''empirical Ego'' should be such as might endure for ever. I may here, in passing, and for the sake of illustration merely, express the fundamental principle of morality in the following formula: - “''So act, that thou mayest look upon the dictate of thy will as an eternal law to thyself.''” The ultimate vocation for every finite, rational being is thus the absolute unity, constant identity, perfect harmony with himself.  ''The Vocation of the Scholar'', by Johann Gottlieb Fichte 1794 p. 20-21&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/vocationofschola00fich#page/20/mode/1up The Vocation of the Scholar, by Johann Gottlieb Fichte 1794, translated by William Smith 1847] Archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But the building of the new theatre, in my time, made the greatest noise; in which his curtain, when it was still quite new, had certainly an uncommonly charming effect.[[Adam Friedrich Oeser|Oeser]] had taken the Muses out of the clouds, upon which they usually hover on such occasions, and set them upon the earth. The statues of Sophocles and Aristophanes, around whom all the modern dramatic writers were assembled, adorned a vestibule to the Temple of Fame. Here, too, the goddesses of the arts were likewise present; and all was dignified and beautiful. But now comes the oddity! Through the open centre was seen the portal of the distant temple: and a man in a light jerkin was passing between the two above-mentioned groups, and, without troubling himself about them, directly up to the temple; he was seen from behind, and was not particularly distinguished. Now, this man was to represent Shakespeare, who without predecessors or followers, without concerning himself about models, went to meet immortality in his own way.

[[File:Johann Georg Hamann (1730 –1788).jpg|thumb|left|130px|Johann Georg Hamann]]Kierkegaard and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) both rebelled against Hegel's philosophy. Neither had a systematic approach to philosophy or religion. And both were compared to [[Johann Georg Hamann]] (1730–1788), the "Magus of the North". Kierkegaard lived at the time Hegel was writing but Nietzsche had help with his battle because of the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860). Both were identified with this category of the single individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Nietzsche, Frederich, and His Influence'', p. 144ff The Book-Lover.

Scandinavian Studies and Notes&lt;/ref&gt;

David F. Swenson translated the ''Edifying Discourses'' during 1944–1945. The publisher ([[Augsburg Publishing House]]) said, "no real understanding of Kierkegaard is possible unless these devotional works are understood and assimilated."&lt;ref&gt;Edifying Discourses, Volume II, translated by David F. and Lillian M. Swenson 1944 front jacket&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about Kierkegaard's idea of the inner and outer self in 1941. He agrees with Kierkegaard in that this "first self" must learn that it is not infallible and come to an agreement with the "deeper self" before growth can occur.{{Quotation|First, the individual's self-consciousness must be so far developed, so profoundly stirred, that it confronts the ideal of an absolute good, an eternal ''telos'', which is identical with its own immortality. Otherwise no consciousness of sin in the Christian sense can ever arise. The existence of such an ideal for the individual is not determined by the possession of a more or less adequate intellectual conception of what this good may be, in the sense of logical content, but depends solely on whether the individual acknowledges something which is absolutely the transformation of his personal existence, so that all other ends become by comparison relative. This is existential pathos, which expresses itself, not as esthetic pathos is satisfied to express itself, namely in words, but in deeds, or rather in an inner transformation and direction of the subject's existence with respect to the absolute good. The development of this attitude is tantamount to the development of the personality to its highest potentiality.   David F. Swenson, ''Something About Kierkegaard'', Chapter VII Kierkegaard's Treatment of the Doctrine of Sin p. 179, 1941, 1945 Augsburg Publishing House}}

[[Existential]] philosophers have the category of [[Other (philosophy)|the other]] which was an [[entity]] outside of the single individual. This "other" is something one is to be freed from because it wants to enslave the single individual wishing to remain a single individual in the face of the other. Kierkegaard would disagree with this interpretation and would insist that the other is the anxiety created by the interplay of the first self and the deeper self as it relates itself to the external world. He wrote the following in ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', which was published just two months before this final discourse of 1844. {{Quotation|Anxiety is a qualification of dreaming spirit, and as such it has its place in psychology. Awake, the difference between myself and my other is posited; sleeping, it is suspended; dreaming, it is an intimated nothing. The actuality of the spirit constantly shows itself as a form that tempts its possibility but disappears as soon as it seeks to grasp for it, and it is a nothing that can only bring anxiety. More it cannot do as long as it merely shows itself. The concept of anxiety is almost never treated in psychology. Therefore, I must point out that it is altogether different from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite, whereas anxiety is freedom’s actuality as the possibility of possibility. For this reason, anxiety is not found in the beast, precisely because by nature the beast is not qualified as spirit. ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol p. 42}}

[[Howard V. Hong]] who translated the ''Upbuilding Discourses'' in 1990 said the following in his introduction to the book. "The movement is to arrive at the simple, the movement is from the public to the single individual." Kierkegaard tried to sell his discourses individually, then as Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, published in 1845. After he ran out of his [[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]] he combined them into a set of sixteen which he called ''Sexten opbyggelige Taler''.&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were meager nonetheless. But he kept his faith in what he was called to do and continued writing.

== Criticism ==
Critics have been against putting so much stress on the inner life of the spiritual self at the expense of the outer life of the physical self. Kierkegaard would agree that a balance is necessary for one to be happy. [[George Brandes]] said in his memoirs (1906), "That God had died for me as my Saviour,—I could not [[understand]] what it meant."&lt;ref&gt;''Reminiscences of My Childhood and Youth'', By George Brandes September 1906 p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; As far as Kierkegaard was concerned he would say Brandes was making a good start at becoming a Christian. Brandes also introduced [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who was also interested in the problems of faith and knowledge and the idea that "
one thing is needful".&lt;ref&gt;See section 290 of his book [[The Gay Science]] [https://archive.org/stream/completenietasch10nietuoft#page/222/mode/2up One Thing is Needful]&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche wrote the following in his book, ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'': {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;The old theological problem of “Faith” and “Knowledge,” or more plainly, of [[instinct]] and [[reason]]-the question whether, in respect to the valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality, which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to a “Why,” that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility-it is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of [[Socrates]], and had divided men’s minds long before Christianity. Socrates himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent-that of a surpassing dialectician-took first the side of reason; and, in fact, what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions? In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also at himself: with his finer [[conscience]] and [[introspection]], he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity. “But why”-he said to himself-”should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts! One must set them right, and the reason also-one must follow the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments.” ''Beyond Good and Evil'', 1909 Zimmerman translation p. 111-112&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodevilpr1909niet#page/110/mode/1up ''Beyond Good and Evil'' by Friedrich Nietzsche, prelude to a philosophy of the future], 2d ed. Friedric Nietzsche; translated by Helen Zimmernan, Published 1909&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Compare to what Kierkegaard wrote in this essay. Kierkegaard's deeper self is pictured in an internal conversation with the first self. "Would you be better off now by having lost some of that burning desire and having won the understanding that life cannot deceive you; is not that kind of losing a winning? That little secret we two have between us, as the deeper self said. What, presumably, is this secret, my listener? What else but this, that with regard to the external a person is capable of nothing at all. If he wants to seize the external immediately, it can be changed in the same instant, and he can be deceived; on the other hand, he can take it with the consciousness that it could also be changed, and he is not deceived even though it is changed, because he has the deeper self’s consent. If he wants to act immediately in the external, to accomplish something, everything can become nothing in that same moment; on the other hand, he can act with this consciousness, and even if it came to nothing, he is not deceived, because he has the deeper self’s consent. But even if the first self and the deeper self have been reconciled in this way and the shared mind has been diverted away from the external, this is still only the condition of coming to know himself. But if he is actually to know himself, there are new struggles and new dangers." Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', 1844, Hong translation p. 316-317&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And he carried the idea further in his 1847 book, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits where he makes faith practicable.  "Doubt very much wants to rob the sufferer of bold confidence, wants to leave him stuck in the hardship, to let him perish in the despondent, indeed, the presumptuous thought that he is forsaken by God, as if it were in a hopeless sense that the apostle said “that we are destined for hardships” (1 Thessalonians 3:3), as if the hardship had no qualification but we were simply appointed to hardship. When, however, the hardship has the qualification of being the road, there is immediately a breath of air, then the sufferer draws a breath, then it must lead to something, because then the hardship is indeed itself the forwarding agent. It is not a difficulty on the road that makes, if I dare say so, a new team of horses necessary, but the hardship itself is a team, the very best; if one only lets it rule, it helps one forward, because hardship is the road. Is it not joyful how the sufferer can breathe in this thought with bold confidence! Not only does he commend himself to God alone and advance against the hardship. No, he says: The hardship itself is a sign to me that I have good references, the hardship is my helper-because hardship is the road. As long as the child is still afraid of the teacher, it surely can learn a great deal, but when trust has driven out the fear and bold confidence has conquered, then the highest level of education begins. So it is also when the sufferer, convinced that hardship is the road has overcome the hardship, because in the highest sense it is not an overcoming of the hardship to will to believe that hardship is the road, is the helper! The Apostle Paul declares somewhere: Faith is our victory, and in another place says: Indeed, we more than conquer. But can one more than conquer? Yes, if before the struggle begins one has changed the enemy into one’s friend. It is one thing to conquer in the hardship, to  overcome the hardship as one overcomes an enemy, while continuing in the idea that the hardship is one’s enemy; but it is more than conquering to believe that the hardship is one’s friend, that it is not the opposition but the road, is not what obstructs but develops, is not what disheartens but ennobles. ''The hardship must be passable and practicable''." Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 302-303 (1847)&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Critics have concentrated on the personality of Kierkegaard to a greater degree than on his writings, especially his discourses. Early interpreters of his works were Georg Brandes, [[Harald Hoffding]] and O. P. Monrad according to this article written in 1915. {{Quotation|The fundamental and decisive element in Soren Kierkegaard’s personality is found by George Brandes in his combined reverence and scorn; by H. Hoffding (more in accordance with the fact that he was his father’s son) in his melancholy; by O. P. Monrad,&lt;ref&gt;(O.P. Monrad, Soren Kierkegaard. Sein Leben und seine Werke (Jena, 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; his latest biographer, in emotion or passion. Certainly the emotional factor—as it forms the decisive element in personal characteristic generally—best suggests the distinctive features of Kierkegaard’s personality. In his published writings and in his journals we are in touch with a nature of unwonted intensity, with and inner life at white heat. This is seen his abnormal sensitiveness; he was touched to the quick by things that others might have ignored or easily forgotten. Again, while he was admittedly the most original mind that Denmark ever produced, his thought seldom operated in cool dialectic, but was in its nature ‘existential,’ expressive of his whole personality; with amazing imaginative fertility he constructs, not chains of reasoning, but ‘experiments in psychology’ i.e. persons and situations depicting a real, living experience. Similarly, religion was for him, not a group of doctrines requiring merely to be believed, defended, or systematized, but a fact making a tremendous demand upon life; the joy of salvation was to be won in the most intense appropriation of the truth and the most impassioned submission to its claim.  ''Soren Kierkegaard'', Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, Volume VII,  James Hastings, John Alexander Selbie, Louis Herbert Gray T. &amp; T. Clark, 1915 p. 697 (696-700)}}

[[Thomas Merton]] wrote a book in 1955 called ''No Man Is An Island'' in response to the interest scholars had in the category of the single individual because he thought this idea would lead people away from the Church. He writes very similarly to what Kierkegaard stated. Here is part of his [[prologue]]. {{Quotation|&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:TMertonStudy.jpg|thumb|lright|130px|Thomas Merton]] --&gt;No matter how ruined man and his world may seem to be, and no matter how terrible man’s despair may become, as long as he continues to be a man his very humanity continues to tell him that life has a meaning. That, indeed, is one reason why man tends to rebel against himself. ...  In the last analysis the individual person is responsible for living his own life and for “finding himself”. ... If he persists in shifting this responsibility to somebody else, he fails to find out the meaning of his own existence. ... I do not intend to divorce myself at any point from Catholic tradition. But neither do I intend to accept points of that tradition blindly, and without understanding, and without making them really my own. ... Man is divided against himself and against God by his own selfishness, which divides him against his brother. This division cannot be healed by a love that places itself only on one side of the rift. Love must reach over to both sides and draw them together. Thomas Merton, ''No Man Is an Island'', 1955, Prologue&lt;ref&gt;Merton's book reflects the writings of [[John Donne]]'s poem which states ""All mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every chapter must be so translated...As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon, calls not upon the preacher only, but upon the congregation to come: so this bell calls us all: but how much more me, who am brought so near the door by this sickness....No man is an island, entire of itself...any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." (Meditation XVII)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Rollo May]] discussed Kierkegaard's [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of creating oneself in his 1975 book, ''The Courage to Create''. He agrees with Kierkegaard's assessment that the self is always only in the process of becoming that which it will be. Determinism, or the accidents of life, are what they are, but the thinking and self-creating that goes on with each single individual is what allows each of us to face our own fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;Rollo May, ''The Courage to Create'', 1975, 1994 p. 99ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Ib Ostenfeld argued that Kierkegaard must have been a "healthy and stable individual" once his personal [[psychology]] is considered.  He noted that "at the outset psychiatry was not a medical specialty in Denmark until the period 1880 to 1890 and that psychiatric studies of Kierkegaard are themselves quite recent. Indeed, the first author to study Kierkegaard from a medical point of views was P.A. Heiberg, who was himself a physician." (Author's Introduction). See link in Secondary sources for his 1978 book, ''Søren Kierkegaard's Psychology''.

Kierkegaard used the Bible as a source book. [[Jon Stewart (philosopher)|Jon Stewart]] has written two books about Kierkegaard's use of the Bible in his works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonstewart.dk/volume_1.htm ''Kierkegaard and the Bible Edited by Lee C. Barrett and Jon Stewart'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters'' states, "The Bible was the most important piece of literature in Søren Kierkegaard's life."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Dictionary_of_major_biblical_interpreter.html?id=N24UAQAAIAAJ The Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters'', p. 609, 2007, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is this tension between those who want to go it alone and those who want company along the way. Kierkegaard was concerned about those who want to teach themselves everything and those who can barely teach themselves anything. If they want to argue with one another then there should be no "scorn and contempt and ways of frightening".&lt;ref&gt;This is what Kierkegaard thought about intimidation and it can be applied to both sides in the argument: "How is it that Hegel and all Hegelians, who are generally supposed to be dialecticians, at this point become angry, yes, as angry as Germans? Or is “spurious” a dialectical qualification? From where does such a predicate enter logic? How do scorn and contempt and ways of frightening find a place as legitimate means of movement within logic, so that the absolute beginning is assumed by the individual because he is afraid of what his neighbors on all sides will think of him if he does not do it? Is not “spurious” an ethical category?"  Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong Vol 1 p. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; One ought to help the other. He wrote about egotistical and sympathetic depression, autopathetic doubt,&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or, Part II'', Hong p.  25-26, 271&lt;/ref&gt; autopathetic and sympathetic resolutions, and suffering autopathetically and sympathetically.&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Postscript'', Hong p. 112-113, ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong p. 265-266&lt;/ref&gt; Some things have to be done alone but that doesn't apply to all things. He liked to pray and this discourse was about prayer. He wrote the following prayer in ''[[Practice in Christianity]]'' (1850), a book for "awakening and deepening." {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;John 12:32: ''And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all to myself.'' Lord Jesus Christ, whether we are far away or nearby, far away from you in the confused human throng, in worldly business, in earthly cares, in temporal joy, in purely human loftiness, or far away from all this in solitude, in forsakenness, in unappreciation, in lowliness-and closer to you: draw us, draw us wholly to yourself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But you, Lord Jesus Christ, we pray that you will draw us and draw us wholly to yourself. Whether our lives will glide calmly along in a cottage by a quiet lake or we shall be tried in battle with the storms of life on rough seas, whether we shall “seek honor in living quietly” (1 Thessalonians 4:11) or, struggling, in abasement: draw us, and draw us wholly to yourself. If only you draw us, then all is indeed won, even if we, humanly speaking, won nothing and lost nothing, even if we, humanly speaking, lost everything-then this, that life-condition, would be the truth of our life, since you draw no one to an unworthy distance from dangers, but neither do you draw anyone out into foolhardy ventures.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Søren Kierkegaard, ''Practice in Christianity'', Hong, p. 259-260}}

'''Sir Francis Anderson''' (3 September 1858 – 24 June 1941) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[philosopher]] and educator. He married twice, firstly to [[Maybanke Anderson|Maybanke Selfe Wolstenholme]], and then to Josephine Wight who survived him, there were no children.

==Early life==
Francis Anderson was born in [[Glasgow]], the son of Francis Anderson, manufacturer, and his wife Elizabeth Anna Lockart, née Ellison.&lt;ref&gt;W. M. O'Neil, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070058b.htm Anderson, Sir Francis (1858 - 1941)]', [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 7, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1979, pp 53-55&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson was educated at Old Wynd and Oatlands public schools and became a pupil-teacher at the age of 14. He went on to the [[University of Glasgow]], matriculating in 1876 and graduated [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|M.A.]] in 1883. He was awarded [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|Sir Richard Jebb]]'s prize for Greek literature, took first place in the philosophical classes of Professors Veitch and Caird, and won two scholarships. For two years he was assistant to the professor of moral philosophy, studied in the theological faculty with the intention of entering the ministry, but apparently was not ordained.

==To Australia==
Anderson came to [[Melbourne]] in 1886 as assistant to [[Charles Strong|the Rev. Dr Charles Strong]] at his [[Australian Church]]. This was a valuable experience to Anderson as his work brought him in contact with both the best and the worst types of human nature. In 1888, instead of returning to Scotland as originally intended, he was appointed lecturer in logic and mental philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]], and was the first [[John Henry Challis|Challis]] professor of logic and mental philosophy from the beginning of 1890. He held this position until the end of 1921, when he retired and became emeritus professor.

Anderson was president of the mental science and education section at the meeting of the [[Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] held at [[Brisbane]] in January 1895 and gave an address on "Politics and Education" and, on 26 June 1901, at a conference of teachers, in an address on "The Public School System of [[New South Wales]]", spoke frankly on "the defects, limitations and needs of the existing system of education". Mr J. Perry, the minister of public instruction, immediately called a conference of inspectors and principal officers of his department and' in 1902 J. W. Turner and Sir [[George Handley Knibbs]] were appointed as commissioners to inquire into educational systems in [[Europe]] and  America. Their report confirmed Anderson's strictures, the pupil-teacher system was abolished, and the training of teachers at the Teachers' College was reconstructed. Thirteen years later Anderson was able to report an immense improvement in the state of education in New South Wales (see his chapter on "Educational Policy and Development" in the Federal Handbook prepared for the meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] held in Australia in 1914). Anderson was president of the social and statistical science section at the meeting of the [[Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] held at [[Adelaide]] in 1907 and gave an address on "Liberalism and Socialism". This was followed by a paper on "Sociology in Australia. A Plea for its Teaching" given at the [[Sydney]] meeting held in 1911. Following the discussion, a resolution was unanimously passed recommending the institution of a chair of [[sociology]] in Australia.

Anderson was the inaugural editor of the [[Australasian Journal of Philosophy|''Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy'']] 1923–1926, and he also took a great deal of interest in the tutorial classes and [[Workers Educational Association#WEA Australia|Workers' Education Association]] movements. Another interest was the [[League of Nations]].

==Honours and legacy==

When Anderson retired at the end of 1921, it was proposed to have his portrait painted but instead he suggested that a frieze emblematic of the history of philosophy should be placed in the philosophy lecture room of the university. Eventually two mural panels were painted for it by [[Norman Carter]], one representing [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], the other [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].

Anderson was knighted in the 1936 [[King's Birthday Honours]] and died in Sydney on 24 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34296|supp=y|page=3996|date=19 June 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; for "educational and social welfare services". Some of his papers and addresses were published separately as pamphlets. His monograph on ''Liberty, Equality and Fraternity'' was issued by the Association of Psychology and Philosophy.

'''Francisco José Ricardo, Ph.D''' is a media philosopher, author, musician, theorist, and filmmaker. Ricardo is co-founder of the Digital Video Research Archive at [[Boston University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/dbin/dance/|title=Morris, Sword, and Clog Dancing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the founding editor of the book series, ''International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/series/international-texts-in-critical-media-aesthetics/?pg=1|title=Bloomsbury - International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics|first=|last=Bloomsbury.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by Bloomsbury. This series focuses primarily on electronic, or [[digital art]], and will publish its twelfth book in 2017. In 2013, Ricardo published ''The Engagement Aesthetic: Experiencing New Media Art through Critique'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-engagement-aesthetic-9781623560409/|title=The Engagement Aesthetic|first=|last=Bloomsbury.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he discusses different methods of reflecting on, interacting with, and critiquing [[new media art]]. As media and culture commentator, he examines the loss of reflection in social communication occurring in what he calls hashtag culture, characterized by diminished language, instinctive reactions and responses, a tendency to seek approval from others, and an obsession with certainty -- difficulties that he considers can be addressed by embracing expression through the arts and other self-directed creative activity. Ricardo has appeared on numerous radio talk shows to discuss this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/wtop-fjr-interview-2017september18|title=WTOP Washington, DC News Radio, On Air Interview with Veronica Robinson|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/hashtag-culture-on-kogo-21sep2017|title=Francisco Ricardo speaks about Hashtag Culture on NewsRadio 600 KOGO with Ted Garcia and LaDona Harvey|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/francisco-speaks-on-followers-social-media-and-hashtag-culture-on-sirius|title=Francisco speaks on Followers, social media, on SiriusXM Urban View, The Laura Coates Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/francisco-speaks-with-terry-gilberg-on-social-media-hashtagculture|title=Francisco Speaks on Social Media and Hashtag Culture with Terry Gilberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Francisco J. Ricardo was born in 1962 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. When he was seven, the family moved to [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and two years later, to [[New York City]]. His father, an architect, and professor at the [[University of Havana]], had studied under [[Josef Albers]] during Albers's residency in Havana. His mother had been a gymnast, and in the U.S. founded a "Health Bauhaus" based on alternative nutrition and numerous forms of exercise, yoga, and meditation. Ricardo studied at [[Harvard University]], receiving a C.A.S [HGSE], and an Ed.M. Ricardo transferred during his doctoral work at Harvard to receive the first Ph.D. in Humanities Computing conferred in the U.S. at the pioneering [[University Professors Program]] of [[Boston University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cybertext.hum.jyu.fi/contributors.php|title=CyberText Yearbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked as Research Associate, later teaching art theory at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].

==Career==
After teaching at RISD, writing and presenting on artists and new media art, including electronic or [[digital art]] (see selected articles), Ricardo decided that he could better show this art, which often employs moving images, through the medium of film. He left teaching and formed the documentary film production company, Conceptualist Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptualistfilms.com|title=ConceptualistFilms.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo's vision is to create a new form of documentary on extraordinary artists and musicians - fewer "talking heads" and biographical material; instead, he wants to engage the viewer with unusual imagery while discussing ideas and philosophies in an experimental and accessible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptualistfilms.com/press-release/|title=Press Release – Conceptualist Films Born!|date=22 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of his first documentary (released 2016) is on the creative art process of the multifaceted artist [[James Franco]]. Franco, once a student of Ricardo's at RISD, has a wide body of his own experimental art and film work which Ricardo explores in the film, according to the website for ''F FOR FRANCO.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fforfranco.com/|title=fforfranco|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film contains hours of conversations between Ricardo and Franco, in various places such as the [[LA Theater]] and The [[Chateau Marmont]], as well as footage given by Franco to Ricardo of work rarely, if ever, seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptualistfilms.com/on-the-subject-of-subjects-james-franco/|title=On the Subject of Subjects – James Franco|date=7 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had its world premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival in 2015, reviewed by Neon Tommy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/neon-tommy/film-review-f-for-franco-ac92640b0fa6&lt;/ref&gt; and was reviewed by ''The Hollywood Reporter'', stating it was a "must for Franco completists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/f-franco-film-review-748389 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CD release==
In 2014, Ricardo released an album of electronic music titled, ''Adding and Subtracting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MUFM39E?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=adding%20and%20subtracting%20francisco&amp;qid=1452585514&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1|title=Adding and Subtracting|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second album of electronic music,''Groove Morphisms''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0193MZFMI?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=groove%20morphisms&amp;qid=1452584601&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1|title=Groove Morphisms|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; is more complex, and was released in December 2015. 
In early 2016, Francisco released ''A Singular Within'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B73SLZE?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=a%20singular%20within&amp;qid=1457418260&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1|title=A Singular Within|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of nine meditative, ambient songs reminiscent of the work of Brian Eno. It's a marked departure from his previous two albums. The digital version of ''A Singular Within'' contains two bonus tracks not found on the physical CD.
Francisco composes his albums electronically, employing a variety of instruments, blending styles and creating complex rhythms. The latest are:

'''Gerhard Karl Erich Gentzen''' (November 24, 1909 – August 4, 1945) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] and [[logician]]. He made major contributions to the [[foundations of mathematics]], [[proof theory]], especially on [[natural deduction]] and [[sequent calculus]]. He died in 1945 after the [[Second World War]], because he was deprived of food after being arrested in [[Prague]].

==Life and career==
Gentzen was a student of [[Paul Bernays]] at the [[University of Göttingen]]. Bernays was fired as "non-[[Aryan]]" in April 1933 and therefore [[Hermann Weyl]] formally acted as his supervisor. Gentzen joined the [[Sturmabteilung]] in November 1933 although he was by no means compelled to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Menzler-Trott, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless he kept in contact with Bernays until the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. In 1935, he corresponded with [[Abraham Fraenkel]] in Jerusalem and was implicated by the Nazi teachers' union as one who "keeps contacts to the [[Chosen People]]." In 1935 and 1936, [[Hermann Weyl]], head of the Göttingen mathematics department in 1933 until his resignation under Nazi pressure, made strong efforts to bring him to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton.

Between November 1935 and 1939 he was an assistant of [[David Hilbert]] in Göttingen. Gentzen joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1937. In April 1939 Gentzen swore the oath of loyalty to [[Adolf Hitler]] as part of his academic appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Menzler-Trott, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1943 he was a teacher at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|University of Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.muni.cz/math/biografie/gerhard_gentzen.html Gerhard Gentzen&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at math.muni.cz&lt;/ref&gt; Under a contract from the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Gentzen evidently worked for the [[V-2]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Menzler-Trott, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentzen was arrested during the [[Prague uprising|citizens uprising]] against the occupying German forces on May 5, 1945. He, along with the rest of the staff of the German University in [[Prague]] was subsequently handed over to Russian forces. Because of his past association with the SA, NSDAP and [[National Socialist German Lecturers League|NSD Dozentenbund]], Gentzen was detained in a prison camp, where he died of malnutrition on August 4, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Menzler-Trott, p. 273 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Gentzen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Gentzen's main work was on the foundations of [[mathematics]], in [[proof theory]], specifically [[natural deduction]] and the [[sequent calculus]]. His [[cut-elimination theorem]] is the cornerstone of [[proof-theoretic semantics]], and some philosophical remarks in his "Investigations into Logical Deduction", together with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later work, constitute the starting point for [[inferential role semantics]].

One of Gentzen's papers had a second publication in the ideological ''[[Deutsche Mathematik]]'' that was founded by [[Ludwig Bieberbach]] who promoted "Aryan" mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tydecks.info/online/math_natur_deu.html#k5#k5 Dipl.Math. Walter Tydecks, Neuere Geschichte der Mathematik in Deutschland (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentzen [[Gentzen's consistency proof|proved the consistency]] of the [[Peano axioms]] in a paper published in 1936. In his [[Habilitation]]sschrift, finished in 1939, he determined the proof-theoretical strength of Peano arithmetic. This was done by a direct proof of the unprovability of the principle of transfinite induction, used in his 1936 proof of consistency, within Peano arithmetic. The principle can, however, be expressed in arithmetic, so that a direct proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] followed. [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] used a coding procedure to construct an unprovable formula of arithmetic. Gentzen's proof was published in 1943 and marked the beginning of [[Ordinal analysis|ordinal proof theory]].

'''Google Native Client''' ('''NaCl''') is a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandboxing]] technology for running either a subset of Intel [[x86]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], or [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] native code, or a portable executable, in a sandbox. It allows safely running [[native code]] from a [[web browser]], independent of the user [[operating system]], allowing [[web app]]s to run at near-native speeds, which aligns with Google's plans for [[Chrome OS]]. It may also be used for securing browser [[plug-in (computing)|plugins]], and parts of other applications or full applications&lt;ref name="Register"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/12/google_native_client_from_all_sides/ |title= Google Native Client: The web of the future – or the past?|author= Cade Metz|date=12 September 2011|publisher=The Register|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[ZeroVM]].&lt;ref name="ZeroVM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zerovm.org/architecture.htm |title= ZeroVM Architecture|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To demonstrate the readiness of the technology, on 9 December 2011, Google announced the availability of several new Chrome-only versions of [[videogame|game]]s known for their rich and [[Central processing unit|processor]]-intensive [[computer graphics|graphics]], including ''[[Bastion (video game)|Bastion]]'' (no longer supported on the Chrome Web Store). NaCl runs [[hardware acceleration (computing)|hardware-accelerated]] 3D graphics (via [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0), sandboxed local file storage, [[dynamic loading]], [[fullscreen application|full screen]] mode, and [[Computer mouse|mouse]] capture. There are also plans to make NaCl available on handheld devices.&lt;ref name="CNet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-57340015-12/native-client-turns-chrome-into-high-end-gaming-platform/ |title= Native Client turns Chrome into high-end gaming platform |author= Seth Rosenblatt|date=9 December 2011|publisher=CNET|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/12/games-apps-and-runtimes-come-to-native.html |title=Google Code Blog: Games, apps and runtimes come to Native Client |publisher=Googlecode.blogspot.com |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portable Native Client (PNaCl) is an architecture-independent version. PNaCl apps are [[ahead-of-time compilation|compiled ahead-of-time]]. PNaCl is recommended over NaCl for most use cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/nacl-and-pnacl#when-to-use-pnacl|title=NaCl and PNaCl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general concept of NaCl (running native code in web browser) has been implemented before in [[ActiveX]], which, while still in use, has full access to the system (disk, memory, user-interface, registry, etc.). Native Client avoids this issue by using sandboxing.

An alternative of sorts to NaCl is [[asm.js]], which also allows applications written in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]] to be compiled to run in the browser (at more than half the native speed), and also supports ahead-of-time compilation, but is a subset of JavaScript and hence backwards-compatible with browsers that do not support it directly. Another alternative (while it may initially be powered by PNaCl) is [[WebAssembly]].

On October 12, 2016, a comment on the Chromium issue tracker indicated that Google's Pepper and Native Client teams had been destaffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=239656#c160 |title=Bugs.chromium.org |date=12 October 2016 | accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 30, 2017, Google announced deprecation of PNaCl in favor of [[WebAssembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2017/05/goodbye-pnacl-hello-webassembly.html|title=Goodbye PNaCl, Hello WebAssembly!|work=Chromium Blog|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Native Client is an [[open-source software|open-source]] project being developed by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/ |title=Google Native Client on Google Code |publisher=Google |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/davemichael/NaCl-Quake|title=GitHub - davemichael/NaCl-Quake: Quake for Native Client (based on the SDL Quake port)|author=davemichael|work=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[XaoS]]'', ''[[Battle for Wesnoth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-battle-for-wesnoth/pobnonecghmlpppkkjpdiiblmakhhldb|title=The Battle for Wesnoth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doom.pdox.net|title=Index of /|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lara-croft-and-the-guardi/dcfdbmpeeihbpddkneaploeinlbaaodn&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[From Dust]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/from-dust/anelkojiepicmcldgnmkplocifmegpfj|title=From Dust|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MAME]], as well as the sound processing system [[Csound]], have been ported to Native Client. Native Client has been available in the [[Google Chrome]] web browser since version 14, and has been enabled by default since version 31, when the Portable Native Client (PNaCl, pronounced: pinnacle) was released.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chen |first=Brad |url=http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2008/12/native-client-technology-for-running.html |title=Native Client: A Technology for Running Native Code on the Web |publisher=Google-code-updates.blogspot.com |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.chromium.org/2011/08/native-client-brings-sandboxed-native.html |title=The Chromium Blog: Native Client Brings Sandboxed Native Code to Chrome Web Store Apps |publisher=Blog.chromium.org |date=18 August 2011 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.chromium.org/2013/11/portable-native-client-pinnacle-of.html |title=Google Code Blog: Portable Native Client: The "pinnacle" of speed, security, and portability |publisher=blog.chromium.org |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[ARM architecture|ARM]] implementation was released in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Google-s-Native-Client-goes-ARM-and-beyond-957478.html|title=Google's Native Client goes ARM and beyond|publisher=The H|date=18 March 2010|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[x86-64]], [[IA-32]], and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] are also supported.

To run an application portably under PNaCl, it must be compiled to an architecture-agnostic and stable subset of the [[LLVM]] [[intermediate representation]] [[bytecode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nativeclient.googlecode.com/svn/data/site/pnacl.pdf |title=PNaCl: Portable Native Client Executables |format=PDF |accessdate=25 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502135033/http://nativeclient.googlecode.com/svn/data/site/pnacl.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The executables are called PNaCl executables (pexes). The PNaCl Toolchain makes .pexe files; NaCl Toolchain .nexe files. The [[file format#Magic number|magic number]] of .nexe files is 0x7F 'E' 'L' 'F', which is [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]]. In Chrome, they are translated to architecture-specific executables so that they can be run.

NaCl uses software [[fault detection and isolation]] for sandboxing on x86-64 and ARM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.google.com/pubs/pub35649.html|title=Adapting Software Fault Isolation to Contemporary CPU Architectures|author1=David Sehr |author2=Robert Muth |author3=Cliff L. Biffle |author4=Victor Khimenko |author5=Egor Pasko |author6=Bennet Yee |author7=Karl Schimpf |author8=Brad Chen |year=2010|publisher= 19th USENIX Security Symposium|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The x86-32 implementation of Native Client is notable for its novel sandboxing method, which makes use of the x86 architecture's rarely used [[x86 memory segmentation|segmentation facility]].&lt;ref name="nacl_paper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.google.com/pubs/pub34913.html|title=Native Client: A Sandbox for Portable, Untrusted x86 Native Code|accessdate=31 July 2011|author1=Bennet Yee |author2=David Sehr |author3=Greg Dardyk |author4=Brad Chen |author5=Robert Muth |author6=Tavis Ormandy |author7=Shiki Okasaka |author8=Neha Narula |author9=Nicholas Fullagar |publisher= IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland'09)|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Client sets up x86 segments to restrict the memory range that the sandboxed code can access. It uses a code verifier to prevent use of unsafe instructions such as those that perform system calls. To prevent the code from jumping to an unsafe instruction hidden in the middle of a safe instruction, Native Client requires that all indirect jumps be jumps to the start of 32-byte-aligned blocks, and instructions are not allowed to straddle these blocks.&lt;ref name=nacl_paper/&gt; Because of these constraints, C and C++ code must be recompiled to run under Native Client, which provides customized versions of the [[GNU toolchain]], specifically [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), [[GNU Binutils]], and [[LLVM]].

Native Client is licensed under a [[BSD licenses|BSD-style license]].

Native Client uses [[Newlib]] as its [[C standard library|C library]], but a port of [[GNU C Library]] (GNU libc) is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.chrome.com/native-client/devguide/devcycle/building |title=Native Client: Building |publisher=developer.chrome.com |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pepper==
{{See also|NPAPI#PPAPI}}
NaCl denotes [[sodium chloride]], common table [[salt]]; as a [[pun]], the name of [[black pepper|pepper]] was also used. Pepper API is a cross-platform, open-source API for creating Native Client modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/overview|title=Technical Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pepper Plugin API, or PPAPI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/pepper_stable/index |title=Pepper Plugin API project at |publisher=Google |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/ppapi/ |title=Chrome Source: Index of /trunk/src/ppapi |publisher=Src.chromium.org |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a cross-platform API for Native Client-secured web browser plugins, first based on Netscape's [[NPAPI]], then rewritten from scratch. It is currently used in Chromium and [[Google Chrome]] to enable the PPAPI version of [[Adobe Flash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.chromium.org/2012/08/the-road-to-safer-more-stable-and.html |title=The road to safer, more stable, and flashier Flash |publisher=Google |date=8 August 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the built-in [[PDF]] viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Metz |first=Cade |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/18/chrome_dev_builds_get_built_in_pdf_reader/ |title=Google hugs Adobe harder with Chrome-PDF merge |publisher=The Register |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PPAPI===
On 12 August 2009, a page on Google Code introduced a new project, Pepper, and the associated Pepper Plugin API (PPAPI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/getting-started/getting-started-background-and-basics#TOC-Pepper-Plugin-API-PPAPI- |title=Getting Started: Background and Basics – The Chromium Projects |publisher=Chromium.org |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "a set of modifications to NPAPI to make plugins more portable and more secure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Comment by t.hajdu....@gmail.com |url=https://code.google.com/p/ppapi/wiki/Concepts |title=Pepper.wiki |publisher=Google |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extension is designed specifically to ease implementing out-of-[[process (computing)|process]] plugin execution. Further, the goals of the project are to provide a framework for making plugins fully cross-platform. Topics considered include:
*Uniform semantics for NPAPI across browsers.
*Execution in a separate process from the renderer-browser.
*Standardize rendering using the browser's compositing process.
*Defining standardized events, and 2D rasterizing functions.
*Initial attempt to provide 3D graphics access.
*Plugin registry.

The continuously evolving Pepper API also supports [[Gamepad]]s (version 19) and [[WebSocket]]s (version 18).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/sdk/release-notes|title=Release Notes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2010|5|13}}, Google's open source browser, [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]], was the only web browser to use the new browser plug-in model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Metz |first=Cade |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/13/google_native_client_sdk/ |title=Google heats up native code for Chrome OS |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2015, Pepper is supported by Chrome, Chromium and Blink layout engine-based browsers such as Opera.

==== PPAPI in Firefox ====

[[Mozilla Firefox]] stated in 2014 that they would not support Pepper, as there is no full specification of the API beyond its implementation in Chrome, which itself is designed for use with [[Blink layout engine]] only, and has private APIs specific to the Flash Player plugin which are not documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zbarsky|first1=Boris|title=Bug 729481 - Support the "Pepper" Plugin api|url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=729481#c83|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 Mozilla announced that it had re-considered and was exploring whether to incorporate the Pepper API and PDFium in future releases of Firefox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Metz |first=Cade |url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mortar_Project |title=Project Mortar |publisher=Mozilla |date=3 October 2016 |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however no such steps were taken.

==Applications==
One website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://play.golang.org|title=The Go Playground|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses NaCL on the server to let users experiment with the [[Go programming language]] from their browsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.golang.org/playground#TOC_3.|title=Inside the Go Playground - The Go Blog|website=blog.golang.org|access-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Some groups of browser developers support the Native Client technology, but others do not.

===Supporters===
Chad Austin (of [[IMVU]]) praised the way Native Client can bring high-performance applications to the web (with about 5% penalty compared to native code) in a secure way, while also accelerating the evolution of client-side applications by giving a choice of the programming language used (besides [[JavaScript]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Austin |first=Chad |url=http://chadaustin.me/2011/01/in-defense-of-language-democracy/ |title=Chad Austin: In Defense of Language Democracy (Or: Why the Browser Needs a Virtual Machine) |publisher=Chadaustin.me |date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Id Software]]'s [[John D. Carmack]] praised Native Client at [[QuakeCon]] 2012, saying: "if you have to do something inside a browser, Native Client is much more interesting as something that started out as a really pretty darn clever x86 hack in the way that they could sandbox all of this in user mode interestingly. It's now dynamic recompilation, but something that you program in C or C++ and it compiles down to something that's going to be not your -O4 optimization level for completely native code but pretty damn close to native code. You could do all of your evil pointer chasings, and whatever you want to do as a to-the-metal game developer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carmack |first=John |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt-iVFxgFWk&amp;t=2h36m18s |title=QuakeCon 2012 |publisher=youtube.com |date=3 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detractors===

Other IT professionals are more critical of this sandboxing technology as it has substantial or substantive interoperability issues.

[[Mozilla]]'s vice president of products, [[Jay Sullivan]], said that Mozilla has no plans to run native code inside the browser, as "These native apps are just little black boxes in a webpage. [...] We really believe in HTML, and this is where we want to focus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Metz |first=Cade |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/24/jay_sullivan_on_firefox/ |title=Mozilla: Our browser will not run native code |publisher=The Register |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozilla's [[Christopher Blizzard]] criticized NaCl, claiming that native code cannot evolve in the same way that the source code-driven web can. He also compared NaCl to Microsoft's [[ActiveX]] technology, plagued with [[DLL Hell]].&lt;ref name="Register"/&gt;

[[Håkon Wium Lie]], Opera's CTO, believes that "NaCl seems to be 'yearning for the bad old days, before the web'", and that "Native Client is about building a new platform – or porting an old platform into the web [...] it will bring in complexity and security issues, and it will take away focus from the web platform."&lt;ref name="Register"/&gt;

==Second Generation==
Second Generation of [[Sandbox (computer security)|Sandbox]]ing developed in Google is gVisor.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17810591&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/google/gvisor&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to replace NaCl in [[Google Cloud Platform|Google Cloud]], to be more exact in [[Google App Engine]].

==Career==
Demsetz grew up on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago, the grandchild of immigrants from central and eastern Europe. He  studied engineering, forestry, and philosophy at four universities before being awarded a B.A. (1953) in economics from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], and an MBA (1954) and a Ph.D. (1959) from [[Northwestern University]]. While a graduate student, he published an article each in ''[[Econometrica]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''.

Demsetz taught at the [[University of Michigan]] (1958–60), UCLA, 1960–63, and the Graduate School of Business at the [[University of Chicago]], 1963–71. In 1971, he returned permanently to UCLA's Economics Department, which he chaired 1978–80. He held the Arthur Andersen UCLA Alumni Chair in Business Economics, 1986–95. He has been affiliated with the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] and the [[Hoover Institution]].

Demsetz is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a director of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], and a past (1996) president of the Western Economics Association.

==Work==
Demsetz belongs to the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] of economic theory, and was one of the pioneers of the approach now called [[New Institutional Economics]]. He is a founder of the field of [[managerial economics]]. He has expanded the theory of [[property rights]] now prevalent in [[law and economics]]. Even though Demsetz never employed [[game theory]], he is a major figure in [[industrial organization]] through his writings on the [[theory of the firm]], [[antitrust law|antitrust policy]], and business [[regulation]]. His expository style is devoid of mathematical formalism to an extent unusual for someone who began his career after 1950. His principal influences include [[Frank Knight]] and a number of colleagues: [[Armen Alchian]], [[Ronald Coase]], [[Aaron Director]], and [[George Stigler]].

Demsetz was the first to propose [[emissions trading]] as a way of giving polluters an economic incentive to reduce their [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] of [[pollutant]]s. He coined the term "[[nirvana fallacy]]" in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Demsetz |first=Harold |authorlink= |year=1969 |title=Information and Efficiency: Another Viewpoint |journal=Journal of Law &amp; Economics |volume=12 |issue= |pages=1–22 |url= |doi=10.1086/466657 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/08/06/peter-t-leeson/anarchy-unbound-or-why-self-governance-works-better-than-you-think/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Darüber hinaus legte Demsetz in der Regulierungstheorie die formalen Grundsteine für eine zeitweise Versteigerung von [[natürliches Monopol|natürlichen Monopolen]]. Seine Arbeiten können als frühe Ansätze der [[Theorie der bestreitbaren Märkte]] angesehen werden.--&gt;

The 1972 Demsetz and [[Armen Alchian]] article ''Production, Information Costs and Economic Organization'' was selected as one of the twenty most important articles published in the first century of the ''American Economic Review''.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.101.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heinrich Friedrich Ernst Blücher''' (29 January 1899 &amp;ndash; 30 October 1970) was a [[Germany|German]] [[poet]] and [[philosopher]]. He was the second husband of [[Hannah Arendt]].

Blücher was born in [[Berlin]]. He was a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] until 1928, but soon rejected [[Stalinism]] and left the party in protest of its Stalinist policies. He then became a member of a small [[anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] group called the [[Communist Party Opposition]].

As a Communist (albeit anti-Stalinist), Blücher, had to flee Germany following the rise of [[National Socialism]]. He married Hannah Arendt in [[France]], and they emigrated to [[New York City]] in 1941.

Heinrich Blücher began teaching philosophy at [[Bard College]] in 1952, continuing for seventeen years, as well as at the [[New School for Social Research]]. Blücher died in New York. His wife [[Hannah Arendt]] was later buried alongside him at [[Bard College]] Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;

Blücher encouraged his wife to become involved with [[Marxism]] and political theory, though ultimately her use of [[Karl Marx]] was in no way orthodox, as shown in such works as ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'' (1958). Blücher also coined the term "the anti-political principle" to describe [[totalitarianism]]'s destruction of a ''space of resistance'' — a term taken up both by Arendt and [[Karl Jaspers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Mommsen]], "Interpretation of the Holocaust as a Challenge to Human Existence", in ''Arendt in Jerusalem'', ed. Ascheim, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13033">In [[logic]], an '''infinite-valued logic''' (or '''real-valued logic''' or '''infinitely many-valued logic''') is a [[many-valued logic]] in which [[truth values]] comprise a [[continuous or discrete variable|continuous]] range. Traditionally, in [[Aristotle's logic]], logic other than [[principle of bivalence|bivalent logic]] was the norm, as the [[law of the excluded middle]] precluded more than two possible values (i.e., "true" and "false") for any [[proposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Weisstein| first=Eric| title=Law of the Excluded Middle| publisher=MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource| year=2018| url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LawoftheExcludedMiddle.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[three-valued logic]] (ternary logic) allows for an additional possible truth value (i.e., "undecided")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Weisstein| first=Eric| title=Three-Valued Logic| publisher=MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource| year=2018| url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Three-ValuedLogic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an example of [[finite-valued logic]] in which truth values are discrete, rather than continuous. Infinite-valued logic comprises continuous [[fuzzy logic]], though fuzzy logic in some of its forms can further encompass finite-valued logic. For example, finite-valued logic can be applied in [[Boolean-valued model|Boolean-valued modeling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Klawltter| first=Warren A.| work=Theses and Dissertations, paper 2025| year=1976| publisher=Lehigh Preserve| title=Boolean values for fuzzy sets| url=https://preserve.lehigh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3025&amp;context=etd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=4th Serbian-Hungarian Joint Symposium on Intelligent Systems| last=Perović| first=Aleksandar| title=Fuzzy Sets – a Boolean Valued Approach| publisher=Conferences and Symposia @ Óbuda University| year=2006| url=http://conf.uni-obuda.hu/sisy2006/28_Perovic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[description logic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=International Journal of Approximate Reasoning| volume=55| issue=9| pages=1890-1916| year=2014| last1=Cerami| first1=Marco| last2=García-Cerdaña| first2=Àngel| last3=Esteva| first3=Frances| title=On finitely-valued Fuzzy Description Logics| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X13002132}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[defuzzification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Schockaert| first1=Steven| last2=Janssen| first2=Jeroen| last3=Vermeir| first3=Dirk| work=Journal of Automated Reasoning| volume=49| issue=4| pages=493–550| year=2012| title=Satisfiability Checking in Łukasiewicz Logic as Finite Constraint Satisfaction| url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10817-011-9227-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Fuzzy Logic| title=1.4.4 Defuzzification| page=4| publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich| year=2014| url=http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~apnoco/Script/15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; of fuzzy logic.

== History ==

[[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] used both [[infinity|infinities]] and [[infinitesimals]] to develop the differential and integral [[calculus]] in the late [[17th century]]. [[Richard Dedekind]], who defined [[real number]]s in terms of [[construction of the real numbers#Construction_by_Dedekind_cuts|certain sets]] of [[rational number]]s in the [[19th century]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Jones| first=Roger Bishop| year=1996| title=Real Numbers - some history| url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/maths/math008.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; also developed an axiom of [[law of continuity|continuity]] stating that a single correct value exists at the limit of any [[trial and error]] [[approximation#Mathematics|approximation]]. [[Felix Hausdorff]] demonstrated the logical possibility of an [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]] ordering of words comprising bivalent values, each word having [[absolute infinite|absolutely infinite]] length, in 1938. However, the definition of a random real number, meaning a real number that has no finite description whatsoever, remains somewhat in the realm of [[paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Princeton University Press| last=Rucker| first=Rudy| title= Infinity and the Mind| url=http://www.rudyrucker.com/infinityandthemind/#calibre_link-311 |section=sections 311 "Infinitesimals and Surreal Numbers" and 317 "Random Reals"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jan Łukasiewicz]] developed a system of three-valued logic in 1920. He generalized the system to many-valued logics in 1922 and went on to develop [[Łukasiewicz logic|logic]]s with [[aleph number|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;]] (infinite within a range) truth values. [[Kurt Gödel]] developed a [[Gödel logic|deductive system]], applicable for both finite- and infinite-valued [[first-order logic]] (a formal logic in which a [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] can refer to a single [[proposition|subject]]) as well as for [[intermediate logic]] (a formal [[intuitionistic logic]] usable to provide proofs such as a [[dialectica interpretation|consistency proof]] for [[arithmetic]]), and showed in 1932 that [[logical intuition]] cannot be characterized by [[finite-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| work=The Development of Modern Logic| last1=Mancosu| first1=Paolo| last2=Zach| first2=Richard| last3=Badesa| first3=Calixto| title=9. The Development of Mathematical Logic from Russell to Tarski 1900-1935| section=7.2 Many-valued logics| publisher=Oxford University Press| pages=418-420| year=2004| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jXavKsArnIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of expressing truth values as real numbers in the range between 0 and 1 can bring to mind the possibility of using [[complex number]]s to express truth values. These truth values would have an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] dimension, for example between 0 and  {{math|''i''}}. Two- or higher-dimensional truth could potentially be useful in systems of [[paraconsistent logic]]. If practical applications were to arise for such systems, [[multidimensional system|multidimensional]] infinite-valued logic could develop as a concept independent of real-valued logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Gershenson| first=Carlos| title=Multidimensional Logic: A model for Paraconsistent Logic| publisher=Cogprints Cognitive Sciences EPrint Archive| url=http://cogprints.org/1479/1/mdl.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] proposed a formal methodology of [[fuzzy logic]] and its applications in the early 1970s. By 1973, other researchers were applying the theory of Zadeh fuzzy controllers to various mechanical and industrial processes. The fuzzy modeling concept that evolved from this research was applied to neural networks in the 1980s and to machine learning in the 1990s. The formal methodology also led to generalizations of mathematical theories in the family of [[t-norm fuzzy logics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Garrido| first=Angel| title=A Brief History of Fuzzy Logic| publisher=Revista EduSoft| year=2012| url=https://www.edusoft.ro/brain/index.php/brain/article/viewFile/308/390}}, Editorial&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
	
Basic [[fuzzy logic]] is the logic of continuous [[t-norm]]s ([[binary operation]]s on the real unit interval [0, 1]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Soft Computing| volume=4| issue=2| pages=106–112| year=2000| last1=Cignoli| first1=R.| last2=Esteva| first2=F| last3=Godo| first3=L.| last4=Torrens| first4=A.| title=Basic Fuzzy Logic is the logic of continuous t-norms and their residua| publisher=Springer International Publishing AG| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s005000000044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications involving [[fuzzy logic]] include [[facial recognition system]]s, [[home appliance]]s, [[anti-lock braking system]]s, [[automatic transmission]]s, controllers for [[rapid transit]] systems and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, [[knowledge-based]] and [[engineering optimization]] systems, [[weather forecasting]], [[pricing]], and [[risk assessment]] [[systems modeling|modeling system]]s, [[medical diagnosis]] and treatment planning and [[commodity market|commodities]] trading systems, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Advances in Fuzzy Systems| volume=2013| last1=Singh| first1=Harpreet| last2=Gupta| first2=Madan M.| last3=Meitzler| first3=Thomas| last4=Hou| first4=Zeng-Guang| last5=Garg| first5=Kum Kum| last6=Solo| first6=Ashu M. G.| title=Real-Life Applications of Fuzzy Logic| publisher=Hindawi| year=2013| url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/afs/2013/581879/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuzzy logic is used to optimize efficiency in [[thermostat]]s for control of heating and cooling, for industrial [[automation]] and [[process control]], [[computer animation]], [[signal processing]], and [[data analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Klingenberg| first=Bryan| title=Fuzzy Logic Applications| publisher=Calvin College Engineering Department| url=https://www.calvin.edu/~pribeiro/othrlnks/Fuzzy/apps.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuzzy logic has made significant contributions in the fields of [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Fuzzy Sets and Systems| volume=156| year=2005| pages=387–406| last=Hüllermeier| first=Eyke| title=Fuzzy methods in machine learning and data mining: Status and prospects| publisher=Elsevier| url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6b96/b2b2b252bdd0502d2a2e03ae8ae009bc77a1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[infinitary logic]], degrees of provability of propositions can be expressed in terms of infinite-valued logic that can be described via evaluated formulas, written as ordered pairs each consisting of a truth degree symbol and a formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Many-Valued Logics| last=Gottwald| first=Siegfried| title=12. Pavelka Style Extensions| pages=40-41| publisher=philpapers.org| year=2005| url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/be53/749719383724aff246f656a73e8a2c1ce702.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], number-free semantics can express facts about classical mathematical notions and make them derivable by logical deductions in infinite-valued logic. [[T-norm fuzzy logic]]s can be applied to eliminate references to real numbers from definitions and theorems, in order to simplify certain mathematical concepts and facilitate certain generalizations. A framework employed for number-free formalization of mathematical concepts is known as fuzzy class theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Běhounek| first=Libor| title=Number-free Mathematics Based on T-norm Fuzzy Logic| publisher=University of Ostrava| year=2009| url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/284d/5342de90884fae07eaabe4a295e745af419b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical questions, including the [[Sorites paradox]], have been considered based on an infinite-valued logic known as fuzzy [[epistemicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| work=Cuts and Clouds| last=MacFarlane| first=John| title=Fuzzy Epistemicism| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2010| url=https://johnmacfarlane.net/fuzzy-epistemicism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sorites paradox suggests that if adding a grain of sand to something that is not a heap cannot create a heap, then a heap of sand cannot be created. A stepwise approach toward a limit, in which truth is gradually "leaked", tends to refute that suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Synthese| volume=134| issue=3| year=2003| pages=363-387| last=Paoli| first=Francesco| title=A Really Fuzzy Approach to the Sorites Paradox| publisher=Springer International Publishing AG| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1022995202767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of [[logic]] itself, infinite-valued logic has served as an aid to understand the nature of the human understanding of logical concepts. [[Kurt Gödel]] attempted to comprehend the human ability for [[logical intuition]] in terms of finite-valued logic before concluding that the ability is based on infinite-valued logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Burgess| first=John| title=Intuitions of Three Kinds in Gödel's Views on the Continuum| url=https://www.princeton.edu/~jburgess/Goedel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open questions remain regarding the handling, in [[natural language]] semantics, of indeterminate truth values.&lt;ref&gt;"The moral: an adequate theory must allow our statements involving the notion of truth to be risky: they risk being paradoxical if the empirical facts are extremely (and unexpectedly) unfavorable. There can be no syntactic or semantic 'sieve' that will winnow out the 'bad' cases while preserving the 'good' ones. ... I  am somewhat uncertain whether there is a definite factual question as to whether natural language handles truth-value gaps &amp;mdash; at least those arising in connection with the semantic paradoxes &amp;mdash; by the schemes of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]], [[Bas van Fraassen|van Fraassen]], or perhaps some other." {{cite journal| work=The Journal of Philosophy| volume=72| number=19| pages=690-716| year=1975| last=Kripke| first=Saul| title=Outline of a Theory of Truth| publisher=Polish Institute of Mathematics| url=https://www.impan.pl/~kz/truthseminar/Kripke_Outline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intellectual honesty''' is an applied method of [[problem solving]], characterized by an unbiased, honest attitude, which can be demonstrated in a number of different ways:

* One's personal faith does not interfere with the pursuit of truth;
* Relevant facts and information are not purposefully omitted even when such things may contradict one's [[hypothesis]];
* Facts are presented in an unbiased manner, and not twisted to give misleading impressions or to support one view over another;
* References, or earlier work, are acknowledged where possible, and [[plagiarism]] is avoided.

Harvard [[ethicist]] Louis M. Guenin describes the "kernel" of intellectual honesty to be "a virtuous disposition to eschew deception when given an incentive for deception".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guenin|first1=Louis M.|title=Candor in Science: Intellectual Honesty|journal=Synthese|date=1 June 2005|volume=145|issue=2|page=179|doi=10.1007/s11229-005-3746-3|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-005-6952-0|language=en|issn=0039-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intentionally committed [[Fallacy|fallacies]] in debates and reasoning are called '''intellectual dishonesty'''.

'''Johannes Clauberg''' (24 February 1622 – 31 January 1665) was a [[German people|German]] [[Theology|theologian]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]]. Clauberg was the founding [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the first [[University of Duisburg]], where he taught from 1655 to 1665. He is known as a "scholastic cartesian".

== Biography ==

He was born in [[Solingen]], and educated in the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tradition in Köln, Moers and Bremen, then in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], where he discovered what came to be called the reformed variation of Aristotelianism. He gave his first disputations in Groningen under the supervision of Tobias Andreae. His first treatise in metaphysics was written in those student years: ''Elementa philosophiae sive Ontosophia'' (1647). Travelling in France and England, he came to study the Cartesian philosophy under [[Johannes de Raey]] at [[Leiden]]. In 1649, he became professor of philosophy and theology at [[Herborn (Hesse)|Herborn]], but subsequently (1651), in consequence of the jealousy of his colleagues, accepted an invitation to a similar post at Duisburg.

Clauberg was one of the earliest teachers of the new doctrines in Germany and an exact and methodical commentator on his masters writings. His theory of the connection between the soul and the body is in some respects analogous to that of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]]; but he is not therefore to be regarded as a true forerunner of [[Occasionalism]], as he uses Occasion for the stimulus which directly produces a mental phenomenon, without postulating the intervention of God.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. H. Müller, ''J. Clauberg und seine Stellung im Cartesianismus''.&lt;/ref&gt; His view of the relation of God to his creatures is held to foreshadow the [[pantheism]] of [[Spinoza]]. All creatures exist only through the continuous creative energy of the Divine Being, and are no more independent of his will than are our thoughts independent of us, or rather less, for there are thoughts which force themselves upon us whether we will or not.

Metaphysics, in Clauberg's conception, studies not the being (ens), but the intelligible, as in the most general object of the intellect (''ens cogitabile''). The most high concept is not being, but the object in general as known to the intellect. For [[metaphysics]] Clauberg suggested the names ''ontosophy or ontology'', the latter being afterwards adopted by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]]. In the prolegomena to his ''Elementa philosophiae sive Ontosophiae'' (1647), Clauberg says:

{{cquote|Since the science which is about God calls itself Theosophy or Theology, it would seem fitting to call Ontosophy or Ontology that science which does not deal with this and that being, as distinct from the others owing to its special name or properties, but with being in general.}}

[[Étienne Gilson]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;In ''L'être et l'essence''. Paris, Vrin, 1948 (English edition: ''Being and some philosophers'', Toronto, Pontifical Institute for Mediaeval Studies, 1952), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|This text may be held, in the present state of historical knowledge, for the birth certificate of ontology as a science conceived after the pattern of theology, yet radically distinct from it, since being qua being is held there as indifferent to all its conceivable determinations. 'There is, Clauberg says, a certain science which envisages being inasmuch as it is being, that is, inasmuch as it is understood to have a certain common nature or degree of being, a degree which is to be found in both corporeal and incorporeal beings, in God and in creatures, in each and every singular being according to its own mode.' Leibniz will later praise Clauberg for such an undertaking, but he will regret that it had not been a more successful one. The very word "ontology" occurs at least once in an undated fragment of Leibniz,&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Couturat]], ''Opuscules et fragments inedits de Leibniz'' (Paris, 1903), p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; and one can expect accidentally to meet it later in various places, but it is not until  1729 that it finally comes into its own with the Ontologia of Christian Wolff."}}

Clauberg died in [[Duisburg]], and lies buried in the city's cathedral.

'''Manly Palmer Hall''' (March 18, 1901&amp;nbsp;– August 29, 1990) was a [[Canadian]]-born [[author]], lecturer, astrologer and [[mysticism|mystic]]. He is best known for his 1928 work ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages''. Over his 70 year career, he gave thousands of lectures, including two at Carnegie Hall, and published over 150 volumes. In 1934, he founded The [[Philosophical Research Society]] in Los Angeles, which he dedicated to the "Truth Seekers of All Time", with a research library, lecture hall and publishing house. Many of his lectures can be found online and his books are still in print.

==Early life==
Manly P. Hall was born in 1901&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gnosticwarrior.com/manly-p-hall|title=Manly P Hall {{!}} GnosticWarrior.com|website=gnosticwarrior.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/secret-teachings-reborn-the-mysterious-life-of-manly-p-hall|title=Secret Teachings Reborn: The Mysterious Life of Manly P. Hall {{!}} New Dawn : The World's Most Unusual Magazine|last=Magazine|first=New Dawn|website=www.newdawnmagazine.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to William S. Hall, a dentist, and Louise Palmer Hall, a [[chiropractor]] and member of the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new.prs.org/about-prs/|title=About {{!}} Philosophical Research Society|website=new.prs.org|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 Hall, who never knew his father, moved from [[Canada]] to [[Los Angeles, California]], with his maternal grandmother to reunite with his birth mother, who was living in Santa Monica, and was almost immediately drawn to the arcane world of mysticism, esoteric philosophies, and their underlying principles. Hall delved deeply into "teachings of lost and hidden traditions, the golden verses of Hindu gods, Greek philosophers and Christian mystics, and the spiritual treasures waiting to be found within one's own soul."  Less than a year later, Hall booked his first lecture, and the topic was [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="Sahagun"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15–18}}

He soon took over as preacher of the Church of the People in 1919, at Trinity Auditorium in downtown Los Angeles. Hall was ordained a minister in the Church of the People on May 17, 1923, and "a few days later, he was elected permanent pastor of the church."&lt;ref name="Sahagun"/&gt;{{rp|28}}

His first publications consisted of two small pamphlets, "The Breastplate of the High Priest" (1920), and "Wands and Serpents."  Between 1921 and 1923 he wrote three books, ''The Initiates of the Flame'' published in October 1922, ''The Ways of the Lonely Ones'' published in 1922, and ''The Lost Keys of Freemasonry'' published in March 1923. Hall did not become a Freemason until 1954, more than thirty years after this book was published.&lt;ref&gt;http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/esoterica/hall_m_p/hall_m_p.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1920s, Carolyn Lloyd and her daughter Estelle—members of a family that controlled a valuable oil field in [[Ventura County, California]]—began "sending a sizeable portion of their oil income to Hall," who used the money to travel and acquire a substantial personal library of ancient literature.&lt;ref name="Sahagun"/&gt;{{rp|38–43}} Hall's "first trip around the world to study the lives, customs and religions of countries in Asia and Europe," which commenced December 5, 1923, was paid for by donations from Carolyn Lloyd and her congregation.&lt;ref name="Sahagun"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

Later in 1928, at the age of 27 years, he published ''An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy: Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages'', which is more commonly referred to as ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages''.&lt;ref name="diamond-Teachings"&gt;&lt;!--n.b.

==''The Secret Teachings of All Ages''==
Hall became sufficiently known and respected as a lecturer and interpreter of the writings of the ancients, and the most useful and practical elements of classical idealism, that he successfully appealed, through advertisements and word of mouth, for funds to finance the book that became ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages - An Encyclopedia Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolic Philosophy'', whose original cost of publication in 1928 was estimated to be $150,000,&lt;ref name="Sahagun"/&gt;{{rp|20–21, 50}} although the price of individual copies varied.  According to original subscription agreements on file at the Philosophical Research Society, editions were sold by subscription for $75 on a pre-publication basis, but "the price of this edition after delivery by the printer is understood to be One Hundred Dollars."  Under the subscription terms, $15 was due at signing of the agreement, and "the balance of Sixty Dollars in four equal monthly payments each."&lt;ref&gt;Several original subscription documents were located by Edie Shapiro, PRS Librarian, on August 6, 2012.  Ms. Shapiro stated: "It appears the price was $50, $75 or $100 (or complimentary, depending)," so an exact accounting of the costs may not be possible to reconstruct.&lt;/ref&gt;  The H.S. Crocker Company of San Francisco agreed to publish the book  "if Hall could secure the interest of book designer John Henry Nash, who once worked as a printer to the Vatican."&lt;ref name="Sahagun"/&gt;{{rp|52}}

After ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' was published, Hall "went from being just another earnest young preacher in the City of Angels to becoming an icon of the increasingly influential metaphysical movement sweeping the country in the 1920s.  His book challenged assumptions about society's spiritual roots and made people look at them in new ways."&lt;ref name="Sahagun"/&gt;{{rp|52}} Hall dedicated ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' to "the proposition that concealed within the emblematic figures, allegories and rituals of the ancients is a secret doctrine concerning the inner mysteries of life, which doctrine has been preserved ''in toto'' among a small band of initiated minds."&lt;ref name="subscribers-Teachings"&gt;{{cite book

==Personal life==
Hall and his followers went to extreme lengths to keep any gossip or information that could tarnish his image from being publicized, and little is known about his first marriage, on April 28, 1930, to Fay B. deRavenne, then 28, who had been his secretary during the preceding five years.  The marriage was not a happy one; his friends never discussed it, and Hall removed virtually all information about her from his papers following her suicide on February 22, 1941.&lt;ref name="Sahagun"/&gt;{{rp|55, 97}}  Following a long friendship, on December 5, 1950, Hall married Marie Schweikert Bauer (following her divorce from George Bauer), and the marriage though stormy was happier than his first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nichols |first=Kimberly |url=http://newtopiamagazine.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/the-maestro-and-the-boy-the-kindness-of-manly-p-hall/ |title=The Maestro and the Boy: The Kindness of Manly P. Hall &amp;#124; Newtopia Magazine |publisher=Newtopiamagazine.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marie Schweikert Bauer Hall died April 21, 2005.&lt;ref name="Sahagun"/&gt;{{rp|120, 127, 133, 278}} She was born on June 24, 1904.

===Career as philosopher===
During the early 1930s, using money from the Lloyds, "Hall traveled to France and England, where he acquired his most extensive collection of rare books and manuscripts in alchemy and esoteric fields from London auctioneer, Sotheby &amp; Company."  Through an agent, due to the depressed economic conditions of the era, Hall was able to buy a substantial number of rare books and manuscripts at reasonable prices.  When Caroline Lloyd died in 1946, she bequeathed Hall a home, $15,000 in cash, and "a roughly $10,000 portion of her estate's annual income from shares in the world's largest oil companies for 38 years."&lt;ref name="Sahagun"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

In 1934, Hall founded the [[Philosophical Research Society]] (PRS) in Los Angeles, California, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization&lt;ref&gt;[http://prs.org/wpcms/?page_id=157 The Philosophical Research Society's Tax Exempt Status] – The Philosophical Research Society's declaration of its 501(c)3 nonprofit status on its website, retrieved December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to the study of religion, mythology, metaphysics, and the occult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prs.org/about.htm |title=About the Philosophical Research Society |accessdate=2008-08-07 |publisher=Philosophical Research Society |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZtkINocD?url=http://www.prs.org/about.htm |archivedate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a Knight Patron of the Masonic Research Group of San Francisco, with which he was associated for a number of years prior to his Masonic affiliations.  On June 28, 1954, Hall initiated as a [[Freemason]] into Jewel Lodge No. 374, San Francisco (now the United Lodge); passed September 20, 1954; and raised November 22, 1954.  He took the Scottish Rite Degrees a year later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manlyphall.org/ The Manly Palmer Hall Archive], retrieved September 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his over 70-year career, Hall delivered approximately 8,000 lectures in the [[United States]] and abroad, authored over 150 books and essays, and wrote countless [[magazine]] articles.  He appears in the introduction to the 1938 film ''[[When Were You Born]]'', a murder mystery that uses astrology as a key plot point.  Hall wrote the original story for the film (screenplay by Anthony Coldeway) and is also credited as the narrator.

In 1942, Manly Hall spoke to an attendance-setting audience at [[Carnegie Hall]], on "The Secret Destiny of America," which later became a book of the same title. He returned in 1945 for another well-attended lecture at the famous venue, titled: "Plato's Prophecy of Worldwide Democracy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/PerformanceHistorySearch/#!search=manly%20p.%20hall |title=Carnegie Hall : Performance History Search |publisher=Carnegiehall.org |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The PRS still maintains a research library of over 50,000 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/lasubject/records/id93.html |title=About the Philosophical Research Society |accessdate=2008-08-07 |work=University of Southern California Archival Research Center: LA as Subject Database |publisher=University of Southern California |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZtkQErVd?url=http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/lasubject/records/id93.html |archivedate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also sells and publishes metaphysical and spiritual books, mostly those authored by Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macraesbluebook.com/search/company.cfm?company=589021 |title=About the Philosophical Research Society |accessdate=2008-08-07 |work=McRae’s Bluebook |publisher=McRae’s Bluebook |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZtkUkewg?url=http://www.macraesbluebook.com/search/company.cfm?company=589021 |archivedate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, some of Manly Hall's rare alchemy books were sold to keep the PRS in operation. "Acquisition of the Manly Palmer Hall Collection in 1995 provided the Getty Research Institute with one of the world's leading collections of alchemy, esoterica, and hermetica."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was reported in 2010 that President Ronald Reagan adopted some ideas and phrasing from Hall’s book ''The Secret Destiny of America'' (1944), using them in speeches and essays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/political-bookworm/2010/04/reagan_and_the_occult.html "Reagan and the Occult" by Mitch Horowitz, ''The Washington Post'', Political Bookworm, April 30th, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HAINZ.JPG|thumbnail|Martin A. Hainz]]
'''Martin Andreas Hainz''' (born March 5, 1974, in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) is an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[philologist]], [[theorist]] and [[philosopher]]. He has taught at several universities in Europe and the [[United States]], among them the universities of Vienna, [[Timişoara]] and [[Iaşi]]. He is a member of the ''Northeastern Language Association'' ([[NEMLA]]). His main interests are contemporary German and especially [[Austrian philosophy]] and [[Austrian literature|literature]]. He is a scholar of [[Wendelin Schmidt-Dengler]].

==Biography==
Hainz's works deal with [[Paul Celan]] and [[Rose Ausländer]] as well as [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]]; he is also considered to be one of today's most important advocates of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Lartillot: ''Martin Hainz – Masken der Mehrdeutigkeit.'' In: Études Germaniques, Nr. 59 (2004): 1, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; His interdisciplinary work has often led to surprising insights; this is especially true concerning Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, who is an ambivalent thinker and poet between sensibility, belief and inspiration. Hainz has shown that, from a dialectical perspective, poetry is the ''rational awareness that is adequate to ([[Jewish]]-[[Christian]]) believing and faith'' (''"Poesie ist also der dem Glauben angemessene Wachzustand"'').

Hainz' researches into some nearly forgotten, but nevertheless important authors and thinkers such as [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], [[Alfred Margul-Sperber]] and [[Constantin Brunner]] are also of merit. He has done important research dealing with [[multiculturalism]] and its opportunities and history in [[Czernowitz]], which is considered to be a paradigm for multicultural societies. These works have led Hainz to some research on translation and its theory; his volume ''Vom Glück sich anzustecken'' (''Being affected by Luck'' or ''The Luck of Being Infected'') has been discussed intensely. [[Vincent Kling (translator)|Vincent Kling]] in his review considered it to be "beyond praise".&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Kling: ''Martin A. Hainz, ed., Vom Glück sich anzustecken'', in Modern Austrian Literature, Vol.39:2, 2006, pp. 102–106: p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Meraj Muhammad Khan was born on 20 October 1938 in [[Farrukhabad]], Uttar Pradesh, [[British Indian Empire]] to an educated Pukhto speaking family of Zakha Khel [[Afridi]] tribe of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin.&lt;ref name="Frontier Post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Naimat Khan|title='His Excellency' Meraj Muhammad Khan|url=http://www.thefrontierpost.com/article/23564/|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=Frontier Post|date=30 June 2013&lt;!-- 09:55:36--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest of four sons and his father, Hakeem Molvi Taj Muhammad Khan, was a [[Homoeopathy|homoeopath]] who practised the methods of [[Unani|Greek medicine]] in [[Quetta]], [[Balochistan Province|Balochistan]].&lt;ref name="Frontier Post"/&gt; His elder brother was the famous renown Pakistani journalist [[Minhaj Barna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspakistan.pk/2011/11/04/A-tribute-to-My-grandfather-Minhaj-Barna/|title=A tribute to: My grandfather – Minhaj Barna|last=Khan|first=Momina|date=2011-11-04|website=News Pakistan|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from local high school in 1956, Khan moved to [[Karachi]] where he attended [[DJ Science College]] and later pursued his higher education at [[Karachi University]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Frontier Post"/&gt; He earned a BA in philosophy and [[humanities]] in 1960, and an MA in philosophy in 1962.&lt;ref name="Frontier Post"/&gt;

===Communism and PPP activism===

He came to public prominence in 1960s while studying at Karachi University. During this time, there was a debating competition in which students from all the colleges of Karachi were participating.&lt;ref name="Marxist News, Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Khan|first=Lal|title=Pakistan's Other Story: 6. Witness to Revolution – Veterans of the 1968–69 upheaval|url=http://www.marxist.com/pakistans-other-story-6.htm|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=Marxist News, Pakistan|date=22 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this competition, some activists of the [[Communist Party of Pakistan|Communist Party]] were sitting in the audience, who asked him to join the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Marxist News, Pakistan"/&gt;

He became an active member of the [[National Students Federation]], eventually becoming NSF's president in 1963. Khan turned the NSF into a militant student political organisation that campaigned for the rights of students.&lt;ref name="Marxist News, Pakistan"/&gt; In 1967, he left the NSF after secretly learning of a socialist convention being held in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].&lt;ref name="Marxist News, Pakistan"/&gt;

He was among those who founded the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) and fully endorsed [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] for the PPP's chairmanship.&lt;ref name="Marxist News, Pakistan"/&gt; Through the PPP, he went into mainstream politics and successfully contested in the [[Pakistani general elections, 1970|1970 general elections]] on a PPP platform from the [[Karachi]] constituency.&lt;ref name="Marxist News, Pakistan"/&gt;

===Labour ministry (1971–1973)===

In December 1971, Khan was appointed [[Ministry of Manpower (Pakistan)|Minister for Manpower]] and directed the [[Ministry of Labour (Pakistan)|Ministry of Labour]] (MoL) in Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]'s government.&lt;ref name="Marxist News, Pakistan"/&gt; In 1972, his tenure saw a [[Karachi labour unrest of 1972|major labour strike]] in Karachi; though it was peacefully resolved by Meraj's intervention.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; It was later reported in [[Pakistani newspapers|newspapers]] and television that the labour strike was actually a competition between two PPP ministers, Meraj and [[Law Minister of Pakistan|Law Minister]] [[Abdul Hafiz Pirzada]] for the control of the labour.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

Meraj's radical leftist group was in direct competition against Law Minister Pirzada's [[Chinese Communist Party|Pro-Peking]] group. However, Meraj's denied all accusations on the television.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=Naveeda|title=Beyond Crisis: Re-evaluating Pakistan|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon [u.k]|isbn=1136517588|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lydM6gRQH6EC&amp;pg=PT321&amp;dq=meraj+muhammad+khan+East+Pakistan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Wxd2UoDpNuiuiAL19IBY&amp;ved=0CEUQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=meraj%20muhammad%20khan%20East%20Pakistan&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Mairaj fell out with the Bhutto government when Bhutto started to compromise on his so-called [[Socialism in Pakistan|Socialist agenda]] and the regime resorted to repressive measures.&lt;ref name="Marxist News, Pakistan"/&gt; As time passee, his differences with Prime Minister Bhutto grew and he left the PPP to reorganise the [[National Students Federation|NSF]]. However, Miraj fell into political isolation, never to regain his political credibility and popularity.&lt;ref name="Marxist News, Pakistan"/&gt;

Commenting on PPP, Meraj later revealed that "the radical (leftist) rhetoric was more than a mask designed to win and retain power."&lt;ref name=Scribner&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Tariq|title=The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power|year=2008|publisher=Scribner|location=New York [u.s.]|isbn=1471105881|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SELWCgBjYSwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA1950&amp;dq=meraj+mohamed+khan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_RZ2UtyDDcGligKV2oCQBA&amp;ved=0CFUQuwUwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=meraj%20mohamed%20khan&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; He once said: "[[Ali Bhutto]] was a great man&amp;nbsp;... but he could be cruel."&lt;ref name="Sixth hour"&gt;{{cite web|last=Allam|first=Zalan|title=Understanding Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,|url=http://sixhour.com/understanding%20zulfiqar%20ali%20bhutto.htm|publisher=Sixth hour|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908032638/http://sixhour.com/understanding%20zulfiqar%20ali%20bhutto.htm|archivedate=8 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political activism (1980s-until his death)===

After leaving the PPP, he became a prominent democratic activist and leftist leader of the [[Movement for Restoration of Democracy]] (MRD) opposing the [[Zia regime|military government]] of [[President of Pakistan|President]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]].&lt;ref name="Pakistan Herald"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakistan Herald|title=Details of Meraj Muhammad Khan|url=http://www.pakistanherald.com/Profile/Meraj-Muhammad-Khan-792|work=Pakistan Herald|publisher=Pakistan Herald|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awami Insaf and the birth of PTI Basic Programme===

In 1998, he joined the center-left/centrist [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] (PTI) headed by [[Imran Khan]], but resigned from the party in 2003, citing differences with Khan.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Herald"/&gt; He then joined the [[Mazdoor Kisan Party]], which later merged with the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]] to form the [[Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party]].&lt;ref name="Pakistan Herald"/&gt; He died in Karachi on 21 July 2016.&lt;ref name="thenews.com.pk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/136653-Senior-politician-Meraj-Muhammad-Khan-passes-away|title=Senior politician Meraj Muhammad Khan passes away|work=thenews.com.pk|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2620">A '''Morton's fork''' is a type of [[false dilemma]] in which contradictory observations lead to the same conclusion. It is said to have originated with the collecting of taxes by [[John Morton (bishop)|John Morton]].

The earliest known use of the term dates from the mid-19th century and the only known earlier mention is a claim by [[Francis Bacon]] of an extant tradition.&lt;ref name="ODPF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O214-MortonsFork.html |title=Morton's Fork |work=Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilemma==
Under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] John Morton was made archbishop of Canterbury in 1486, then Lord Chancellor in 1487. He raised taxation funds for his king by holding that someone living modestly must be saving money and, therefore, could afford taxes, whereas someone living extravagantly obviously was rich and, therefore, could afford taxes.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Morton's-Fork | title=Morton's Fork | publisher=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODPF"/&gt;

In some instances, such as Morton's original use of the fallacy, it may be that one of the two observations is probably valid, but the other is pure [[Sophism | sophistry]]: evidence of possessing wealth may be genuinely irrelevant to having a source of taxable income.

In other cases, it may be that neither observation may be relied upon to support the conclusion properly. For example, asserting that a person suspected of a crime who is acting nervously must have something to feel guilty about, while a person who acts calmly and confidently must be practised or skilled at hiding guilt. Either observation therefore has little, if any, [[relevance (law)|probative]] value, as each could equally be evidence for the opposite conclusion.

==Examples==
"[[Morton's fork coup]]" is a maneuver in the game of [[Contract bridge|bridge]] that uses the principle of Morton's Fork.&lt;ref&gt;Frey et al. (1976). ''The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge'', p. 295. {{ISBN|0-517-52724-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Robert. [[The Bridge World]], March 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of the television series ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'' is entitled "[[Morton's Fork (Fargo)|Morton's Fork]]", after the dilemma. It is also mentioned in NCIS Los Angeles season 5 episode 16, "Fish Out of Water."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">'''Noology''' derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]] words νοῦς, ''[[nous]]'' or "mind" and λόγος, ''[[logos]]''. Noology thus outlines a systematic study and organization of thought, knowledge and the mind.

==Overview==
In the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] uses "noology" synonymously with [[rationalism]], distinguishing it from [[empiricism]]: {{quote|[Philosophers have differed from each other with] respect to the origin of [[pure reason|pure rational knowledge]], and as to whether it is derived from experience, or has its origin independently of experience, in reason. [[Aristotle]] may be considered as the head of the empiricists, [[Plato]] of the noologists. [[John Locke|Locke]], who in modern times followed Aristotle, and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who followed Plato (though at a sufficient distance from his mystical system), have not been able to bring this dispute to any conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason''. Trans. Marcus Weigelt and Max Muller (A854, A855). London: Penguin Books, 2007. Page numbers are Weigelt's marginal numbers that refer to the page numbers of the standard edition of ''Kritik der reinen Vernunft''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Spanish philosopher [[Xavier Zubiri]] developed his own notion of noology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]], ''Phenomenology World-wide: Foundations — Expanding Dynamics — Life-Engagements: A Guide for Research and Study'', Springer, 2002, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used to describe the science of intellectual phenomena. It is the study of images of thought, their emergence, their genealogy, and their creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jamie Murray | title = Nome law: Deleuze &amp; Guattari on the emergence of law | journal = International Journal for the Semiotics of Law | volume = 19 | issue = 2 |date=June 2006 | doi = 10.1007/s11196-006-9014-0 | pages =127–151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Greenspan graduated from [[Barnard College]], [[Barnard College#Relationship with Columbia University|Columbia University]] summa cum laude with a B.A. in philosophy in 1966.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://faculty.philosophy.umd.edu/PGreenspan/Res/cv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 she received her Ph.D. from the [[Harvard University]] Philosophy Department, receiving the Emily and Charles Carrier Award for the best dissertation in moral philosophy.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt;  She then moved to an Assistant Professor position at the [[University of Chicago]], where in 1979 she was awarded tenure and promoted to Associate Professor in the Department of Philosophy and the College.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt;  In 1980 she accepted an offer from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], where she was promoted to full Professor in 1989.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt; Greenspan served as an [[Andrew Mellon]] Fellow at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] for the 1975-76 year,&lt;ref name=cv /&gt; and has received several research fellowships, including from the National Endowment for the Humanities (1983–84),&lt;ref&gt;[https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?q=1&amp;a=0&amp;n=1&amp;ln=Greenspan&amp;fn=Patricia&amp;o=0&amp;k=0&amp;f=0&amp;s=0&amp;p=0&amp;d=0&amp;y=0&amp;prd=0&amp;cov=0&amp;prz=0&amp;wp=0&amp;pg=0&amp;ob=year&amp;or=DESC.

==Research areas==
Greenspan’s principal research interests lie in [[moral philosophy]], [[moral psychology]], and the [[philosophy of action]].&lt;ref name=obio&gt;{{cite web|title=Patricia S. Greenspan {{!}} Department of Philosophy|url=http://philosophy.umd.edu/people/greenspan|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has ranged among several interconnected subtopics, as follows:

*[[Deontic logic]]: Greenspan’s Ph.D. dissertation and her first published article dealt with the logic of ought-judgments, arguing that “oughts” are “time-bound” and that wide-scope conditional ought-judgments allow for detachment only when their antecedents are no longer avoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Derived Obligation: Some Paradoxes Escaped (unpublished Ph.D. Dissertation, Harvard, 1972); “Conditional Oughts and Hypothetical Imperatives,” Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 259-76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Free will]] and [[moral responsibility]]: Greenspan’s second major article and ongoing work argues that freedom depends on the difficulty of doing otherwise, rather than simply ability, and hence admits of degrees.&lt;ref&gt;“Behavior Control and Freedom of Action,” Philosophical Review, 87 (1978), 225-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  Greenspan’s developed view also distinguishes between freedom and responsibility, arguing that the compatibility of responsibility with free will does not imply a similar compatibilist view of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;“Free Will and Rational Coherency,” Philosophical Issues, 22 (2012), 185-200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Greenspan has applied some of her work on these subjects to questions arising from the U.S. Genome Project and to the issue of the responsibility of psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;"Free Will and the Genome Project," Philosophy and Public Affairs, 22 (1993), 31-4; "Responsible Psychopaths," Philosophical Psychology, 16 (2003), 417-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Emotion]]:  Greenspan next began a long-running project on the rational and moral role of emotion with the publication of an article defending the rationality of ambivalent emotions in an argument designed to cast doubt on attempts by several contemporary philosophers to equate emotions with evaluative judgments or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;“A Case of Mixed Feelings: Ambivalence and the Logic of Emotion,” in A. O. Rorty (ed.), Explaining Emotions (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980), pp. 191-204&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first book argues instead that emotions amount to feelings with an evaluative intentional content short of belief that makes them both susceptible to a distinctive kind of rational assessment and important in a distinctive way to rational and moral motivation, paradoxically serving as a counterforce to weakness of will.&lt;ref&gt;Emotions and Reasons: An Inquiry into Emotional Justification (New York: Routledge, Chapman and Hall, 1988). [0-413-90049-2]. Cf. M. K. Morris, ”Review of Emotions and Reasons by Patricia S. Greenspan,” Noûs, 26 (1992), 250-252; B. N. G., “Review of Emotions and Reasons: an Inquiry into Emotional Justification by Patricia S. Greenspan, Philosophical Quarterly, 46 (1996), 281-282.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second book and some later essays simplify this account, defend it against some common objections, and apply it to further issues, as outlined below.
*[[ethical dilemma|Moral dilemmas]]: In an essay and in her second book Greenspan argues for the coherency of irresolvable moral dilemmas, cases in which all alternatives are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Practical Guilt: Moral Dilemmas, Emotions, and Social Norms (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995); cf.  “Moral Dilemmas and Guilt,” Philosophical Studies, 43 (1983), 117–125.  Also, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-dilemmas; T. McConnell, “Review of P.S. Greenspan’s Practical Guilt,” Ethics, 106 (1996), 854-856.&lt;/ref&gt;  She sees dilemmas as a result of the need to establish the motivational force of morality by forging a connection in childhood between emotions and rules simple enough to be learned at that early stage.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. “Learning Emotions and Ethics,” in P. Goldie (ed.), Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Emotion, pp. 539-59 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Metaethics]]: Greenspan defends what she calls a “social artifact” version of moral realism, in which morality is invented, yet “real” (in the sense of mind-independent) insofar as it reflects the requisites of life in a viable social group.&lt;ref&gt;Practical Guilt; cf. "Moral Responses and Moral Theory: Socially-Based Externalist Ethics," Journal of Ethics, 2 (1998), 103-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  She sees emotion as essential to the motivational force of moral judgments in general terms, though not necessarily on each occasion of use or for every agent.  She thus departs from contemporary “internalist” understandings of moral meaning that deny the possibility of understanding a moral judgment without being motivated by it.
*[[Practical reason]]s and [[rationality]]: Greenspan argues that emotions play a significant role in rational thought, as noted.&lt;ref&gt;For simpler reworking of her original argument cf. “Emotional Strategies and Rationality,”  Ethics, 110 (2000), 469-87; “Emotions, Rationality, and Mind/Body,” Philosophy, 52 (2003), 113-25; "Practical Reasoning and Emotion," in A. Mele and P. Rawling (eds.), Oxford Handbook of Rationality (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004); “Craving the Right: Emotions and Moral Reasons,” in C. Bagnoli (ed.), Morality and the Emotions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent work she gives an independent account of practical reasons as registering or responding to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;"Practical Reasons and Moral 'Ought'," in Russ Schafer-Landau (ed.), Oxford Studies in Metaethics, Vol. II (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 172-94; cf. "Asymmetrical Reasons," in M. E. Reicher and J. C. Marek (eds.), Experience and Analysis: Proceedings of the 27th International Wittgenstein Symposium (Vienna: oebv&amp;hpt, 2005), pp. 387-94.&lt;/ref&gt;  The account allows for the rational permissibility in certain cases of action against one’s strongest reason and is brought to bear on issues including the rationality of "satisficing" (choosing less than the best) and the notion of “imperfect” obligation (an obligation that leaves room for options).&lt;ref&gt;“Resting Content: Sensible Satisficing?,” American Philosophical Quarterly, Special Issue on Rationality, 46 (2009), 305-17; "Making Room for Options: Moral Reasons, Imperfect Duties, and Choice," Social Philosophy and Policy, 27 (2010), 181-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">'''Pride Cymru''' (previously '''Cardiff Mardi Gras''') is a [[Pride]] festival held annually in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. 

The first Cardiff Mardi Gras took place in [[Bute Park]], Cardiff, in September 1999. The event was an immediate success with over 5,000 attending.{{fact|date=October 2017}} By 2001, the number of attendees had grown to 20,000.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pridecymru.co.uk/about/ | title=About | work=Pride Cymru | location=UK | accessdate=2016-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2016pics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/best-pictures-pride-cymru-festival-11746182|title=The best pictures from the Pride Cymru festival 2016|publisher=[[Wales Online]]|author=Liz Day|date=14 August 2016|access-date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 event was cancelled owing to lack of support, but it has been held every year from 2009.{{fact|date=October 2017}} Cardiff Mardi Gras became a registered charity in 2010 and changed its name to Pride Cymru in 2014. Since 2012 the event has included a parade through Cardiff city centre.&lt;ref name=2016pics /&gt;

==Controversy: Cardiff Council==
In 2016, there was a rumour started that [[Cardiff Council]] had dropped support for the event.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-37045582 |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date= 13 August 2016 |access-date= 23 October 2017 |title= Pride Cymru: Uncertainty over 2017 LGBT event in Cardiff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an official statement, the Pride Cymru chair said she was told by the council that they'd "made a choice not to allow events during the summer of 2017".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/fears-pride-cymru-find-new-11746674 |date= 18 August 2016|access-date=1 August 2017 |title= Fears Pride Cymru will have to find a new home because of Champions League fanzone|publisher=[[Wales Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was strong local opposition to the decision and the issue prompted a personal appeal from Sir [[Ian McKellen]] in which he compared the negative attitude toward the LGBT community with that seen in India and China on his travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-37253872|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2 September 2016|access-date=1 August 2017|title=Sir Ian McKellen: Pride 2017 uncertainty 'alarming'}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under intense pressure, Cardiff Council reversed its decision and awarded Pride Cymru a slot later in August to move it away from other major events taking place. The organisers would instead take over the running of the Council's [[Cardiff Big Weekend|Big Weekend]] open-air music festival.&lt;ref name="bigweekend"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/cardiffs-big-weekend-coming-back-12344130 | title=Cardiff's Big Weekend is coming back – and organisers promise it will be bigger and better | first=Ruth | last=Mosalski | work=WalesOnline | location=UK | date=20 December 2016 | accessdate=20 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiff's Big Weekend==
In 2017, Pride Cymru took control of the [[Cardiff Council]]'s 'Big Weekend' and combined it with their LGBT pride parade to form [[Cardiff Big Weekend|Pride Cymrus Big Weekend]].&lt;ref name="bigweekend" /&gt; {{Asof|2017}}, the event is due to continue for at least five years.&lt;ref name="bbc17"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-40964316 | title=Pride Cymru: Under threat event 'safe for five years' | first=Chris | last=Wood | work=[[BBC News]] | publisher=[[BBC]] | location=UK | date=26 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Quantum Reality''''' is a 1985 popular science book by physicist [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]], a member the [[Fundamental Fysiks Group]] which was formed to explore the philosophical implications of quantum theory.&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news| last = Johnson | first = George | title = What Physics Owes the Counterculture | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = June 24, 1985 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/books/review/book-review-how-the-hippies-saved-physics-by-david-kaiser.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = September 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book attempts to address the [[ontology]] of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] objects, their attributes, and their interactions, without reliance on advanced mathematical concepts. Herbert discusses the most common [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] and their consequences in turn, highlighting the conceptual advantages and drawbacks of each.&lt;ref name="qr"&gt;{{cite book | last = Herbert | first = Nick | authorlink = Nick Herbert (physicist) | title = Quantum Reality: Beyond the New Physics: An Excursion into Metaphysics and the Meaning of Reality | publisher = Anchor Books/[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] | date = 1985 | doi = | isbn = 978-0-385-18704-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Background===
Following a brief summary of the experimental crises (such as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]) which motivated quantum theory, Herbert identifies four major formulations of quantum theory: [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Paul Dirac]]'s [[Transformation theory (quantum mechanics)|transformation theory]], and [[Richard Feynman]]'s [[Path integral formulation|sum-over-histories]] formulation.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|41–53}}

In introducing quantum objects (which he dubs "quons"), Herbert describes how quantum properties inhere in a [[wave function]], which serves as a [[wikt:proxy|proxy]] for the [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]] of these properties. He likens the quantum measurement process to mathematically [[Signal processing|treating]] the wave function as a [[Series (mathematics)|summation]] of [[waveform]]s of a particular family, with various families corresponding to particular properties. The [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the spectrum of these waveforms represents the uncertainty in the quantum measurement. Herbert shows that for pairs of [[conjugate variables]], such as position and momentum, these bandwidths are [[complementarity (physics)|linked]] such that their product has a finite lower bound, thereby illustrating the basis of [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]: any ''single'' property can be measured to arbitrary precision, but conjugate properties cannot ''simultaneously'' be known to arbitrary precision.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|71–112}}

Herbert identifies two philosophical problems presented by quantum theory—the ''interpretation question'', concerning the physical nature of the reality underlying observation; and the ''[[measurement problem]]'', concerning the apparently special role of the measurement act in quantum theory, and various approaches to formally defining the measurement act.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|113–156}}

===Eight interpretations===
Herbert identifies eight [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], all consistent with observation and with the aforementioned mathematical formalisms. He likens these different interpretations to the story of the [[blind men and an elephant]]—different approaches to the same underlying reality, which yield remarkably different (but often overlapping) pictures. The interpretations identified by Herbert are:
#The '''[[Copenhagen interpretation]], Part I ("There is no deep reality.")''' Most notably associated with [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], Herbert identifies this as the most broadly accepted interpretation among physicists. In this interpretation, dynamic attributes do not describe the reality of quantum objects themselves, but inhere instead in the ''[[relationalism|relationship]]'' between the observed object and the measurement device.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|158–164}}
#The '''Copenhagen interpretation, Part II ("Reality is created by observation.")''' In this variation of the Copenhagen interpretation, associated with [[John Archibald Wheeler]], the reality of quantum attributes is created in the act of [[observation]], as illustrated by the example of [[Wheeler's delayed choice experiment]].&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|164–168}}
#'''"Reality is an undivided wholeness."''' This interpretation, associated with [[David Bohm]] and [[Walter Heitler]], suggests that the state of the entire universe may be implicated in any quantum measurement. Herbert highlights the apparent interaction of widely separated [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles, which may be represented by a single combined wave function, or "shared reality", in a high-dimensional [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|168–172}}
#The '''[[many-worlds interpretation]]'''. Devised by [[Hugh Everett]], this interpretation does away with the conceptual problem of [[wave function collapse]] by supposing that all possible outcomes occur equally, in a constantly branching tree of parallel universes.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|172–175}}
#'''[[Quantum logic]] ("The world obeys a non-human kind of reasoning.")''' Associated with [[John von Neumann]], [[Garrett Birkhoff]], and [[David Finkelstein]], this interpretation holds that quantum objects ''do'' possess innate attributes, but that the relationships between these attributes are governed by a non-[[distributive lattice]], or "wave logic", unlike the [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean lattice]] governing classical objects. In the example of the "three-[[polarizer]] paradox", two stacked, orthogonally-oriented polarizers will not allow any light to pass through (the [[join and meet|meet]] of the sets of photons which will pass through each filter is [[null set|null]]), yet the insertion of a diagonally-oriented polarizer between them allows some light to pass through the stack. The paradox can be understood by considering a polarized beam as a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], with diagonal components that [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] destructively.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|177–185}}
#'''[[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Neorealism]] ("The world is made of ordinary objects.")''' Constructed by [[David Bohm]] and also associated with [[Louis de Broglie]], this interpretation holds that quantum objects possess definite attributes, but that these attributes can change value instantly in response to events anywhere in the universe, with this information encoded in a physical [[pilot wave]] which must be able to travel [[Superluminal communication|faster than light]]. Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did away with this superluminal communication, but [[Bell's theorem]] later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism is rejected by most of the physics establishment.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|185–189}}
#'''"[[Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation|Consciousness creates reality]]."''' First proposed by [[John von Neumann]], this interpretation grants special status to [[consciousness|conscious]] minds as the location of [[wave function collapse]], in which the myriad possibilities of a quantum system are narrowed to one observed state. Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation, in which the observer selects which attribute will be seen to have a definite value but does not determine the value itself, von Neumann contended that the actual attribute value is determined in a collapse that occurs at the interface of the brain and the mind.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|189–193}}
#'''"The duplex world of [[Werner Heisenberg]]."''' Heisenberg recognized a division inherent in the Copenhagen interpretation, between the concrete actuality ([[phenomenon]]) of observations and the range of potentiality ([[wikt:noumenon|noumenon]]) described by the wave function. In seeking to address the ontological nature of the unobserved world, he considered quantum theory to be not merely a successful mathematical analogy, but a literal description of the underlying reality. In Herbert's description of Heisenberg's view, the unobserved world is a world composed of possibility, qualitatively less real than the world of observed fact.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|193–195}}

===Bell's theorem and its implications===
Adding a further wrinkle to the nature of quantum reality, Herbert presents the [[EPR paradox]], and its resolution in the form of [[Bell's theorem]]. The EPR paradox, resting on the long-held assumption of [[principle of locality|locality]], suggests the existence of "elements of reality"—unmeasured quantum attributes which are nonetheless real—which are not predicted by quantum theory. Bell's theorem resolves this paradox by proving that locality is ruled out by observation—that any model of reality consistent with observation ''must'' allow for non-local interaction. However, Herbert is careful to note, Bell's theorem does not entail any prediction of experimentally observable non-local ''phenomena'', nor does it allow for superluminal communication.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|211–231}}

Herbert then re-evaluates the aforementioned interpretations of quantum reality in light of Bell's theorem:

*In the case of the Copenhagen interpretation, the "experimental arrangement" of observed entity and measurement device in which quantum attributes reside—considered by Bohr to be limited to the local interaction—must be expanded to include potentially distant objects with which these systems may be entangled.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|240–241}}
*According to Herbert, Bell's theorem supports the Bohmian notion of underlying reality as an undivided wholeness.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|241–242}}
*Although Herbert asserts that the many-worlds interpretation lacks the [[counterfactual definiteness]] required to prove Bell's theorem, he contends that the many-worlds view is inherently non-local, by any reasonable conception of locality.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|242}}
*In Herbert's view, Bell's result strikes a major blow to neorealist models, by showing that the ostensibly real pilot wave must violate Einstein's universal [[speed of light|speed limit]].&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|243–244}}

Herbert concludes that, although Bell's theorem does not preclude any of the aforementioned interpretations of quantum mechanics, it insists that any valid interpretation ''must'' allow for non-local interaction.&lt;ref name="qr"/&gt;{{rp|245}}

==Reception==
In its review of ''Quantum Reality'', ''The New York Times'' praised Herbert's efforts at making the subject matter comprehensible to a lay audience.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news| last = Lehmann-Haupt | first = Christopher  | title = Quantum Reality | department = Books of the Times | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = June 24, 1985 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/24/books/books-of-the-times-073391.html | accessdate = September 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Heinz Pagels]] called ''Quantum Reality'' "a great place for the general reader to begin to learn about quantum physics".&lt;ref name="enfolded"&gt;{{cite web| last = Nielsen | first = Tom | title = References – Cosmos/Quantum | work = Enfolded.net | url = http://www.enfolded.net/enfolded/references/cosqntm.htm | accessdate = September 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', however, concluded that ''Quantum Reality'', while engaging, may leave lay readers confused.&lt;ref name="kirkus"&gt;{{cite news | title = Quantum Reality: Beyond the New Physics | newspaper = [[Kirkus Reviews]] | date = June 28, 1985 | publisher = Anchor/Doubleday | url = https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/nick-herbert-2/quantum-reality-beyond-the-new-physics/| accessdate = September 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Post-anarchist]] writer [[Hakim Bey]] used ''Quantum Reality'' as the basis for an analysis of the field of quantum physics in terms of the [[social paradigm]]s that it may influence, and from which it may draw its metaphors.&lt;ref name="bey"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bey | first = Hakim | authorlink = Hakim Bey | title = Quantum Mechanics &amp; Chaos Theory: Anarchist Meditations on N. Herbert's ''Quantum Reality: Beyond the New Physics'' | work = Hakim Bey and Ontological Anarchy | url = http://hermetic.com/bey/quantum.html | accessdate = September 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[David Kaiser]], who has written about the [[Fundamental Fysiks Group]] to which Herbert belonged, claims that the book is used in undergraduate physics courses.&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt;

''Quantum Reality'' has been translated into German, Japanese, and Portuguese.&lt;ref name="qt"&gt;{{cite web | last = Herbert | first = Nick | authorlink = Nick Herbert (physicist) | title = A Book About Reality | work = Quantum Tantra | date = July 16, 2009 | url = http://quantumtantra.blogspot.com/2009/07/book-about-reality.html | accessdate = September 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raphael Demos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|m|oʊ|s}}; January 23, 1892 – August 8, 1968) was Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity, emeritus, at [[Harvard University]] and an authority on the work of the Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. At Harvard, he taught [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]

== Early life ==
Demos was born to Ottoman Greek parents at [[Smyrna]] (now Izmir), in the [[Ottoman Empire]], on January 23, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095709912 Raphael Demos.] Oxford Reference.

According to the recollections of [[Bertrand Russell]], Demos saved up and traveled [[steerage]] to the United States specifically to improve his education, having read all the books available to him at home.&lt;ref name="Shook" /&gt; Arriving in Boston in 1913 without money, he first worked as a waiter in a restaurant&lt;ref name="Shook" /&gt; and then as a janitor in the Harvard student halls of residence in order to fund his tuition at the university.&lt;ref name="Monk" /&gt; He studied under Bertrand Russell, who was temporarily at Harvard, and Russell found Demos to be one of his best students and was impressed by his enthusiasm for philosophy which he found refreshing.&lt;ref name="Feinb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Monk"&gt;{{cite book|author=Monk, Ray|title=Bertrand Russell: The spirit of solitude 1872–1921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AzssomBIDRIC&amp;pg=PA350|year=1996|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-684-82802-2|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demos obtained his PhD in 1916 for a dissertation titled ''The Definition of Judgment''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76981226 ''The definition of judgment''] WorldCat.

== Family ==
Demos married Jean and they had a son, [[John Demos]], who attended Harvard University and was a Guggenheim Fellow in United States history in 1977,&lt;ref name=gf /&gt; and a daughter, Penny, who attended [[Radcliffe College]].

== Career ==
Demos began his academic career at Harvard as an assistant in philosophy in 1916–17, rising to assistant professor in 1926. He studied at the University of Cambridge in 1918–19.&lt;ref name="Shook" /&gt; He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] in 1927, awarded for "a study of the philosophy of evolution and social philosophy, principally in Paris, France",&lt;ref name=gf&gt;[http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/raphael-demos/ Raphael Demos.] John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.

Hocking]] and he was a member of the Doty committee which produced the report ''[[General education in a free society]]'' completed the same year. He was a fellow of [[Adams House (Harvard College)|Adams House]].&lt;ref name=crim&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/8/13/professor-raphael-demos-77-dies-praphael/ Professor Raphael Demos, 77, Dies.] ''The Harvard Crimson'', 13 August 1968. Retrieved 28 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he received an award from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], as well as from the [[American Philosophy Association]] in 1959 and the [[Littauer Foundation]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Shook" /&gt;

Demos retired from Harvard in 1962 after which he taught at [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1962–63 and 1964–67. He taught at [[McGill University]] in Montreal in 1963–64.&lt;ref name=crim /&gt;

In May 1963, Demos wrote to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] asking whether King had ever been a student of his at Harvard. King replied to say that he had attended the university for two years as a special student and taken Demos's course on the Philosophy of Plato for which he had received an A from Demos.

'''''Sanjay's Super Team''''' is a [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[short film]] produced by [[Pixar Animation Studios]]. Written and directed by [[Sanjay Patel]], and based on his childhood, it premiered on June 15, 2015 at the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|title=Annecy: U.S., Globalization Fire Up Fest, Market|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/annecy-u-s-globalization-fire-up-fest-market-1201519653/|accessdate=June 20, 2015|work=Variety|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanied the theatrical release of Pixar's ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'' on November 25, 2015.&lt;ref name=LATGetsPersonal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keegan|first1=Rebecca|title=Pixar artist Sanjay Patel gets personal with 'Sanjay's Super Team'|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-pixar-short-sanjay-super-team-20150429-story.html|accessdate=June 20, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Patel's own childhood when he felt conflicted by the modern world and the [[Hindu]] traditions of his family, ''Sanjay's Super Team'' follows the daydream of a young Indian boy, bored with his father's religious meditation, who imagines Hindu gods as superheroes.&lt;ref name=LATGetsPersonal /&gt;

==Plot==
An intertitle card at the start of the short states that it is based on a (mostly) true story.

A young boy, Sanjay, is watching his favorite superhero show, ''Super Team'', while his father is trying to meditate at a small [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[shrine]] in the same room at home. 

Each is annoyed by the other's activity until Sanjay's father turns off the television, confiscates his son's ''Super Team'' action figure, and makes him participate in prayer. Sanjay retrieves the toy while his father is distracted, but accidentally sets its cape on fire from the shrine's [[Diya (lamp)|oil lamp]]. While putting out the cape, he extinguishes the lamp as well and is transported to a temple with three stone statues. 

Suddenly, [[Ravana]] appears and begins to steal the statues' weapons, shattering them in the process. Sanjay breaks the light up mechanism in his toy and uses it to light the giant lamp in the middle of the room, bringing the statues to life as the gods [[Vishnu]], [[Durga]], and [[Hanuman]]. The gods begin to fend off Ravana's attacks and ring their [[Ghanta|bells]] to drive him back, but he retaliates. 

Sanjay recognizes the giant lamp as an upside down bell and breaks his toy on it to ring it aloud, calming Ravana so that he departs the temple. Sanjay receives a new toy from Vishnu as well as his blessing, then finds himself back in the real world, the cape on his action figure unburnt. His father allows him to continue watching ''Super Team'', and Sanjay surprises him with a drawing that shows the gods watching over the cartoon heroes.

The story ends with real life pictures of [[Sanjay Patel]] and his father, during his childhood and in the present day.

==Production==
[[File:Sanjay Patel.png|thumb|left|Patel premiered the film at the 2015 [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]]]]
The inspiration for the short film came from Patel's own childhood, growing up in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] in the 1980s, in a family of Indian immigrants. Like many American children of the era, he played with [[Transformers]], watched ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons and read ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' comics. He also performed daily [[Hindu]] rituals of meditation and prayer with his father. He felt conflicted by his parents' traditions, saying "Our worlds were diametrically apart. I just wanted my name to be Travis, not Sanjay."&lt;ref name=LATGetsPersonal /&gt;

Growing up, he became more confident with his identity, although he still found it challenging to openly embrace his Indian background at work. As a child, he "felt deeply the absence of anyone who looked like him in films and television." To "bring a young brown boy's story to the pop culture zeitgeist," Patel first pitched the short to Pixar executives during 2012. Pixar's chief creative officer, [[John Lasseter]], was very welcoming to the idea "about celebrating the personal side of the story." 

The film's setting was inspired by the Lido Motel, an old [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] motel which his parents bought and worked at when he was a child.&lt;ref name=LATGetsPersonal/&gt; Patel started the film with only [[Vishnu]], which served as a "mirror of my father" and would contrast one deity with three superheroes. Then the development team suggested adding more gods, with Patel choosing [[Durga]] to showcase a goddess as "in [[Vedas|Vedic]] philosophy, there's always a masculine energy and a feminine energy", and [[Hanuman]] for a half animal deity. 

Ravana drew inspiration from the various [[Rakshasa]]s, and following Buddhist tradition, "the demon isn't vanquished, he isn't destroyed. Once the boy destroys his idol, it makes the monster more human."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9869646/sanjays-super-team-sanjay-patel-pixar-interview|title = Pixar's Sanjay Patel on his debut short: 'It was so lovely to have John Lasseter champion it'|date = December 8, 2015|accessdate = December 15, 2015|publisher = The Verge|last = Robinson|first = Tasha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shasta-abbey-Buddha̠.jpg|thumb|Buddha at the Buddhahall of Shasta Abbey, Mt Shasta, California]]
'''Shasta Abbey''', located on sixteen forested acres near [[Mount Shasta]] in northern [[California]], [[United States]] is a training [[monastery]] for [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] and a place of practice for lay Buddhists and interested visitors. It was established in 1970 by Reverend Master P.T.N.H. [[Houn Jiyu-Kennett|Jiyu-Kennett]], who was Abbess and spiritual director until her death in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zen is Eternal Life |last=Jiyu-Kennett |first=Rev.

==History==

A monastery of the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives (OBC), it was established in 1970 by Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett, a British woman, on behalf of her teacher, [https://obcon.org/about-us/founding-teachers/koho-zenji/ Keido Chisan Koho Zenji], her Master in Japan. In November 1969, Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett came to San Francisco on a lecture tour and stayed on in the United States to establish Shasta Abbey the following year. Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett served twenty-six years as Abbess and spiritual director of Shasta Abbey, ordaining and teaching monks and lay people. She founded [[Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey]] in England in 1972. She also founded the [https://obcon.org OBC] to establish a framework within which the temples she founded could come together.&lt;ref&gt;[https://shastaabbey.org/about/ About: Shasta Abbey]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Abbot was Rev. Master Eko Little, a Dharma Heir of Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett and her assistant for 20 years. He succeeded Rev. Master Jiyu after her death and served as Abbot until 2010. He maintained his Master’s wishes for, and legacy to, Shasta Abbey in the 14 years following her death. In his time as Abbot, he continued to unfold Rev. Master Jiyu’s teaching, strengthening the fabric of the monastery, and enhancing the spiritual life of the Sangha, both monastic and lay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://shastaabbey.org/about/ About: Shasta Abbey]&lt;/ref&gt; There were also some serious problems that came to light towards the end of his Abbacy, and in May, 2010, he left the Abbey and returned to lay life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dear Friends|url=http://www.shastaabbey.org/pdf/Announcement0511.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Shasta Abbey|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third, and current, Abbess is Rev. Master Meian Elbert, who was ordained in 1977 and received Dharma Transmission in 1979 from Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett. She was named a Master of the Order by Rev. Master Jiyu in 1989. She was chaplain to Rev. Master Jiyu for more than 15 years and has served the community as Vice Abbess, Chief Cook, Chief Precentor, Prior and Novice Master. She also served as Executive Secretary of the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives. Rev. Master Meian was elected Abbess by the resident Shasta Abbey monastic community on June 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://shastaabbey.org/about/ About: Shasta Abbey]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
[[File:ShastaAbbey2.png|thumb|right|[[Sōtō|Serene Reflection Meditation]]]]
Buddhist training at Shasta Abbey is based on the practice of [[Shikantaza|Serene Reflection Meditation]] ([[Sōtō|Sōtō Zen]]) and the keeping of the Buddhist Precepts. The resident monastic community includes approximately 26 vegetarian, celibate male and female monks. 

[[File:ShastaAbbey1.jpg|thumb|left|A Festival Ceremony in the Buddha Hall at Shasta Abbey]]
The daily schedule is a kaleidoscope of seated meditation, ceremonial and working meditation in all its various forms in order to cultivate the mind of meditation in all aspects of daily life. The schedule flows through the day from the wake-up bell to lights out, and provides opportunities “…to do what needs to be done…”. A typical day’s schedule is hard to define, but most days start with meditation and Morning Service. The day is then filled with the normal activities of daily life: Meals eaten together, individual monastic office tasks and tasks done together for the benefit of the whole community, time for individual spiritual practice and time for common ceremonial and practice, rest and renewal time including community tea and tea with the laity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://shastaabbey.org/community/ Monastic Community: Shasta Abbey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lay residents staying at the Abbey for an extended period of time, and visitors participating in retreats are asked to follow a similar schedule to that of the monks. Both monks and laity observe the practice of The Middle Way as far as possible in the daily schedule.

The Abbey is a place of silence and serenity for the local congregation, lay friends and interested visitors. Practitioners strive to follow the Buddha's Teachings wholeheartedly, giving up what seems important from the point of view of the self to follow the Way of the Buddhas and Ancestors. This is reflected in their attitude of faith and practice of [[Dāna]](mutual assistance):

:There really can be no price put on the Buddha Dharma. Thus, we at Shasta Abbey have chosen not to have fees or even suggested donation amounts. We make an offering of the teaching, and provide a training refuge, putting our faith in the practice of dana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://shastaabbey.org/about/ About: Shasta Abbey]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Shasta Abbey Press publishes Buddhist books, including the writings of its founder, Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett, and translations of many Buddhist texts. Among these are the master works of Soto Zen patriarchs [[Dogen]] Zenji ([[Shōbōgenzō]]) and [[Keizan]] Jokin Zenji ([[Denkoroku]]). Many publications can be [https://shastaabbey.org/publications/ accessed free of charge] via the Shasta Abbey Website.

The translations of Buddhist texts and scriptures at Shasta Abbey are particularly useful for practitioners of Buddhism in the West, as the translations are done from the mind of meditation and by actual Buddhist monks, as opposed to the worldly, literal-minded viewpoints of many scholastic western translators of the past. The translations are less esoteric and thus easier to understand from the point of view of Buddhist practice in a western context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37618">The core of '''[[Prem Rawat]]'s teaching''' is that the individual’s need for fulfillment can be satisfied by turning within to contact a constant source of peace and joy. Rather than a body of dogma, he emphasizes a direct experience of transcendence, which he claims is accessible through the four techniques of meditation which he teaches. He calls these techniques "[[Techniques of Knowledge|Knowledge]]" and says that Knowledge will take "all your senses that have been going outside all your life, turn them around and put them inside to feel and to actually experience you."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Religions of the world, pp.428 "The meditation techniques the Maharaji teaches today are the same he learned from his father, Hans Ji Maharaj, who, in turn, learned them from his spiritual teacher [Sarupanand]. 'Knowledge', claims Maharaji, 'is a way to be able to take all your senses that have been going outside all your life, turn them around and put them inside to feel and to actually experience you... What you are looking for is inside of you.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

In his public speeches he quotes from Hindu, Muslim and Christian sources, but he relies on the experience provided by the four meditation techniques for his inspiration and guidance.&lt;ref name="Geaves, Ron 2006"&gt;Geaves, Ron, Globalization, charisma, innovation, and tradition: An exploration of the transformations in the organisational vehicles for the transmission of the teachings of Prem Rawat (Maharaji), 2006, Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies, 2 44–6 – Although Rawat does not see himself as part of a tradition or as having to conform to the behavior of any predecessor, in my view, the best way to place him is to identify him with Vaudeville’s definition of the sant&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Michael, The Dictionary of the Esoteric: 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult Traditions, pp.75-6, (2002), Sterling Publishing Company, {{ISBN|1-84293-108-3}}&lt;br /&gt;Maharaj Ji [teaches] meditation upon the life-force. This meditation focuses on four types of mystical energy, known as the experiences of Light, Harmony, Nectar, and the Word. These allow the practitioner to develop a deep and spiritual self-knowledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides, George D. Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements pp.210-1, Scarecrow Press (2001) {{ISBN|0-8108-4095-2}}.&lt;br/&gt;"This Knowledge was self-understanding, yielding calmness, peace, and contentment, since the innermost self is identical with the divine. Knowledge is attained through initiation, which provides four techniques that allow the practitioner to go within.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Stephen J. ''Alternative Religions: A Sociological Introduction'' (2003), pp.116-7, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7546-3410-8}}.&lt;br /&gt;"The major focus of Maharaji is on stillness, peace, and contentment within the individual, and his 'Knowledge' consists of the techniques to obtain them. Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding. Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self, which brings a sense of well-being, joy and harmony. The Knowledge includes four meditation procedures: Light, Music, Nectar and Word. The process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher. Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation. The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full."&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar and follower Ron Geaves, this lack of professed concepts allows his followers a freedom of expression which is spontaneous and personal.&lt;ref name="Geaves, Ron 2006"/&gt; Rawat places no outer requirements or prohibitions on those taught the techniques, nor does he regard himself as an exemplary leader. Practitioners are asked not to reveal these techniques to anyone else, but to allow others to prepare to receive the experience for themselves.&lt;ref name="Three promises"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Three promises"/&gt; Rawat has been criticized for a lack of intellectual content in his public discourses.&lt;ref name="Melton1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schnabel1982"&gt;Schnabel (1982), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent2001"&gt;Kent (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Scholars have asserted that Prem Rawat's teachings originate in the traditions of the North Indian [[Sant Mat|Sant]]s, who dismiss all religious ritual and dogma and emphasize the possibility of a direct experience of God, who, they claim, "dwells in the heart".&lt;ref&gt;Lipner.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologically, their teachings are distinguished by an inward, loving devotion to a divine principle, and socially by an [[egalitarian]]ism that is opposed to the qualitative distinctions of the Hindu [[caste]] system.&lt;ref name=Woodhead&gt;Woodhead, Linda &amp; Fletcher, Paul. ''Religion in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations'' (2001) pp.71-2. Routledge (UK) {{ISBN|0-415-21784-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sants believe that the [[Guru]] or [[Satguru|Perfect Master]] is an embodiment of God and a fitting object of worship. Some of the more notable Sant gurus include [[Namdev]] (d.1350), [[Kabir]] (d.1518), [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] (d.1539), [[Mirabai]] (d.1545), [[Surdas]] (d.1573), [[Tulsidas]] (d.1623), and [[Tukaram]] (d. 1650).&lt;ref name="Melton1986"&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton|Melton, J. Gordon]] ''The Encyclopedia Handbook of Cults in America.'' p.143, Garland Publishing (1986) {{ISBN|0-8240-9036-5}} "The Divine Light Mission is derived from Sant Mat (literally, the way of the saints), a variation of the Sikh religion which draws significant elements from Hinduism. It is based upon a succession of spiritual masters generally believed to begin with Tulsi Sahib, an early nineteenth century guru who lived at Hathrash, Uttar Pradesh. It is believed that the person mentioned as Sarupanand Ji in Mission literature is in fact Sawan Singh, a prominent Sant Mat guru. In any case, Hans Maharaj Ji claimed a Sant Mat succession which he passed to Maharaj Ji. Maharaj Ji, as do many of the other Sant Mat leaders, claims to be a Perfect Master, an embodiment of God on earth, a fitting object of worship and veneration."&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars refer to affinities with medieval traditions of [[Nirguna Brahman|Nirguna Bhakti]] (Sanskrit = "formless devotion"), with a similar emphasis on universalism, equality and direct experience, and criticism of blind allegiance to religious ritual and dogma.&lt;ref&gt;Geaves, Ron, ''Globalization, Charisma, Innovation and Tradition: 2006.'' ''Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies'', 2 44-62. &lt;br /&gt;"Prem Rawat has affinities with the mediaeval Nirguna Bhakti (formless devotion) tradition of Northern India, more commonly known as Sant. With its emphasis on universalism, equality, direct experience, criticism of blind allegiance to religious ritual and dogma, and tendency towards syncretism."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hans Ji Maharaj]], Rawat's father and guru, was a devotee of Swarupanand, and became a guru in 1936 on Swarupanand's death. He began presenting his message and teaching the techniques of Knowledge in the small town of [[Najibabad]], near [[Haridwar]]. His talks  were strongly influenced by the reformist philosophy of the [[Arya Samaj]], and he viewed himself primarily as the "Guru of the Poor". His teachings were rich in metaphor and more concerned with practical applications than theory.&lt;ref name="Reinhart Hummel"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reinhart Hummel |title=Indische Mission und neue Frömmigkeit im Westen: Religiöse Bewegungen Indiens in westl.

In 1936 he published a book ''Hans Yog Prakash''&lt;ref&gt;Hans ji Maharaj, ''Hans Yog Prakash'' (1936) (Unknown publisher), New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; as a first step to broadening the dissemination of his message.

==Teachings==
Prem Rawat did not inherit a formal set of teachings nor did he develop one, as he sees [[conceptual thinking]] as the main enemy of the direct [[religious experience]] which he claims can be obtained through the techniques of Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Maeve in Sociological Review ''The Divine Light Mission as a Social Organization'' nr. 27, 1979 pp. 279–96&lt;br&gt;"Essentially, premies believe that the key to understanding themselves, the gateway to happiness, love and that peace of mind 'which surpasseth understanding' lies in meditating on the knowledge of Guru Maharaj Ji, and that this knowledge is there inside each human being. Only Maharaj Ji has the key to it and only his appointed mahatmas or initiators may give Maharaj Ji's knowledge. This crucial fact that knowledge may only be revealed by Maharaj Ji legitimates the leader's supremacy to the believers and ensures that seekers achieve these benefits from a single source."&lt;/ref&gt; His central claim is that God resides in every human being and the human quest for fulfillment can be resolved by turning inward to discover a constant source of contentment and joy. He gives equal billing to all religions, quoting from Hindu, Muslim and Christian sources, but rather than rely on scriptures for inspiration and guidance, Rawat relies on the experience provided by the four techniques of Knowledge. This lack of professed concepts allow his followers a freedom of expression which is spontaneous and personal.&lt;ref name="Geaves, Ron 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinhart Hummel"/&gt;Neither in the time of the father, Shri Hans, nor in that of the son, did the Divine Light Mission possess a systematically developed set of teachings. Both saw [doctrines] as presenting more problems than advantages ... The young Guru explains that conceptual thinking, translated with the English word “mind” in German translations also, is the main enemy of direct religious experience. It is therefore hardly surprising that little firm information about DLM teachings can be obtained from his followers. On the other hand, the lack of professed concepts allows them a freedom of expression which is spontaneous and personal, and which makes an agreeable contrast with the unexamined reproduction of received teachings [such as are found in other Indian-inspired groups.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Rawat relocated to the U.S. and while his teachings remained essentially Hindu in origin and he continued with many Indian traditions, he managed with the minimum of Hindu terms and concepts, keeping his main emphasis on an individual, subjective experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Geaves in Christopher Partridge (Eds.), New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities pp.201-202, Oxford University Press, USA (2004) {{ISBN|978-0-19-522042-1}}. However, at the heart of Maharaji's teachings lies the simplest message that the human quest for fulfillment can be resolved by turning inward to discover a constant source of contentment and joy within. This message is supported by four techniques, together known as Knowledge, which provide the practical application that allow the practitioner the possibility of the experience spoken about by Maharaji.' [...]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Hunt Alternative Religions: A Sociological Introduction (2003), pp. 116–7, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7546-3410-8}} ... the emphasis is on individual, subjective experience, rather than on a body of dogma. The teachings provide a kind of practical mysticism. Maharaji speaks not of God, but of the god or divinity within, the power that gives existence.&lt;/ref&gt; His first western discourses were criticized by some religious scholars as evangelical and lacking in substance and for stressing direct experience over intellect or religious conceptual thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reinhart Hummel|Hummel, Reinhart]], ''Indische Mission und neue Frömmigkeit im Westen. Religiöse Bewegungen in westlichen Kulturen'' Stuttgart 1980, {{ISBN|3-17-005609-3}}, p79. &lt;br /&gt;"In a satsang in 1975 in Orlando/Florida, he spoke in a language similar to American evangelical campaigners." Original: "In einem 1975 in Orlando/Florida gehaltenen Satsang spricht er eine ähnliche Sprache wie amerikanische Evangelisationsfeldzüge."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reender Kranenborg|Kranenborg, Reender]] (1982) ''Oosterse Geloofsbewegingen in het Westen/Eastern faith movements in the West'' (Dutch language) {{ISBN|90-210-4965-1}}. In this context, Rawat often referred to the negative influence of the "mind" or "conceptual thinking" as the main enemy of direct religious experience. To some scholars this reference to "mind" appeared to mean either "the alienating influences that made man stray from his true nature," or a "state of consciousness characterized by everything but passive, nonrational confidence and trust."&lt;/ref&gt;

A reporter at an appearance in Boston described Rawat as "...a real human being. He spoke humbly, conversationally, and without any apparent notion that he was God. In fact he seemed to consciously undercut the divine stage show and the passionate words said in his honor. Devotees and mahatmas speak of him as the guy who will out-Christ Christ, yet the guru himself claims, not that he is divine, but that his Knowledge is".&lt;ref&gt;EastWest Journal "An Expressway over Bliss Mountain" by Phil Levy P 29&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist James Downton observed that from his early beginnings Rawat appealed to his followers to give up the concepts and beliefs that might impede them from fully experiencing the "Knowledge" or life force, but this did not prevent them from adopting a fairly rigid set of ideas about his divinity, and to project millennial preconceptions onto him and the movement.&lt;ref name="Downton"&gt;{{cite book |author=Downton, James V. |title=Sacred journeys: the conversion of young Americans to Division Light Mission |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-231-04198-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen A. Kent]], in the preface of his book ''[[From Slogans to Mantras]]'', described his disappointment at hearing what he considered to be a poorly delivered and banal message by Rawat in 1974, and was surprised that his companions spoke glowingly about the same message.&lt;ref name="Kent2001"&gt;Kent (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Prem Rawat has never asked for payment for teaching Knowledge but it was reported that in the 1970s, some Indian mahatmas asked would-be initiates to empty their pockets and give what they had prior to receiving Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jonathon| last=Rawson|title=God in Houston: The Cult of Guru Maharaji Ji| work=[[The New Republic]]|page=17|date=November 17, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Penthouse magazine|date=July 1974|title=I See The Light|first=Ken|last=Kelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Rawat began using Western initiators to teach the techniques of Knowledge and continued to transform his teachings in order to appeal to a Western context.

By the early 1980s Prem Rawat had dropped the title "Guru" and eliminated the last of the Indian aspects. Rawat does not see himself as bound by conventional beliefs or practices of any institutionalized religion or tradition-honored world view. He is essentially an iconoclast who plots his route by pragmatic decisions to meet the demands and challenges that occur in his public career as a teacher striving to convince people of the value of self-knowledge. Rawat claims that practicing Knowledge will allow the practitioner to experience joy, self-understanding, calmness, peace and contentment. Practitioners describe Knowledge as internal and highly individual, with no associated social structure, liturgy, ethical practices or articles of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Hunt Alternative Religions: A Sociological Introduction (2003), pp. 116–7, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7546-3410-8}}. He came to recognize that the Indian influences on his followers in the West were a hindrance to the wider acceptance of his teachings. He therefore changed the style of his message and relinquished the Hindu tradition, beliefs, and most of its original eastern religious practices. Hence, today the teachings do not concern themselves with reincarnation, heaven, or life after death. The movement now focuses entirely on "Knowledge", which is a set of simple instructions on how adherents should live.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides, George D. ''Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements'' pp. 210–1, Scarecrow Press (2001) {{ISBN|0-8108-4095-2}} This Knowledge was self-understanding, yielding calmness, peace, and contentment, since the innermost self is identical with the divine. Knowledge is attained through initiation, which provides four techniques that allow the practitioner to go within ... and emphasizing that the Knowledge is universal, non Indian, in nature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Stephen J., ''Alternative Religions: A Sociological Introduction.'' (2003), pp. 116–7, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7546-3410-8}}. The major focus of Maharaji is on stillness, peace, and contentment within the individual, and his 'Knowledge' consists of the techniques to obtain them. Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding. Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self. In turn, this brings a sense of well-being, joy and harmony as one comes in contact with one's "own nature." The Knowledge includes four meditation procedures: Light, Music, Nectar and Word. The process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher. Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation. The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ron Geaves, Rawat speaks spontaneously, with an emphasis on an individual's subjective experience rather than on a body of theoretical knowledge, and he draws upon real life experiences, including his own, rather than on interpretations of the scriptures. He is uncluttered by tradition in the manner of a contemporary [[Kabir]] or [[Nanak]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Geaves, Ron, Globalization, charisma, innovation, and tradition: An exploration of the transformations in the organisational vehicles for the transmission of the teachings of Prem Rawat (Maharaji), 2006, Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies, 2 44-62&lt;/ref&gt; Rawat advises students that for maximum benefit the techniques should be practised daily for at least one hour. He does not demand obedience,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} in that no outer requirements or prohibitions are placed on those taught the techniques. The axiom, 'If you like it, practice it; if you don’t, try something else,' is frequently given in his public discourses.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Neither does Prem Rawat regard himself as an exemplary leader, a role often ascribed to religious founders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Hunt ''Alternative Religions: A Sociological Introduction'' (2003), pp.116-7, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7546-3410-8}}. &lt;br /&gt;"Maharaji transformed his initial teachings in order to appeal to a Western context. He came to recognize that the Indian influences on his followers in the West were a hindrance to the wider acceptance of his teachings.

He declared himself the sole source of spiritual authority in the Mission. And, unlike some gurus who have come to this country and have easternized their followers, he became more fully westernized, which premies interpreted as an attempt to integrate his spiritual teachings into our culture."&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of Knowledge is described by practitioners as internal and highly individual. The techniques are to be practised privately, and have no related social structure or hierarchy. According to students, there is no liturgy or social obligation involved. They also say that the techniques are universally applicable and their practice has no impact on, or relationship to, a student's gender, race, sexual orientation, economic status, religion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elanvital.com.au/faq.html] Elan Vital FAQ Retrieved November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Techniques of Knowledge===
{{Main article|Techniques of Knowledge}}
According to the Dutch religious scholar and Christian minister [[Reender Kranenborg]] and the American religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]], the techniques of Knowledge are secret and were originally called "Light", "Sound", "Name" (or "Word") and "Nectar", but Maharaji now refers to them as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Frankiel, Sandra S. in Lippy, Charles H. and Williams. Peter W. (Eds.) ''Encyclopedia of the American Religious Experience'' p. 1521, Charles Scribner's Sons (1988), {{ISBN|0-684-18863-5}} (Vol III)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kran"&gt;[[Reender Kranenborg|Kranenborg, Reender]] Dr. (1982) ''Oosterse Geloofsbewegingen in het Westen/Eastern faith movements in the West'' (Dutch language) {{ISBN|90-210-4965-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;Melton, Gordon J., Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America (1992) pp. 143-4, Garland Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8153-1140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rawat asks practitioners to promise "not to reveal these techniques to anyone", but says to "let other people go through their own journey ... [so] they, too, can have the techniques when they are ready."&lt;ref name=promises&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Kranenborg and Melton provide differing details of them in their writings but agree on a general description of the practices.&lt;ref name="Kran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton"/&gt; "Light" involves careful pressure on the eyes, seeking to open the "[[third eye]]" after a long period of training and practice. This is comparable to similar [[tantra|Tantric]] practices. "Sound" involves positioning the hands over the ears and temples, with the goal of hearing the "heavenly music". This is reported to be related to sabda-[[brahman]] meditation. "Name" or "Word" is a meditation concentrating on breath. "Nectar" involves tongue positioning, eventually leading the student to taste the "nectar of life". Michael Drury describes these techniques as helping the practitioner to develop "a deep and spiritual self-knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Michael, ''The Dictionary of the Esoteric: 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult Traditions'', pp. 75-6 (2002), Sterling Publishing Company, {{ISBN|1-84293-108-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching Knowledge / The Keys===
In his early days in the West, Prem Rawat or his [[Mahatma]]s (renamed to "Initiators" in 1974) conducted "Knowledge Sessions" face-to-face in small groups. From 2001 the techniques were taught via a multimedia presentation made by Rawat. In 2005, Prem Rawat introduced "The Keys", a program of five [[DVD]]'s which prepare the student for receiving Knowledge. The techniques are taught in Key Six. A request from a practitioner who feels they are ready to view Key Six will result in an invitation to a Knowledge Session.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in more than 50 languages (of which he speaks five himself: [[English (language)|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] and [[Italian (language)|Italian]]; the other languages are dubbed). In this presentation, Maharaji explains the techniques step-by-step, to ensure that they are understood and practiced correctly. This process takes 2½ hours, of which one hour is dedicated to practicing the techniques, 15 minutes each. Before the presentation starts, people are asked to keep three promises: a) to keep in touch, b) to give Knowledge a fair chance, and c) to not share these techniques with anyone. If attendees agree with these three promises they are invited to stay and receive "the gift of Knowledge."&lt;ref name=promises /&gt;

The Knowledge Sessions are facilitated by volunteers who operate the video equipment and ensure the comfort of the attendees. Knowledge Sessions are available throughout the year in most Western countries. In special cases, such as people who are in hospitals etc., or are otherwise bed-ridden, the volunteers go to them to conduct the Session.

==Reception==

===Scholars===
[[George D. Chryssides]] writes that the Knowledge according to Prem Rawat was based on self-understanding, providing the practitioner with calmness, peace, and contentment, as the inner-self is identical with the divine.  Rawat emphasizes that this Knowledge is universal, not Indian, in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides, George D. ''Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements'', pp. 210-1, Scarecrow Press (2001) {{ISBN|0-8108-4095-2}} &lt;br /&gt;"Maharaji progressively dissolved the Divine Light Mission, closing the ashrams, affirming his own status as a master rather than a divine leader, and emphasizing that the Knowledge is universal, non-Indian, in nature" [...] "This Knowledge was self-understanding, yielding calmness, peace, and contentment, since the innermost self is identical with the divine. Knowledge is attained through initiation, which provides four techniques that allow the practitioner to go within.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ron Geaves]], who specializes in studies in comparative religion at Liverpool Hope University in England and who is one of the Western students of Prem Rawat,&lt;ref name="PIP/Cagan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cagan|first=Andrea|title=Peace is Possible: The Life and Message of Prem Rawat|year=2007|publisher=Mighty River|pages=115–116|isbn= 978-0-9788694-9-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Prem Rawat himself has stated that he does not consider himself to be a charismatic figure, preferring to refer to his teachings and the efficacy of the practice of the four techniques on the individual as the basis of his authority. The showing of the four techniques replaces the traditional diksha, and although it marks the sealing of master/disciple relationship, that is not emphasized in the session itself. Rather, the focus is on correct practice and staying in touch through participation or listening. Prem Rawat’s teachings make no reference to any traditional authority, neither person nor text.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Stephen J. Hunt]] describes Rawat's major focus as being on stillness, peace and contentment within the individual, and his 'Knowledge' consists of the techniques to obtain them. Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding. Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self. In turn, this brings a sense of well-being, joy, and harmony as one comes in contact with one's "own nature." The Knowledge includes four secret meditation procedures and the process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher. Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation. The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full. They claim that Rawat's authority comes from the nature of his teachings and their benefit to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Hunt Alternative Religions: A Sociological Introduction (2003), pp. 116–7, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7546-3410-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sacred Journeys]] sociologist [[James V. Downton]] writes
&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from all the psychological and social explanations one could offer to explain their conversions, the fact is that, during the Knowledge session or afterward in meditation, these young people had a spiritual experience which deeply affected them and changed the course of their lives. It was an experience which moved many to tears and joy, for they had found the answer they had been seeking. It was an experience which gave their lives more positive direction, meaning, and purpose. It was an experience which brought them into a new relationship to life and removed many blocks to growth. It was an experience-which sages have spoken about throughout history-of the oneness of life.&lt;ref&gt;Downton, James V., Sacred journeys: The conversion of young Americans to Divine Light Mission, (1979) Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-04198-5}}. Encounters with God" Page 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marc Galanter (MD)]], professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at the New York University Medical Center, writes that "over the long term of membership, meditation also played an important role in supporting a convert's continuing involvement. An analysis of the relationship between the time members spent in meditation and the decline in their level of neurotic distress revealed that greater meditation time was associated with diminished neurotic distress. This association suggests that the emotional response to meditation acts as a reinforcement for its continued practice." That is, the more a member meditated, in general, the better the person was likely to feel. Members apparently used meditation to relieve distress, both at scheduled times and on an ad hoc basis.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Galanter,Cults and new religious movements: a report of the Committee on Psychiatry and Religion of the American Psychiatric Association (1989) {{ISBN|0-89042-212-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Schnabel]] a sociologist, references [[Jan van der Lans|Van der Lans]], a religious psychologist employed at the Catholic [[Radboud University Nijmegen|University of Nijmegen]]. Van der Lans says that among his Western students, Rawat appeared to stimulate an uncritical attitude, giving them an opportunity to project their fantasies of divinity onto his person. According to these authors, the divine nature of the guru is a standard element of Eastern religion, but removed from its cultural context, and confounded with the Western understanding of God as a father, what is lost is the difference between the guru's person and that which the guru symbolizes—resulting in what they refer to as limitless personality worship. Schnabel writes that this kind of understanding of the master-disciple relationship, alien to the original Eastern [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru-disciple]] context, often ends in disillusionment for the disciple, who finds that the teacher in the end fails to live up to his or her expectations.&lt;ref name="Schnabel1982V"&gt;[[Paul Schnabel|Schnabel]], ''Tussen stigma en charisma'' ("Between stigma and charisma"), 1982. [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/schn016tuss01_01/schn016tuss01_01_0012.htm Ch. V, p. 142]&lt;br /&gt;The reference texts by Van der Lans quoted by Schnabel in that chapter:

===Former followers===
Reports obtained by [[Ted Patrick]] and several scholars after [[deprogramming]] of several of Rawat's former worshippers refer to the experience of Rawat's "meditation" techniques as self-hypnosis, and as diminishing the ability to think both during the practice and for an extended period of time after cessation.&lt;ref name=Patrick&gt;Patrick, Ted with Tom Dulack, ''Let Our Children Go!: By the man who rescues brainwashed American youth from sinister 'religious' cults'' pp. 214-215 (1976) E.P. Dutton &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0-525-14450-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Conway&gt;Conway, Flo and Siegelman, Jim, ''"Snapping: America's Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change'' Second Edition, Second printing: pp 159 f (2005) Stillpoint Press, {{ISBN|0-385-28928-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Rawat has been criticized for a lack of intellectual content in his public discourses&lt;ref name="Melton1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schnabel1982"&gt;Schnabel (1982), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent2001"&gt;Kent (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[David V. Barrett]], at the heart of Prem Rawat's teaching is the Knowledge, and the experience is an individual, subjective experience rather than a body of dogma. In its Divine Light days the movement was sometimes criticized for this stressing of emotional experience over intellect. The teaching could perhaps best be described as practical mysticism.&lt;ref name=barret65&gt;Barret, David V., The New Believers: A Survey of Sects, Cults and Alternative Religions (2003), p. 65, Cassel, {{ISBN|1-84403-040-7}}&lt;br&gt;"Elan Vital has now dropped all of its original Eastern religious practices. [...] Unusually, the fact that Maharaji came from a lineage of 'Perfect Masters' is no longer relevant to the reformed movement. This is not where the authority comes from, nor the recognition of Maharaji as the master by his student; this comes rather from the nature of the teaching and its benefit to the individual. The experience is an individual, subjective experience rather than a body of dogma, and in its Divine Light days the movement was sometime criticized for this stressing of emotional experience over intellect. The teachings could perhaps best described as practical mysticism.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Citadel''''' is a novel by [[A. J. Cronin]], first published in 1937, which was groundbreaking in its treatment of the contentious theme of medical ethics. It has been credited with laying the foundation in Great Britain for the introduction of the [[National Health Service|NHS]] a decade later.&lt;ref name=nhs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ournhsscotland.com/history/birth-nhs-scotland/expectant-public | title=An expectant public: 1948–2008 60 years of the NHS |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2008 |work=Birth of NHS in Scotland |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for 1937 novels, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].&lt;ref name=nyt1938&gt;
"Booksellers Give Prize to 'Citadel': Cronin's Work About Doctors Their Favorite--'Mme. Curie' Gets Non-Fiction Award ...", ''The New York Times'', 2 March 1938, page 14. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).
&lt;br/&gt;Ballots were submitted by 319 stores; there had been about 600 ABA members one year earlier.
&lt;br/&gt;• At the [[Hotel Astor]] luncheon, presenter [[Clifton Fadiman]] said: "Unlike the [[Pulitzer Prize]] committee, the booksellers merely vote for their favorite books. They do not say it is the best book or the one that will elevate the standard of manhood or womanhood. Twenty years from now we can decide which are the masterpieces. This year we can only decide which books we enjoyed reading the most."&lt;/ref&gt;

For his fifth book, Dr. Cronin drew on his experiences practising medicine in the coal mining communities of the [[South Wales Valleys]], as he had for ''[[The Stars Look Down]]'' two years earlier. Specifically, he had researched and reported on the correlation between coal dust inhalation and lung disease in the town of [[Tredegar]]. He had also worked as a doctor for the [[Tredegar Medical Aid Society]] at the [[Tredegar General Hospital|Cottage Hospital]], which served as the model for the [[National Health Service]].

Cronin once stated in an interview, "I have written in ''The Citadel'' all I feel about the medical profession, its injustices, its hide-bound unscientific stubbornness, its humbug ... The horrors and inequities detailed in the story I have personally witnessed. This is not an attack against individuals, but against a system."

== Plot summary ==

In October 1924, Andrew Manson, an idealistic, newly qualified doctor, arrives from Scotland to work as assistant to Doctor Page in the small (fictitious) Welsh mining town of Drineffy (Blaenelly is the name given in some adaptations). He quickly realises that Page is unwell and disabled and that he has to do all the work for a meagre wage. Shocked by the unsanitary conditions he discovers, Manson works to improve matters and receives the support of Dr Philip Denny, a cynical semi-alcoholic who, Manson finds out in due course, took a post as an assistant doctor after having fallen from grace as a surgeon. Resigning, he obtains a post as assistant in a miners' medical aid scheme in 'Aberalaw', a neighbouring coal mining town in the [[South Wales coalfield]]. On the strength of this job, Manson marries Christine Barlow, a junior school teacher.

Christine helps her husband with his [[silicosis]] research. Eager to improve the lives of his patients, mainly coal miners, Manson dedicates many hours to research in his chosen field of lung disease. He studies for, and is granted, the [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|MRCP]], and when his research is published, an MD. The research gains him a post with the 'Mines Fatigue Board' in London, but he resigns after six months to set up a private practice.

Seduced by the thought of easy money from wealthy clients rather than the principles he started out with, Manson becomes involved with pampered private patients and fashionable surgeons and drifts away from his wife. A patient dies because of a surgeon's ineptitude, and the incident causes Manson to abandon his practice and return to his principles. He and his wife repair their damaged relationship, but then she is run over by a bus and killed.

Since Manson has accused the incompetent surgeon of murder, he is vindictively reported to the [[General Medical Council]] for having worked with an American [[tuberculosis]] specialist, Richard Stillman, who does not have a medical degree, even though the patient had been successfully treated at his clinic. Stillman's treatment, that of [[pneumothorax]] involved collapsing an affected lung with [[nitrogen]], and was not universally accepted at the time.

Despite his lawyer's gloomy prognosis, Manson forcefully justifies his actions during the hearing and is not struck off the medical register.

==Historical context==
The novel is of interest because of its portrayal of a voluntary contribution medical association which is based (not entirely uncritically) on the [[Tredegar Medical Aid Society]] for which Cronin worked for a time in the 1920s, and which in due course became the inspiration for the [[National Health Service]] as established under [[Aneurin Bevan]].

==Adaptations==
The novel was made into a [[The Citadel (film)|1938 film]] with [[Robert Donat]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Ralph Richardson]] and [[Rex Harrison]], and television versions include one American ([[The Citadel (1960)|1960]]), two British ([[The Citadel (1960 British miniseries)|1960]] &amp; [[The Citadel (television)|1983]]), and two Italian ([[La Cittadella (1964)|1964]] &amp; [[La Cittadella (2003)|2003]]) adaptations of the novel. There are also three film adaptations of the novel in Indian languages: ''[[Tere Mere Sapne (1971 film)|Tere Mere Sapne]]'' (1971) in [[Hindi]], ''[[Jiban Saikate (1972)|Jiban Saikate]]'' (1972) in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and ''[[Madhura Swapnam]]'' (1982) in [[Telugu language|Telugu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/IN-FOCUS-Dreaming-of-a-better-tomorrow/articleshow/50086370.cms|title=IN FOCUS - Dreaming of a better tomorrow|work=The Times of India|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 an [[Radio drama|adaptation for radio]] by Christopher Reason was featured as the BBC Radio 4 15 minute drama. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09d9qgn|title=15 Minute Drama, The Citadel|work=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tom Regan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|g|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwNoBYeBW0o Animal rights philosopher Tom Regan on the Late Late show Part 1 of 4]&lt;!--at 1:20--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; November 28, 1938 &amp;ndash; February 17, 2017) was an American philosopher who specialized in [[animal rights]] theory. He was professor emeritus of philosophy at [[North Carolina State University]], where he had taught from 1967 until his retirement in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/exhibits/regan/ "Tom Regan"], North Carolina State University, accessed 4 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regan was the author of numerous books on the philosophy of animal rights, including ''[[The Case for Animal Rights]]'' (1983), one of a handful of studies that have significantly influenced the modern [[animal rights movement]]. In these, he argued that non-human animals are what he called the "subjects-of-a-life", just as humans are, and that, if we want to ascribe value to all human beings regardless of their ability to be rational agents, then to be consistent, we must similarly ascribe it to non-humans.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom. ''The Case for Animal Rights''. University of California Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1985, he served with his wife Nancy as co-founder and co-president of the Culture and Animals Foundation, a nonprofit organization "committed to fostering the growth of intellectual and artistic endeavors united by a positive concern for animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tomregan.info/about-tom-regan/the-culture-and-animals-foundation/| title=The Culture and Animals Foundation | accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal rights==
{{No footnotes|section|date=February 2015}}
{{main article|The Case for Animal Rights}}
In ''The Case for Animal Rights'', Regan argued that non-human animals bear moral [[rights]]. His philosophy aligns broadly within the tradition of [[Immanuel Kant]], though he rejects Kant's idea that respect is due only to [[Rationality|rational]] beings. Regan points out that we routinely ascribe inherent [[Value theory|value]], and thus the right to be treated with [[respect]], to [[human]]s who are not rational, including [[infant]]s and the severely mentally [[Disability|impaired]].

The crucial attribute that all humans have in common, he argues, is not rationality, but the fact that each of us has a life that matters to us; in other words, what happens to us matters to us, regardless of whether it matters to anyone else. In Regan's terminology, we each experience being the [[Subject (philosophy)|"subject-of-a-life."]] If this is the true basis for ascribing inherent value to individuals, to be consistent we must ascribe inherent value, and hence moral rights, to all subjects-of-a-life, whether human or non-human. The basic right that all who possess inherent value have, he argues, is the right never to be treated merely as a means to the ends of others.

In Regan's view, not to be used as a means [[logical consequence|entails]] the right to be treated with respect, which includes the right not to be harmed. This right, however, is not absolute, as, there are times when to respect someone’s right not to be harmed, another’s right not to be harmed must be overridden.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} His philosophy employs principles such as the miniride principle (a.k.a. minimize overriding) and the worse-off principle to deal with these situations.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The miniride principle is that when faced with overriding the rights of many innocent beings versus the rights of few innocent beings&amp;mdash;when each individual involved would be equally harmed&amp;mdash;we should override the rights of the few. The worse-off principle states that, when individuals involved are not harmed in a comparable way given a certain course of action, we should mitigate the situation of those who would be worse-off. Thus, if the harm of a few innocent beings is greater than the harm to many innocent beings, the right action is to override the rights of the many. As this relates to animal rights, Regan asserts the harm in the death of an animal is not tantamount to the harm in the death of a normal, healthy human. This is supposedly because the ending of an animal life entails the loss of fewer opportunities when compared to the loss of a normal, healthy human. According to Regan, there would be more harm in the death of a normal, healthy dog than there would be in the death of a person who was irreversibly [[coma]]tose, as the dog would have more opportunities for satisfaction than the irreversibly comatose human.&lt;ref&gt;''The Case for Animal Rights'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004, p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters argue that Regan's argument for animal rights does not rely on a radical new theory of [[Moral philosophy|ethics]], but that it follows from a consistent application of moral principles and [[Intuition (knowledge)|insights]] that many of us already hold with respect to the ethical treatment of human beings. However, others criticize the lack of certainty with which Regan's "inherent value" or "subject-of-a-life" status can be determined, and note that the sufficient conditions he lists&amp;mdash;for example, having [[Perception|sense-perceptions]], [[belief]]s, desires, [[Motivation|motive]]s, and [[memory]]&amp;mdash;in effect reduce to "similarity to humans".
&lt;!--It's not clear what the following means. Making it invisible until we find out – Advocates of biocentrism such as ethicist Paul Taylor argue that ''all'' individual living beings possess intrinsic value, limiting the rights that could possibly come along with this status unless such ubiquitous human activities as [[eating]], [[horticulture]], and [[antisepsis]] are to be banned.--&gt;
According to Regan, it follows from the ascription to animals of the basic right to be treated with respect that we should abolish the breeding of animals for [[Meat|food]], [[Animal testing|animal experimentation]], and commercial [[hunting]]. Starting as a leather-wearing, circus-visiting meat eater, a series of musings, experiences, and insights led him to conclude he was morally unable to use animals for meat, clothing, or any other purpose that does not respect their rights.

==G. E. Moore scholarship==

In the 1980s, Regan published three books on [[G. E. Moore]]'s philosophy. The first book, ''G. E. Moore: The Early Essays'', is a collection of essays that were originally published between 1897 and 1903, none of which Moore himself anthologized. Regan argues that these papers reveal Moore’s early taste for speculative metaphysics; in "The Nature of Judgment", for example, Moore maintains that "the world consists of concepts", including existence, "which is itself a concept . . . Thus, all that exists . . . is composed of concepts necessarily related to one another in specific manners, and likewise to the concept of existence." In another paper, "Freedom", Moore enthusiastically affirms his agreement with F. H. Bradley, writing: "I can only say that the arguments by which Mr. Bradley has endeavoured to prove the unreality of Time appear to me perfectly conclusive."

Regan’s second book, ''The Elements of Ethics'', is a series of ten lectures Moore delivered in 1898. Large parts of these lectures were carried over by Moore into ''Principia Ethica'' and, Regan maintains, these lectures cast important light on ''Principia’s'' pages.

Regan’s third book, ''Bloomsbury’s Prophet: G. E. Moore and the Development of His Moral Philosophy'', represents Regan’s major contribution to Moorean scholarship. Representative reviews include E. D. Klemke writing that ''Bloomsbury’s Prophet'' is "a marvelous book", while Aurum Stroll writes "[t]he portrait of the man  Moore that Regan gives us is not only unique . . . but it is well done, indeed."

In this book, Regan relies on a trove of unpublished material, housed in the Moore Archive at the University of Cambridge, including Moore’s two dissertations, on Kant’s moral philosophy; correspondence, consisting of letters that Moore wrote as well those he received; scores of papers he read at meetings of the [[Cambridge Conversazione Society]], also known as the Apostles, and at the Sunday Essay Society; and a diary Moore kept throughout his formative years, breaking off on April 19, 1916.

Using these materials, Regan argues that ''Principia''{{’}}s primary purpose was (as Moore wrote) to "humble the Science of Ethics" by exposing the "lies" told by "would-be scientific ethicists" ("Art, Morals, and Religion": May 5, 1901). In Moore’s view, a truly scientific ethic is able to prove very little concerning values, rules, duty, and virtues.

Regarding values: such an ethic cannot establish anything concerning what has intrinsic value—what is good in itself. That must be left to the judgment of individuals who, taking due precautions, ask themselves what things would be good if they were the only things to exist in the world.

Regarding rules of conduct: a truly scientific ethic can at most establish that “a very few rules” (''Principia'', xxii, italics in the original) ought always to be followed. Not even all the rules commended by Common Sense qualify: only “most of those most universally recognized by Common Sense” are possible candidates, and even in their case Moore maintains only that the requisite type of justification “may be possible” (p. xxii, italics in the original).

That being so, almost all our decisions will need to be made without relying on any rule: in almost all cases, Moore writes, “rules of action should not be followed at all” (''Ibid''., p. xiii). In all cases of this sort, individuals should guide their choice “by a direct consideration of the effects which the action may produce” (p.&amp;nbsp;XX), doing what one thinks will promote one’s own interests, as these are enlarged by the lives of others in whom one has “a strong personal interest” (''Ibid''., XX) instead of attempting to satisfy the demands of “a more extended beneficence,” as in “the greatest good for the greatest number.” And of the goods to be aimed at, the more immediate are generally to be preferred to the more distant. In short, in virtually all our activities in our day-to-day life we are at liberty to live and choose without troubling ourselves about whether we are doing what duty, in the form of the rules of morality, requires.

Regarding virtues: a truly scientific ethic should promote the private virtues of prudence, temperance, and industry (the only virtues Moore discusses in ''Principia''), not the (so-called) virtues of beneficence, charity, civic-mindedness, social justice, patriotism, piety, reverence, or altruism. Such an ethic should promote the virtues of the creative self, not the virtues of the conscientious citizen.

On this basis Regan argues that Moore genuinely is “Bloomsbury’s prophet,” advocating, as he does, the values, the rules of conduct, and the virtues that are synonymous with the name, “Bloomsbury.” As Regan notes, “theirs was an anarchy of the bedroom, not the streets.”

Writing in the Library Journal, Leon H. Brody assessed the work as follows.

"Regan's thesis is that an adequate understanding of Moore's ethical philosophy can be achieved only when seen against the backdrop of Bloomsbury--the avant-garde group of free spirits (among whom were Lytton Strachey, Virginia Woolf, and John Maynard Keynes) who met weekly in London between 1905 and 1920. When seen in that light, Regan argues, Moore's thought as expressed in Principia Ethica is a "radical defense of the freedom of the individual to choose," rather than a defense of conformity to the status quo, as is usually assumed. Written with the verve appropriate to its subject, and yet philosophically scrupulous, this book deserves a place in philosophy and cultural history collections in both public and academic libraries."

==Personal life==
Regan and his wife Nancy had two children, Bryan and Karen.&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Philosopher Tom Regan, animal rights author, dies at 78|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/02/17/philosopher-tom-regan-animal-rights-author-dies-at-78.html|accessdate=February 18, 2017|work=Fox News|date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3580">'''Warnock's dilemma''', named for its originator Bryan Warnock, is the problem of interpreting a lack of response to a posting in a [[virtual community]].{{sfn|Holiday|2012|pp=101-103}}  The term originally referred to  [[Electronic mailing list|mailing list discussions]], but has been applied to [[Usenet]] posts, [[blog]]s, [[Internet forum|Web forum]]s, and online content in general.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|p=101}} The dilemma arises because a lack of response does not necessarily imply that no one is interested in the topic, but could also mean for example that readers find the content to be exceptionally good (leaving nothing for commenters to add).{{sfn|Holiday|2012|p=101}}

On many internet forums, only around [[1% rule (Internet culture)|1 percent of users create new posts]], while 9 percent reply and 90 percent are [[lurker]]s that don't contribute to the discussion.&lt;ref name="arthur"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jul/20/guardianweeklytechnologysection2 What is the 1% rule?] by Charles Arthur, ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When no users reply, the original poster has no way of knowing what lurkers think of their contribution.

Warnock's dilemma leads to online writers and publishers adopting more confrontational writing strategies in order to ensure that they will get a response.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|p=102}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Say Everything: How Blogging Began, What It's Becoming, and Why It Matters|page=259

|first=Scott |last=Rosenberg |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this can also lead publishers to avoid producing the kind of content that might fail to generate comments due to its high quality.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|pp=102-103}}  This problem arises particularly with sites that focus on [[viral content]], such as ''[[Buzzfeed]]'' and ''[[Huffington Post]]''.{{sfn|Holiday|2012|pp=102-103}}

==Original description==

{{cquote|The problem with no response is that there are five possible interpretations:

# The post is correct, well-written information that needs no follow-up commentary. There's nothing more to say except "Yeah, what he said."
# The post is complete and utter nonsense, and no one wants to waste the energy or bandwidth to even point this out.
# No one read the post, for whatever reason.
# No one understood the post, but won't ask for clarification, for whatever reason.
# No one cares about the post, for whatever reason.|||Bryan C. Warnock|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.bootstrap/1127 Re: RFCs: two proposals for change] -- Original description of the dilemma&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since Warnock's original description of the dilemma in August 2000, the expression has become used in the [[Perl]] world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/15407 Re: Warnocked?] -- Post to the Perl 6 language list explaining history and uptake of term&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=December 2018}}

'''''Why I am an Atheist''''' is an essay written by Indian revolutionary [[Bhagat Singh]] in 1930 in Lahore Central Jail.&lt;ref&gt;http://scroll.in/article/715660/on-bhagat-singhs-death-anniversary-why-i-am-an-atheist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ahmedabadmirror1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/index.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=78&amp;contentid=2012041820120418214700623bc7c28b | title=Bhagat Singh on atheism and death | publisher=Ahmedabadmirror.com | date=18 April 2012 | accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was a reply to his religious friends who thought Bhagat Singh became an atheist because of his vanity.&lt;ref name="frontline1"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2421/stories/20071102501502500.htm |title=Why I am an atheist |publisher=Frontline.in |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Bhagat Singh 1929 140x190.jpg|thumb|Bhagat Singh in 1929]]
Bhagat Singh was a member of [[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/03/22/stories/2008032251531100.htm | title=Bhagat Singh as seen by Ramasami Periyar | work=The Hindu | date=22 March 2008 | accessdate=18 February 2014 | author=S. Irfan Habib}}&lt;/ref&gt; a revolutionary party in the Indian freedom struggle. He was an atheist who believed in [[communism]], and he wrote several articles on [[anarchism]] and communism for ''Kirti''.&lt;ref name="Ramnath2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maia Ramnath|title=Decolonizing Anarchism: An Antiauthoritarian History of India's Liberation Struggle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dJtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17|date=1 January 2012|publisher=AK Press|isbn=978-1-84935-082-2|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested on 8 April 1929 in connection with the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] bombing case and was sentenced to 14 years life imprisonment. He was re-arrested in connection with the murder of one Saunders, a deputy superintendent of police who was killed by [[Sukhdev Thapar|Sukhdev]], [[Shivaram Rajguru| Rajguru]], and Bhagat Singh in 1928 in retaliation for the death of [[Lala Lajpat Rai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-67th-independence-day-bhagat-singh-not-a-martyr-government/1/299547.html | title=Martyr Bhagat Singh lost in red tape on India's 67th Independence Day | work=India Today | date=14 August 2013 | accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the trial began and he was transferred to Lahore jail. In the jail, on 4 October 1930, [[Randhir Singh (Sikh)|Baba Randhir Singh]], a religious man and member of [[Ghadar Party]] who was convicted in the [[Lahore Conspiracy Case trial|first Lahore conspiracy case]], met Bhagat Singh and tried to incite his belief in God; however, Bhagat Singh did not change his stand. Thereafter, Randhir Singh said "You are giddy with fame and have developed an ego which is standing like a black curtain between you and the God".&lt;ref name="ahmedabadmirror1"/&gt; As a reply to Randhir Singh, he wrote this essay on 5 and 6 October 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main7.asp?filename=op100204LEAD_ARTICLE1.asp | title=Is the BJP turning Marxist-Leninist? | work=Tehelka | date=2 October 2004 | accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 1930, all three of the defendants were convicted in the murder of Saunders and sentenced to death. On 23 March 1931, they were executed by hanging in the Lahore jail (present-day Shadman Chowk or Bhagat Singh Chowk).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/its-now-bhagat-singh-chowk-in-lahore/article3951829.ece | title=It’s now Bhagat Singh Chowk in Lahore | work=The Hindu | date=30 September 2012 | accessdate=18 February 2014 | author=Anita Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
After the death of Singh, the essay was published on 27 September 1931 in Lala Lajpat Rai's English weekly ''The People''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070311/spectrum/book1.htm | title=Understanding Bhagat Singh | work=Tribune India | date=11 March 2007 | accessdate=18 February 2014 | author=V.

=== Tamil version ===
On the request of [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]], [[P. Jeevanandham]] translated the essay to the [[Tamil language]]. The Tamil version of the essay was published in ''[[Kudi Arasu]]'' in 1935. According to Chaman Lal, "at one time after Partition, the English copy of this essay was not found anywhere. It was then re-translated from Tamil to English, and some websites still carry the re-translated English version of this essay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/periyar-admired-bhagat-singh-criticised-gandhiji/article2380792.ece | title=Periyar admired Bhagat Singh, criticised Gandhiji | work=The Hindu | date=22 August 2011 | accessdate=18 February 2014 | author=B.

In the essay, Bhagat Singh discussed his atheism, which did not come because of his vanity.&lt;ref name="frontline1"/&gt; He explained how a religious boy who chanted prayers for hours, became an atheist.&lt;ref name="frontline1"/&gt; He also questioned theists about the existence of God.&lt;ref name="frontline1"/&gt;

The '''World Conference on Human Rights''' was held by the United Nations in Vienna, Austria, on 14 to 25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"&gt;{{cite book | last=Norchi | first=Charles | chapter=Human Rights: A Global Common Interest | editor=Krasno, Jean E. | title=The United Nations: Confronting the Challenges of a Global Society | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | year=2004 | isbn=1-58826-280-4 | page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first human rights conference held since the end of the [[Cold War]].  The main result of the conference was the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]].

==Background==
Although the United Nations had long been active in the field of human rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/humanrightsun/2008/12/20081278493266190.html | title=Timeline: Human Rights Conventions | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vienna conference was only the second global conference to focus exclusively on human rights, with the first having been the [[International Conference on Human Rights]] held in [[Teheran]], [[Iran]], during April–May 1968 to mark the twentieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/l2ptichr.htm | title=Proclamation of Tehran, Final Act of the International Conference on Human Rights, Teheran, 22 April to 13 May 1968 | publisher=U.N. Doc. A/CONF. 32/41 at 3 (1968) via [[University of Minnesota]] Human Rights Library | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vienna conference came at a time when world conferences were popular, with the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] having been held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, in June 1992, and the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], soon following in September 1994.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt; More conferences would follow after that, including the [[Commission for Social Development|World Summit for Social Development]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995 and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing, China, in September 1995.  Such conferences were seen as a way to promote global participation, consultation, and policy formation, and were seen as a likely significant new way to influence the direction of international society.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;

The notion of having a world conference on human rights was first proposed in 1989.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt; The end of the [[Cold War]] brought about the hope that the long stalemate and distortion of United Nations behaviors due to the bipolar superpower confrontation would cease.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;  

In the run-up to the 1993 conference, much of the optimism of the 1989 era was lost.&lt;ref name="boyle-80"/&gt; Preparatory conferences were held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, beginning in 1991, as were a number of regional and satellite meetings.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-80"/&gt; These struggled to produce new ideas that countries could agree upon,&lt;ref name="nyt042593"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/world/a-bleak-assessment-as-rights-meeting-nears.html | title=A Bleak Assessment as Rights Meeting Nears | author=Riding, Alan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=25 April 1993 | pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted differences surrounding the role of state sovereignty, [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), and whether new or strengthened human rights instruments for the UN were feasible and impartial.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; The [[United Nations General Assembly]] was eventually forced to decide upon the conference's agenda in 1992.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-80"/&gt; [[Pierre Sané]], the Secretary General of [[Amnesty International]], was concerned that conference might represent a backwards step for human rights.&lt;ref name="nyt042593"/&gt; He added, "It's not surprising that governments are not overenthusiastic. After all, they are the ones violating human rights."&lt;ref name="nyt042593"/&gt;

==Conference==
The World Conference on Human Rights was attended by representatives of 171 nations and 800 NGOs, with some 7,000 participants overall.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt; This made it the largest gathering ever on human rights.&lt;ref name="boyle-79"&gt;{{cite book | last=Boyle | first=Kevin | authorlink=Kevin Boyle (lawyer)| chapter=Stock-Taking on Human Rights: The World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna 1993 | editor=Beetham, David | title=Politics and Human Rights | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] | year=1995 | isbn=0-631-19666-8 | page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was organised by Human Rights expert John Pace.

There was much discussion ahead of the conference on what could and could not be said during it.  The rules adopted stated that no specific countries or places could be mentioned where human rights abuses were taking place, including those involved in current conflicts such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Angola]], and [[Liberia]], and those subject to ongoing human rights criticism, such as China and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="nyt061493"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/14/world/a-rights-meeting-but-don-t-mention-the-wronged.html | title=A Rights Meeting, but Don't Mention the Wronged | author=Riding, Alan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=14 June 1993 | page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-81"&gt;Boyle, "Stock-Taking on Human Rights", p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, human rights abuses were to be discussed in the abstract only; this led ''[[The New York Times]]'' to state that the conference was taking place "In an atmosphere strangely removed from reality."&lt;ref name="nyt061493"/&gt; In particular, that the ongoing [[Bosnian War]] was taking place only an hour's flight from Vienna testified dramatically that no new era of international cooperation had come into place.&lt;ref name="boyle-80"&gt;Boyle, "Stock-Taking on Human Rights", p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the rules, organizations and demonstrators at the conference's physical site were happy to mention specific ongoing abuses all around the world, with many displaying atrocity photographs in an attempt to out-do each other.&lt;ref name="nyt061693"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/16/world/women-seize-focus-at-rights-forum.html | title=Women Seize Focus at Rights Forum | author=Riding, Alan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=16 June 1993 | page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One person concerned about the [[Polisario Front]] and [[Western Sahara]] situation said, "It's hard to be noticed."&lt;ref name="nyt061693"/&gt;

The conference did have an expansive view of human rights, with efforts made to highlight [[women's rights]], [[indigenous peoples]]' rights, [[minority rights]], and more in the context of universal political and economic rights.&lt;ref name="nyt061493"/&gt; Women's rights in particular gained a strong and effective presence at the conference.&lt;ref name="nyt061693"/&gt;

One fault line at the conference was Western nations who proclaimed a [[moral universalism|universal meaning]] to human rights versus nations who said that human rights needed to be interpreted differently in non-Western cultures and that attempts to impose a universal definition amounted to interference in their internal affairs.&lt;ref name="nyt061493"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt061593"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/world/us-rejects-notion-that-human-rights-vary-with-culture.html | title=U.S. Rejects Notion That Human Rights Vary With Culture | author=Sciolino, Elaine | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=15 June 1993 | page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter group was led by China, [[Syria]] and [[Iran]], and also included a number of Asian nations such as Singapore, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="nyt061593"/&gt; On the opening day of the conference, U.S. Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher]] spoke out strongly against this notion, saying "We cannot let [[cultural relativism]] become the last refuge of [[oppression|repression]]."&lt;ref name="nyt061593"/&gt;

Former [[U.S. House of Representatives]] member and vice presidential candidate [[Geraldine Ferraro]] attended the conference as the alternate U.S. delegate,&lt;ref name="fox-bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,34759,00.html | title=Geraldine Ferraro – Bio | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=5 September 2003 | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the attendees heavily interested in women's rights aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/opinion/human-rights-for-women.html | title=Human Rights for Women | author=[[Geraldine Ferraro|Ferraro, Geraldine]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=10 June 1993 | page=A27 op-ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of pressures from the People's Republic of China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/f9e14159ae1b90f8c125690a005ab864?Opendocument Lettre datée du 24 juin 1993, adressée au Président de la Conférence mondiale sur les droits de l'homme par le Chef adjoint de la délégation chinoise]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[14th Dalai Lama]] was able to give a talk at the conference on [[human responsibilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Antoine Donnet]], ''Tibet mort ou vif'', Édition Gallimard, 1990 ; Nouv. éd. augmentée 1993, {{ISBN|2-07-032802-3}} (''Tibet: Survival in Question'', traduction Tica Broch, Oxford/Zed Books, 1994, {{ISBN|0-19-563573-6}}, {{ISBN|1-85649-130-7}}, {{ISBN|1-85649-129-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetibet.org/about/dalai5 A speech given by His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna, Austria, June 1993.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
{{Main|Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action}}
The key result of the World Conference on Human Rights was the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], which was formulated late in the meeting&lt;ref name="boyle-81"/&gt; and was adopted by consensus of 171 states on 25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; While one possible interpretation sees this document as a "well crafted but empty exhortation", it did come to represent as much of a consensus as could be found on human rights in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="boyle-81"/&gt; And it did in fact set new marks in human rights work in several areas.  It established the interdependence of democracy, economic development, and human rights.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; Specifically, it replaced the Cold War division of Civil and Political Rights (CPR) apart from Economic Social and Cultural rights (ESCR) with the concept of rights being indivisible (you cannot take one type of rights without the other), interdependent (one set of rights needs the other to be realised), and inter-related (that all human rights relate to each other).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part I, para 5&lt;/ref&gt; It called for the creation of instruments to publicize and protect the rights of women, children, and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; It requested more funding for the [[United Nations Center for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="norchi-88"&gt;Norchi, "Human Rights: A Global Common Interest", p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most significantly, it called for a new office, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt;

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] subsequently endorsed the declaration as part of Resolution 48/121.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"/&gt; It also created the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 20 December 1993.

By the early 2000s, all of the explicit establishments recommended by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action had been met in full or in part.&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt; The conference also highlighted the importance that NGOs would continue to play in the human rights infrastructure.&lt;ref name="norchi-88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyle-81"/&gt;

==Reception==
Jincy Willet of ''The New York Times'' said that the book "amuses as much as it informs". Sarah Halzack of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the book "a bit haphazard" although "his self-effacing tone and dry sense of humor help to unify the pieces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/2012/01/09/gIQAXQFrnQ_story.html |title=‘Would It Kill You To Stop Doing That?: A Modern Guide to Manners’ by Henry Alford |author=Sarah Halzack |date=3 February 2012 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Marchand of ''[[National Post]]'' said that "sometimes his humour is a bit strained" although his advice can be "very practical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/01/20/open-book-would-it-kill-you-to-stop-doing-that-by-henry-alford/ |title=Open Book: Would It Kill You to Stop Doing That? by Henry Alford |author=Philip Marchand |date=20 January 2012 |work=[[National Post]] |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
