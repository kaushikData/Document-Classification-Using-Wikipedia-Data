The '''2016 Pokémon World Championships''' was the eighth annual [[Electronic Sports|e-Sport]] invite-only tournament held by [[Play! Pokémon]], a branch of [[The Pokémon Company]] that unites the top ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' [[video game]] and [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]] players from around the world. The event was held at the [[San Francisco Marriott Marquis]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] from August 19 to August 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2016/about/|title=2016 Pokémon World Championship|work=Play! Pokemon|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in the tournament history, the ''[[Pokkén Tournament]]'' invitational was featured alongside the Video Game Championships (VGC) and Trading Card Game (TCG) tournaments. Side events and an official store with event merchandise occurred alongside the event.

The defending Video Game champions were Shoma Honami from [[Japan]] (Masters Division), Mark McQuillan from the [[United Kingdom]] (Senior Division) and Kotone Yasue from Japan (Junior Division).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2015/|title=2015 Pokémon World Championships|work=Play! Pokemon|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defending Trading Card Game champions were Jacob Van Wagner from the [[United States]] (Masters Division), Patrick Martinez from the United States (Senior Division), and Rowan Stavenow from [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2015/|title=2015 Pokémon World Championships|work=Play! Pokémon|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age divisions and qualifications ==
Both the Pokémon VGC and TCG were divided into three age divisions: the ''Junior Division'' (born 2005 or later), the ''Senior Division'' (born between 2001 and 2004), and the ''Masters Division'' (born 2000 or earlier). For the ''[[Pokkén Tournament]]'' invitational, players were grouped into either the ''Senior Division'' (born 2001 or later) or ''Masters Division'' (born 2000 or earlier).

The process of obtaining an invitation is primarily based on Championship Points.&lt;ref name=POKEMONCP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/pokemon-events/pokemon-tournaments/earn-championship-points/|title=Championship Points|work=Play! Pokémon|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players could earn Championship Points by performing in select online and live tournaments held throughout the 2016 season (between September 2015 and July 2016). Players from [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] were excluded from this rule as these countries had their own method of qualification not based on Championship Points.

[[Play! Pokémon]] divided players into five different rating zones: [[US]] and [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[Asia-Pacific]] and [[South Africa]]. Different zones had different Championship Points requirements due to the distribution of events around the world.

There are two possible invitations players could obtain:
* a regular 'Day One' invite, and
* a 'Day Two' invite, which allowed players to acquire a 'Day One' bye and automatically enter the second Swiss tournament.

'Day Two' invites were usually accompanied by travel awards and stipends paid by [[Play! Pokémon]].

=== Trading Card Game Championship qualifications ===

== Tournament structure ==
The Video Game Championships consisted of two Swiss tournaments and one single elimination tournament played across three days.

On Friday (Day 1), all players who earned an invitation without a Day 1 bye were entered into a Swiss tournament, where players with two or fewer losses would advance onto the next round. The second Swiss tournament was then played on Saturday (Day 2), where players who advanced from Day 1 were joined by players who received an invitation with a Day 1 bye.

At the end of the Day 2 Swiss tournament, players with two or fewer losses advanced to play in single elimination rounds until the last two remain. The finals took place on Sunday (Day 3).&lt;ref name=WCSStandings&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.pokemon.com/standings/us/worlds/2016/vg/#9_0_0|title=2016 Pokemon World Chamionships Standings|work=Video Game World Championships Results|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aemilia Scaura''' (ca 100 BC – 82 BC) was the daughter of [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]], a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], and his second wife [[Caecilia Metella Dalmatica]].

By the time of her birth, Scaurus was around 70 and, as ''[[princeps senatus]]'', the speaker of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], was one of the most important politicians of [[Rome]]. After her father's death, Caecilia Metella  married [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. Aemilia was married to [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 67 BC)|Manius Acilius Glabrio]], and she was pregnant. [[Plutarch]] wrote that when Sulla was appointed dictator "he admired [[Pompey]] for his high qualities and thought him a great help in his administration of affairs, he was anxious to attach him to himself by some sort of a marriage alliance. His wife Metella shared his wishes, and together they persuaded Pompey to divorce Antistia and marry Aemilia." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plutarch |author-link=Plutarch |title=Parallel Lives |title-link=Parallel Lives |chapter=Life of Pompey |others=9.1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was tragic, "the young woman died in childbirth at the house of Pompey." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plutarch |author-link=Plutarch |title=Parallel Lives |title-link=Parallel Lives |chapter=Life of Sulla |others=33.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch commented that "This marriage was therefore characteristic of a tyranny, and befitted the needs of Sulla rather than the nature and habits of Pompey..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plutarch |author-link=Plutarch |title=Parallel Lives |title-link=Parallel Lives |chapter=Life of Pompey |others=9.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dugali Ahmed''' or '''Ahmed-paša Dugalić''' ({{floruit}} 1598–1605) was an Ottoman governor of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] (1598–99; 1604) and [[Temeşvar Eyalet]] (1605–?).

'''Alexander IV''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀλέξανδρος Δ΄}}; 323&amp;ndash;309 BC), erroneously called sometimes in modern times '''Aegus''',&lt;ref&gt;The error was caused by a modern misreading, {{lang|grc|ΑΙΓΟΥ}} for {{lang|grc|ΑΛΛΟΥ}}, of the text of [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Canon of Kings]]. See e.g. {{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|volume=1|chapter=s.v.

==Birth==
Alexander IV was the son of [[Alexander the Great]] (a [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[Greeks|Greek]]), and Alexander's wife [[Roxana of Bactria|Roxana]] (a [[Sogdia]]n [[Persians|Persian]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. Z. (2004), ''Chaghatai: the Fabulous Cities and People of the Silk Road'', West Conshokoken: Infinity Publishing, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strachan, Edward and Roy Bolton (2008), ''Russia and Europe in the Nineteenth Century'', London: Sphinx Fine Art, p. 87, {{ISBN|978-1-907200-02-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livius.org. "[http://www.livius.org/articles/person/roxane/ Roxane]." ''Articles on Ancient History''. Page last modified 17 August 2015. Retrieved on 29 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the grandson of [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Because Roxana was pregnant when Alexander the Great died on 11 June 323 BC and the sex of the baby was unknown, there was dissension in the [[Ancient Macedonian military|Macedonian]] army regarding the order of succession. While the [[Hoplite|infantry]] supported the unborn baby's uncle, [[Philip III of Macedon|Philip III]] (who was feeble-minded), the [[chiliarch]] [[Perdiccas]], commander of the elite [[Companion cavalry]], persuaded them to wait in the hope that Roxana's unborn child would be male. The factions compromised, deciding that Perdiccas would rule the Empire as [[regent]] while Philip would reign, but only as a figurehead with no real power. If the child was male, then he would be king. Alexander IV was born in August, 323 BC.

==Regents==
After a severe regency, military failure in [[Egypt]], and mutiny in the army, Perdiccas was assassinated by his senior officers in May or June 321 or 320 BC (problems with Diodorus's chronology have made the year uncertain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Diodorus and the Date of Triparadeisus|journal=The American Journal of Philology|date=Summer 1986|first=Edward M|last=Anson|volume=107|issue=2|pages=208–217|id= |jstor=294603|format=|doi=10.2307/294603|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;), after which [[Antipater]] was named as the new regent at the [[Partition of Triparadisus|Partition]] of [[Triparadeisos|Triparadisus]]. He brought with him Roxana and the two kings to Macedon and gave up the pretence of ruling Alexander's Empire, leaving former provinces in Egypt and Asia under the control of the [[satrap]]s (see [[diadochi]]). When Antipater died in 319 BC he left [[Polyperchon]], a Macedonian general who had served under Philip II and Alexander the Great, as his successor, passing over his own son, [[Cassander]].

==Civil War==
Cassander allied himself with [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy Soter]], [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] and [[Eurydice III of Macedon|Eurydice]], the ambitious wife of king Philip Arrhidaeus, and declared war upon the Regency. Polyperchon was allied with [[Eumenes]] and [[Olympias]].

Although Polyperchon was successful at first, taking control of the Greek cities, his fleet was destroyed by Antigonus in 318 BC. When, after the battle, Cassander assumed full control of Macedon, Polyperchon was forced to flee to [[Epirus]], followed by Roxana and the young Alexander. A few months later, Olympias was able to persuade her relative [[Aeacides of Epirus]] to invade Macedon with Polyperchon. When Olympias took the field, Eurydice's army refused to fight against the mother of Alexander and defected to Olympias, after which Polyperchon and Aeacides retook Macedon. Philip and Eurydice were captured and executed on December 25, 317 BC, leaving Alexander IV king, and Olympias in effective control, as she was his regent.

Cassander returned in the following year (316 BC), conquering Macedon once again. Olympias was immediately executed, while the king and his mother were taken prisoner and held in the citadel of [[Amphipolis]] under the supervision of [[Glaucias of Macedon|Glaucias]]. When the general peace between Cassander, Antigonus, Ptolemy, and [[Lysimachus]] put an end to the [[Diadochi|Third Diadoch War]] in 311 BC, the peace treaty recognized Alexander IV's rights and explicitly stated that when he came of age he would succeed Cassander as ruler.

==Death==
[[File:Tomb III Vergina.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb III in [[Vergina]], probably belonged to Alexander IV]]

Following the treaty, defenders of the [[Argead dynasty]] began to declare that Alexander IV should now exercise full power and that a regent was no longer needed, since he had almost reached the significant age of 14, the age at which a Macedonian noble could become a court page. [[Cassander]]'s response was definitive: to secure his rule, in 309 BC he commanded [[Glaucias of Macedon|Glaucias]] to secretly assassinate the 14-year-old Alexander IV and his mother. The orders were carried out, and they were both poisoned. There is controversy about the exact year of Alexander IV's death because of conflicting sources but the consensus of Hammond and Walbank in &lt;i&gt;A History of Macedonia Vol.3&lt;/i&gt; is that Alexander was killed late in the summer of 309 BC, shortly after his alleged half-brother [[Heracles of Macedon|Heracles]]. However, Green thinks that Heracles was killed after Alexander IV's assassination&lt;ref&gt;Green, Peter. Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age. p44, 2007 Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the royal tombs discovered by the archaeologist Manolis Andronikos in the so-called "Great [[Tumulus]]" in [[Vergina]] in 1977/8 is believed to belong to Alexander IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Macedonian Heritage |url=http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Museums/Archaeological_and_Byzantine/Arx_Bas_Tafoi_Berginas.html |title=Royal Tombs: Vergina |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonia''' (50 BC – ?? ??) was a [[Roman citizenship|Roman]] noblewoman. She was the daughter and only child of [[Antonia Hybrida Minor]] and triumvir [[Mark Antony]]. Her parents were paternal first cousins. Her maternal grandparents were an unnamed Roman woman and politician [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]], while paternal grandparents were [[Julia Antonia]] (third cousin of dictator [[Julius Caesar]]) and [[praetor]] [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]]).

Antonia was the eldest known recorded child of Antony's. Some modern historians consider her to be the first child born to Antony. She was born and raised in [[Rome]]. By 47 BC, Antonia’s parents had divorced because her mother had slept with her father’s friend, the tribune [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella]].

Antonia’s father had arranged for her to be betrothed in 44 BC, to Marcus Aemilius [[Lepidus the Younger]], the son of triumvir [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]. However, for an unknown reason the betrothal was later broken off. In later years, she appeared to have travelled with her father. In 36 BC, Antonia married [[Pythodoros of Tralles]], who was an [[Anatolia]]n [[Greeks|Greek]], who originated from Tralles (modern [[Aydın]], [[Turkey]]). He was extremely wealthy and was a friend to the late triumvir [[Pompey]]. Pythodoros was about 20 years older than Antonia.

The reason why Antony married his daughter off to Pythodoros was to hopefully gain some of Pythodoros’ wealth for his war chest in his campaign to invade [[Parthia]]. This was a testament to Antony’s Eastern perspective, as at that time Antony was married to [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Greek Queen [[Cleopatra VII]] of [[Egypt]] and was living with her at her palace in [[Alexandria]], Egypt.

Antonia’s marriage to Pythodoros and her father’s motive for the marriage to occur horrified the [[Roman Senate]], particularly [[Augustus|Octavian]]. This was among one of the reasons that Octavian in 31 BC, declared war on her father and stepmother. In the following year, her father and stepmother committed suicide when Octavian defeated them and conquered Egypt.

Antonia and Pythodoros settled in Smyrna (modern [[Izmir]], [[Turkey]]). Either in 30 BC or 29 BC, Antonia bore Pythodoros, a daughter and only child [[Pythodorida of Pontus|Pythodorida]], who through her marriages became Queen of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] and [[Cappadocia]]. Pythodorida was born and raised in Smyrna. After that moment, nothing more is known about Antonia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2403">'''Asfar ibn Kurduya''' (also spelled '''Kurdawayh''', '''Kardawayh''' and '''Kurdawaih'''), was a [[Daylamite]] officer who served the [[Buyid dynasty]].

Asfar is first mentioned during the reign of the Buyid ruler [[Adud al-Dawla]], as one of the most prominent officers of the Empire. After the death of Adud al-Dawla in 983, the Buyid Empire was thrown into civil war; the Empire was disputed between his two sons [[Samsam al-Dawla]] and [[Sharaf al-Dawla]]. Samsam al-Dawla ruled [[Iraq]], while Sharaf al-Dawla ruled [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kerman Province|Kerman]].

In 986, Asfar rebelled against Samsam al-Dawla, and changed his allegiance to Sharaf al-Dawla. However, Asfar quickly changed his mind, and declared allegiance to the latter's other brother [[Baha' al-Dawla|Abu Nasr Firuz Kharshadh]], who was shortly given the ''[[laqab]]'' of "Baha' al-Dawla." However, Samsam al-Dawla, with the aid of [[Fuladh ibn Manadhar]], suppressed the rebellion, and imprisoned Baha al-Dawla. After this event, Asfar is no longer mentioned.

'''Dame Jocelyn Barbara Hepworth''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DBE}} (10 January 1903&amp;nbsp;– 20 May 1975) was an English artist and sculptor. Her work exemplifies [[Modernism]] and in particular modern sculpture. She was one of the few female artists of her generation to achieve international prominence.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; Along with artists such as [[Ben Nicholson]] and [[Naum Gabo]], Hepworth was a leading figure in the colony of artists who resided in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] during the [[Second World War]].

==Early life==
Jocelyn Barbara Hepworth was born on 10 January 1903 in [[Wakefield]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the eldest child of Gertrude and [[Herbert Hepworth]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Her father was a civil engineer for the West Riding County Council, who in 1921 became County Surveyor.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Hepworth attended [[Wakefield Girls' High School]], where she was awarded music prizes at the age of twelve as noted by Sophie Bowness in "Rhythm of the Stones:  Barbara Hepworth and Music"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Barbara Hepworth: Centenary |last= |first= |publisher=Tate Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=1-85437-479-6 |location= |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hepworth1970"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Barbara |last1=Hepworth |title=Barbara Hepworth: A Pictorial Autobiography |publisher=Praeger Publishers |date=1970 |edition=1st |location=New York |lccn=73-99496}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won a scholarship to and studied at the [[Leeds School of Art]] from 1920. It was there that she met her fellow student, [[Henry Moore]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; They became friends and established a friendly rivalry that lasted professionally for many years. Hepworth was the first to sculpt the pierced figures that are characteristic of works by both. They would lead in the path to modernism in sculpture.

Despite attempting to gain a position in what was a male-dominated environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Festing |first=Sally |title=Barbara Hepworth: A Life of Forms |date=1995 |pages=xviii, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hepworth successfully won a county scholarship to attend the [[Royal College of Art]] (RCA) in London, and studied there from 1921 until she was awarded the diploma of the Royal College of Art in 1924.&lt;ref name="ccc" /&gt;

==Early career==
Following her studies at the RCA, Hepworth travelled to [[Florence]], Italy, in 1924 on a [[West Riding]] Travel Scholarship.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; Hepworth was also the runner-up for the [[Prix-de-Rome]], which the sculptor [[John Skeaping]] won.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; After travelling with him to Siena and Rome, Hepworth married Skeaping on 13 May 1925 in Florence.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In Italy, Hepworth learned how to carve marble from the master sculptor, Giovanni Ardini.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Hepworth and Skeaping returned to London in 1926, where they exhibited their works together from their flat.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Their son Paul was born in London in 1929.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;
Her early work was highly interested in abstraction and art movements on the continent. In 1933, Hepworth travelled with [[Ben Nicholson]] to France, where they visited the studios of [[Jean Arp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Constantin Brâncuşi]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Hepworth later became involved with the Paris-based art movement, [[Abstraction-Création]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In 1933, Hepworth co-founded the [[Unit One]] art movement with Nicholson and [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], the critic [[Herbert Read]], and the architect [[Wells Coates]].&lt;ref name=nash/&gt; The movement sought to unite Surrealism and abstraction in British art.&lt;ref name=nash/&gt;

Hepworth also helped raise awareness of continental artists amongst the British public. In 1937, she designed the layout for ''[[Circle: An International Survey of Constructivist Art]]'', a 300-page book that surveyed Constructivist artists and that was published in London and edited by Nicholson, [[Naum Gabo]], and [[Leslie Martin]].&lt;ref name=peggy/&gt;

Hepworth married Nicholson on 17 November 1938 at [[Hampstead]] Register Office in north London, following his divorce from his wife [[Winifred Nicholson|Winifred]].&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; The couple had triplets in 1934, Rachel, Sarah, and Simon. Rachel and [[Simon Nicholson|Simon]] also became artists. The couple divorced in 1951.&lt;ref name=riggs/&gt;

==St Ives==
Hepworth, Nicholson and their children went to live in Cornwall at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;

Hepworth lived in Trewyn Studios in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] from 1949 until her death in 1975.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; She said that "Finding Trewyn Studio was sort of magic. Here was a studio, a yard, and garden where I could work in open air and space."&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; St Ives had become a refuge for many artists during the war. On 8 February 1949, Hepworth and Nicholson co-founded the [[Penwith Society of Arts]] at the Castle Inn; nineteen artists were founding members, including [[Peter Lanyon]] and [[Bernard Leach]].
&lt;ref name=penwith/&gt;

Hepworth was also a skilled draughtsman. After her daughter Sarah was hospitalised in 1944, she struck up a close friendship with the surgeon Norman Capener.&lt;ref name="pallant2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbara Hepworth: The Hospital Drawings  27th November 2012|url=http://pallant.org.uk/about1/press-office/press-releases/2012/barbara-hepworth-hospital-drawings|website=pallant.org.uk|publisher=Pallant House Gallery|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Capener's invitation, she was invited to view surgical procedures and, between 1947–1949, she produced nearly eighty drawings of operating rooms in chalk, ink, and pencil.&lt;ref name="pallant2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hepburn2013"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Tate| isbn = 978-1-84976-165-9| last = Hepburn| first = Nathaniel| title = Barbara Hepworth: The Hospital Drawings| location = New York, NY| date = 3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hepworth was fascinated by the similarities between surgeons and artists, stating: "There is, it seems to me, a close affinity between the work and approach of both physicians and surgeons, and painters and sculptors."&lt;ref name="pallant2012"/&gt;

In 1950, works by Hepworth were exhibited in the British Pavilion at the XXV [[Venice Biennale]]&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; alongside works by [[Matthew Smith (painter)|Matthew Smith]] and [[John Constable]].&lt;ref name=british/&gt; The 1950 Biennale was the last time that contemporary British artists were exhibited alongside artists from the past.&lt;ref name=british/&gt; Two early public commissions, ''[[Contrapunctal Forms]]'' and ''[[Turning Forms]]'', were exhibited at the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951.

During this period, Hepworth moved away from working only in stone or wood and began to work with bronze and clay.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; Hepworth often used her garden in St Ives, which she designed with her friend the composer [[Priaulx Rainier]], to view her large-scale bronzes.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;

===Death of son Paul===
Her eldest son, Paul, was killed on 13 February 1953 in a plane crash while serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] in Thailand.&lt;ref name=stephens/&gt; A memorial to him, ''Madonna and Child'', is in the [[St Ia's Church, St Ives|parish church of St Ives]].&lt;ref name=bio1/&gt;

Exhausted, in part from her son's death, Hepworth travelled to Greece with her good friend [[Margaret Gardiner (artist)|Margaret Gardiner]] in August 1954.&lt;ref name=stephens/&gt; They visited [[Athens]], [[Delphi]], and many of the [[Aegean Islands]].&lt;ref name=stephens/&gt;

When Hepworth returned to St Ives from Greece in August 1954, she found that Gardiner had sent her a large shipment of Nigerian [[guarea]] hardwood.&lt;ref name = stephens/&gt; Although she received only a single tree trunk, Hepworth noted that the shipment from Nigeria to the Tilbury docks came in at 17 tons.&lt;ref name = stephens/&gt; Between 1954–1956 Hepworth sculpted six pieces out of guarea wood, many of which were inspired by her trip to Greece, such as "Corinthos" (1954) and "Curved Form (Delphi)" (1955).&lt;ref name = stephens/&gt;

==Late career==
The artist greatly increased her studio space when she purchased the Palais de Danse, a cinema and dance studio, that was across the street from Trewyn in 1960. She used this new space to work on large-scale commissions.&lt;ref name=sophie/&gt;

Hepworth also experimented with [[lithography]] in her late career. She produced two lithographic suites with the Curwen Gallery and its director Stanley Jones, one in 1969 and one in 1971.&lt;ref name=behrman/&gt; The latter was entitled "The Aegean Suite" (1971) and was inspired by Hepworth's trip to Greece in 1954 with [[Margaret Gardiner (artist)|Margaret Gardiner]].&lt;ref name="hepworthwakefield"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbara Hepworth: Graphic works 26 April 2013 – 7 February 2014|url=http://www.hepworthwakefield.org/whatson/barbara-hepworth-graphic-works|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508054016/http://www.hepworthwakefield.org/whatson/barbara-hepworth-graphic-works/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 May 2013|website=hepworthwakefield.org|publisher=The Hepworth Wakefield|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist also produced a set of lithographs entitled "Opposing Forms" (1970) with [[Marlborough Fine Art]] in London.&lt;ref name="hepworthwakefield"/&gt;

Barbara Hepworth died in an accidental fire at her Trewyn studios on 20 May 1975 at the age of 72.&lt;ref name="barbarahepworth.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowness|first1=Sophie|title=Biography|url=http://barbarahepworth.org.uk/biography/|website=barbarahepworth.org.uk|publisher=Sophie Bowness|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissions==
In 1951 Hepworth was commissioned by the Arts Council to create a piece for the [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref name=bio9/&gt; The resulting work featured two Irish limestone figures entitled, "Contrapuntal Forms" (1950), which was displayed on London's South Bank.&lt;ref name=bio9/&gt; To complete the large-scale piece Hepworth hired her first assistants, Terry Frost, Denis Mitchell, and John Wells.&lt;ref name=bio9/&gt;

From 1949 onwards she worked with assistants, sixteen in all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Festing|first=Sally|title=Barbara Hepworth: A Life of Forms|year=1995|pages=xx, 185–6, 197, 214, 219–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her most prestigious works is ''[[Single Form]]'',&lt;ref name=bio2/&gt; which was made in memory of her friend and collector of her works, the former Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], and which stands in the plaza of the United Nations building in New York City.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; It was commissioned by Jacob Blaustein, a former United States delegate to the U.N., in 1961 following Hammarskjöld's death in a plane crash.&lt;ref name=un/&gt;

==Controversy==
On 20 December 2011, her 1969 sculpture ''[[Two Forms (Divided Circle)|Two Forms]]'' was stolen, from its plinth in [[Dulwich Park]], [[South London]]. Suspicions are that the theft was by [[scrap metal]] thieves. The piece, which had been in the park since 1970, was insured for £500,000, a spokesman for [[Southwark Council]] said.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt;

One of the edition of six of her 1964 bronze sculpture, ''Rock Form (Porthcurno)'', was removed from the [[Mander Centre]] in [[Wolverhampton]] in the spring of 2014 by its owners, the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and Dalancey Estates. Its sudden disappearance led to questions in Parliament in September 2014. [[Paul Uppal]], Member of Parliament for [[Wolverhampton South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton South West]] said: "When the ''Rock Form'' was donated by the [[Mander family]], it was done so in the belief it would be enjoyed and cherished by the people of Wolverhampton for generations... It belongs to, and should be enjoyed by, the City of Wolverhampton." The sculpture has since been loaned to the city by RBS and can be seen in Wolverhampton City Art Gallery.

==Recognition==
Hepworth was awarded the Grand Prix at the 1959 São Paulo Bienal.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; She also was awarded the Freedom of St Ives award in 1968 as an acknowledgment of her significant contributions to the town.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; She was awarded honorary degrees from Birmingham (1960), Leeds (1961), Exeter (1966), Oxford (1968), London (1970), and Manchester (1971).&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; She was appointed CBE in 1958 and DBE in 1965.&lt;ref name=alan/&gt;&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt; In 1973 she was elected an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref name=aaal/&gt;

Following her death, her studio and home in St Ives became the [[Barbara Hepworth Museum]], which came under control of the [[Tate]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;

In 2011, [[The Hepworth Wakefield]] opened in Hepworth's hometown of [[Wakefield]], England. The Museum was designed by the famed architect [[David Chipperfield]].&lt;ref name="hepworthwakefield_about"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our gallery|url=http://www.hepworthwakefield.org/about/history/|website=hepworthwakefield.org|publisher=The Hepworth Wakefield|accessdate=11 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128015621/http://www.hepworthwakefield.org/about/history/|archivedate=28 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 it was announced that [[Tate Britain]] was to stage the first big London show of Hepworth's work since 1968. It would bring together more than 70 of her works, including the major abstract carvings and bronzes for which she is best known. It would also include unseen photographs from the Hepworth archive, held by the Tate, including a self-[[photogram]] created in the 1930s and experimental photographic collages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/19/tate-britain-barbara-hepworth-exhibition-sculptor-london|title=Tate Britain brings Barbara Hepworth out of the shadows and back in focus|author=Mark Brown|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''baykok''' (or '''pau'guk''', '''paguk''', '''baguck'''; '''''bakaak''''' in the [[Ojibwe language]] and '''''pakàk''''' in the [[Algonquin language]]) is a malevolent [[spirit]] from the [[mythology]] of the [[Ojibwa]]y nation.

==In traditional culture==

The Baykok is a character from the [[Anishinaabe]] [[Anishinaabe traditional beliefs#Aadizookaan|''aadizookaan'']] (traditional stories). It is said to fly through the forests of the [[Great Lakes]] region.  The cries of Baykok are also described as being shrill. Described as "Death" in ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'', it is said to appear as an extremely emaciated [[skeleton]]-like figure, with thin translucent skin and glowing red points for eyes. The Baykok only preys upon warriors, but does so ruthlessly, using invisible [[arrow]]s or beating its prey to death with a club. The Baykok, after paralyzing or killing its prey, then devours the liver of its victim. Baykok was also said to approach a sleeping hunter, gently cut an opening in the chest and remove a piece of the stomach, without waking the victim. &lt;ref name="McGowen"&gt;{{cite book| title=Encyclopedia of Legendary Creatures |author=Tom McGowen | publisher=Rand McNally| year=1981| pages=12| isbn=978-0528824029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''bakaak'' in the [[Anishinaabe language]] means "skeleton" in the sense of "bones draped in skin" rather than "bare-bones", such that it lends itself to words like ''bakaakadozo'', meaning "to be thin/skinny/poor", and ''bakaakadwengwe'', meaning "to have a lean/thin face". The name ''Bakaak'' occasionally appears as ''Bekaak'' (reflected in [[English language|English]] as "Baykok"), which may be a shortening of ''bekaakadwaabewizid'', meaning "an extremely thin being".

The description of ''Bakaak'''s shrill cries (''bagakwewewin'', literally meaning "clear/distinct cries") is a pun of its name. The method the ''Bakaak'' uses to subdue its victim is another pun of its name: the word for "to beat using a club" is ''baagaakwaa'ige''. A similar construct is found in the name for the basketry splints called ''baagaako'igan'', prepared by pounding [[Fraxinus nigra|black ash]]. Yet another pun on the name is the way the ''Bakaak'' "flings its victim's chest open" (''baakaakwaakiganezh'') to devour the victim's liver.

==In popular culture==

First introduced to the non-Anishinaabe public through ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'', the baykok is occasionally referenced in modern fiction. Elliot James' novel 'Daring' features a bakaak which hunts werewolves.

[[File:Bellum omnium contra omnes.png|thumb|The ''Præfatio'' (Preface) of ''De Cive'' where the phrase ''bellum omnium contra omnes'' appears for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=22dEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA11-IA16&amp;dq=%22bellum+o-mnium+contra+omnes%22 See] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Taken from the revised edition printed in 1647 at Amsterdam (''apud L. Elzevirium'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=22dEAAAAcAAJ See] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''{{lang|la|Bellum omnium contra omnes}}''''', a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase meaning "the war of all against all", is the description that [[Thomas Hobbes]] gives to [[Human condition|human existence]] in the [[state of nature]] [[thought experiment]] that he conducts in ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642) and ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651). The common modern English usage is a war of "each against all" where war is rare and terms such as "competition" or "struggle" are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/71/0425.html|title=Each Against All|author=[[Charles Fourier]]|editor=[[Upton Sinclair]]| year=1915|edition=1st |work=[[Bartleby.com]]|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hobbes' use==
In [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] itself,&lt;ref name=Lv &gt;{{cite book|title=Leviathan |author=[[Thomas Hobbes]] |editor-first = Hermann |editor-last =Klenner |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KJJ1HkxT_hoC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Meiner Verlag |location=[[Hamburg]] |year=2005 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=KJJ1HkxT_hoC&amp;pg=610&amp;dq=%22a+warre,+as+is+of+every+man,+against+every+man%22+%22a+perpetuall+warre+of+every+man+against+his+neighbour%22+%22bellum+omnium+in+omnes%22+%22bellum+omnium+contra+omnes%22 610] |isbn=978-3-787-31699-1| id={{ISBN|3-78731699-X}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] speaks of 'warre of every one against every one',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=BPtdfEZ2iDcC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22Warre+of+every+one+against+every+one%22 Chapter 14].&lt;/ref&gt; of 'a war [...] of every man against every man'&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=BPtdfEZ2iDcC&amp;q=%22of+every+man+against+every+man%22 Chapters 13-14].&lt;/ref&gt; and of 'a perpetuall warre of every man against his neighbour',&lt;ref name=Lv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=BPtdfEZ2iDcC&amp;q=%22a+perpetuall+warre+of+every+man+against+his+neighbour%22 Chapter 24].&lt;/ref&gt; but the Latin phrase occurs in ''[[De Cive]]'':
{{Quote|[...] ''ostendo primo conditionem hominum extra societatem civilem, quam conditionem appellare liceat statum naturæ, aliam non esse quam bellum omnium contra omnes; atque in eo bello jus esse omnibus in omnia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22ostendo+primo+conditionem+hominum+extra+societatem+civilem,+quam+conditionem+appellare+liceat+statum+naturae,+aliam+non+esse+quam+bellum+omnium+contra+omnes+;+atque+in+eo+bello+jus+esse+omnibus+in+omnia%22 ''Præefatio'' ("Preface")].&lt;/ref&gt;

I demonstrate, in the first place, that the state of men without civil society (which state we may properly call the state of nature) is nothing else but a mere war of all against all; and in that war all men have equal right unto all things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22I+demonstrate+in+the+first+place,+that+the+state+of+men+without+civil+society+(which+state+we+may+properly+call+the+state+of+nature)+is+nothing+else+but+a+mere+war+of+all+against+all;+and+in+that+war+all+men+have+equal+right+unto+all+things%22 English translation] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later on, two slightly modified versions are presented in [[De Cive|''Libertas'' (liberty)]]:
{{Quote|[...] ''Status hominum naturalis antequam in societatem coiretur, bellum fuerit; neque hoc simpliciter, sed bellum omnium in omnes.''&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22status+hominum+naturalis+antequam+in+societatem+coiretur,+bellum+fuerit;+neque+hoc+simpliciter,+sed+bellum+omnium%22%22in+omnes%22 Chapter 1, section 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural state of men, before they entered into society, was a mere war, and that not simply, but a war of all men against all men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor%3A%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22The+natural+state+of+men,+before+they+entered+into+society,+was+a+mere+war,+and+that+not+simply,+but+a+war+of+all+men+against+all+men%22 English translation] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|''Nam unusquisque naturali necessitate bonum sibi appetit, neque est quisquam qui bellum istud omnium contra omnes, quod tali statui naturaliter adhæret, sibi existimat esse bonum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22Nam+unusquisque+naturali+necessitate+bonum+sibi+appetit,+neque+est+quisquam+qui+bellum+istud+omnium+contra+omnes,+quod+tali+statui+naturaliter+adhaeret,+sibi+existimat+esse+bonum%22 Chapter 1, section 13].&lt;/ref&gt;

For every man by natural necessity desires that which is good for him: nor is there any that esteems a war of all against all, which necessarily adheres to such a state, to be good for him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22De+Cive%22%22For+every+man+by+natural+necessity+desires+that+which+is+good+for+him%3A+nor+is+there+any+that+esteems+a+war+of+all+against+all%2C+which+necessarily+adheres+to+such+a+state%2C+to+be+good+for+him%22 English translation] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In chapter XIII of ''Leviathan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html |title=Chapter XIII - Of the Natural Condition of Mankind as Concerning Their Felicity and Misery |author=Thomas Hobbes |date= |work=bartleby.com |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes explains the concept with these words:
{{Quote|Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called War; and such a war as is of every man against every man.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22Hereby+it+is+manifest+that+during+the+time+men+live+without+a+common+Power+to+keep+them+all+in+awe,+they+are+in+that+condition+which+is+called+War;+and+such+a+war+as+is+of+every+man+against+every+man%22 Occurrences] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] In such condition there is no place for Industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual Fear, and danger of violent death; And the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22In+such+condition+there+is+no+place+for+Industry,+because+the+fruit+thereof+is+uncertain:+and+consequently+no+Culture+of+the+Earth;+no+Navigation,+nor+use+of+the+commodities+that+may+be+imported+by+Sea;+no+commodious+Building;+no+Instruments+of+moving+and+removing+such+things+as+require+much+force;+no+Knowledge+of+the+face+of+the+Earth;+no+account+of+Time;+no+Arts;+no+Letters;+no+Society;+and+which+is+worst+of+all,+continual+Fear,+and+danger+of+violent+death;+And+the+life+of+man+solitary,+poor,+nasty,+brutish,+and+short%22 ''Ibid.'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The thought experiment places people in a pre-social condition, and theorizes what would happen in such a condition. According to Hobbes, the outcome is that people choose to enter a [[social contract]], giving up some of their liberties in order to enjoy peace. This thought experiment is a test for the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimation]] of a [[Sovereign state|state]] in fulfilling its role as "[[sovereignty|sovereign]]" to guarantee social order, and for comparing different types of states on that basis.

Hobbes distinguishes between war and battle: war does not only consist of actual battle; it points to the situation in which one knows there is a 'Will to contend by Battle'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22+Leviathan+%22Will+to+contend+by+Battle%22 ''Ibid.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later uses==
In his ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785) [[Thomas Jefferson]] uses the phrase ''bellum omnium in omnia'' ("war of all things against all things," assuming ''omnium'' is intended to be neuter like ''omnia'') as he laments that the constitution of that state was twice at risk of being sacrificed to the nomination of a [[dictator]] after the manner of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notes on the State of Virginia|author=[[Thomas Jefferson]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FlEVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher=Lilly and Wait | location=Boston| year=1832|page=[https://books.google.com/?id=FlEVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22ad+libitum+into+any+other+form+of+government+for+precedents+to+rule+us+by,+for+what+oppression+may+not+a+precedent+be+found+in+this+world+of+the+bellum+omnium+in+omnia?%22 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the phrase is used by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]].
* In ''[[On the Jewish Question]]'' (1843-4):
{{Quote|Religion has become the spirit of ''[[civil society]]'', of the sphere of egoism, of ''bellum omnium contra omnes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/+%22Karl+Marx%22+%22On+the+Jewish+Question%22+%22Religion+has+become+the+spirit+of+civil+society,+of+the+sphere+of+egoism,+of+bellum+omnium+contra+omnes.%22 |title=On The Jewish Question - Works of Karl Marx 1844 |date= |work= |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* In ''[[Grundrisse|Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1857-8):
{{quote|One could just as well deduce from this abstract phrase that each individual reciprocally blocks the assertion of the others' interests, so that, instead of a general affirmation this war of all against all produces a general negation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch03.htm+%22One+could+just+as+well+deduce+from+this+abstract+phrase+that+each+individual+reciprocally+blocks+the+assertion+of+the+others%E2%80%99+interests,+so+that,+instead+of+a+general+affirmation+this+war+of+all+against+all+produces+a+general+negation%22 |title=Grundrisse: Notebook I – The Chapter on Money|author=|date= |work= |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|It is remarkable how [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] rediscovers, among the beasts and plants, the society of England with its division of labour, competition, opening up of new markets, 'inventions' and [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthusian]] 'struggle for existence'.

* In a letter to [[Pyotr Lavrov]] (London, 12-17 November 1875), Engels is expressed clearly against any attempt to legitimize the trend anthropomorphizing human nature to the distorted view of natural selection:
{{Quote|The whole Darwinists teaching of the struggle for existence is simply a transference from society to living nature of Hobbes's doctrine of ''bellum omnium contra omnes'' and of the bourgeois-economic doctrine of competition together with Malthus's theory of population.

'''Biorobotics''' is a term that loosely covers the fields of [[cybernetics]], [[bionics]] and even [[genetic engineering]] as a collective study.

Biorobotics is often used to refer to a real subfield of [[robotics]]: studying how to make robots that emulate or simulate living biological organisms mechanically or even chemically. 

The term is also used in a reverse definition: making biological organisms as manipulatable and functional as robots, or making biological organisms as components of robots. In the latter sense, biorobotics can be referred to as a [[theoretical]] discipline of comprehensive genetic engineering in which organisms are created and designed by artificial means. The creation of life from non-living matter for example, would be biorobotics. The field is in its infancy and is sometimes known as [[synthetic biology]] or [[bionanotechnology]].

== Bio-inspired robotics ==
{{Main|Bio-inspired robotics}}
Bio-inspired robotics is the practice of making robots that are inspired by real biological systems, while being simpler and more effective. In contrast, the resemblance of [[animatronics]] to biological organisms is usually only in general shape and form.

A biological brain, grown from cultured neurons which were originally separated, has been developed as the neurological entity subsequently embodied within a robot body by [[Kevin Warwick]] and his team at [[University of Reading]]. The brain receives input from sensors on the robot body and the resultant output from the brain provides the robot's only motor signals.

The '''blood eagle''' is a ritualized method of [[capital punishment|execution]], detailed in late [[skald|skaldic poetry]]. According to the two instances mentioned in the [[Saga]]s, the victims (in both cases members of [[royal families]]) were placed in a prone position, their ribs severed from the spine with a sharp tool, and their lungs pulled through the opening to create a pair of “wings”. There is continuing debate about whether the ritual was a literary invention, a mistranslation of the original texts, or an authentic historical practice.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Frank | first =Roberta | title =Viking atrocity and Skaldic verse: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle | journal =English Historical Review | volume =XCIX | issue =CCCXCI | pages =332–343 | publisher =Oxford Journals | date =1984 | url =http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/XCIX/CCCXCI/332.full.pdf+html | doi =10.1093/ehr/XCIX.CCCXCI.332 | accessdate = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tracy"&gt;{{cite book| last =Tracy| first =Larissa| title =Torture and Brutality in Medieval Literature: Negotiations of National Identity| publisher =DS Brewer| date =2012| location =| pages =109–111| url =http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewitem.asp?idproduct=13853| isbn =9781843842880| access-date =2015-03-30| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194210/http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewitem.asp?idproduct=13853#| archive-date =2015-09-23| dead-url =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dash"&gt;{{cite web| last =Dash| first =Mike| authorlink =Mike Dash| title =The Vengeance of Ivarr the Boneless| website =Smithsonian.com| publisher =Smithsonian| date =18 March 2013| url =http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-vengeance-of-ivarr-the-boneless-4002654/| accessdate = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounts==
The blood eagle ritual killing rite appears in just two instances in Norse literature, plus oblique references some have interpreted as referring to the same ritual. The primary versions share certain commonalities: the victims are both noblemen (Halfdan Haaleg or "Long-leg" was a prince; [[Ælla of Northumbria]] a king) and both of the executions were in retaliation for the murder of a father.

===Einarr and Halfdan ===
{{wikisource|Heimskringla/Harald Harfager's Saga#Halfdan Haleg's Death.}}
In the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'', the blood eagle is described as a sacrifice to [[Odin]]. [[Torf-Einarr]] has [[Harald Fairhair]]'s son [[Halfdan Long-Leg]] ritually executed:

{{quote|''Þar fundu  þeir Hálfdan hálegg, ok lèt Einarr rísta örn á baki honum með sverði, ok skera rifin öll frá hrygginum ok draga þar út lúngun, ok gaf hann Óðni til sigrs sèr.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/orkneyingasagaa00dasegoog|title=Orkneyinga saga and Magnus saga, with appendices, Volume 1|last=Guðbrandur Vigfússon|first=Sir George Webbe Dasent|publisher=H.M.S.O., 1887|others=Oxford University|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einarr made them carve an eagle on his back with a sword, and cut the ribs all from the backbone, and draw the lungs there out, and gave him to Odin for the victory he had won.&lt;ref name="Dasent"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Dasent| first =G.W.| title = Icelandic Sagas and Other Historical Documents Relating to the Settlements and Dsecents of the Northmen on the British Isles Vol III - The Orkneyinger's Saga| journal =Rerum Britannicarum Medii Ævi Scriptores, Or, Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland During the Middle Ages| volume =88| issue =3| pages =xxvi, 8–9| publisher =Great Britain.

[[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Heimskringla]]'' contains an account of the same event described in ''Orkneyinga saga'', with Einarr actually performing the deed himself:

{{quote|''Þá gékk Einarr jarl til Hálfdanar; hann reist örn á baki honum með þeima hætti, at hann lagði sverði á hol við hrygginn ok reist rifin öll ofan alt á lendar, dró þar út lungun; var þat bani Hálfdanar.''&lt;ref name="Heimskingla.no"&gt;

Afterwards, Earl Einarr went up to Halfdan and cut the "blood eagle" on his back, in this fashion that he thrust his sword into his chest by the backbone and severed all the ribs down to the loins, and then pulled out the lungs; and that was Halfdan's death.&lt;ref name="Hollander"&gt;

=== Ivar and King Ælla ===
In ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|Þáttr af Ragnars sonum]]'' (the "Tale of Ragnar's sons"),  [[Ivar the Boneless]] has captured king [[Ælla of Northumbria]], who had killed Ivar's father [[Ragnar Loðbrók]]. The killing of Ælla, after a battle for control of [[York]], is described thus:
 
{{quote|They caused the bloody eagle to be carved on the back of Ælla, and they cut away all of the ribs from the spine, and then they ripped out his lungs.}}
&lt;!--Some sources on-line mistakenly ascribe to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' the text from ''ßáttr af Ragnars sonum'' mentioned above. The relevant year (867) of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', however, says merely:
{{quote|{{lang|ang|Her for se here of East Englum ofer Humbre muþan to Eoforwicceastre on Norþhymbre, ⁚ þær wæs micel ungeþuærnes þære þeode betweox him selfum, ⁚ hie hæfdun hiera cyning aworpenne Osbryht, ⁚ ungecyndne cyning underfengon Ællan; ⁚ hie late on geare to þam gecirdon þæt hie wiþ þone here winnende wærun, ⁚ hie þeah micle fierd gegadrodon, ⁚ þone here sohton æt Eoforwicceastre, ⁚ on þa ceastre bræcon, ⁚ hie sume inne wurdon, ⁚ þær was ungemetlic wæl geslægen Norþanhymbra, sume binnan, sume butan; ⁚ þa cyningas begen ofslægene, ⁚ sio laf wiþ þone here friþ nam; ⁚ þy ilcan geare gefor Ealchstan biscep, ⁚ he hæfde þæt bisceprice .l. wintra æt Scireburnan, ⁚ his lic liþ þær on tune.}}

[Translation:] Here the [[Viking]] enemy army went forth from [[East Anglia]] over the mouth of the [[Humber]] to York town in [[Northumbria]], and there was there great discord of the people among themselves, and they had their king [[Osberht of Northumbria|Osberht]] overthrown, and accepted a strange king Ælla; and they late in the year turned to fighting against the enemy army, and they gathered a great army, and they sought the enemy army at York, and broke into the town, and some of them got in, and there was an unmeasurable slaughter of Northumbrians, some inside, some outside; and '''both kings were slain''', and the survivors made peace with the enemy army; and in the same year [[bishop]] Ealhstān died, who had the [[diocese|bishopric]] 50 winters at [[Sherborne]], and his body lies in the town.}} --&gt;

The blood eagle is referred to by the eleventh-century poet [[Sigvatr Þórðarson]], who, some time between 1020 and 1038, wrote a skaldic verse named ''[[Knútsdrápa]]'' that recounts and establishes [[Ivar the Boneless]] as having killed Ælla and subsequently cutting his back.

Sighvatr's skaldic verse in [[Old Norse]]:
{|
! Original
! Literal translation
! Suggested reordering
|-
| style="padding-right:1em" | {{lang|non|&lt;poem&gt;Ok Ellu bak,
At lét hinn’s sat,
Ívarr, ara,
Iorví, skorit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skaldic.arts.usyd.edu.au/db.php?table=poems&amp;id=356 Knútsrápra by Sigvatr Þórðarson], ''Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
| style="padding-right:1em" |&lt;poem&gt;And Ella’s back,
at had the one who dwelt
Ívarr, with eagle,
York, cut.&lt;/poem&gt;
|&lt;poem&gt;And Ívarr, the one
who dwelt at York,
had Ella's back
cut with [an] eagle.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

Skaldic verse, a common medium of Norse poets, was meant to be cryptic and allusive, and the idiomatic nature of Sighvatr's poem as a description of what has become known as the blood eagle is a matter of historical contention, particularly since in Norse imagery the eagle was strongly associated with blood and death.

===Other accounts===
Another possible oblique reference to the ritual appear in ''[[Norna-Gests þáttr]]''. There are two stanzas of verse near the end of its section 6, "[[Sigurd]] Felled the Sons of Hunding", where a character describing previous events says:
{|
| style="padding-right:1em" | {{lang|non|&lt;poem&gt;Nú er blóðugr örn
breiðum hjörvi
bana Sigmundar
á baki ristinn.
Fár var fremri,
sá er fold rýðr,
hilmis nefi,
ok hugin gladdi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/nornages.htm Norna-Gests þáttr]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
|&lt;poem&gt;Now the blood eagle
With a broad sword
The killer of [[Sigmund]]
Carved on the back.
Fewer were more valiant
As the troops dispersed
A chief of people
Who made the [[raven]] glad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100323030754/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/oldheathen/077.php Hardman's translation of ''Norna-Gests þáttr'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
|}
The word translated "raven" is not ''hrafn'' but ''[[Huginn|hugin]]'', one of [[Odin]]'s ravens.

==Authenticity==
There is debate about whether the blood eagle was historically practiced, or whether it was a literary device invented by the authors who transcribed the sagas. No contemporary accounts of the ritual exist, and the scant references in the sagas are several hundred years after the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]]. 

Alfred Smyth supported the historicity of the ritual, stating that it is clearly [[human sacrifice]] to the Norse god [[Odin]].  He characterized St. Dunstan's description of the Ælla's killing as an "accurate account of a body subjected to the ritual of the blood eagle".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred P. Smyth]], ''Scandinavian Kings in the British Isles, 850–880'' (1977), Oxford, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Roberta Frank]] reviewed the historical evidence for the ritual in her "Viking Atrocity and Skaldic Verse: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle", where she writes: "By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the various saga motifs—eagle sketch, rib division, lung surgery, and 'saline stimulant'—were combined in inventive sequences designed for maximum horror."&lt;ref name="Frank-II"&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|1984|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; She concludes that the authors of the sagas misunderstood alliterative [[kenning]]s which described carnivorous birds scavenging after battles, i.e. killing a foe and allowing their backs to be torn by eagles as battlefield [[carrion]]. She compared the lurid details of the blood eagle to Christian [[martyr]]dom tracts, such as that relating the tortures of [[Saint Sebastian]], shot so full of arrows that his ribs and internal organs were exposed.  She suggests that these tales of martyrdom inspired further exaggeration of the misunderstood skaldic verses into a grandiose torture and death ritual with no actual historical basis.  David Horspool in his book ''King Alfred: Burnt Cakes and Other Legends'', while not committing to the historical veracity of the ritual, also saw parallels to martyrdom tracts.&lt;ref name="Horspool"&gt;{{cite book |last=Horspool |first=David |authorlink= |title=King Alfred: Burnt Cakes and Other Legends |publisher=Profile Books |year=2006 |location=London |pages=44–45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdB584-MIhIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=067402320X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank's paper sparked a "lively debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baraz |first=David |authorlink= |title=Medieval Cruelty: Changing Perceptions, Late Antiquity to the Early Modern Period |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2003 |location=Ithaca, NY |page=67 |isbn=978-0801438172}}, citing: Bjarni Einarsson, "''De Normanorum Atrocitate'', or on the Execution of Royalty by the Aqueline Method", ''The Saga Book'', 22 (1988): 79–82; Roberta Frank, "The Blood-Eagle Again", ''The Saga Book'', 22 (1988): 287–289; Bjarni Einarsson and Roberta Frank, "The Blood-Eagle Once More: Two Notes", ''The Saga Book'', 23 (1990): 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Ronald Hutton]]'s ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles]]: Their Nature and Legacy'' states that "the hitherto notorious rite of the 'Blood Eagle,' the killing of a defeated warrior by pulling up his ribs and lungs through his back, has been shown to be almost certainly a [[Christian]] [[mythology|myth]] resulting from the misunderstanding of some older verse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink= |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy states |publisher=Blackwell |year=1991 |location=Oxford |page=282|isbn=978-0631172888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12539">'''[[Capital punishment]] in [[Israel]]''' has only been imposed twice in the history of the state and is only to be handed out for crimes committed during war time, such as [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], crimes against the Jewish people, [[treason]], and certain crimes under [[military law]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;The current [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] is considered a war{{by whom?|date=December 2017}}, and the commission of such crimes can technically result in the death penalty{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}, though this has not occurred.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel]] inherited the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] code of law, which included the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for several offenses, but in 1954 Israel abolished the penalty for murder. Although a legal option under law, Israel does not use the death penalty. The last execution was carried out in 1962, when [[Holocaust]] architect [[Adolf Eichmann]] was hanged for genocide and crimes against humanity. The last death sentence in Israel was handed down in 1988, when [[John Demjanjuk]] was sentenced to death for war crimes and crimes against humanity; his sentence (and conviction) was subsequently overturned. No death sentences have been sought by Israeli prosecutors since the 1990s.

==History==
Israel's rare use of the death penalty may in part be due to [[Religion and capital punishment#Judaism|Jewish religious law]].&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Makot 1:10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biblical law]] explicitly mandates the death penalty for 36 offenses, from [[murder]] and [[adultery]] to [[idolatry]] and desecration of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. However, in ancient Israel, the death penalty was rarely carried out. Jewish scholars since the beginning of the [[common era]] have developed such restrictive rules to prevent execution of the innocent that the death penalty has become [[de facto]] abolished. [[Moses Maimonides]] argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely "according to the judge's caprice". His concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–71 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jewish religious leaders and scholars believe that the death penalty should remain unused, even in extreme cases such as political [[assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conservative Responsa in Israel - Masorti Responsa - Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies - SIJS|url = http://www.responsafortoday.com/moment/4_1.htm|website = www.responsafortoday.com|accessdate = 2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the modern state of Israel was established in 1948, it inherited the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]]'s legal code, with a few adjustments, and thus capital punishment remained on the books. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Israeli War of Independence]], the first execution took place after [[Meir Tobianski]], an Israeli army officer, was falsely accused of espionage, subjected to a [[drumhead court martial]] and found guilty. He was executed by firing squad, but later posthumously exonerated.

In December 1948, it was decided that in the event of further death sentences, all executions would be stayed until the government determined the fate of the death penalty. The first death sentences imposed by an Israeli civil court, against two Arabs who had been found guilty of murder, were confirmed by an appeals court in November 1949, but the sentences were commuted to life imprisonment by President [[Chaim Weizmann]], due to his opposition to the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=WV643k%2FWpfocKmYPSyqWXo0VDhgU8zo7EYDqG1GSYrhW8E8UvLSAWiyCdmubomgEYw%3D%3D&amp;mode=image&amp;href=MAR%2f1961%2f02%2f17&amp;page=23&amp;rtl=true|title = מיתת־תליה" – חודש הסעיף שבוטל"|last = Shaul|first = Hon|date = 1961-02-17|work = |access-date = 2015-07-16|via = |trans-title = "Bed of hanging" – the clause which was cancelled was renewed|page = 23|newspaper = [[Maariv]]|language = Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli cabinet first considered abolishing the death penalty in July 1949.

In 1950, seven convicted murderers were on death row in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3339783,00.html|title=הנידונים למוות|first=ינון|last=רויכמן|date=14 December 2006|publisher=|via=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 the Israeli cabinet again proposed that the death penalty be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.jta.org/1951/10/30/archive/abolition-of-death-penalty-in-israel-proposed-by-cabinet|title = Abolition of Death Penalty in Israel Proposed by Cabinet|last = |first = |date = 1951-10-30|work = |access-date = |via = |newspaper = Jewish Telegraphic Agency|quote = The Israel Cabinet last night decided to submit to the Parliament a law proposing abolition of the death penalty.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.jta.org/1953/12/17/archive/israel-will-not-carry-out-death-sentences-immediately|title = Israel Will Not Carry out Death Sentences Immediately|last = |first = |date = 1953-12-17|work = |access-date = 2015-07-16|via = |newspaper = Jewish Telegraphic Agency|quote = The Israel Government has no intention of proceeding at this time with execution of death penalties, Minister of Justice Pinhas Rosen told Parliament’s legal committee tonight in a statement [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the first death sentence for Nazi war crimes under the Nazi Collaborators' Law was imposed on Yechezkel Ingster, who was convicted of torturing and beating other Jews as a [[kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]], but the court also recommended that the death sentence be commuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1952/01/07/archive/first-israeli-sentenced-to-death-for-torturing-nazi-victims|title=First Israeli Sentenced to Death for Torturing Nazi Victims|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence was commuted to two years' imprisonment. In 1953, another death sentence for murder was imposed. It was not carried out, and the convicted murderer received a presidential pardon six years later.&lt;ref&gt;http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=%2FHJYmaMuW0OIYAMoUfYvr1dueMAxRq0Av0moSTf8LamRy%2BJ51%2BsE8B6dX2atP8pwYw%3D%3D&amp;mode=image&amp;href=MAR%2f1959%2f03%2f18&amp;page=2&amp;rtl=true&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 the [[Knesset]] voted to abolish the death penalty for the crime of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.jta.org/1954/02/17/archive/israel-parliament-votes-to-abolish-capital-punishment|title = Israel Parliament Votes to Abolish Capital Punishment|last = |first = |date = 1954-02-17|work = |access-date = 2015-07-16|via = |newspaper = Jewish Telegraphic Agency|quote = The Israel Parliament today abolished the death penalty for the crime of murder. The vote was 61 to 33, with two abstentions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death penalty was retained for war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against the Jewish people, treason and certain crimes under military law during wartime.

In 1962 the second execution—and the only civil execution—in Israel took place when [[Adolf Eichmann]] was hanged after being convicted in 1961 of participation in [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[war crime]]s relating to [[the Holocaust]].

Throughout the following decades, death sentences were occasionally handed down to those convicted of terrorist offenses, but these sentences were always commuted. In 1988 [[John Demjanjuk]], a guard in a Nazi death camp during the war nicknamed "Ivan the Terrible" by inmates for his brutality, was sentenced to death after being convicted of war crimes, but his conviction was later overturned on appeal. In the mid-1990s the practice of seeking the death penalty for those facing terrorism charges ceased.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-expected-to-seek-death-penalty-for-killers-of-fogel-family-1.362893|title=IDF Expected to Seek Death Penalty for Killers of Fogel Family|first=Chaim|last=Levinson|date=20 May 2011|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Itamar attack]] in 2011, the issue of the death penalty briefly came up again. Israeli military prosecutors were expected to seek the death penalty for the perpetrators,&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; but in the end did not. Even so, the judges seriously considered imposing the death penalty when determining the sentence of one of the perpetrators, but decided not to, as the prosecution had not requested it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/idf-court-gives-palestinian-five-life-sentences-for-itamar-murders-1.407626 IDF court gives Palestinian five life sentences for Itamar murders]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the March 2015 election, the [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] party ran on a platform that included death sentences for terrorists; in July of the same year a bill was proposed, and sponsored by one of the party's members, to allow a majority of presiding judges to sentence a terrorist to death. By a vote of 94–6 the bill was rejected in its first reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Knesset votes down death penalty for terrorists 94-6|url = http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Knesset-votes-down-death-penalty-for-terrorists-94-6-409077|website = The Jerusalem Post|accessdate = 2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calls for imposition of the death penalty===
Israeli politicians have sometimes called for the imposition of the death penalty on specific criminals. In 2010 [[Knesset|Member of the Knesset]] [[Ayoub Kara]] called for the imposition of the death penalty on the perpetrator of the [[Tapuah Junction stabbing (2010)]].&lt;ref name="MurderedAtJunction"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shomron Honors Druze Soldier Murdered at Tapuach Junction|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/142472|accessdate=24 July 2017|publisher=Israel National News|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 political figures including Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu called for the penalty to be imposed on the perpetrator of the [[2017 Halamish stabbing attack]].&lt;ref name="DeathPenaltyHalamish"&gt;{{cite news|title=Netanyahu demands death penalty for Halamish terrorist|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-demands-death-penalty-for-halamish-terrorist/|accessdate=27 July 2017|work=Times of Israel|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives in [[Israeli government|the government]] plan to introduce to the [[Knesset]] a bill which would allow the death penalty for [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5188931/Israeli-leaders-push-terrorist-death-penalty.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/israel-will-todesstrafe-fuer-terroristen-einfuehren-15347505.html&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, a bill making it easier for [[military court]]s to hand down death sentences was approved by the Knesset in a preliminary vote of 52-49. Prime Minister Netanyahu voted in favor, but later said the bill required "deeper discussion" among the ministers before being voted on again.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-deathpenalty/israeli-death-penalty-advocates-win-preliminary-vote-in-parliament-idUSKBN1ES1DT&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39776">'''Child discipline''' is the methods used to prevent future behavioral problems in children. The word discipline is defined as imparting knowledge and skill, in other words, to teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Canadian Paediatric Society |title= Effective discipline for children |journal= Paediatrics &amp; Child Health |volume= 9 |issue= 1 |pages= 37–41 |pmc= 2719514|year= 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its most general sense, [[discipline]] refers to systematic instruction given to a disciple. ''To discipline'' means to instruct a person to follow a particular code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Papalia|first=D.E. |last2=Wendkos-Olds |first2=S. |last3= Duskin-Feldman |first3=R. |year=2006 |title=A Child's World: Infancy Through Adolescence |edition=10th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discipline is used by parents to teach their children about expectations, guidelines and principles. Children need to be given regular discipline to be taught right from wrong and to be maintained safe. Child discipline can involve rewards and punishments to teach self-control, increase desirable behaviors and decrease undesirable behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smenyak |first=Sarah |title=The difference between discipline and child abuse |url= http://www.livestrong.com/article/69111-difference-between-discipline-child/ |publisher=Demand Media |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the purpose of child discipline is to develop and entrench desirable social [[Habituation|habits]] in children, the ultimate goal is to foster sound judgement and [[morality|morals]] so the child develops and maintains self-discipline throughout the rest of his/her life.

Because the values, beliefs, education, customs and [[culture]]s of people vary so widely, along with the age and temperament of the child, methods of child discipline vary widely.  Child discipline is a topic that draws from a wide range of interested fields, such as [[parenting]], the professional practice of [[behavior analysis]], [[developmental psychology]], [[social work]], and various [[religion|religious perspectives]].  In recent years, advances in the understanding of [[attachment parenting]] have provided a new background of theoretical understanding and advanced clinical and practical understanding of the effectiveness and outcome of parenting methods.

In Western society, there has been debate in recent years over the use of [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] for [[child]]ren in general, and increased attention to the concept of "positive parenting" where good behavior is encouraged and rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/HelpAndAdvice/Publications/Leaflets/encouraging_pdf_wdf36202.pdf |title=Encouraging better behavior - A practical guide to positive parenting |publisher=[[NSPCC]] |year=2003 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014154404/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/helpandadvice/publications/leaflets/encouraging_pdf_wdf36202.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistency, firmness and respect are all important components of [[positive discipline]]. The goal of positive discipline is to teach, train and guide children so that they learn, practice self-control and develop the ability to manage their emotions, and make wise choices regarding their personal behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/positive_discipline_punishment_vs_discipline|title=Positive discipline: Punishment vs. discipline|work=MSU Extension|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historical research suggests that there has been a great deal of individual variation in methods of discipline over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollock |first=Linda A. |title= Forgotten children: parent-child relations from 1500 to 1900 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url= https://books.google.com/?id=JYR4nxXWIjMC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=18th+century+child+discipline&amp;q=18th%20century%20child%20discipline |year=1983 |isbn=0-521-25009-9 |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval times===
Nicholas Orme of the University of Exeter argues that children in medieval times were treated differently from adults in legal matters, and the authorities were as troubled about violence to children as they were to adults. In his article, "Childhood in Medieval England," he states, "Corporal punishment was in use throughout society and probably also in homes, although social commentators criticized parents for indulgence towards children rather than for harsh discipline." Salvation was the main goal of discipline, and parents were driven to ensure their children a place in heaven.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Sandy |title=How has child discipline changed?|url= http://www.livestrong.com/article/31506-child-discipline-changed/ |publisher=Demand Media |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident in early 14th-century London, neighbors intervened when a cook and clerk were beating a boy carrying water. A scuffle ensued and the child's tormentors were subdued. The neighbors didn't even know the boy, but they firmly stood up for him even when they were physically attacked, and they stood by their actions when the cook and clerk later sued for damages.&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, Barbara, ''Growing Up in Medieval London'' (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial times===
During colonial times in the United States, parents were able to provide enjoyments for their children in the form of toys, according to David Robinson, writer for the ''Colonial Williamsburg Journal''. Robinson notes that even the Puritans permitted their young children to play freely. Older children were expected to swiftly adopt adult chores and accountabilities, to meet the strict necessities of daily life.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;  Harsh punishments for minor infractions were common. Beatings and other forms of corporal punishment occurred regularly; one legislator even suggested capital punishment for children's misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED252451|title=ERIC - Student Discipline in Colonial America., 1984-Nov|work=ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biblical views ===
The [[Book of Proverbs]] mentions the importance of disciplining children, as opposed to leaving them neglected or unruly, in several verses. Interpretation of these verses varies, as do many passages from the Bible, from literal to metaphorical. The most often paraphrased is from Proverbs 13:24, "He that spareth his [[switch (rod)|rod]] hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes." ([[King James Version]].) Other passages that mention the 'rod' are Proverbs 23:14, "Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell," and Proverbs 29:15, "The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.learnthebible.org/eight-misconceptions-about-spanking.html |title= Eight Misconceptions About Spanking  |publisher=Learn The Bible |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Bible's lessons have been paraphrased for hundreds of years, the modern phrase, "Spare the rod and spoil the child," was coined by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]], in ''[[Hudibras]]'', a [[mock heroic]] [[narrative poem]] published in 1663. The [[Contemporary English Version]] of Proverbs 13:24 is: 'If you love your children you will correct them; if you don't love them, you won't correct them'.

=== Medieval views ===
[[Image:Koerperstrafe- MA Birkenrute.png|thumb|280px|Medieval schoolboy birched on the bare buttocks]]
The primary guidelines followed by medieval parents in training their children were from the Bible. Scolding was considered ineffectual, and cursing a child was a terrible thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanawalt |first=Barbara |title= The Ties that Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1986 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the use of corporal punishment was as a disciplinary action taken to shape behavior, not a pervasive dispensing of beatings for no reason. Corporal punishment was undoubtedly the norm.  The medieval world was a dangerous place, and it could take harsh measures to prepare a child to live in it. Pain was the medieval way of illustrating that actions had consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://historymedren.about.com/od/medievalchildren/a/child_play_3.htm |title=The Medieval Child, Part 4: The Playful Years |publisher=About.com |accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of John Locke ===
In his 1690 ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' English [[physician]] and [[philosopher]]  [[John Locke]] argued that the child resembled a blank tablet ([[tabula rasa]]) at birth, and was not inherently full of [[sin]]. In his 1693 ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' he suggested that the task of the parent was to build in the child the strong body and [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] of mind that would allow the capacity of [[reason]] to develop, and that [[parents]] could reward good behavior with their esteem and punish bad behavior with disgrace – the withdrawal of parental approval and affection - as opposed to beatings.&lt;ref name="FAQs.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Co-Fa/Discipline.html |title=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society - Discipline  |publisher=FAQs.org |accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The twentieth century ===
In the early twentieth century, child-rearing experts abandoned a romantic view of childhood and advocated formation of proper habits to discipline children. A 1914 U.S. Children's Bureau pamphlet, ''Infant Care'', urged a strict schedule and admonished parents not to play with their babies.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[John B. Watson]]'s 1924 ''Behaviorism'' argued that parents could train malleable children by rewarding good behavior and punishing bad, and by following precise schedules for food, sleep, and other bodily functions.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Although such principles began to be rejected as early as the 1930s, they were firmly renounced in the 1946 best-seller ''[[The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|Baby and Child Care]]'', by pediatrician [[Benjamin Spock]], which told parents to trust their own instincts and to view the child as a reasonable, friendly human being. Dr. Spock revised his first edition to urge more parent-centered discipline in 1957, but critics blamed his popular book for its permissive attitude during the youth rebellions of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="FAQs.org"/&gt;

=== Conservative backlash ===

Following the permissive trend of the 1960s and early 1970s, American [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]] [[James Dobson]] sought the return of a more conservative society and advocated [[spanking]] of children up to age eight.&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobson |first=James |title=Dare to Discipline |year=1977 |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=0-553-22841-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson's position is controversial. As early as 1985 ''The New York Times'' stated that "most child-care experts today disapprove of physical punishment."&lt;ref name=nyt85&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Wright |newspaper=The New York Times |date=19 June 1985 |page=C9 |title= Parents and Experts Split on Spanking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, parents have historically had the right to spank their children when appropriate. A 2006 retrospective study in New Zealand, showed that physical punishment of children remained quite common in the 1970s and 1980s, with 80% of the sample reporting some kind of corporal punishment from parents, at some time during childhood. Among this sample, 29% reported being hit with an empty hand. However 45% were hit with an object, and 6% were subjected to serious physical abuse.  The study noted that abusive physical punishment tended to be given by fathers and often involved striking the child's head or torso instead of the buttocks or limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millichamp |first=Jane |author2=Martin, J. |author3=Langley, J. |year=2006 |title=On the receiving end: young adults describe their parents' use of physical punishment and other disciplinary measures during childhood |journal=The New Zealand Medical Journal |volume=119 |issue=1228 |pmid=16462926 |pages= U1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudes have changed in recent years, and legislation in some countries, particularly in continental Europe, reflect an increased skepticism toward corporal punishment.  As of December 2017, domestic corporal punishment has been outlawed in 56 countries around the world, most of them in Europe and Latin America, beginning with Sweden in 1966. Official figures show that just 10 percent of Swedish children had been spanked or otherwise struck by their parents by 2010, compared to more than 90 percent in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=swed30&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1005/p06s10-woeu.html |last= Sullivan |first= Tom |location= Boston |title=In 30 years without spanking, are Swedish children better behaved? |newspaper =The Christian Science Monitor |date=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish law does not actually lay down any legal punishment for smacking but requires social workers to support families with problems.&lt;ref name=swed30/&gt;

Even as corporal punishment became increasingly controversial in North America, Britain, Australia and much of the rest of the English-speaking world, limited corporal punishment of children by their parents remained lawful in all 50 states of the [[United States]]. It was not until 2012 that [[Delaware]] became the first state to pass a statute defining "physical injury" to a child to include "any impairment of physical condition or pain."&lt;ref&gt;:DELAWARE STATE SENATE 146th GENERAL ASSEMBLY, SENATE BILL NO. 234, AN ACT TO AMEND TITLE 11 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO OFFENSES AGAINST CHILDREN.

== Cultural differences ==
A number of authors have emphasized the importance of cultural differences in assessing disciplinary methods. Baumrind argues that "The cultural context critically determines the meaning and therefore the consequences of physical discipline . . ." (Baumrind, 1996; italics in original). Polite (1996) emphasizes that the "debate over whether or not to use corporal punishment rages in many ethnic communities." Larzelare, Baumrind and Polite assert that "After ignoring decades of cultural differences in the effects of spanking, these 2 ARCHIVES [1997] studies and 2 other studies in the past year have each found significantly
different effects for African Americans than for non-Hispanic European Americans. The effects of spanking in African American families are generally beneficial to children, unless it is used excessively, either in severity or in frequency." (Larzelere et al., 1998; references to other articles omitted). Our results confirm the serious differences of opinion on discipline, even in a relatively homogenous ethnic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Amuwo |first=Shaffdeen |author2=Robert Fabian |author3=Jacqueline Hill |author4=Ardith Spence |author5=George Tolley  |journal= Journal of Socio-Economics |year=2004 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=153–173 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535703001185 |accessdate=10 December 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.socec.2003.12.016 |title=Child discipline and family decision-making}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parenting styles==
There are different [[parenting styles]] which parents use to discipline their children. Four types have been identified: authoritative parents, authoritarian parents, indulgent parents, and indifferent parents.

'''''Authoritative parents''''' are parents who use warmth, firm control, and rational, issue-oriented discipline, in which emphasis is placed on the development of self-direction. They place a high value on the development of autonomy and self-direction, but assume the ultimate responsibility for their child's behavior. "You live under my roof, you follow my rules!" is a cliché, but one that parents may often find themselves speaking - and it probably most closely mimics the authoritative parenting style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parentingliteracy.com/parenting-a-z/44-overview/47-parenting-styles/|title=Parenting Styles|work=parentingliteracy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Authoritarian parents''''' are parents who use punitive, absolute, and forceful discipline, and who place a premium on obedience and conformity. If parents exhibit good emotional understanding and control, children also learn to manage their own emotions and learn to understand others as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumrind|first=D.|date=February 1967|title=Child care practices anteceding three patterns of preschool behavior|journal=Genetic Psychology Monographs|volume=75|issue=1|pages=43–88|issn=0016-6677|pmid=6032134}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parents believe it is their responsibility to provide for their children and that their children have no right to tell the parent how best to do this. Adults are expected to know from experience what is really in the child's best interest and so adult views are allowed to take precedence over child desires. Children are perceived to know what they want but not necessarily what is best for them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Parenting Styles. Written by Joseph Lao, Ph.D&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Indulgent parents '''''are parents who are characterized by responsiveness but low demandingness, and who are mainly concerned with the child's happiness. They behave in an accepting, benign, and somewhat more passive way in matters of discipline.

'''''Indifferent parents''''' are parents who are characterized by low levels of both responsiveness and demandingness. They try to do whatever is necessary to minimize the time and energy they must devote to interacting with their child. In extreme cases, indifferent parents may be neglectful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steingberg |first= Laurence |title=Adolescence |year=2011 |publisher=Mcgraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-353203-5 |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; They ask very little of their children. For instance, they rarely assign their children chores. They tend to be relatively uninvolved in their children's lives. It's not that they don't love their children. It's just that they believe their children should live their own lives, as free of parental control as possible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

A fifth type of parenting style is connectedness. '''Connected parents''' are parents who want to improve the way in which they connect with their children using an empathetic approach to challenging or even tumultuous relationships. Using the 'CALM' technique, by Jennifer Kolari, parents recognize the importance of empathy and aspire to build capacity in their children in hopes of them becoming confident and emotionally resilient. The CALM acronym stands for: '''C'''onnect emotionally, match the '''A'''ffect of the child, '''L'''isten to what your child is saying and '''M'''irror their emotion back to show understanding.&lt;ref&gt;last=Kolari |first=Jennifer |title= Connected Parenting|year=2009|publisher=Viking Canada|location=Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-physical discipline==
Non-physical discipline consists of both punitive and non-punitive methods but does not include any forms of corporal punishment such as hitting or spanking. The regular use of any single form of discipline becomes less effective when used too often, a process [[psychology|psychologists]] call [[habituation]]. Thus, no single method is considered to be for exclusive use. Non-Physical discipline is used in the concerted cultivation style of parenting that comes from the middle and upper class. concerted cultivation is the method of parenting that includes heavy parental involvement, and use reasoning and bargaining as disciplinary methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lareau |first=Annette |title=Unequal Childhoods |year=2011 |publisher= University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-27142-5 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time-outs ===
{{Main|Child time-out}}
A common method of child discipline is sending the child away from the family or group after misbehavior. Children may be told to stand in the corner ("corner time") or may be sent to their rooms for a period of time.
A [[child time-out|time-out]] involves isolating or separating a child for a few minutes and is intended to give an over-excited child time to calm down.
[[Image:Skamvrån av Carl Larsson 1894.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Time-out'', painting by [[Carl Larsson]]]]
Alternatively, time-outs have been recommended{{By whom|date=June 2011}} as a time for parents to separate feelings of anger toward the child for their behavior and to develop a plan for discipline.

When using time-outs as a discipline strategy, individuals must also take into consideration the temperaments of the child if one decides to use time-outs. If a child, for example, has a feisty temperament, or a temperament that expresses emotion in a highly intense way, then discipline strategies of using time-outs would be ineffective because of the clash of discipline strategy to the child's temperament trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marion |first=Marian |title=Guidance of Young Children |year=2007 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-154530-2 |pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an individual decides to use the time-out with a child as a discipline strategy, the individual must be unemotional and consistent with the undesired behavior. Along with taking into consideration the child's temperament, the length of the time-out needs to also depend on the age of the child. For example, the time-out should last one minute per year of the child's age, so if the child is five years old, the time-out should go no longer than five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effective discipline for children |journal=Paediatrics &amp; Child Health |date=January 2004 |volume=9 |issue=1|pages=37–41 |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2719514/pdf/pch09037.pdf |accessdate=30 November 2012 |pmc=2719514 |pmid=19654979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several experts do not recommend the use of time-out or any other form of [[punishment]]. These authors include [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], [[Alfie Kohn]], and [[Aletha Solter]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, T. (2000). Parent Effectiveness Training: The Proven Program for Raising Responsible Children. New York, NY: Three Rivers Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2005). Unconditional Parenting: Moving From Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason. New York, NY: Atria Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (1989). Helping Young Children Flourish. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press, and Solter, A. (2013). Attachment Play. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2002). The disadvantages of time-out. http://www.awareparenting.com/timeout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grounding ===
{{Main|Grounding (discipline technique)}}
Grounding is a form of discipline, usually, for older children, preteens and teenagers, that restricts their movement outside of the home, such as visiting friends or using the car and they are not allowed to go anywhere but school and few required places. Sometimes it is combined with the withdrawal of privileges for computer, video games, telephone or TV.

=== Scolding ===
Scolding involves reproving or criticizing a child's negative behavior and/or actions.

Some research suggests that scolding is counter-productive because parental attention (including negative attention) tends to reinforce behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Johnson, Sylvia |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/10-tips-parents-defiant-children/story?id=8549664 |title= 10 Tips for Parents of Defiant Children |date= 15 September 2009 |work=ABC News |accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-punitive discipline ==
While punishments may be of limited value in consistently influencing rule-related behavior, non-punitive discipline techniques have been found to have greater impact on children who have begun to master their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toner |first1=Ignatius J. |last2= |first2= |year=1986 |title=Punitive and non-punitive discipline and subsequent rule-following in young children |journal=Child and Youth Care Forum |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=27–37 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r00u746076w16067/ |doi=10.1007/BF01118991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-punitive discipline (also known as empathic discipline and positive discipline) is an approach to child-rearing that does not use any form of punishment. It is about loving guidance, and requires parents to have a strong relationship with their child so that the child responds to gentle guidance as opposed to threats and punishment. According to Dr. Laura Markham, the most effective discipline strategy is to make sure your child wants to please you.&lt;ref name=ahaparent&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://ahaparenting.com/parenting-tools/positive-discipline/use-positive-discipline |title= How to Use Positive Discipline |author=Markham, Dr. Laura |publisher=Aha! Parenting |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-punitive discipline also excludes systems of "manipulative" rewards. Instead, a child's behavior is shaped by "democratic interaction" and by deepening parent-child communication. The reasoning behind it is that while punitive measures may stop the problem behavior in the short term, by themselves they do not provide a learning opportunity that allows children the autonomy to change their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.insideout-counselling.com.au/html/cms/12/non-punitive-discipline |title= Non-punitive discipline |publisher= Inside Out Counselling |accessdate=28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments such as time-outs may be seen as banishment and humiliation. Consequences as a form of punishment are not recommended, but natural consequences are considered to be possibly worthwhile learning experiences provided there is no risk of lasting harm.&lt;ref name=ahaparent /&gt;

Positive discipline is both non-violent discipline and non-punitive discipline. Criticizing, discouraging, creating obstacles and barriers, blaming, shaming, using sarcastic or cruel humor, or using physical punishment are some negative disciplinary methods used with young children. Any parent may occasionally do any of these things, but doing them more than once in a while may lead to low self-esteem becoming a permanent part of the child's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/Issues/discipline.html |title=Positive discipline |date=20 May 2008 |publisher=AtHealth.com |accessdate=28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essential aspects ===
In the past, harsh discipline has been the norm for families in society. However, research by psychologists has brought about new forms of effective discipline. Positive discipline is based on minimizing the child's frustrations and misbehavior rather than giving punishments. The main focus in this method is the "Golden Rule", treat others the way you want to be treated. Parents follow this when disciplining their children because they believe that their point will reach the children more effectively rather than traditional discipline. The foundation of this style of discipline is encouraging children to feel good about themselves and building the parent's relationship with the child so the child wants to please the parent. In traditional discipline, parents would instill fear in their child by using shame and humiliation to get their point across. However, studies show that this type of punishment ultimately causes the children to have more psychological problems in their adolescence and adulthood. Physical and harsh punishment shows the child that violence and negative treatment is acceptable in some circumstances, wheres, positive discipline demonstrates the opposite. In positive discipline the parents avoid negative treatment and focus on the importance of communication and showing unconditional love. Feeling loved, important and well liked has positive and negative effects on how a child perceives themselves. The child will feel important if the child feels well liked and loved by a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = No More Perfect Kids:Love Your Kids for Who They Are|last = Savage|first = Jill|publisher = Moody PubLishers|year = 2014|isbn = 9780802411525|location = |pages = |last2 = Koch|first2 = Kathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important aspects are reasonable and age-appropriate expectations, feeding healthy foods and providing enough rest, giving clear instructions which may need to be repeated, looking for the causes of any misbehavior and making adjustments, and building routines. Children are helped by knowing what is happening in their lives. Having some predictability about their day without necessarily being regimental will help reduce frustration and misbehavior.&lt;ref name=pchsa&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/HealthTopicDetails.aspx?p=114&amp;np=141&amp;id=2309 |title= The Nanny Show and you |publisher=Parenting and Child Health Services South Australia |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are the children taught to be open-minded, but the parents must demonstrate this as well.

=== Methods ===

==== Praise and rewards ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
Simply giving the child spontaneous expressions of appreciation or acknowledgement when they are not misbehaving will act as a reinforcer for good behavior. Focusing on good behavior versus bad behavior will encourage appropriate behavior in the given situation. According to B. F. Skinner, past behavior that is reinforced with praise is likely to repeat in the same or similar situation.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. ''About Behaviorism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In operant conditioning, schedules of reinforcement are an important component of the learning process. When and how often we reinforce a behavior can have a dramatic impact on the strength and rate of the response.
A schedule of reinforcement is basically a rule stating which instances of a behavior will be reinforced. In some case, a behavior might be reinforced every time it occurs. Sometimes, a behavior might not be reinforced at all. Either positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement might be used, depending on the situation. In both cases, the goal of reinforcement is always to strengthen the behavior and increase the likelihood that it will occur again in the future.
In real-world settings, behaviors are probably not going to be reinforced each and every time they occur. For situations where you are purposely trying to train and reinforce an action, such as in the classroom, in sports or in animal training, you might opt to follow a specific reinforcement schedule. As you'll see below, some schedules are best suited to certain types of training situations. In some cases, training might call for starting out with one schedule and switching to another once the desired behavior has been taught.&lt;ref&gt;SKINNER, B. F. The behavior of organisms. New York: D. Appleton-Century Co., 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Example of operant conditioning

'''[[Positive reinforcement]]''': Whenever he is being good, cooperative, solves things non-aggressively, immediately reward those behaviors with praise, attention, goodies.

'''Punishment''': If acting aggressively, give immediate, undesired consequence (send to corner; say "NO!" and couple with response cost).

'''Response cost:''' Most common would be "time-out". Removing sources of attention by placing in an environment without other people. Careful: This can become (aversive) punishment, depending on how done. To be response cost, it can only simply be taking away a desirable thing; not adding a negative one.

'''[[Negative reinforcement]]:''' One example would be to couple negative reinforcement with response cost—after some period of time in which he has acted cooperatively or calmly while in the absence of others, can bring him back with others. Thus, taking away the isolation should reinforce the desired behavior (being cooperative).

'''Extinction:''' Simply ignoring behaviors should lead to extinction. Note: that initially when ignored, can expect an initial increase in the behavior—a very trying time in situations such as a child that is acting out.&lt;ref&gt;Zeilberger, J., Sampen, S., &amp; Sloan, H. (1968). Modification of a child's problem behaviors in the home with the mother as therapist. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 1, 47-53.)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for children who are otherwise ignored by their parents to turn to misbehavior as a way of seeking attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How can I discipline my children? |publisher=BBC |location= London |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/parents/life/health_happiness/problems/discipline_home.shtml |accessdate = 13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is a child screaming for attention. Parents often inadvertently reward the bad behavior by immediately giving them the attention, thereby reinforcing it. On the other hand, parents may wait until the child calms down and speaks politely, then reward the more polite behavior with the attention.

==== Natural consequences ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
Natural consequences involve children learning from their own mistakes. In this method, the parent's job is to teach the child which behaviors are inappropriate. In order to do this, parents should allow the child to make a mistake and let them experience the natural results from their behavior. For instance, if a child forgets to bring his lunch to school, he will find himself hungry later. Using natural consequences would be indicative of the theory of accomplishment of natural growth, which is the parenting style of the working class and poor.  The accomplishment of natural growth focuses on separation between children and family. Children are given directives and expected to carry them out without complaint or delay. Children are responsible for themselves during their free time, and the parent's main concern is caring for the children's physical needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lareau |first=Annette |title=Unequal Childhoods |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-27142-5 |pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for this method to be effective the parents cannot shield their child from harm or from getting in trouble. They must allow for the mistake to occur in order for the child to learn the consequences. For example, a basic natural consequence is that if the child touches a hot pot he will get burned. The consequence is usually immediate, and the parent may have little control when protecting the child. However, the pain is the consequence of touching the pot which will teach the child to not do that again.

====Internal discipline and democracy====
:''Main articles: [[School discipline#Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools|Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools]] and [[Sudbury Valley School]]''

[[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury model]] democratic schools, attended by children ages 4 to 19, claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike.

Furthermore, they emphasize that much more important than the externals of order is the question of the sources of internal discipline: how does an individual come to develop the inner strength and character that endows his life with order and coherence, an independent person appropriate to a free republic of co-equal citizens, capable of making decisions within a rational, self-consistent framework—a person treating and being treated with respect?

They affirm that the hallmark of the independent person is the ability to bear responsibility and since there is no way of teaching or training another person for self-sufficiency, there is no technique for obtaining or transmitting these traits. Hence, the only way a person becomes responsible for himself is for him to be responsible for himself, with no reservation or qualifications. Thence the need to permit children, at home and school, freedom of choice, freedom of action, and freedom to bear the results of action—the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;The Crisis in American Education &amp;mdash; An Analysis and a Proposal, [http://www.sudval.com/05_onepersononevote.html#02 The Sudbury Valley School] (1970), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MAqxzEss8k4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=The+Crisis+in+American+Education+%E2%80%94+An+Analysis+and+a+Proposal,+The+Sudbury+Valley+School+(1970),+Law+and+Order:+Foundations+of+Discipline ''Law and Order: Foundations of Discipline''] (pg. 49-55).

The '''common snapping turtle''' (''Chelydra serpentina'') is a large freshwater [[turtle]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Chelydridae]]. Its natural range extends from southeastern [[Canada]], southwest to the edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]], as far east as [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Florida]]. The three species of ''[[Chelydra]]'' and the larger [[alligator snapping turtle]]s (genus ''[[Macrochelys]]'') are the only extant chelydrids, a family now restricted to the Americas. The common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is the most widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology of the Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina)|year=2008|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=5–13|author=Ernst, C.H.|editor1=A.C. Styermark |editor2=M.S. Finkler |editor3=R.J. Brooks |chapter=Systematics, Taxonomy, and Geographic Distribution of the Snapping Turtles, Family Chelydridae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common snapping turtle is noted for its combative disposition when out of the water with its powerful beak-like jaws, and highly mobile head and neck (hence the [[species|specific]] name ''serpentina'', meaning "[[snake]]-like"). In water, they are likely to flee and hide themselves underwater in sediment. Snapping turtles have a life-history strategy characterized by high and variable mortality of embryos and hatchlings, delayed sexual maturity, extended adult longevity, and [[semelparity and iteroparity|iteroparity]] (repeated reproductive events) with low reproductive success per reproductive event. Females, and presumably also males, in more northern populations mature later (at 15–20 years) and at a larger size than in more southern populations (about 12 years). Lifespan in the wild is poorly known, but long-term mark-recapture data from Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada, suggest a maximum age over 100 years.&lt;ref name="adw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2009/ec/CW69-14-565-2009E.pdf|title=COSEWIC Assessment and Status Report on the Snapping Turtle ''Chelydra serpentina''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''C. serpentina'' has a rugged, muscular build with a ridged [[carapace]] (upper shell), although ridges tend to be more pronounced in younger individuals. The carapace length in adulthood may be nearly {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}}, though {{convert|25|-|47|cm|in|abbr=on}} is more common.&lt;ref name="Animal"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Wilson, D.E. |editor2=Burnie, D. |date=2001 |title=Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife |location=London and New York |publisher=Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing. 624 pp |isbn=978-0-7894-7764-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''C. serpentina'' usually weighs {{convert|4.5|-|16|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

==Ecology and life history==
Common habitats are shallow [[pond]]s or [[streams]]. Some may inhabit [[brackish water|brackish]] environments, such as [[estuary|estuaries]]. Common snapping turtles sometimes bask—though rarely observed—by floating on the surface with only their carapaces exposed, though in the northern parts of their range, they also readily bask on fallen logs in early spring. In shallow waters, common snapping turtles may lie beneath a muddy bottom with only their heads exposed, stretching their long necks to the surface for an occasional breath (their nostrils are positioned on the very tip of the snout, effectively functioning as snorkels). Snapping turtles [[omnivore|consume both plant and animal matter]], and are important aquatic scavengers, but they are also active hunters that prey on anything they can swallow, including many [[invertebrate]]s, [[fish]], [[frog]]s, [[reptile]]s (including snakes and smaller turtles), unwary [[bird]]s, and small [[mammal]]s. In some areas, adult snapping turtles can be incidentally detrimental to breeding [[waterfowl]], as they will occasionally take ducklings and goslings but their effect on such prey is frequently exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, D.A. (1972). ''Ecological relations of waterfowl and snapping turtle populations''. Ph.D. dissertation, Utah State University, Salt Lake City, UT. 72 pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Snapping_turtle_eggs_md.jpg|thumb|left|A snapping turtle's eggs]]
Common snapping turtles have few predators when older, but eggs are subject to predation by [[crow]]s, [[American mink|mink]], [[skunk]]s, [[fox]]es, and [[raccoon]]s. As hatchlings and juveniles, most of the same predators will attack them as well as [[heron]]s (mostly [[great blue heron]]s), [[bittern]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[Fisher (animal)|fishers]], [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]]s, large [[fish]], and [[snakes]].&lt;ref name=VHS/&gt; There are records during winter in [[Canada]] of hibernating adult common snapping turtles being ambushed and preyed on by [[northern river otter]]s.&lt;ref name= Brooks&gt;Brooks, R.J.; Brown, G.P.; Galbraith, D.A. (1991). "Effects of a sudden increase in natural mortality of adults on a population of the common snapping turtle (''Chelydra serpentina'')". ''Canadian Journal of Zoology'' '''69''' (5): 1314-1320.&lt;/ref&gt; Other natural predators which have reportedly preyed on adults include [[coyote]]s, [[American black bear|black bears]], [[American alligator|alligators]] and their larger cousins, [[alligator snapping turtle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, C.H., &amp; Lovich, J. E. (2009). ''Turtles of the United States and Canada''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Large, old male snapping turtles have very few natural threats due to their formidable size and defenses, and tend to have a very low annual mortality rate.&lt;ref name= Brooks/&gt;

These turtles travel extensively over land to reach new [[habitat]]s or to lay [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. Pollution, [[habitat destruction]], food scarcity, overcrowding, and other factors drive snappers to move; it is quite common to find them traveling far from the nearest water source. Experimental data supports the idea that snapping turtles can sense the Earth's magnetic field, which could also be used for such movements (together with a variety of other possible orientation cues).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landler|first=Lukas|last2=Painter|first2=Michael S.|last3=Youmans|first3=Paul W.|last4=Hopkins|first4=William A.|last5=Phillips|first5=John B.|date=2015-05-15|title=Spontaneous Magnetic Alignment by Yearling Snapping Turtles: Rapid Association of Radio Frequency Dependent Pattern of Magnetic Input with Novel Surroundings|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e0124728|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124728|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4433231|pmid=25978736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Congdon|first=Justin D.|last2=Pappas|first2=Michael J.|last3=Krenz|first3=John D.|last4=Brecke|first4=Bruce J.|last5=Schlenner|first5=Meredith|date=2015-02-27|title=Compass Orientation During Dispersal of Freshwater Hatchling Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina) and Blanding's Turtles (Emydoidea blandingii)|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=121|issue=6|pages=538–547|doi=10.1111/eth.12366|issn=0179-1613}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species mates from April through November, with their peak laying season in June and July. The female can hold [[spermatozoa|sperm]] for several seasons, using it as necessary. Females travel over land to find sandy soil in which to lay their eggs, often some distance from the water. After digging a hole, the female typically deposits 25 to 80 eggs each year, guiding them into the [[nest]] with her hind feet and covering them with sand for incubation and protection. Incubation time is temperature-dependent, ranging from 9 to 18 weeks. In cooler climates, hatchlings overwinter in the nest. The common snapping turtle is remarkably cold-tolerant; radiotelemetry studies have shown some individuals do not hibernate, but remain active under the ice during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/emrrp/turtles/species/comsnap.html US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center, Environmental Laboratory:  Common Snapping Turtle (''Chelydra serpentina'')]&lt;/ref&gt; Hibernating snapping turtles do not breathe for, in the northern part of their range, more than six months since ice covers their hibernating site. These turtles can get oxygen by pushing their head out of the mud and allowing gas exchange to take place through the membranes of their mouth and throat. This is known as extrapulmonary respiration. If they cannot get enough oxygen through this method they start to utilize anaerobic pathways, burning sugars and fats without the use of oxygen. The metabolic by-products from this process are acidic and create very undesirable side effects by spring, which are known as oxygen debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/snappers.htm|title=Tortoise Trust Web - Conservation and Ecology of Snapping Turtles|first=ULf|last=Edqvist|website=www.tortoisetrust.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although designated as "least concern" on the [[IUCN]] redlist, the species has been designated in the Canadian part of its range as "Special Concern" due to its life history being sensitive to disruption by anthropogenic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=COSEWIC|title=Species Profile - Snapping Turtle|url=http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=1033|work=Species At Risk Public Registry|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systematics and taxonomy==
Currently, no [[subspecies]] of the common snapping turtle are recognized.&lt;ref name=Rhodin&gt;{{Anchor|CITEREFRhodin2010}}{{Cite book|url=http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Accounts/crm_5_000_checklist_v3_2010.pdf |title=Turtles of the world, 2010 update: Annotated checklist of taxonomy, synonymy, distribution and conservation status |journal=Chelonian Research Monographs |volume=5 |accessdate= |date=2010-12-14 |author1=Rhodin, Anders G.J. |author2=van Dijk, Peter Paul |author3=Iverson, John B. |author4=Shaffer, H.

== Behavior ==
In their environment, they are at the top of the food chain, causing them to feel less fear or aggression in some cases. When they encounter a species unfamiliar to them such as humans, in rare instances, they will become curious and survey the situation and even more rarely may bump their nose on a leg of the person standing in the water. Although snapping turtles have fierce dispositions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/snapping_turtle.aspx Snapping Turtle], Encyclopedia.com&lt;/ref&gt; when they are encountered in the water or a swimmer approaches, they will slip quietly away from any disturbance or may seek shelter under mud or grass nearby.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;[http://nature.ca/notebooks/english/snapper.htm Common Snapping Turtle], Nature.ca&lt;/ref&gt; However, common snapping turtles can be very aggressive if restrained or approached on land, and have a bite powerful enough to mutilate human fingers.

== Captivity ==

The common snapping turtle is not an ideal pet. Its neck is very flexible, and a wild turtle can bite its handler even if picked up by the sides of its shell. The claws are about as sharp as those of [[dog]]s, but cannot be trimmed as can dog claws. Despite this, a snapping turtle cannot use its claws for either attacking (its legs have no speed or strength in "swiping" motions) or eating (no opposable thumbs), but only as aids for digging and gripping. Veterinary care is best left to a reptile specialist. A wild common snapping turtle will make a hissing sound when it is threatened or encountered; however, when in the water and unprovoked, they are fairly docile towards humans.

It is a common misconception that common snapping turtles may be safely picked up by the tail with no harm to the animal; in fact, this has a high chance of injuring the turtle, especially the tail itself and the [[vertebra]]l column.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thatpetplace.com/thatreptileblog/2008/06/24/handling-snapping-turtles-chelydra-serpentina-and-other-large-turtles/|title=Handling Snapping Turtles, Chelydra serpentina, and Other Large Turtles|last=Indiviglio|first=Frank|date=2008-06-24|work=That Reptile Blog|publisher=That Pet Place|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifting the turtle with the hands is difficult and dangerous. Snappers can stretch their necks back across their own carapace and to their hind feet on either side to bite. When they feel stressed, they release a musky odor from behind their legs.

It may be tempting to rescue a snapping turtle found on a road by getting it to bite a stick and then dragging it out of immediate danger. This action can, however, severely scrape the legs and underside of the turtle and lead to deadly infections in the wounds. The safest way to pick up a common snapping turtle is by grasping the carapace above the back legs. There is a large gap above the back legs that allows for easy grasping of the carapace and keeps hands safe from both the beak and claws of the turtle. It can also be picked up with a shovel, from the back, making sure the shovel is square across the bottom of the shell. The easiest way, though, is with a blanket or tarp, picking up the corners with the turtle in the middle.

Snapping turtles are raised on some [[turtle farm]]s in China.&lt;ref&gt;Fang Anning (方安宁), "[http://www.gui138.cn/xinwen/gbxw/201007/765.html “小庭院”养殖龟鳖大有赚头]" (Small-scale turtle farming may be very profitable). ''Zuojiang Daily'' (左江日报) (with photo)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invasive species==
In recent years in [[Italy]], large mature adult ''C. serpentina'' turtles have been taken from bodies of water throughout the country.  They were most probably introduced by the unwise release of pets. In March 2011, an individual weighing {{convert|20|kg|abbr=on}} was captured in a canal near [[Rome]];&lt;ref&gt;"''Una "azzanatrice" catturata fuori Roma''". (March 17, 2011). ''Corriere della Sera''. Milan.&lt;/ref&gt; another individual was captured near Rome in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/photostory/curiosita/2012/09/17/Tartaruga-azzannatrice-presa-Tevere_7489581.html|title=Tartaruga azzannatrice presa nel Tevere - Photostory Curiosità - ANSA.it|website=www.ansa.it|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japan]], the species was introduced as an exotic pet in the 1960s; it has been recorded as the source of serious bite injuries. In 2004 and 2005, some 1000 individuals were found in [[Chiba Prefecture]], making up the majority of individuals believed to have been introduced.&lt;ref name=thejapantimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/05/national/invasive-snapping-turtles-on-the-rise-in-chiba-other-areas/#.WRlKTUHV_qA |title=Invasive snapping turtles on the rise in Chiba, other areas |last=Desaki |first=Yotaro |date=5 August 2014 |publisher=thejapantimes news  |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
[[File:Ograbme.jpg|thumb|Political cartoon depicting merchants attempting to dodge the "Ograbme"]]
The common snapping turtle was the central feature of a famous [[United States|American]] [[political cartoon]]. Published in 1808 in protest at the [[Thomas Jefferson|Jeffersonian]] [[Embargo Act of 1807]], the cartoon depicted a snapping turtle, jaws locked fiercely to an American trader who was attempting to carry a barrel of goods onto a [[United Kingdom|British]] ship. The trader was seen whimsically uttering the words "Oh! this cursed Ograbme" ("[[embargo]]" spelled backwards). This piece is widely considered a pioneering work within the [[genre]] of the modern political cartoon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In 2006, the snapping turtle was declared the [[List of U.S. state reptiles|state reptile]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] by a sweeping vote of the [[New York Legislature]] after being popularly chosen by the state's public [[elementary school]] children.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/nyregion/23ladybug.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=A Few Things Lawmakers Can Agree On |last=Medina|first=Jennifer|date=2006-06-23|work=N.Y./Region|publisher=New York ''Times''|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As food==
The common snapping turtle is a traditional ingredient in [[turtle soup]]; consumption in large quantities however can become a health concern due to potential concentration of toxic environmental pollutants in the turtle's flesh.&lt;ref name="DEEP-ct.gov"&gt;{{citation |title=Common Snapping Turtle: Interesting Facts |url=http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2723&amp;q=469200 |website=Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, State of Connecticut |publisher=DEEP (ct.gov) |date=8 November 2016 |accessdate=7 October 2017 |mode=CS1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
The species is currently classified as [[Least Concern]] by the [[IUCN]], but has declined sufficiently due to pressure from collection for the pet trade and habitat degradation that Canada and several U.S. states have enacted or are proposing stricter conservation measures.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; In Canada, it is listed as 'Special Concern' in the Species at Risk Act in 2011 and is a target species for projects that include surveys, identification of major habitats, investigation and mitigation of threats, and education of the public including landowners. Involved bodies include governmental departments, universities, museums, and citizen science projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Environment and Climate Change Canada|year=2016|title=Management Plan for the Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina) in Canada [Proposed]|series=Species at Risk Act Management Plan Series|publisher=Ottawa, Environment and Climate Change Canada|location=Ottawa|url=https://www.registrelep-sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/plans/mp_snapping%20turtle_e_proposed.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Some criticised the reaction to Diana's death at the time as being "hysterical" and "irrational". As early as 1998 philosopher [[Anthony O'Hear]] identified the mourning as a defining point in the "sentimentalisation of Britain", a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred.&lt;ref&gt;[[O'Hear, Anthony]] (1998) "Diana, Queen of Hearts: Sentimentality personified and canonised" in Anderson and Mullen ''Faking It: The sentimentalisation of modern society'', [[Social Affairs Unit]], {{ISBN|978-0-907631-75-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] bandleader [[Noel Gallagher]] responded to the reaction with "The woman's dead.

The Royal Standard never flies at half-mast as it is the Sovereign's flag and there is never an [[interregnum]] or vacancy in the monarchy, as the new monarch [[The king is dead, long live the king!|immediately succeeds]] his or her predecessor. Finally, as a compromise, the [[Union Flag]] was flown at half-mast as the Queen left for Westminster Abbey on the day of the funeral.&lt;ref name="Streeter" /&gt; This set a precedent, and [[Flags at Buckingham Palace|Buckingham Palace has subsequently flown the Union Flag]] when the Queen is not in residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law: Text with Materials|author=David Pollard, Neil|p=22|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-199-28637-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rift between Prince Charles and the Queen's private secretary Sir [[Robert Fellowes, Baron Fellowes|Robert Fellowes]] (Diana's brother-in-law) was reported in the media over what the nature of the Princess's funeral should be with Charles demanding a public funeral and Fellowes supporting the Queen's idea of a private one.&lt;ref name="Public-Private"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/16/world/queen-issues-feisty-denial-of-disputes-over-funeral.html|title=Queen Issues Feisty Denial Of Disputes Over Funeral|publisher=The New York Times|first=Youssef M.|last=Ibrahim|date=16 September 1997|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palace later issued a statement denying such rumours.&lt;ref name="Public-Private"/&gt;

In London, thousands of people carried bouquets and stood outside of Buckingham Palace after the news of her death.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; People started bringing flowers within an hour after the news was shared.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The BBC flew its flags at [[half-mast]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Both radio and television aired the British national anthem, "God Save the Queen," in response to Diana's death.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

During the four weeks following her funeral, the [[suicide rate]] in England and Wales rose by 17% and cases of [[Self-injury|deliberate self-harm]] by 44.3% compared with the average for that period in the four previous years. Researchers suggest that this was caused by the "[[identification (psychology)|identification]]" effect, as the greatest increase in suicides was by people most similar to Diana: women aged 25 to 44, whose suicide rate increased by over 45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effect of death of Diana, princess of Wales on suicide and deliberate self-harm|last1=Hawton |first1=Keith|last2=Harriss|first2=Louise|last3=Simkin|first3=Sue|last4=Jusczcak|first4=Edmund|last5=Appleby |first5=Louise|last6=McDonnell|first6=Ros|last7=Amos|first7=Tim|last8=Kiernan|first8=Katy|last9=Parrott|first9=Hilary|publisher=The Royal College of Psychiatrists|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|issue=5|date=November 2000|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/177/5/463|accessdate=4 June 2010|pages=463–466|pmid=11060002 |doi=10.1192/bjp.177.5.463|volume=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another research showed that 50% of Britons and 27% of Americans were deeply affected by her death as if someone they knew had died.

The national grieving for Diana had economic effects. In the short term, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) estimated that retail sales dropped 1% that week. Traffic congestion in central London as crowds went to the palaces to pay homage likewise adversely affected [[productivity]], and the CEBR estimated that would cost businesses £200 million, or a total loss of 0.1% of [[gross domestic product]] for the third quarter of 1997. However, in the long run the CEBR expected that to be offset by increased tourism and memorabilia sales.&lt;ref name="Economic effect"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marks|first=Kathy|title=Diana 1961-1997: The legacy - Death to affect British economy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/diana-1961-1997-the-legacy-death-to-affect-british-economy-1238058.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=7 September 1997|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flame of Liberty.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ''[[Flame of Liberty]]'', the unofficial Diana memorial in Paris, France]]
In the years after her death, interest in the life of Diana has remained high. As a temporary memorial, the public co-opted the ''Flamme de la Liberté'' (''[[Flame of Liberty]]''), a monument near the Alma Tunnel related to the French donation of the [[Statue of Liberty]] to the United States. The messages of condolence have since been removed and its use as a Diana memorial has discontinued, though visitors still leave messages in her memory. A permanent memorial, the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain]], was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II|the Queen]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in London on 6 July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park/hyde-park-attractions/diana-memorial-fountain|title=Diana Memorial Fountain|work=The Royal Parks|accessdate=25 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810143439/http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park/hyde-park-attractions/diana-memorial-fountain|archivedate=10 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, Lord Stevens explained in an interview on [[GMTV]] that the case is substantially more complex than once thought. ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' wrote on 29 January 2006 that agents of the British secret service were cross-examined because they were in Paris at the time of the crash. It was suggested in many journals that these agents might have exchanged the blood test of the driver with another blood sample (although no evidence for this has been forthcoming).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2014816,00.html|title=Doubts cast over blood samples in Diana inquiry|last=Leppard|first=David|date=29 January 2006|newspaper=The Sunday Times|accessdate=1 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|date=30 January 2006|title=Auftrieb für Spekulationen (in: Aus Aller Welt)}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroyalist.net/content/view/372/2/|title=The Diana Investigation: What Lord Stevens Really Said|date=30 January 2006|publisher=The Royalist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
{{Main|Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories}}
Although the initial French investigation found that Diana had died as a result of an accident, several [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] have been raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3372593.stm|title=The theory about conspiracies|publisher=BBC|date=6 January 2004|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since February 1998, Fayed's father, [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] (the owner of the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Hôtel Ritz]], where Paul worked, and thus potentially liable for wrongful death liability) has claimed that the crash was a result of a [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories|conspiracy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/55800.stm|title=Diana crash was a conspiracy – Al Fayed|date=12 February 1998|accessdate=5 August 2008|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] on the instructions of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7251568.stm|title=Point-by-point: Al Fayed's claims|date=19 February 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His claims were dismissed by a French judicial investigation&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; and by [[Operation Paget]], a [[Metropolitan Police Service]] inquiry that concluded in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6179275.stm|title=Diana death a 'tragic accident'|date=14 December 2006|work=BBC News|accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inquest headed by [[Scott Baker (judge)|Lord Justice Scott Baker]] into the deaths of Diana and Fayed began at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], London, on 2 October 2007, a continuation of the inquest that began in 2004.&lt;ref name="inquests" /&gt; On 7 April 2008, the jury concluded that Diana and Fayed were the victims of an  "unlawful killing" by the "[[Gross negligence|grossly negligent]]" chauffeur Paul and the drivers of the following vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1584160/Diana-jury-blames-paparazzi-and-Henri-Paul-for-her-unlawful-killing.html|title=Diana jury blames paparazzi and Henri Paul for her 'unlawful killing'|last=Rayner|first=Gordon|date=7 April 2008|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=12 October 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional factors were "the impairment of the judgment of the driver of the Mercedes through alcohol" and "the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt, the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else".&lt;ref name="verdict" /&gt;

On 17 August 2013, [[Scotland Yard]] revealed that they were examining the credibility of information from a source that alleged that Diana was murdered by a member of the British military.&lt;ref name="reu17"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/17/us-britain-diana-idUSBRE97G09H20130817|title=British police studying new information on Princess Diana death|last=Addison|first=Stephen|date=17 August 2013|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=18 August 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/17/world/europe/england-princess-diana/index.html|title=Newly revealed conspiracy claim in Princess Diana death sparks talk|author=Michael Pearson|date=17 August 2013|newspaper=CNN|accessdate=18 August 2013|author2=Atika Shubert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[George Clooney]] publicly lambasted several tabloids and paparazzi agencies following Diana's death. A few of the tabloids [[boycott]]ed Clooney following the outburst, stating that he "owed a fair portion of his celebrity" to the tabloids and photo agencies in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101970915-138281,00.html|title=Hey, wanna buy some pix?|author=Richard Zoglin|date=24 June 2001|work=TIME|accessdate=22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana was ranked third in the 2002 ''[[100 Greatest Britons|Great Britons]]'' poll sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the British public, after [[Sir Winston Churchill]] (1st) (a distant  cousin), and [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (2nd), just above [[Charles Darwin]] (4th), [[William Shakespeare]] (5th), and [[Isaac Newton]] (6th). That same year, another British poll named Diana's death as the most important event in the country's last 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2002/08/27/Poll-queries-British-sense-of-history/UPI-69441030476098/|title=Poll queries British sense of history|last=Almond|first=Peter|date=27 August 2002|work=United Press International|location=Washington, D.C.|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69Tx5NHQd?url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2002/08/27/Poll-queries-British-sense-of-history/UPI-69441030476098/|archivedate=28 July 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=28 July 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Nick Barrett criticised this outcome as being "a pretty shocking result".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/aug/31/20020831-041721-1985r/|title=Rue Britannia: Diana's death tops poll|date=31 August 2002|newspaper=The Washington Times|accessdate=28 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69TxRbFI9?url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/aug/31/20020831-041721-1985r/|archivedate=28 July 2012|deadurl=no|location=Washington, D.C.|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2004, US TV network [[CBS]] showed pictures of the crash scene in one of its programmes which were "part of a 4,000-page French government report". It showed an intact rear side and centre section of the Mercedes, including one of an unbloodied Diana with no outward injuries crouched on the rear floor with her back to the right passenger seat—the right rear door is fully open. The release of these pictures were poorly received in the UK, where it was felt that the privacy of Diana was being infringed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/22/pressandpublishing.broadcasting|title=Spencer 'sickened' by Diana pictures|date=22 April 2004|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham Palace, UK Prime Minister and Diana's brother condemned the action, while CBS defended its decision saying that the pictures "are placed in journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given to Princess Diana just after the crash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3647849.stm|title=Family's shock over Diana images|publisher=BBC|date=22 April 2004|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July 2006, Italian magazine ''[[Chi (magazine)|Chi]]'' published photographs that showed Diana amid the wreckage of the car crash;&lt;ref name="photo1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/14/world/main1805875.shtml |title=Photos Of Dying Diana Outrage Britain, Italian Magazine Printed Photos Of Princess At Crash Site In 1997 |publisher=CBS News |date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017100235/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/14/world/main1805875.shtml |archivedate=17 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the photos were released despite an unofficial blackout on such photographs being published.&lt;ref name="photo2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5181226.stm |title=Princes' 'sadness' at Diana photo |publisher=BBC News |date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018063600/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5181226.stm |archivedate=18 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The photographs, taken minutes after the accident, show her slumped in the back seat while a paramedic attempts to fit an oxygen mask over her face.}} The editor of ''Chi'' defended his decision by saying he published the photographs simply because they had not been previously seen, and he felt the images were not disrespectful to the memory of Diana.&lt;ref name="photo2" /&gt;

The British newspaper ''[[The Daily Express]]'' has been criticised for continued and sustained coverage of Princess Diana following her death. A 2006 report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' showed that the newspaper had mentioned her in numerous recent news stories, with headlines including "Perhaps Diana should have worn seatbelt", "Diana inquiry chief's laptop secrets stolen", "£250,000 a year bill to run Diana fountain" and "Diana seatbelt sabotage probe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/may/09/pressandpublishing.themonarchy|title=Any old Diana headline here|date=9 May 2006|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet coverage===
Diana's death occurred at a time when Internet use in the developed world was booming, and several national newspapers and at least one British regional newspaper had already launched online news services. [[BBC News]] had set up online coverage of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|general election]] earlier in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshnetworks.com/blog/2008/06/major-events-influenced-bbcs-news-online/|title=Major events influenced BBC's news online|date=5 June 2008|work=Fresh Networks|accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result of the widespread public and media attention that Diana's death resulted in, BBC News swiftly created a website featuring news coverage of Diana's death and the events that followed it. Diana's death helped BBC News officials realise how important online news services were becoming, and a full [[BBC News Online|online news service]] was launched on 4 November that year, alongside the launch of the BBC's rolling news channel [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] on 9 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/diana/|title=Diana Remembered|work=BBC|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''Der Ackermann aus Böhmen''''' (German for "The Ploughman from [[Bohemia]]"), also known as '''''Der Ackermann und der Tod''''' ("The Ploughman and Death"), is a work of prose in [[Early New High German]] by [[Johannes von Tepl]], written around 1401.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marion E. Gibbs (University of London) |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=16326 |title=Literary Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Der Ackermann aus Böhmen |publisher=Litencyc.com |date=2004-07-13 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen manuscripts and seventeen early printed editions are preserved; the earliest printed version dates to 1460 and is one of the two earliest printed books in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia|author= John M. Jeep|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|page=677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Sdo1gNF4D8C&amp;lpg=PA678&amp;dq=der%20ackermann&amp;pg=PA678#v=onepage&amp;q=der%20ackermann&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is remarkable for the high level of its language and vocabulary and is considered one of the most important works of late [[medieval German literature]].

It is a spirited dialogue between the ploughman, whose wife Margaretha has recently died, and [[Death (personification)|Death]]. Central themes of the book are their opposing views on [[life]], [[Human|mankind]], and [[morality]]. The work also represents a concept of marriage as a communion of love, a notion not generally accepted at the time.

The work consists of 34 short chapters. In odd-numbered chapters the ploughman accuses Death of robbing him of his beloved young wife. In the even chapters Death answers, setting logic and cynicism against the emotions of the ploughman. In Chapter 33, [[God]] appears and judges the dispute: he reminds the ploughman that he owes his life to God, and reminds Death that he owes his powers to God. "So plaintiff, yours is the honour!  And Death, yours is the victory! Every man is obliged to give his life to Death, his body to the earth, and his soul to Us." Chapter 34 is a lyrical prayer of the ploughman for the soul of his wife.

The work has been seen as a precursor of early [[humanism]] in [[German literature]], especially by [[Konrad Burdach]]. The opposite position, that the work should be viewed in the tradition of medieval literature, was argued by [[Arthur Hübner]].

There is also the question of whether the work is a mere exercise in courtly style or represents the processing of the author's personal experiences. The former is supported by a letter that Johannes von Tepl wrote in Latin to a friend to accompany the work; in it, he exclusively stresses the work's stylistic merits. The latter is supported by the fact that the author's first wife had died in 1400, that the protagonist's plough is described as a feather (i.e. he is a writer), and that the initial letters of the last chapter's prayer spell JOHANNES.

'''''Donnie Darko''''' is a 2001 American [[science fiction film]] written and directed by [[Richard Kelly (director)|Richard Kelly]]. It stars [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Jena Malone]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Katharine Ross]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Noah Wyle]], and [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]. The film follows the adventures of the troubled title character as he seeks the meaning behind his [[Doomsday event|doomsday]]-related visions.

Filmed over the course of 28 days (coincidentally mirroring the time transpired in the movie), the film was almost released [[straight-to-video]].&lt;ref name="'Darko' takes a long, strange trip"&gt;{{cite news |title = 'Darko' takes a long, strange trip |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-02-14-dvd-donnie-darko_x.htm |publisher = [[USA Today]] |first1=Mike |last1=Snider |date=2005-02-14 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Donnie Darko'' was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, 2001, before receiving a limited theatrical release on October 26, 2001 by [[Flower Films]]. Due to the film's advertising featuring a crashing plane and the [[September 11 attacks]] that transpired a month before, the film was scarcely advertised. In the end, ''Donnie Darko'' grossed just over $7.5 million worldwide on a budget of $4.5 million.&lt;ref name="numbers" /&gt; Despite its lackluster box office performance, ''Donnie Darko'' received critical acclaim. Critics lauded the film's story, acting, and tone. The film was listed #2 in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s 50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time,&lt;ref name="empireonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.empireonline.com/features/50greatestindependent/2.asp|title=50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as #63 in ''Empire'''s 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.empireonline.com/500/88.asp|title=Empire's 500 Greatest Movies Of All Time|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in March 2002. The film became a surprising success on the home video market, reportedly grossing over $10 million in home video sales. The film has developed a [[cult following]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-new-cult-canon-donnie-darko,2179/|title= The New Cult Canon: Donnie Darko|author=Scott Tobias |date=2008-02-21 |publisher = The Onion | work = [[The A.V. Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's soundtrack is also famous for its cover of [[Tears for Fears]]'s "[[Mad World]]" by [[Gary Jules]] and [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]]. The cover reached number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and stayed there for three consecutive weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/gary-jules-3-1373002|title=IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD!|date=4 January 2004|work=[[NME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song achieved lukewarm success in the United States, reaching number 30 on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. A [[Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut|director's cut]] was released in 2004, on a two-disc special edition [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=donnie_darko|title=Donnie Darko}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stage adaptation appeared in 2007, and a sequel, ''[[S. Darko]]'', in 2009.

==Plot==
On October 2, 1988, troubled teenager Donald "Donnie" Darko is woken up and beckoned outside by a mysterious voice. Once outside, he meets a figure in a monstrous rabbit costume who introduces himself as "Frank" and tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie wakes up the next morning on the green of a local golf course and returns home to discover a [[jet engine]] has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] investigators do not know its origin.

Over the next several days, Donnie continues to have visions of Frank, and his parents Eddie and Rose send him to [[psychotherapist]] Dr. Thurman. Thurman believes Donnie is detached from reality, and that his visions of Frank are "[[hallucination|daylight hallucinations]]," symptomatic of [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Frank asks Donnie if he believes in [[time travel]], who, in turn, asks his science teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff. Monnitoff gives Donnie ''The Philosophy of Time Travel'', a book written by Roberta Sparrow, a former science teacher at the school who is now a seemingly senile old woman living outside of town. Donnie also starts seeing Gretchen Ross, who has recently moved into town with her mother under a new identity to escape her violent stepfather.

Frank begins to influence Donnie's actions, including causing him to flood his high school by breaking a water main. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer attributes the act of vandalism to the influence of the short story "[[The Destructors]]", assigned by dedicated English teacher Karen Pomeroy. Kitty begins teaching “attitude lessons” taken from local [[motivational speaker]] Jim Cunningham, but Donnie rebels against these, leading to friction between Kitty and Rose. Kitty arranges for Cunningham to speak at a school assembly, where Donnie insults him. He later finds Cunningham's wallet and address, and Frank suggests setting his house on fire. Firefighters discover a hoard of [[child pornography]] there. Cunningham is arrested, and Kitty, who wishes to testify in his defense, asks Rose to chaperone their daughters’ dance troupe on its trip to Los Angeles.

With Rose and little sister Samantha in Los Angeles, and Eddie away for business, Donnie and Elizabeth hold a [[Halloween]] costume party to celebrate Elizabeth's acceptance to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. At the party, Gretchen arrives distraught as her mother has gone missing, and she and Donnie have sex for the first time. When Donnie realizes that Frank's [[Prophecy|prophesied]] end of the world is only hours away, he takes Gretchen and two other friends to see Sparrow. Instead of Sparrow, they find two high school bullies, Seth and Ricky, who were trying to rob Sparrow's home. Donnie, Seth, and Ricky get into a fight in the road in front of her house, just as Sparrow was returning home. An oncoming car swerves to avoid Sparrow and runs over Gretchen, killing her. The driver turns out to be Elizabeth's boyfriend, Frank Anderson, wearing the same rabbit costume from Donnie's visions. Donnie shoots Frank in the eye with his father's gun, and walks home carrying Gretchen’s body.

Donnie returns home as a vortex forms over his house. He borrows one of his parent’s cars, loads Gretchen’s body into it, and drives to a nearby ridge that overlooks town. There, he watches as the plane carrying Rose and the dance troupe home from Los Angeles gets caught in the vortex’s wake, which violently rips off one of its engines, and sends it back in time. Events of the previous 28 days unwind. Donnie wakes up in his bedroom, recognizes the date is October 2, and laughs as the jet engine falls into his bedroom, crushing him. Around town, those whose lives Donnie would have touched wake up from troubled dreams. Gretchen rides by the Darko home the next morning, and learns of Donnie's death. Gretchen and Rose exchange glances and wave as if they know each other, but cannot remember where.

==Production==
Although the film was always meant to be set in 1988, Kelly admitted he felt pressured to make the setting more contemporary; but, he couldn't figure out how to make the story work in such a setting and retained the original setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Cranswick | first=Ami | title=Exclusive Interview with Donnie Darko writer/director Richard Kelly | url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/12/exclusive-interview-with-donnie-darko-writerdirector-richard-kelly/ | website=Flickering Myth | accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with BBC, Kelly said he "set out to write something ambitious, personal, and nostalgic about the late 80s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korsner|first1=Jason|title=Donnie Darko Interview|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/10/21/richard_kelly_donnie_darko_interview.shtml|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=BBC|date=October 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank, the giant rabbit, was inspired by the novel ''[[Watership Down]]'', with the novel's censorship being a plot point before being abandoned in the final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Susman|first1=Gary|title=25 Things You May Not Know About 'Donnie Darko'|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2011/10/26/25-things-you-may-not-know-about-donnie-darko/|website=Moviefone|accessdate=21 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051340/https://www.moviefone.com/2011/10/26/25-things-you-may-not-know-about-donnie-darko/ |archive-date=22 December 2017 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer information has shown the costume could also have been an inspiration from a dream Kelly had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=THE BUNNY SUIT|last=Coggan|first=Devan|date=7 April 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
''Donnie Darko'' was filmed in 28 days which, by coincidence, virtually matches the time that transpires in the film from October 2, 1988, to the Friday or Saturday weekend party before Halloween on Monday, October 31, 1988.&lt;ref name="DCDVD" /&gt;  The budget for the film was $4.5 million.&lt;ref name="DCDVD" /&gt;

It almost went straight to home video, but was theatrically released by Drew Barrymore's production company, [[Flower Films]].&lt;ref name="'Darko' takes a long, strange trip"/&gt;

Some scenes were shot in Bixby Knolls Virginia Country Club, in Long Beach, [[California]], with many of the school sequences shot at [[Loyola High School (Los Angeles, California)|Loyola High School]]. The "Carpathian Ridge" scenes were shot on the [[Angeles Crest Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Poster, Steven (Cinematographer) |title=Donnie Darko Production Diary |medium=DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Donnie Darko (soundtrack)}}
In 2003, the piano-driven cover of [[Tears for Fears]]' "[[Mad World]]" featured in the film, as part of the end sequence, was a hit for composer [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]] and singer [[Gary Jules]], topping the charts in the United Kingdom and Portugal.&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunett |first=Adam |date=2004-07-22 |website=[[Indie Wire]] |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/donnie_darko_the_directors_cut_the_strange_afterlife_of_an_indie_cult_film |title=Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut: The Strange Afterlife of an Indie Cult Film |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One continuous sequence involving an introduction of Donnie's high school prominently features the song "[[Head over Heels (Tears for Fears song)|Head over Heels]]", by [[Tears for Fears]], Samantha's dance group, "Sparkle Motion", performs with the song "[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]", by [[Duran Duran]], and "[[Under the Milky Way]]", by [[The Church (band)|The Church]], is played after Donnie and Gretchen emerge from his room during the party. "[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]", by [[Joy Division]], also appears in the film [[diegesis|diegetically]] during the party and shots of Donnie and Gretchen upstairs. The version included was released in 1995, although the film is set in 1988. The opening sequence is set to "[[The Killing Moon]]" by [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]].&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/12415/donnie-darko-directors-cut.html|title=''Donnie Darko'': Director's Cut|first=Matt|last=Day|date=10 August 2004|publisher=The Digital Fix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the re-released [[director's cut]], the music in the opening sequence is replaced by "[[Never Tear Us Apart]]" by [[INXS]]; "[[Under the Milky Way]]" is moved to the scene of Donnie and Eddie driving home from Donnie's meeting with his therapist; and "The Killing Moon" is played as Gretchen and Donnie return to the party from Donnie's parents' room.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;

==Release==
The film had a [[limited release]], opening October 26, the month following the [[September 11 attacks]]. It was subsequently held back for almost a year for international release. Kelly said it took almost six months to sell the movie. "It almost went directly to the [[Starz|Starz network]]. We had to beg them to put it in theaters. [[Filmmaker]] [[Christopher Nolan]] stepped in and convinced [[Newmarket Films|Newmarket]] to put it in theaters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/14/donnie-darko-richard-kelly-donald-trump|title=Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly: 'Sometimes films need time to marinate'|first=Dave|last=Schilling|date=November 14, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=January 26, 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
''The Donnie Darko Book'', written by Richard Kelly, is a 2003 book about the film. It includes an introduction by Jake Gyllenhaal, the screenplay of the ''[[Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut]]'', an in-depth interview with Kelly, facsimile pages from the ''Philosophy of Time Travel'', photos and drawings from the film, and artwork it inspired. [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] released first a six-inch (15&amp;nbsp;cm) figure of Frank the Bunny and later a foot-tall (30&amp;nbsp;cm) "talking version" of the same figure.

===Home media===
The film was originally released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in March 2002. Strong DVD sales led [[Newmarket Films]] to release a "[[Director's cut|Director's Cut]]" on DVD in 2004. Bob Berney, President of Newmarket Films, has described the film as "a runaway hit on DVD," citing United States sales of more than $10 million.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The film was released in the U.S. on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on February 10, 2009, containing both versions. The movie was then re-released on July 26, 2011 as a four-disc, 10th anniversary edition, once again containing both versions in HD, and the theatrical version on DVD.

The film was released as a 2-disc Blu-ray special edition in the UK on July 19, 2010, by Metrodome Distribution, and featuring both Original and Director's Cut. It also included commentaries from director Kelly and actor Gyllenhaal, Kelly and [[Kevin Smith]], and cast and crew, including Drew Barrymore.

In December 2016, [[Arrow Films]] released a limited edition [[4K resolution]] Blu-ray of the film in the UK, supervised and approved by director Kelly. This release includes both the Director's and Theatrical cuts and was accompanied by a [[Dual format]] Blu-ray and DVD release.&lt;ref&gt;The Dual Format Blu-ray and DVD release arrived on December 12th&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, it was released in April 2017.

===Director's cut===
{{Main|Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut}}
''Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut'' was released on May 29, 2004, in [[Seattle, Washington]], at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], and later in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]], on July 23, 2004. The tickets sold out within the day for the Seattle International Film Festival premiere, grossing nearly $33,000 over a five-day period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=AFTER DARK|last=Valby|first=Karen|date=18 June 2004|work=Entertainment Weekly|last2=Flynn|first2=Gillian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cut includes twenty minutes of extra footage and an altered soundtrack.

The director's cut DVD was released on February 15, 2005 in single- and double-disc versions, the latter being available in a standard DVD case or in a limited edition that also features a [[Lenticular lens|lenticular]] slipcase, whose central image alternates between Donnie and Frank depending on the viewing angle. Most additional features are exclusive to the two-DVD set: the director's commentary assisted by [[Kevin Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Commentary with Kevin Smith | title = Donnie Darko Directors Cut | publisher = Faber and Faber | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-571-22124-6 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; excerpts from the storyboard, a 52-minute production diary, "#1 fan video", a "cult following" video interviewing English fans, and the new director's cut trailer. The single-DVD edition was also released as a giveaway with copies of the British ''Sunday Times'' newspaper on February 19, 2006.

The DVD of the Director's Cut includes text of the in-universe fictional book, ''The Philosophy of Time Travel'', written by Roberta Sparrow, which Donnie is given and reads in the film.&lt;ref name="POTT"&gt;[http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/philosphy-of-time-travel/ Text of ''The Philosophy of Time Travel'']&lt;/ref&gt; The text expands on the philosophical and scientific concepts much of the film's plot revolves around, and has been seen as a way to understand the film better than from its theatrical release.&lt;ref name=Everything/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Donnie-Darko-The-Director-s-Cut-631.html|title=Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut - CINEMABLEND|date=May 27, 2016|work=cinemablend.com|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/01/24/donnie-darko-the-directors-cut|title=Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut|first=Mike|last=Drucker|date=January 24, 2005|work=ign.com|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined by ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''{{'}}s Dan Kois from the book's text, much of the film takes place in an unstable Tangent Universe that is connected to the Primary Universe and a duplicate of it, except for an extra metal vessel known as an Artifact&amp;nbsp;— the plane engine. If the Artifact is not sent to the Primary Universe by the chosen Living Receiver (Donnie) within 28 days, the Primary Universe will be destroyed upon collapse of the Tangent. To aid in this task, the Living Receiver is given super-human abilities such as foresight, physical strength and elemental powers, but at the cost of troubling visions and paranoia, while the Manipulated Living (all who live around the Receiver) support him in unnatural ways, setting up a [[domino effect|domino-like chain of events]] encouraging him to return the Artifact. The Manipulated Dead (those who die within the Tangent Universe, like Frank and Gretchen) are more aware than the Living, having the power to travel through time, and will set an Ensurance Trap, a scenario which leaves the Receiver no choice but to save the Primary Universe.&lt;ref name=Everything&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.salon.com/2004/07/23/darko/ | title = Everything you were afraid to ask about "Donnie Darko" | first = Dan | last = Kois | date = 2004-07-23 | accessdate = 2013-06-19 | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
{{Anchor|Box office}}
''Donnie Darko'' had its first screening at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], on January 19, 2001, and debuted in United States theaters on October 26, 2001, to a tepid response. During its opening weekend, it was shown on only 58 screens nationwide, grossing $110,494.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=donniedarko.htm|title=Donnie Darko (2001)|publisher= IMDB | work = [[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the result of the movie being released shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cine-vue.com/2010/07/dvd-releases-donnie-darko-2-disc.html|title=Blu-ray Review: 'Donnie Darko: 2 Disc Ultimate Edition' (rerelease)|author=James Davies|publisher=cine-vue.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220014356/http://www.cine-vue.com/2010/07/dvd-releases-donnie-darko-2-disc.html|archivedate=February 20, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the film's run closed in United States theaters, on April 11, 2002, it had earned just $517,375.&lt;ref name="numbers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; It ultimately grossed $7.6 million worldwide, just enough to recoup its budget.&lt;ref name="numbers" /&gt;

Despite its poor box office showing, the film began to attract a devoted fan base. It was originally released on VHS and DVD in March 2002. During this time, the Pioneer Theatre in [[New York City]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] began [[Midnight movie|midnight screenings]] of ''Donnie Darko'' that continued for 28 consecutive months.&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt; In the United Kingdom, ''Donnie Darko'' sold 300,000 tickets within the first six weeks of its release, based mostly on [[word-of-mouth marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, Danny (29 July 2004).

===Critical reaction===
The film received critical acclaim, with praise towards the acting, atmosphere and unconventional writing. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the theatrical version of the film an 86% rating, and the director's cut a 91% rating.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes" /&gt; The site's critical consensus reads, "Richard Kelly's debut feature ''Donnie Darko'' is a daring, original vision, packed with jarring ideas and intelligence and featuring a remarkable performance from Jake Gyllenhaal as the troubled title character."

[[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnson]] cited the film in ''[[Us Weekly]]'', as one of the outstanding films at Sundance in 2001, describing it as "a heady blend of science fiction, spirituality, and teen angst."&lt;ref&gt;''Us Weekly'', 2/21/2001, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Oppenheimer of ''New Times (LA)'' praised the film, saying, "Like gathering storm clouds, ''Donnie Darko'' creates an atmosphere of eerie calm and mounting menace—[and] stands as one of the most exceptional movies of 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/park_city_2001_review_donnie_darko_plays_with_the_time_of_our_lives |title=PARK CITY 2001 REVIEW: Donnie Darko Plays with the Time of Our Lives |author=Andy Bailey |date=2001-01-21 |publisher=[[Indie Wire]] |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ABC Australia, Megan Spencer called the movie "menacing, dreamy, [and] exciting" and noted "it could take you to a deeply emotional place lying dormant in your soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/film/s702145.htm|title=Donnie Darko: triple j film reviews|author=Megan Spencer|date=2002-10-15|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the theatrical version of the film two and a half stars out of four, but later gave the director's cut three stars out of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/donnie-darko-the-directors-cut-2004 |author=[[Roger Ebert]] |accessdate=2012-08-31 |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
{{main|S. Darko}}
A 2009 [[sequel]], ''[[S. Darko]]'', centers on Sam, Donnie's younger sister. Sam begins to have strange dreams that hint at a major catastrophe. ''Donnie Darko'' creator [[Richard Kelly (director)|Richard Kelly]] has said he had no involvement in the sequel, as he does not own the rights to the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/13/arcade-fire-open-box|title=Arcade Fire Open Box: Richard Kelly on film score and Darko sequel |author=Chris Tilly |date=2008-05-13 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase and producer [[Adam Fields]] were the only creative links between it and the original film. The sequel received extremely negative reviews.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/s-darko,27924/|title=S. Darko |author=Josh Modell |date=2009-05-13 |publisher=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview published on January 24, 2017, Kelly revealed there's a movie set in the world of ''Donnie Darko'' he wants to make, that would be much bigger and more ambitious than the original. Because of the large budget required, Kelly said he will look into securing the necessary resources, once he finishes with his next film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmv.com/video/richard-kelly-talks-reissuing-donnie-darko-and-his-plans-for-a-much-bigger-and-more-ambitious-sequel|title=Richard Kelly talks reissuing Donnie Darko and his plans for a "much bigger and more ambitious" sequel|work=hmv.com|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[PopMatters]]'' magazine journalist J.C. Maçek III director [[Richard Kelly (director)|Richard Kelly]] said regarding the sequel ''[[S. Darko]]'', "I hate it when people ask me about that sequel because" he laughs, morosely, "I had nothing to do with it. And I hate it when people try and blame me or hold me responsible for it because I had no [involvement]. I don’t control the underlying rights to [the Donnie Darko franchise]. I had to relinquish them when I was 24-years old. I hate when people ask me about that because I’ve never seen it and I never will, so… don’t ask me about the sequel." He adds with a cynical laugh, "Those people are making lots of money. They’re certainly making lots of money."&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Mainstream Darko: Director Richard Kelly on Building His Own Sandbox|date=3 April 2017|author=Maçek III, J.C.|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/mainstream-darko-richard-kelly-interview-donnie-darko/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked if he would ever do an official sequel, Kelly responded, "I’m open to doing something much bigger and longer and more ambitious that could be a new story." He added, "We’ll see what happens. I have a lot of stuff that I’m working on and it’s ambitious and it’s expensive and we’ll see what happens."&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

==Adaptations==
[[Marcus Stern (theatre director)|Marcus Stern]], associate director of the [[American Repertory Theater]], directed a stage adaptation of ''Donnie Darko'' at the Zero Arrow Theatre, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], in the fall of 2007. It ran from October 27 until November 18, 2007, with opening night scheduled near Halloween.

An article written by the production drama team says the director and production team planned to "embrace the challenge to make the fantastical elements come alive on stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/inside/articles/articles-vol-6-i1c-end-world| title = Bringing the End of the World to Life| author = Sarah Wallace| publisher = [[American Repertory Theatre]]| date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Stern adapted and directed Kelly's screenplay for a graduate student production at the American Repertory Theatre's [[Institute for Advanced Theater Training]] (I.A.T.T./M.X.A.T.).

'''Edvard Hagerup Grieg''' ({{IPA-no|ˈɛdvɑɖ ˈhɑːɡərʉp ˈɡrɪɡː}}; 15 June 1843{{spaced ndash}}4 September 1907) was a Norwegian [[composer]] and [[pianist]]. He is widely considered one of the leading [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use and development of [[Music of Norway|Norwegian folk music]] in his own compositions brought the music of Norway to international consciousness, as well as helping to develop a [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|national identity]], much as [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Bedřich Smetana]] did in [[Finland]] and [[Bohemia]], respectively.&lt;ref name="isbn1-84383-210-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Daniel M.

Grieg is the most celebrated person from the city of [[Bergen]], with numerous statues depicting his image, and many cultural entities named after him: the city's largest concert building ([[Grieg Hall]]), its most advanced music school ([[Grieg Academy]]) and its professional choir (Edvard Grieg Kor). The Edvard Grieg Museum at Grieg's former home, [[Troldhaugen]], is dedicated to his legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bergenbyarkiv.no/bergenbyleksikon/arkiv/1424944?s=Grieghallen|title=Grieghallen|publisher =Bergen byleksikon|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://kmd.uib.no/no/studier/musikk |title=  Griegakademiet|publisher =Universitetet i Bergen|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://griegmuseum.no/en |title=Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen|publisher =KODE|accessdate= September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://en.edvardgriegkor.no/ |title= About Edvard Grieg Kor|publisher=  Edvard Grieg Kor|accessdate= September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edvard Hagerup Grieg was born in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]]. His parents were Alexander Grieg (1806–1875), a merchant and vice-consul in Bergen; and Gesine Judithe Hagerup (1814–1875), a music teacher and daughter of solicitor and politician [[Edvard Hagerup]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Edvard Grieg |first=Finn  |last=Benestad|authorlink=Finn Benestad |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]] |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Edvard_Grieg/utdypning |language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benestad; Schjelderup-Ebbe (1990) [1980]. pp. 25–28&lt;/ref&gt;  The family name, originally spelled [[Greig (name)|Greig]], is associated with the [[Scottish clans|Scottish]] [[Clan Gregor|Clann Ghriogair (Clan Gregor)]].  After the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746, Grieg's great-grandfather, Alexander Greig,&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Nils Grinde. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/11757 "Grieg, Edvard"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 11 November 2013 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; travelled widely, settling in Norway about 1770, and establishing business interests in Bergen.

Edvard Grieg was raised in a musical family. His mother was his first piano teacher and taught him to play at the age of six. Grieg studied in several schools, including [[Tanks Upper Secondary School]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Layton. ''Grieg''. (London: Omnibus Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1858, Grieg met the eminent Norwegian violinist [[Ole Bull]],&lt;ref name="Benestad 1990 pp. 35"&gt;Benestad; Schjelderup-Ebbe (1990) [1980]. pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; who was a family friend; Bull's brother was married to Grieg's aunt.&lt;ref&gt;Benestad; Schjelderup-Ebbe (1990) [1980]. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Bull recognized the 15-year-old boy's talent and persuaded his parents to send him to the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Leipzig Conservatory]],&lt;ref name="Benestad 1990 pp. 35"/&gt; the piano department of which was directed by [[Ignaz Moscheles]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Roche and Henry Roche.

Grieg enrolled in the [[music school|conservatory]], concentrating on the piano, and enjoyed the many concerts and recitals given in [[Leipzig]]. He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study. An exception was the [[organ (music)|organ]], which was mandatory for piano students. In the spring of 1860, he survived two life-threatening [[Respiratory disease|lung diseases]], [[pleurisy]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Throughout his life, Grieg's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine. He suffered from numerous respiratory infections, and ultimately developed combined lung and heart failure. Grieg was admitted many times to spas and [[Sanatorium|sanatoria]] both in Norway and abroad. Several of his doctors became his personal friends.&lt;ref&gt;Laerum OD. Edvard Grieg's health and his physicians. Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 1993 Dec 10;113(30):3750-3 {{PMID|8278965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1861, Grieg made his debut as a concert pianist in [[Karlshamn]], Sweden. In 1862, he finished his studies in Leipzig and held his first concert in his home town,&lt;ref&gt;[http://griegmuseum.no/en/about-grieg Grieg Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; where his programme included [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Pathétique]]'' sonata.

[[File:Edvard en Nina Grieg 1899.jpg|right|thumb| Edvard Grieg and [[Nina Grieg|Nina Hagerup]] (Grieg's wife and first cousin) in 1899]]
In 1863, Grieg went to [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, and stayed there for three years. He met the Danish composers [[Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann|J. P. E. Hartmann]] and [[Niels Gade]]. He also met his fellow Norwegian composer [[Rikard Nordraak]] (composer of the [[Ja, vi elsker dette landet|Norwegian national anthem]]), who became a good friend and source of inspiration. Nordraak died in 1866, and Grieg composed a [[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak|funeral march]] in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://snl.no/Edvard_Grieg |title=Edvard Grieg|publisher=Store norske leksikon|author=Rune J. Andersen
|accessdate= September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 1867, Grieg married his first cousin, [[Nina Grieg|Nina Hagerup]] (1845–1935), a lyric soprano. The next year, their only child, Alexandra, was born. Alexandra died in 1869 from [[meningitis]]. In the summer of 1868, Grieg wrote his [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] while on holiday in Denmark. [[Edmund Neupert]] gave the concerto its premiere performance on 3&amp;nbsp;April 1869 in the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen. Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://nbl.snl.no/Nina_Grieg   |title=Nina Grieg
|publisher= Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Inger Elisabeth Haavet|accessdate= September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, [[Franz Liszt]], who had not yet met Grieg, wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education, which led to Grieg's obtaining a travel grant. The two men met in [[Rome]] in 1870. On Grieg's first visit, they went over Grieg's Violin Sonata No. 1, which pleased Liszt greatly. On his second visit in April, Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto, which Liszt proceeded to sightread (including the orchestral arrangement). Liszt's rendition greatly impressed his audience, although Grieg gently pointed out to him that he played the first movement too quickly. Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on [[orchestration]] (for example, to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.mnc.net/norway/grieg.htm |title=  Edvard Grieg (1843-1907) |publisher=  Norwegian State Academy of Music in Oslo |author=  Harald Herresthal |accessdate=  September 1, 2017 |deadurl=  yes |archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20051214011056/http://www.mnc.net/norway/GRIEG.HTM |archivedate=  14 December 2005 |df=  dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874–76, Grieg composed [[incidental music]] for the premiere of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', at the request of the author.

Grieg had close ties with the [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]] (Harmonien), and later became Music Director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882. In 1888, Grieg met [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] in Leipzig. Grieg was struck by the greatness of Tchaikovsky.&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/5648/I_1st1.htm |title=First Impressions, Edvard Grieg |author=Gretchen Lamb |accessdate=11 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027092831/http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/5648/I_1st1.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 |deadurl=unfit }} Lamb cites David Brown's ''Tchaikovsky Remembered''&lt;/ref&gt; Tchaikovsky thought very highly of Grieg's music, praising its beauty, originality and warmth.&lt;ref name=kenn&gt;{{cite web

Grieg was awarded two honorary doctorates, first by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1894 and the next from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Lionel. "Preface." Preface. Edvard Grieg in England. N.p.: Boydell, 2006. Xi. Google Books. Web. 01 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Troldhaugen in Bergen.jpg|thumb|225 px|Edvard Grieg Museum in [[Troldhaugen]]]]
The Norwegian government provided Grieg with a pension as he reached retirement age. In the spring of 1903, Grieg made nine 78-rpm [[gramophone record]]ings of his piano music in Paris; all of these historic discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs, despite limited fidelity. Grieg also made live-recording [[player piano]] music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and [[Welte-Mignon]] reproducing system, all of which survive today and can be heard. He also worked with the [[Aeolian Company]] for its 'Autograph Metrostyle' piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces.

In 1899, Grieg cancelled his concerts in [[France]] in protest of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], an anti-semitic scandal that was then roiling French politics. Regarding this scandal, Grieg had written that he hoped that the French might, "Soon return to the spirit of 1789, when the French republic declared that it would defend basic human rights."  As a result of his position on the affair, he became the target of much French [[hate mail]] of that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2007/02/27/493382.html Grieg the Humanist Brought to Light] article by ''Dagbladet''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/books/i-have-no-desire-to-appear-before-a-french-audience-1.47656 I Have No Desire....] Haaretz News. April 4, 2002. By Shaul Koubovi.  Downloaded Dec. 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, he met the composer and pianist [[Percy Grainger]] in London. Grainger was a great admirer of Grieg's music and a strong empathy was quickly established. In a 1907 interview, Grieg stated: “I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.”&lt;ref&gt;John Bird, ''Percy Grainger '', Oxford University Press, 1999, P. 133-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edvard Grieg died at the Municipal Hospital in Bergen, Norway in the late summer of 1907 at age 64 from [[heart failure]]. He had suffered a long period of illness. His last words were "Well, if it must be so."

The funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people out on the streets of his home town to honor him. Following his wish, his own ''[[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak]]'' was played in an orchestration by his friend [[Johan Halvorsen]], who had married Grieg's niece.

Grieg also composed the incidental music for [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', which includes the famous excerpt entitled, "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]". In this piece of music, the adventures of the anti-hero, Peer Gynt, are related, including the episode in which he steals a bride at her wedding. The angry guests chase him, and Peer falls, hitting his head on a rock. He wakes up in a mountain surrounded by trolls. The music of "In the Hall of the Mountain King" represents the angry trolls taunting Peer and gets louder each time the theme repeats. The music ends with Peer escaping from the mountain.

In an 1874 letter to his friend [[Frants Beyer]], Grieg expressed his unhappiness with Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter, one of the movements he composed for ''Peer Gynt'', writing "I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King – something that I literally can't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies, exaggerated Norwegian nationalism, and trollish self-satisfaction! But I have a hunch that the irony will be discernible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Grieg's ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was originally written for the piano, and later arranged by the composer for [[string instrument|string]] orchestra. Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], Henrik Ibsen, [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and others. Russian composer [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]] used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet. Norwegian pianist [[Eva Knardahl]] recorded the composer's complete piano music on 13 LPs for [[BIS Records]] in 1977-1980. The recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs, also on [[BIS Records]]. Grieg himself recorded many of these piano works before his death in 1907.

'''Elizabeth of Rhuddlan''' (7 August 1282 – 5 May 1316) was the eighth and youngest daughter of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] and Queen [[Eleanor of Castile]]. Of all of her siblings, she was closest to her younger brother [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]], as they were only two years apart in age.

==First marriage==
In April 1285 there were negotiations with [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Floris V]] for Elizabeth's betrothal to his son [[John I, Count of Holland]]. The offer was accepted and John was sent to [[England]] to be educated. On 8 January 1297 Elizabeth was married to John at [[Ipswich]]. In attendance at the marriage were Elizabeth's sister [[Margaret of England (1275–1333)|Margaret]], her father, [[Edward I of England]], her brother [[Edward II of England|Edward]], and [[Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]]. After the wedding Elizabeth was expected to go to [[Holland]] with her husband, but did not wish to go, leaving her husband to go alone. It is recorded that while in Ipswich the King, in some outburst, threw his daughter's coronet into the fire: a great ruby and a great emerald were supplied by Adam the Goldsmith for stones lost as a result.&lt;ref&gt;T.H. Turner (ed.), ''Manners and Household Expenses of England in the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Centuries, Illustrated by Original Records'' (William Nicol/Shakspeare Press, London 1841), [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924027939820#page/n89/mode/2up pp. lxxvi–vii, note] (Internet archive).&lt;/ref&gt;

After some time travelling England, it was decided Elizabeth should follow her husband. Her father accompanied her, travelling through the [[Southern Netherlands]] between [[Antwerp]], [[Mechelen]], [[Leuven]] and [[Brussels]], before ending up in [[Ghent]]. There they remained for a few months, spending [[Christmas]] with her two sisters [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Bar|Eleanor]] and [[Margaret of England, Duchess of Brabant|Margaret]]. On 10 November 1299, John died of [[dysentery]], though there were rumours of his murder. No children had been born from the marriage.

==Second marriage==
On her return trip to England, Elizabeth went through [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to see her sister Margaret. When she arrived in England, she met her stepmother [[Margaret of France, Queen of England|Margaret]], whom Edward had married while she was in [[Holland]]. On 14 November 1302 Elizabeth was married to [[Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford]], 3rd of Essex, also [[Constable of England]], at [[Westminster Abbey]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Issue==
The children of Elizabeth and [[Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford]] were:

''Plantagenet Ancestry:  A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families'', vol. 1, 2nd ed., (2011):  p. 306 (author states, "ii. HUMPHREY DE BOHUN, 1st son, born shortly before 30 Oct. 1303.  He died by the end of Oct. 1304, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.").&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Lady Eleanor de Bohun]] (17 October 1304 – 1363)
# [[John de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford]] (23 November 1306 – 1335)

# [[Margaret de Bohun, 2nd Countess of Devon]] (3 April 1311 – 1391)
# [[William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton]] (1312–1360). 
# Edward de Bohun (1312–1334), twin of William
# Eneas de Bohun, (1314 – after 1322); he is mentioned in his father's will
# Isabel de Bohun (b&amp;d 5 May 1316)

==Later life==
During [[Christmas]] 1315, Elizabeth, who was pregnant with her eleventh child, was visited by her sister-in-law, Queen [[Isabella of France]]. On 5 May 1316 she went into labour, giving birth to her daughter Isabella. Both Elizabeth and her daughter Isabella died shortly after the birth, and were buried together in [[Walden Abbey Church, Walden Essex]].

'''Ethical arguments''' have arisen regarding [[torture]], and its debated value to [[society]]. Despite worldwide condemnation and the existence of treaty provisions that forbid it, some countries still use it. The [[ethical]] assertion that torture is a tool is at question.

==Premise==
{{see|Effectiveness of torture for interrogation}}
The basic ethical debate is often presented as a matter of [[deontological]] versus [[utilitarian]] viewpoint. A utilitarian thinker may believe, when the overall outcome of lives saved due to torture are positive, torture can be justified; the intended outcome of an action is held as the primary factor in determining its merit or morality. The opposite view is the deontological, from Greek "deon" (duty), which proposes general rules and values that are to be respected regardless of outcome. However, if the outcome of policies allowing torture are uncertain (or if the outcome can not be definitely traced back to the use of torture) then there can be a utilitarian view that torture is wrong (see issues related to the ends justifying the means in analysis of the [[ticking time bomb scenario]]).

It has been suggested that one of the reasons torture endures is that torture indeed works in some instances to extract information/confession if those who are being tortured are indeed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9832909 |title=Terrorism and civil liberty: torture |work=[[The Economist]] |date=September 20, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Posner]], a highly influential judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, argued that "If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary [[ticking time bomb scenario|to prevent the detonation of a nuclear bomb]] in Times Square, torture should be used—and will be used—to obtain the information.... No one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Posner |first=Richard |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/the-best-offense |title=The Best Offense |work=The New Republic |date=September 2, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some experienced intelligence officers&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/8833108/Torture-is-not-wrong-it-just-doesnt-work-says-former-interrogator.html |title=Torture is not wrong, it just doesn't work, says former interrogator |work=The Telegraph |date=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/glenn-l-carle/zero-dark-thirty-torture_b_2395939.html |title=Glenn L. Carle: Zero Dark Thirty -- Torture Is the American Way? |work=Huffington Post |date=January 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have more recently come forward claiming that not only does torture not work, it can result in false information since people undergoing torture will say anything just to make the torture stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Rothrock | first= Col. John |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2302-2005Jan11.html |title=The Torture Myth |work=The Washington Post |date=January 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people also point to neuroscience to demonstrate that torture may further impair a person's ability to tell the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/09/21/the-tortured-brain.html |title=The Tortured Brain |work=The Daily Beast |date=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And the debate continues.

A utilitarian argument against torture is that the majority of tortures are employed not as a method of extracting information, but as a method of terrorizing and subjugating the population, enabling state forces to dispense with ordinary means of establishing innocence or guilt and with the whole legal apparatus altogether.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Therefore, it is better that a few individuals be killed by bombers than a much greater number—possibly thousands of innocent people—be tortured and murdered and legal and constitutional provisions destroyed. During the investigation of Italian Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]]'s kidnapping, General [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] reportedly responded to a member of the security services who suggested torture against a suspect, "Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture."&lt;ref&gt;Report of Conadep (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons): Prologue - 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Citation |authorlink=Alan M. Dershowitz |last=Dershowitz |first=A.M. |title=Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge |location=London |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2002 |page=134 |isbn=0-300-10153-8 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, torture has been reviled as an idea, yet employed as a tool and defended by its wielders, often in direct contradiction to their own averred beliefs.  Judicial torture was a common feature of the legal systems of many countries including all Civil Law countries in Europe until around the French Revolution.  This was part of ancient Greek and Roman Law theory that remained valid in Europe.  Roman Law assumed, for example, that slaves would not tell the truth in a legal court as they were always vulnerable to threats from their owners.  Their testimony could only be of value if it were extracted by a greater fear of torture.  Legal scholars were well aware of the problems of false testimony produced by the threat of torture.  In theory torture was not meant to produce a confession as such, but rather details of the crime or crime scene which only the guilty party would know.

The [[Spanish Inquisition]] is probably the most infamous example in which torture was used to extract information regarding allegations of [[heresy]]. In early modern times under certain conditions, torture was used in England. For example, the confession of [[Marc Smeaton]] at the trial of [[Anne Boleyn]] was presented in written form only, either to hide from the court that Smeaton had been tortured on [[the rack]] for four hours, or because [[Thomas Cromwell]] was worried that he would recant his confession if cross examined.  When [[Guy Fawkes]] was arrested for his role in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 he was tortured until he revealed all he knew about the plot. This was not so much to extract a confession, which was not needed to prove his guilt, but to extract from him the names of his fellow conspirators. By this time torture was not routine in England and a special warrant from King [[James I of England|James I]] was needed before he could be tortured. The wording of the warrant shows some concerns for humanitarian considerations, the severity of the methods of interrogation were to be increased gradually until the interrogators were sure that Fawkes had told all he knew. In the end this did not help Fawkes much as he was broken on the only rack in England, which was in the [[Tower of London]]. Torture was abolished in England around 1640 (except ''[[peine forte et dure]]'' which was abolished in 1772).

The use of torture in Europe came under attack during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  [[Cesare Beccaria]]'s ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (1764) denounced the use of torture as cruel and contrary to reason.  The [[French Revolution]] abolished the use of torture in [[France]] and the French Armies carried abolition to most of the rest of [[Europe]].  The last European jurisdictions to abolish legal torture were [[Portugal]] (1828) and the canton of [[Glarus]] in [[Switzerland]] (1851).

Under codified legal systems such as France, torture was superseded with a legal system that is highly dependent on investigating magistrates and the confession remains ''The Queen of Proofs''.  Such magistrates are often under pressure to produce results.  It is alleged that in many cases police violence towards suspects has been ignored by the magistrates.  In the [[adversarial system]] of [[Common Law]] used throughout the English-speaking world, the experience is a different one. As the two parties have to convince a jury whether the defendant in a case is guilty or innocent of a crime, if the defence can persuade a jury that reasonable doubt exists over the credibility of a confession then the jury is likely to disregard the confession. If the defence can show that the confession was made under such duress that most people would make such a confession, then the jury is likely to question the confession's credibility. Usually the more duress that can be shown to have been used by law enforcement by the defence, the less weight most juries will place on confessions. In Britain partly to protect the individual against police brutality and partly to make confessions credible to a jury, all interviews with a suspect are audio taped on a machine which make two simultaneous copies one for the police and one for the defendant. In Northern Ireland, where society is more polarised than in the rest of the United Kingdom, which means that allegations of police brutality are perceived by sections of the community to carry more credence, interviews are video taped.

It has been alleged that in certain circumstances  torture, even though it is illegal, may have been used by some European countries. In "anti-terrorist" campaigns where information is needed for intelligence purposes, and not to obtain a confession for use in court, there is a temptation by the security forces, whether authorised by governments or not, to extract intelligence from alleged terrorists using any means available including the use of torture. Where there is a time component to a crime, for example in a kidnapping case, there is also a temptation for the police to try to extract information by methods which would nullify the use of such information in court.

==Debate==

===Proponents===
Some scholars have argued that the need for information outweighs the moral and ethical [[argument]]s against torture.

[[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]] in an opinion article&lt;ref name="yab"&gt;[http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_a_l/yasmin_alibhai_brown/article222735.ece Yasmin Alibhai-Brown: People matter more than holy books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171152/http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_a_l/yasmin_alibhai_brown/article222735.ece |date=2007-09-30 }} Editorial and Opinion (Page 31) in [[The Independent]] Monday 23 May 2005. Includes commentary on how some Americans have changed their attitudes to torture.&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[The Independent]] on 23 May 2005 wrote:

This utilitarian position is both contemptible and persuasive...}}

Two academics at [[Deakin University]] in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Australia]], Professor [[Mirko Bagaric]], a Croatian born Australian based author and lawyer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/author.asp?id=3915|title=Mirko Bagaric|work=On Line Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the head of Deakin University's Law School, and a fellow Deakin law lecturer, Julie Clarke, published a paper in the ''University of San Francisco Law Review'' arguing that when many lives are in imminent danger, "all forms of harm" may be inflicted on a suspect, even if this might result in "[[death|annihilation]]".The reasoning behind the proposal to legalise torture is that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bagaric |first=Mirko |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Clarke |first2=Julie |url=http://www.usfca.edu/lawreview/Vol39number3.htm |title=Not Enough Official Torture in the World?

{{quotation|as a society we would accept that one person being killed to save thousands is legitimate. ...&lt;br&gt;
Of course, it is far more repugnant to inflict harm on an innocent person than a wrongdoer''," said Professor Bagaric, "''But in some extreme cases, where it is almost certain someone has information that could prevent many lives being lost and there is no other way to obtain that information, the mere fact that they're not directly involved in creating that threat doesn't mean they can wash their hands of responsibility.}}

It was observed that Bagaric "was not the author of what he wrote, all he did was reintroducing Alan M. Dershowitz’ thesis, [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]]’s [Israeli] government legal adviser and the theorist of the legal torture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voltairenet.org/article30349.html Voltaire Network: Torture: the visible part of the iceberg] - 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also observed that Bagaric has written many pieces calling for men to be sentenced more than women for the same crime. This calls into question his ability to deal impartially with regard to crime and torture, which is mainly committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/01/why-we-should-close-womens-prisons-and-treat-their-crimes-more-fairly]&lt;/ref&gt;

When reviewing Alan Dershowitz's book, "''Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge''" [[Richard Posner]], a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, wrote
{{quotation|If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary to [[Ticking time bomb scenario|prevent the detonation of a nuclear bomb]] in Times Square, torture should be used - and will be used - to obtain the information. ... no one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility.|[[Richard Posner]], [[The New Republic]], September 2002&lt;ref name="Slackman NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hensher Independent" /&gt;}}

On December 20, 2005, [[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.|Albert Mohler]], president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] addressed the problem of whether [[torture]] should be used by American military forces in order to gain important information from terrorist suspects. Although he spoke out against any form of legal codification, he did state the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/commentary_read.php?cdate=2005-12-20|title=Torture and the War on Terror: We Must Not Add Dirty Rules to Dirty Hands|work=AlbertMohler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Under certain circumstances, most morally sensitive persons would surely allow interrogators to yell at prisoners and to use psychological intimidation, sleep deprivation, and the removal of creature comforts for purposes of obtaining vital information. In increasingly serious cases, most would likely allow some use of pharmaceuticals and more intensive and manipulative psychological techniques. In the most extreme of conceivable cases, most would also allow the use of far more serious mechanisms of coercion – even what we would all agree should be labeled as torture.&lt;br&gt;
...I would argue that we cannot condone torture by codifying a list of exceptional situations in which techniques of torture might be legitimately used. At the same time, I would also argue that we cannot deny that there could exist circumstances in which such uses of torture might be made necessary.}}

===Opponents===
Many experts argue that torture is an unreliable means of obtaining useful information.&lt;ref name="Slackman NYT"&gt;{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Slackman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/weekinreview/16slac.html |title=What's Wrong With Torturing a Qaeda Higher-Up? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=16 May 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, many states have used torture not to extract information, but as a means of terrorising their populations or specific communities. [[Frantz Fanon]], in "[[The Wretched of the Earth]]" reports the French in Algeria using "preventative torture" on entirely innocent people to stop them doing anything in future.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In most countries torture is illegal, and this being so, outside the normal framework for establishing guilt or innocence. Therefore, an abnormally large proportion of torture victims are either innocent (apart from membership of target communities) or of mistaken identity. For example, [[Khalid el-Masri]], an innocent German citizen was kidnapped and tortured, having been mistaken for [[Al-Qaida]] chief [[Khalid al-Masri]]. The [[Red Cross]] in Iraq estimated that 80% of detainees at [[Abu Ghraib]] were the "wrong people".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004 05/003886.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the article by Professor Bagaric and Mrs Clarke, [[Amnesty International]] [[spokesman|spokeswoman]] Nicole Bieske, who is also a [[lawyer]], was stunned by the idea of regulating torture.
{{quotation|It's astonishing and appalling that somebody would hold this opinion in relation to such a fundamental issue as torture, and to be justifying it on moral as well as pragmatic grounds...&lt;ref name="ML-17May"&gt;Minchin,Liz. ''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/War-on-Terror/Make-torture-legal/2005/05/16/1116095906016.html Make torture legal, say two academics]'', [[The Age]] 17 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Professor Bagaric and Mrs Clarke submitted the paper to an American law journal because of:
{{quotation|the kind of emotive comments that I've had here in Australia, saying that this view is horrendous, unthinking, and irresponsible.&lt;ref name="ML-17May"/&gt;}}

[[Joe Navarro]], one of the F.B.I.’s top experts in questioning techniques, told The New Yorker,

:“Only a psychopath can torture and be unaffected. You don’t want people like that in your organization. They are untrustworthy, and tend to have grotesque other problems.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/070219fa_fact_mayer | title=Whatever it takes.

Toleration of torture and arbitrary detention has been likened to a "cancer of democracy" in a book of the same title by [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], which begins to undermine all other aspects of a state's legitimacy. On the 20th anniversary of the coming into force of the United Nations Convention against Torture, Philip Hensher writes "Civilization is at once compromised if, in defense of other freedoms, it decides to regress, to accept the possibility of torture as it is seen in the movies."&lt;ref name="Hensher Independent"&gt;{{Citation |first=Philip |last=Hensher |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article2710613.ece |title=Hollywood is helping us learn to love torture |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=26 June 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ticking time bomb scenario==
{{Main|Ticking time bomb scenario}}

In law enforcement, one perceived argument is the necessity of force to extract information from a suspect when regular interrogation yields no results and time is of the essence, as can be seen in the most frequently cited theoretical example is the "[[ticking time bomb]]" scenario, where a known terrorist has planted a [[nuclear bomb]]. In such circumstances, it has been argued, that not to use torture would be wrong, and by others that using torture would change society in a manner which would be worse.

The obvious rebuttal to this stance is that no such scenario has ever existed. In addition, those situations resembling such a case were resolved without the need to torture any suspect. Furthermore, it is asked whether torture would be limited to suspects, or whether one could torture the family and friends of this detainee to make him compliant.

*Supporters cite cases where torture has worked:

:In the case of [[Magnus Gäfgen]], who was suspected of kidnapping 11-year-old [[Jakob von Metzler]] and arrested in October 2002 by German police. Police surveillance had observed Gäfgen pick up a €1 million ransom demanded from the von Metzler family and proceed to go on a spending spree.  After the ransom was paid, the boy was not released. Fearing for the boy's safety Frankfurt's deputy police chief, [[Wolfgang Daschner]], had Gäfgen arrested and when he would not talk threatened to cause Gäfgen severe pain.  Gäfgen told police where he had hidden von Metzler's body.  In this case torture was threatened, but not used, to extract information that, in other circumstances, could have saved a boy's life. The ethical question is whether this can ever be justified. Wolfgang Daschner felt that in the circumstances it was justified. German Chancellor Merkel, in an interview on January 9, 2006 in reference to the Metzler case stated "The public debate showed that the overwhelming majority of citizens believed that even in such a case, the end does not justify the means. That is also my position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,394180,00.html|title=SPIEGEL Interview: Merkel: Guantanamo Mustn't Exist in Long Term|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=9 January 2006|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Opponents, on the other hand, cite cases of rampant abuse: for example, in [[Chile]] and [[Argentin]]a in the 1970s and 1980s thousands of people "[[Forced disappearance|disappeared]]" and were tortured or killed or both.

Beyond that, another reason is that torture fails to elicit the expected information because the subject is saying anything interrogators want to hear to stop the ordeal (or deliberately lies to waste the interrogators' time and make it more likely the bomb will go off), or worse: the detainee is innocent. By adopting a "the ends justifies the means" approach this would allow nine innocent people to be tortured as long as the tenth offered a full confession.

It has been estimated that as few as two dozen of the 600 detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] had any potential intelligence value even if it could be obtained from them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/21/politics/21GITM.html U.S. Said to Overstate Value of Guantánamo Detainees]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Famine relief''' is an organized effort to reduce [[starvation]] in a region in which there is famine. A [[famine]] is a phenomenon in which a large proportion of the population of a region or country are so undernourished that death by starvation becomes increasingly common. In spite of the much greater technological and economic resources of the modern world, famine still strikes many parts of the world, mostly in the developing nations.

Famine is associated with naturally occurring crop failure and [[Infectious disease|pestilence]] and artificially with war and [[genocide]]. In the past few decades, a more nuanced view focused on the economic and political circumstances leading to modern famine has emerged. Modern relief agencies categorize various gradations of famine according to a [[famine scale]].

Many areas that suffered famines in the past have protected themselves through technological and social development. The first area in Europe to eliminate famine was the [[Netherlands]], which saw its last peacetime famines in the early-17th century as it became a major economic power and established a complex political organization.  A prominent economist on the subject, [[Nobel laureate]] [[Amartya Sen]], has noted that no functioning democracy has ever suffered a famine, although he admits that malnutrition can occur in a democracy&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.sandiego.edu/~baber/globalethics/DemocracyNotEnough.html Does Democracy Avert Famine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and he does not consider mid 19th century Ireland to be a functioning democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misu.ait.ac.th/NewsAndEvents/newsletterData/HTMLFormat/iss2no2/starve.htm Untitled Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the world's food aid is given to people in areas where poverty is endemic; or to people who have suffered due to a natural disaster other than famine (such as the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami]]), or have lost their crops due to conflicts (such as in the [[Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]]). Only a small amount of food aid goes to people who are suffering as a direct consequence of famine.

==Famine response methods==
In his book on famine, [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a [[relief operation]] are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died." He goes on to say that "evidence suggests the massive food shipments sent to Somalia in 1992 had little impact on the outcome of the famine . . . and that by the time it arrived in sufficient, steady quantities in the rural areas, the death rate had peaked and was already declining."" – Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)

There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html UN aid debate: give cash not food?]&lt;/ref&gt; In a major endorsement of the approach, the UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=146&amp;Key=24 Weathering the Storm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899 Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899 |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described the plan as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering sacks of grain and tins of oil may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt; Fred Cuny further pointed out "Studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country – though not always in the immediate food deficit area. Usually, merchants begin hoarding food as a crisis develops – in conflicts, to keep it from being stolen, in famines, to get higher prices. Even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad." from memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York) – July 1994. The Irish aid agency [[Concern Worldwide|Concern]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, [[Safaricom]], which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another. Concern donated more than $30,000 for distribution via cellphone to some of [[Kenya]]'s poorest people so that they can buy local food.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;

In the past four years, [[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed recipe for coping with a food crisis and, as a result, it had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. In addition, foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food. Since then, the percentage of Ethiopians living in poverty dropped to 39 percent in 2006 from 44 percent in 2001, according to the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2 A model of African food aid is now in trouble]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporary therapeutic foods==
[[Malnutrition]] is a medical condition, not just a lack of food. The bodies of severely malnourished humans, especially children, are unable to process regular food. Instead of being fed food such as rice or porridge, patients are fed [[therapeutic food]] for up to one month, or until their bodies are able to process traditional foods. There are two main types of therapeutic foods in use: Powdered formulas (F-75, F-100, BP-100) to be prepared with clean water and to be used only under supervision; and ready-to-eat [[peanut paste]] formulations ([[Plumpy'nut]], Plumpy'doz, eeZeePaste RUTF) which can be used at home without supervision.

* '''[[F-100 (food)|F-75]]''' (phase 1 therapeutic milk): a milk based powder to be prepared with clean water, that is given to severely malnourished children when they first arrive for treatment. It is normally given for one to three days, in cases of [[kwashiorkor]] it can be given for a maximum of seven days. It is not intended to cause the child to gain weight, but only to condition the body to digest food.
* '''[[F-100 (food)|F-100]]''' (phase 2 therapeutic milk): a milk based powder to be prepared with clean water. It contains more protein and calories than F-75, and is designed for rapid weight gain, and to prepare the body for digestion of normal food. It has been criticized as ineffective&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05Plumpy-t.html?pagewanted=2 The milk-water mixture, a 30 years old solution, was unable to prevent deaths of 20% to 60% of malnourished children]&lt;/ref&gt; compared to ready-to-use therapeutic peanut paste based foods.
* '''[[BP-100 (food)|BP-100]]''' (phase 2 therapeutic food): a wheat based powder to be used in a similar manner to F-100.
* '''[[Plumpy'nut]]''', Plumpy'doz, eeZeePaste RUTF: various ready-to-eat mixtures of peanut paste, milk powder, sugar, fats, minerals and [[vitamin]]s, to be used as an alternative to F-100. The products come in ready-to-eat packets that require no water or mixing. They put parents or guardians in charge of feeding their own malnourished children in their own communities, rather than forcing them to always bring their malnourished children to hospitals or therapeutic feeding centers for assistance.{{or|date=November 2013}} The [[Wall Street Journal]] noted: "Nutritionists for the first time can take treatment beyond crowded emergency feeding centers and hospitals settings, where disease can spread rapidly, and into communities where malnourished children live."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Thurow, "In battling hunger, a new advance:  Peanut-butter paste," ''The Wall Street Journal'', 12 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the malnourished children recover enough to be able to digest complex foods, products containing higher levels of protein can be used to increase muscle growth. Plant protein foods such as [[textured vegetable protein]] have been advocated. Besides containing high amounts of protein, they also have a long shelf life and are inexpensive. Also, similar to [[tofu]], plant protein can be manufactured in a more sustainable way than animal protein. This is an important question in areas such as [[Darfur]], where cattle farming contributes to constant destruction of arable farmland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x147t0n754m21n7m/ Plant Protein Foods in the developing world]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/v62l5450673v5x83/ Standards of protein food in the developing world]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern relief==
Today, the [[Peace Corps]], religious groups, and charities feed hungry people all over the world, especially in countries hardest hit by famine. In addition to giving them food, they teach the hungry to grow their own food crops, so that they can feed themselves.  In some environments (such as the desert, rocky areas, or cold wastelands) farming is difficult to impossible. Such land is called unarable. This is why famine repeats in those areas. New methods have been invented to grow food crops in these difficult areas. These new methods include: [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizer]], [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] food crops, digging wells, [[reverse osmosis]] water processors to turn salty ocean water into fresh water, [[greenhouse]]s, [[hydroponic]]s, canal digging, dirt hill walls stacking for protection against wind and dust, mylar insulation, and [[sustainable agriculture]].

'''Frederick Joseph McEvoy''' (12 February 1907 – 7 November 1951) was an Australian born British multi-discipline sportsman and socialite.  He had most sporting success as a [[bobsleigh|bobsledder]] in the late 1930s, winning several medals including three golds at the [[FIBT World Championships]].  He married several wealthy heiresses and was a close friend of [[Errol Flynn]].  He usually shortened his name to Freddie McEvoy and was nicknamed "Suicide Freddie".

==Sporting achievements==

===Bobsleigh===
McEvoy was the [[List of flag bearers for Great Britain at the Olympics|British flag bearer]] at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/GBR Great Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628000000/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/GBR|date=28 June 2010}}.

At the [[FIBT World Championships 1937|FIBT World Championships in 1937]] he realised greater success in the sport. Partnering [[Byran Black]] for the two-man at [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], Italy he achieved his first gold medal.  He teamed up with Black, Olympic team-mate Charles Green, and [[David Looker]] in the four-man, again winning the gold medal.&lt;ref name="sports123-4"&gt;[http://sports123.com/bob/mw-4.html World Championships – Men: 4-Man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211002351/http://sports123.com/bob/mw-4.html|date=11 December 2007}}.

At the [[FIBT World Championships 1938|same event in 1938]] three of the four-man riders returned to defend their title.  [[Chris MacKintosh]] replaced Byran Black and the team once again won the gold medal.  In the two-man race Charles Green partnered McEvoy and the pair won the silver medal.  Both men partnered again [[FIBT World Championships 1939|the following year]] and, alongside two new team-mates, won silver in the four-man event at Cortina d'Ampezzo.&lt;ref name="sports123-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sports123-2"/&gt;

===Motor racing===
McEvoy came sixth in the 1936 [[Vanderbilt Cup]], racing a [[Maserati]] along the 300-mile course "considered by European road veterans to be probably the most severe test for man and car in the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportscars.tv/Newfiles/vanderbilt36-7.html George Vanderbilt Cup Races 1936-7].

==Other activities==
In 1943, McEvoy lived in Hollywood and was able to make uncredited appearances in two films.  The first was in ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943 film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' a scene starring good friend [[Errol Flynn]] in his only musical number.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036422/fullcredits#cast Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943) – Full cast and crew].

McEvoy was married several times, taking his first wife in 1940.  [[Beatrice Cartwright]], a member of [[Charles Pratt|Pratt family]] and heir to a fortune from [[Standard Oil]], was twice his age and had lived with McEvoy for several years before their marriage.&lt;ref name="SR" /&gt; The union did not last, and in 1942 Cartwright accused McEvoy of being unfaithful with "three well-known society women".&lt;ref name="Advertiser1942"&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48888810?searchTerm=fred%20mcevoy&amp;searchLimits= Flynn's Host Sued For Divorce].

In February 1943,&lt;ref name="marrcert"/&gt; McEvoy married Irene Margaret Wrightsman, the daughter of [[Charles Bierer Wrightsman|Charles B. Wrightsman]],&lt;ref name="marrcert"/&gt; the president of [[Standard Oil]] of Kansas.  Wrightsman was 18 at the time of their wedding, nearly half his age.  Wrightsman was disinherited by her father after she eloped and the marriage lasted just two years.&lt;ref name="SR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TCM" /&gt;

In 1945 he met [[Barbara Hutton]],&lt;ref name="SR" /&gt; another wealthy heiress who had just divorced third husband [[Cary Grant]].  Hutton was warned to stay away from McEvoy by friends and relatives and they assumed that the pair would marry as soon as he "legally divorces penniless Irene".&lt;ref name="TCM" /&gt; The couple were never wed, though Hutton bought a chalet at a ski resort in [[Franconia, New Hampshire]] and they lived together for a time.  Hutton married again in 1947 and she remained friends with McEvoy who went on to marry [[Claude Stephanie Filatre]], a French fashion model, in 1949.&lt;ref name="SR" /&gt;

Errol Flynn married [[Patrice Wymore]] at a ceremony in [[Monte Carlo]] in 1950 with McEvoy as his best man and Filatre as the matron of honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18173687?searchTerm=fred%20mcevoy&amp;searchLimits= Flynn Weds Starlet In Monte Carlo].

==Death==
McEvoy, his wife, and several others were sailing from [[Tangier]] to the [[Bahamas]] on his 104-ton schooner,&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt; ''Kangaroo'', on 7 November 1951.  Just off the coast of [[Morocco]] a storm wrecked the ship and McEvoy swam to shore to look for help, leaving Claude Stephanie afloat on the mast.  He was unable to find any assistance and returned to his wife.  The pair tried to swim back to land but the waves were too strong.  Their bodies and those of four others were discovered the following day.&lt;ref name="SR" /&gt; One of the three survivors gave the name of Walter Praxmarer but was identified as Manfred Lenther, an Austrian man charged with murdering a woman in Berlin in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18239265?searchTerm=fred%20mcevoy&amp;searchLimits= Strange Twist To Shipwreck Tragedy].

The rules that govern each industry may differ significantly; however, the main purpose of GMP is always to prevent harm from occurring to the end user.&lt;ref name="MooreManufacturing09" /&gt; Additional tenets include ensuring the end product is free from contamination, that it is consistent in its manufacture, that its manufacture has been well documented, that personnel are well trained, and the product has been checked for quality more than just at the end phase.&lt;ref name="MooreManufacturing09" /&gt; GMP is typically ensured through the effective use of a [[quality management system]] (QMS).&lt;ref name="IFSTFood12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MooreManufacturing09" /&gt;

Good manufacturing practices, along with [[good agricultural practice]]s, [[good laboratory practice]]s and [[good clinical practice]]s, are overseen by regulatory agencies in the India, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Europe, China, and other countries.

==High-level details==
Good manufacturing practice guidelines provide guidance for manufacturing, testing, and quality assurance in order to ensure that a manufactured product is safe for human consumption or use. Many countries have legislated that manufacturers follow GMP procedures and create their own GMP guidelines that correspond with their legislation.

All guideline follows a few basic principles&lt;ref name="MooreManufacturing09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHOQuality07"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59s4hlhFKowC&amp;pg=PA17 |chapter=Chapter 1: WHO good manufacturing practices: Main principles for pharmaceutical products |title=Quality Assurance of Pharmaceuticals: A compendium of guidelines and related materials - Good manufacturing practices and inspection |volume=2 |edition=2nd updated |author=World Health Organization |publisher=WHO Press |year=2007 |pages=17–18 |isbn=9789241547086}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Manufacturing facilities must maintain a clean and hygienic manufacturing area.
* Manufacturing facilities must maintain controlled environmental conditions in order to prevent [[Contamination|cross-contamination]] from adulterants and allergens that may render the product unsafe for human consumption or use.
* Manufacturing processes must be clearly defined and controlled. All critical processes are [[Validation (drug manufacture)|validated]] to ensure consistency and compliance with specifications.
* Manufacturing processes must be controlled, and any changes to the process must be evaluated. Changes that affect the quality of the drug are validated as necessary.
* Instructions and procedures must be written in clear and unambiguous language using [[good documentation practice]]s.
* Operators must be trained to carry out and document procedures. 
* Records must be made, manually or electronically, during manufacture that demonstrate that all the steps required by the defined procedures and instructions were in fact taken and that the quantity and quality of the food or drug was as expected. Deviations must be investigated and documented.
* Records of manufacture (including distribution) that enable the complete history of a batch to be traced must be retained in a comprehensible and accessible form.
* Any distribution of products must minimize any risk to their quality.
* A system must be in place for recalling any batch from sale or supply.
* Complaints about marketed products must be examined, the causes of quality defects must be investigated, and appropriate measures must be taken with respect to the defective products and to prevent recurrence.

Good manufacturing practices are recommended with the goal of safeguarding the health of consumers and patients as well as producing quality products. In the United States, a food or drug may be deemed "adulterated" if it has passed all of the specifications tests but is found to be manufactured in a facility or condition which violates or does not comply with current good manufacturing guideline.

GMP guidelines are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products. They are a series of general principles that must be observed during manufacturing. When a company is setting up its quality program and manufacturing process, there may be many ways it can fulfill GMP requirements. It is the company's responsibility to determine the most effective and efficient quality process that both meets business and regulatory needs.&lt;ref name="IFSTFood12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MooreManufacturing09" /&gt;

== Guideline versions ==
GMPs are enforced in the United States by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), under Title [[21 CFR]]. The regulations use the phrase "current good manufacturing practices" (CGMP) to describe these guidelines.&lt;ref name="FDA-GMPDrugs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/Manufacturing/ucm169105.htm |title=Facts About the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=6 October 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA-GMPFood"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/CGMP/default.htm |title=Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=27 December 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA-GMPMedDev"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/postmarketrequirements/qualitysystemsregulations/ |title=Quality System (QS) Regulation/Medical Device Good Manufacturing Practices |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=2 February 2018 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA-GMPCosmetic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/postmarketrequirements/qualitysystemsregulations/ |title=Draft Guidance for Industry: Cosmetic Good Manufacturing Practices |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=3 November 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts may theoretically hold that a product is [[adulterated]] even if there is no specific regulatory requirement that was violated as long as the process was not performed according to industry standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt21.4.210#se21.4.210_11 |title=US CFR Title 21 §210.1(b) Status of current good manufacturing practice regulations |work=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations |accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since June 2007, a different set of CGMP requirements have applied to all manufacturers of [[dietary supplement]]s, with additional supporting guidance issued in 2010.&lt;ref name="FDA-GMPDietSupp" /&gt; Additionally, in the U.S., medical device manufacturers must follow what are called "quality system regulations" which are deliberately harmonized with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] requirements, not necessarily CGMPs.&lt;ref name="FDA-GMPMedDev" /&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) version of GMP is used by pharmaceutical regulators and the [[pharmaceutical industry]] in over 100 countries worldwide, primarily in the developing world.&lt;ref name="NallyGood07" /&gt; The [[European Union]]'s GMP (EU-GMP) enforces similar requirements to WHO GMP, as does the FDA's version in the US. Similar GMPs are used in other countries, with [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Singapore]], [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]] and others having highly developed/sophisticated GMP requirements.&lt;ref name="CartwrightInternational10"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dyrNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8 |chapter=Preface |title=International Pharmaceutical Product Registration |editor1=Cartwright, A.C.|editor2=Matthews, B.R. |publisher=CRC Press |edition=2nd |pages=vi–x |year=2010 |isbn=9781420081831}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], the Medicines Act (1968) covers most aspects of GMP in what is commonly referred to as "The Orange Guide," which is named so because of the color of its cover; it is officially known as ''Rules and Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Distributors''.&lt;ref name="PPOrangeGuide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmpress.com/product/9780857112859/orangeguide |title=Rules and Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Distributors 2017 |author=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency |publisher=Pharmaceutical Press |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1999 publication of ''GMPs for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients'', by the [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|International Conference on Harmonization]] (ICH), GMPs now apply in those countries and trade groupings that are signatories to ICH (the EU, [[Japan]] and the U.S.), and applies in other countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, Singapore) which adopt ICH guidelines for the manufacture and testing of active raw materials.&lt;ref name="CartwrightInternational10" /&gt;

== Enforcement ==
Within the European Union GMP inspections are performed by National Regulatory Agencies. GMP inspections are performed in Canada by the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate&lt;ref name="HC-GMP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/compliance-enforcement/good-manufacturing-practices.html |title=Good Manufacturing Practices |work=Health Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |date=27 February 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the United Kingdom by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA))&lt;ref name="MHRAGood17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-manufacturing-practice-and-good-distribution-practice |title=Good manufacturing practice and good distribution practice |author=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency |work=Gov.uk |date=20 October 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) by the [[Ministry of Food and Drug Safety]] (MFDS)&lt;ref name="MFDSGuideTo17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nifds.go.kr/_custom/nifds/_common/board/download.jsp?attach_no=23002 |format=PDF |title=Guide to Drug Approval System in Korea |author=Ministry of Food and Drug Safety |publisher=National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation |date=April 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in Australia by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA)&lt;ref name="AustDoH-GMP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tga.gov.au/good-manufacturing-practice-overview |title=Good manufacturing practice - an overview |publisher=Department of Health, Therapeutic Goods Administration |date=29 September 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in Bangladesh by the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA)&lt;ref name="AnisfeldAssess15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js22111en/ |title=Assessment of the Good Manufacturing Practices Inspection Program of the Bangladesh Directorate General of Drug Administration |author1=Anisfeld, M.H.|author2=Kim, E.M.|author3=Aimiuwu, J.|author4=Thumm, M. |publisher=World Health Organization |date=May 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in South Africa by the Medicines Control Council (MCC)&lt;ref name="MCC-GMP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mccza.com/documents/16b9955c4.01SAGuidetoGMPJun10v5.pdf |format=PDF |title=Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicines in South Africa |author=Medicines Control Council |publisher=Medicines Control Council |date=August 2010 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in Brazil by the [[National Health Surveillance Agency]] (ANVISA)&lt;ref name="ANVISA42-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.anvisa.gov.br/documents/33880/2547641/CP%2B42-2015%2B-%2BNotification.pdf/3b6d64d6-5207-41c4-925b-3e68d4e270e8?version=1.0&amp;download=true |format=PDF |title=Draft Technical Resolution nº 42, May 13th 2015 |author=World Trade Organization |date=13 May 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in India by state Food and Drugs Administrations (FDA), reporting to the [[Central Drugs Standard Control Organization]]&lt;ref name="CDSCOUpdated17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdsco.nic.in/Forms/list.aspx?lid=2097&amp;Id=3 |title=Updated list of WHO GMP Certified Manufacturing Units for Certificate of Pharmaceutical Products (COPP) in various States of India as on December 2016 |publisher=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization |date=10 June 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in Pakistan by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan&lt;ref name="DRAPGMP17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dra.gov.pk/userfiles1/file/SROs/GMPInspectionCommitteeAppealRegulations2017Gazette09102017.pdf |format=PDF |title=S.R.O. 1012(I)/2017 |work=The Gazette of Pakistan |publisher=Government of Pakistan |date=9 October 2017 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in Nigeria by [[NAFDAC]]&lt;ref name="NAFDAC-GMP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nafdac.gov.ng/index.php/guidelines/gmp-gidelines |title=GMP Guidelines |publisher=National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and by similar national organisations worldwide. Each of the [[inspectorate]]s carry out routine GMP inspections to ensure that drug products are produced safely and correctly. Additionally, many countries perform pre-approval inspections (PAI) for GMP compliance prior to the approval of a new drug for marketing.

== CGMP inspections ==
Regulatory agencies (including the FDA in the U.S. and regulatory agencies in many European nations) are authorized to conduct unannounced inspections, though some are scheduled.&lt;ref name="FDA-GMPDrugs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PPOrangeGuide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MFDSGuideTo17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AustDoH-GMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AnisfeldAssess15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCC-GMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDSCOUpdated17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DRAPGMP17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAFDAC-GMP" /&gt; FDA routine domestic inspections are usually unannounced, but must be conducted according to 704(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 USCS § 374), which requires that they are performed at a "reasonable time". Courts have held that any time the firm is open for business is a reasonable time for an inspection.&lt;ref name="FDAGuidance14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM360484.pdf |format=PDF |title=Guidance for Industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection |author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=October 2014 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other good practices ==
Other good-practice systems, along the same lines as GMP, exist:
* [[Good agricultural practice]] (GAP), for farming and ranching 
* [[Good clinical practice]] (GCP), for [[hospital]]s and [[clinician]]s conducting clinical studies on new drugs in humans
* Good distribution practice (GDP) deals with the guidelines for the proper [[Drug distribution|distribution of medicinal products for human use]]
* [[Good laboratory practice]] (GLP), for laboratories conducting non-[[clinical trial|clinical studies]] ([[toxicology]] and [[pharmacology]] studies in animals)
* Good pharmacovigilance practice (GVP), for the safety of produced drugs
* Good regulatory practice (GRP), for the management of regulatory commitments, procedures and documentation

Collectively, these and other good-practice requirements are referred to as "[[GxP]]" requirements, all of which follow similar philosophies. Other examples include good guidance practices, and good tissue practices.

Aabrekk made his debut for Sogndal in 1974 in the [[Norwegian Second Division]] (the third tier of Norwegian football).&lt;ref name="Sogndal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Alaget/Spelarstall/Spelarinfo/tabid/620/person/504/mid/1437/Default.aspx |title=Harald Aabrekk – Statistikk Sogndal |publisher=[[Sogndal Fotball]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenpå90talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |title=90-talet og Hardal Aabrekk |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208033129/http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenp%C3%A590talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |archive-date=8 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a short spell at SK Brann, where he played a match in the [[Tippeligaen]] (the top division) in [[1978 Norwegian First Division|1978]],&lt;ref name="Brann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brann.no/historie/spillerdatabase/spillerarkiv/harald-aabrekk/ |title=Statistics; Brann |publisher=[[SK Brann]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played for Sogndal throughout his career and was a major contributor to their promotion to the [[Norwegian First Division]] in 1981. He scored Sogndal's first goal in that division, against [[Molde FK|Molde]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He played a total of 133 league games from 1973 to 1982, including 22 matches in the [[1982 Norwegian First Division|First Division in 1982]].&lt;ref name="Sogndal"/&gt;

==Coaching career==
Aabrekk started his coaching career in his home county, [[Sogn og Fjordane]], at lower-league clubs Eid, Sandane, and [[Stryn TIL|Stryn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk blir ny Sogndal-trener |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801042447/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Nyheter/Aktuelt/tabid/486/smid/1092/ArticleID/10197/reftab/360/t/Harald-Aabrekk-er-tilbake/Default.aspx |language=Norwegian |title=Harald Aabrekk er tilbake |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming head coach of Sogndal. In 1990, his first season with them, Sogndal was promoted to the Tippeligaen in spite of a 5–0 loss against [[Bryne FK|Bryne]] in their first home match.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He then served as head coach of Tromsø in the Tippeligaen from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |title=Trist redningsmann |first=Roy |last=Ellingsen |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian |date=7 August 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917153008/http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, during a match against [[FK Bodø/Glimt|Bodø/Glimt]], Aabrekk tried to stall for time by acting as if he were injured after he was run down by Bodø/Glimt's physiotherapist Truls Karlsen. Although uninjured, he was taken by ambulance to hospital.&lt;ref name="hospital"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/11/04/481856.html |language=Norwegian |title=Fotballens største skuespillere |work=[[Dagbladet]] |first=Sigve |last=Kvamme |date=4 November 2006 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Verdens Gang]]'', he excused his behavior by saying, "I felt I was lying on the ground a bit too long, and I did not dare to get up so I stayed on the ground. I lay there and was thinking, 'What's going on?' It was not planned, and it was definitely not very smart. I would rather call it a blackout." This episode, according to the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'', was the third worst case of acting in the history of football.&lt;ref name="hospital"/&gt;

Aabrekk later worked for the [[Football Association of Norway]] as a coordinator for youth development in [[Western Norway]]. He also served as [[Nils Johan Semb]]'s assistant coach for the [[Norway national under-21 football team|Norwegian under-21 team]] from 1992 to 1998, and when Semb succeeded [[Egil Olsen]] as head coach of the [[Norway national football team|Norwegian national team]] in 1998, Aabrekk became assistant coach of the national senior team.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt; At the same time, he worked as [[Kjell Tennfjord]]'s assistant in Brann, and in the summer of 1998 he became their head coach.&lt;ref name="tilbake"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk tilbake i Brann |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222190913/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After leading Brann to the finals of the [[1999 Norwegian Football Cup|1999 Norwegian Cup]], where they lost 2–0 against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/1999/10/31/181874.html |language=Norwegian |title=Uten Aabrekk slokner Brann |work=Dagbladet |date=31 October 1999 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received a one-year leave of absence to work full-time as assistant coach of the national team during their preparations for the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] football championship.

In 2008 Aabrekk was hired by Brann as a scout.&lt;ref name="tilbake"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv2.no/sport/fotball/tippeligaen/aabrekk-blir-brannspeider-1751146.html |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk blir Brann-speider |work=[[TV 2 (Norway)]] |first=Sturla |last=Johannessen |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through the season, the club wanted Aabrekk and the assistant coach, Espen Steffensen, to switch jobs.

'''''Hyophorbe amaricaulis''''' (also known as Loneliest palm)&lt;ref name="ARKive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/loneliest-palm/hyophorbe-amaricaulis/#src=portletV3api|title=Loneliest palm (Hyophorbe amaricaulis)|publisher=ARKive|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a species of palm tree of the order ''[[Arecales]]'', family [[Arecaceae]], subfamily [[Arecoideae]], tribe [[Hyophorbeae]]. It is found exclusively on the island of [[Mauritius]], and only a single surviving specimen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mabberley, D.J.|year=1997|title=The Plant-Book, 2nd Ed.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]], UK|isbn=0-521-41421-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been documented in the [[Curepipe Botanic Gardens]] in [[Curepipe]]. Thus, it is the most gravely threatened species of any kingdom.

==Distribution==
This species is one of nine species of palm which are indigenous to [[Mauritius]], and one of the seven palms which are also [[endemism|endemic]].

In the 1700s, this palm species was described from specimens taken from the mountain [[Pieter Both (mountain)|Pieter Both]], where it seems to have been widespread at the time.

Currently, only the single specimen exists in [[Curepipe Botanic Gardens]], and it is not known if this specimen was planted here, or was a survivor from the area's wild population that became included when the gardens were established.

==Description==
[[image:Hyophorbe-amaricaulis2.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Hyophorbe amaricaulis leaves|A close-up view of Hyophorbe amaricaulis leaves]]
The palm is about 12 meters high with a relatively thin gray trunk with a waxy crown shank.

It is related to the [[bottle palm]] and [[spindle palm]]. It is said to resemble the green variety of ''[[Hyophorbe indica|H. indica]]'' - another ''[[Hyophorbe]]'' palm species which also does not develop a swollen trunk.

It is reported to have white to cream-colored flowers on an inflorescence with three-ordered branching. Its fruits are 3.8&amp;nbsp;cm long and a dull red colour, but years and years of efforts have not resulted in fertile offspring.

'''Jane Seymour''' (c. 1508{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] from 1536 to 1537 as the third [[Wives of Henry VIII|wife]] of [[King Henry VIII]]. She succeeded [[Anne Boleyn]] as [[queen consort]] following the latter's execution in May 1536. She died of postnatal complications less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, a son who became [[King Edward VI]]. She was the only one of Henry's wives to receive a queen's funeral, and his only consort to be buried beside him in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].

==Early life==
Jane, the daughter of [[John Seymour (1474–1536)|Sir John Seymour]] and [[Margery Wentworth]] was probably born at [[Wulfhall]], [[Wiltshire]],{{sfn|Norton|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FiXjKTkR0QYC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} although [[West Bower Manor]] in Somerset has also been suggested,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Bower Manor with barn|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1058940|website=National Heritage List for England|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her birth date is not recorded; various accounts use anywhere from 1504 to 1509,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=Marilee |title=Jane Seymour – Facts, Biography, Information &amp; Portraits |url=https://englishhistory.net/tudor/monarchs/jane-seymour/ |accessdate=17 November 2018 |date=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is generally estimated as occurring in or around 1508.{{sfn|Norton|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FiXjKTkR0QYC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} Through her maternal grandfather, she was a descendant of [[King Edward III]]'s son [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]].{{sfn|Norton|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FiXjKTkR0QYC&amp;pg=PA8 8]}}  Because of this, she and [[King Henry VIII]] were fifth cousins. She shared a great-grandmother, [[Elizabeth Cheney, Lady Say|Elizabeth Cheney]], with his second and fifth wives, [[Anne Boleyn]] and [[Catherine Howard]].{{sfn|Norton|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FiXjKTkR0QYC&amp;pg=PA9 9]}}

Jane was not as highly educated as Henry's first and second wives, [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Anne Boleyn]]. She could read and write a little, but was much better at [[needlework]] and [[household management]], which were considered much more necessary for women.{{sfn|Brown|2005|p=244}} Her needlework was reported to be beautiful and elaborate; some of her work survived as late as 1652, when it is recorded to have been given to the [[Seymour family]]. After her death, it was noted that Henry was an "enthusiastic embroiderer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-needlework.org.uk/content/129/henry_viii_embroiderer_king |title=Henry VIII&amp;nbsp;– the Embroiderer King |publisher=Royal School of Needlework |accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane became a [[maid-of-honour]] in 1532 to Queen Catherine, but may have served her as early as 1527, and went on to serve Queen Anne. The first report of Henry VIII's interest in Jane was in February 1536, about three months before Anne's execution.{{sfn|Lipscomb|2012|p=70}}

Jane was highly praised for her gentle, peaceful nature, being referred to as "gentle a lady as ever I knew" by John Russell and being named as "the Pacific" by the Imperial Ambassador [[Eustace Chapuys]] for her peacemaking efforts at court.&lt;ref&gt;David Starkey, Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII, p.585-586&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chapuys, she was of middling stature and very pale; he also commented that she was not of much beauty. However, [[John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford|John Russell]] stated that she was "the fairest of all the King's wives."{{sfn|Norton|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=FiXjKTkR0QYC&amp;pg=PA65 65]}} [[Polydore Vergil]] commented that she was "a woman of the utmost charm in both character and appearance."{{sfn|Vergil|1950|p=337}} She was regarded as a meek, gentle, simple, and chaste woman, whose large family made her a suitable candidate to give birth to many children.

== Marriage and birth of heir ==
{{Wives of Henry VIII}}
Henry VIII was [[Engagement|betrothed]] to Jane on 20 May 1536, just one day after Anne Boleyn's execution. They were married at the [[Palace of Whitehall]], [[Whitehall]], [[London]], in the Queen's closet by [[Stephen Gardiner|Bishop Gardiner]]{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=344}} on 30 May 1536. As a wedding gift he made her a grant of 104 manors in four counties as well as a number of forests and hunting chases for her jointure, the income to support her during their marriage.{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=344}} She was publicly proclaimed queen on 4 June 1536. Her well-publicised sympathy for the late Queen Catherine and her daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary]] showed her to be compassionate and made her a popular figure with the common people and most of the courtiers.{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=340}} She was never crowned because of [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in London, where the coronation was to take place. Henry may have been reluctant to have her crowned before she had fulfilled her duty as a queen consort by bearing him a son and a male heir.{{sfn|Wagner|2012|p=1000}}

As queen, Jane was said to be strict and formal. Jane would form a close relationship with her stepdaughter, Mary. The lavish entertainments, gaiety, and extravagance of the queen's household, which had reached its peak during the time of Anne Boleyn, was replaced by a strict enforcement of decorum. For example, she banned the French fashions that Anne Boleyn had introduced. Politically, Seymour appears to have been conservative.&lt;ref name="JANE SEYMOUR:THIRD WIFE OF HENRY VIII OF ENGLAND"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Seymour: Third Wife of Henry VIII of England|url=http://www.a-london-tourist-guide.com/jane-seymour.html|publisher=A-london-tourist-guide.com|accessdate=22 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620050949/http://www.a-london-tourist-guide.com/jane-seymour.html|archivedate=20 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her only reported involvement in national affairs, in 1536, was when she asked for pardons for participants in the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]]. Henry is said to have rejected this, reminding her of the fate her predecessor met with when she "meddled in his affairs".&lt;ref name="PBShandbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/sixwives/meet/js_handbook_king.html|title= The Six Wives of Henry VIII: Jane Seymour|publisher=PBS|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=PBS is not a Reliable Source, a historical work is needed here|date=May 2014}} Her motto as a queen was "''Bound to obey and serve''."

Jane put forth much effort to restore Mary to court and to the royal succession, behind any children that she might have with Henry. Jane brought up the issue of Mary's restoration both before and after she became queen. While she was unable to restore Mary to the line of succession, she was able to reconcile her with Henry.{{sfn|Wagner|2012|p=1000}} Eustace Chapuys wrote to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of her compassion and efforts on behalf of Mary's return to favour. A letter from Mary to her shows that Mary was grateful to her. While it was her who first pushed for the restoration, Mary and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] were not reinstated to the succession until Henry's sixth wife, [[Catherine Parr]], convinced him to do so.{{sfn|Farquhar|2001|p=72}}

In  January 1537, Jane became pregnant. During her pregnancy, she developed a craving for [[quail]], which Henry ordered for her from [[Calais]] and [[Flanders]]. During the summer, she took no public engagements and led a relatively quiet life, being attended by the royal physicians and the best midwives in the kingdom.{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UsWO_odsZAC&amp;pg=PA362 362]}} She went into confinement in September 1537 and gave birth to the coveted male heir, the future [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], at two o'clock in the morning{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UsWO_odsZAC&amp;pg=PA367 367]}} on 12 October 1537 at [[Hampton Court Palace]].{{sfn|Seal|2001|p=129}} Edward was christened on 15 October 1537, without his mother in attendance, as was the custom.  He was the only legitimate son of Henry VIII to survive infancy. Both of his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, were present and carried Edward's train during the ceremony.{{sfn|Walder|1973|p=47}}

== Death and funeral ==
[[File:Jane Seymour - Cast Shadow Workshop.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Jane believed to have been painted during her short queenship and attributed to the "[[Cast Shadow Workshop]]"]]
Jane's labour had been difficult, lasting two nights and three days, probably because the baby was not well positioned.{{sfn|Walsh|2009}} After the christening, it became clear that she was seriously ill.{{sfn|Norton|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FiXjKTkR0QYC&amp;pg=PA145 145]}} She died on 24 October 1537 at [[Hampton Court Palace]]. Within a few weeks of her death, there were conflicting testimonies concerning the cause of her demise. In retrospect from the current day, there are various speculations that have been offered. According to King Edward's biographer, Jennifer Loach, her death may have been due to an infection from a [[retained placenta]]. According to [[Alison Weir]], she may have succumbed to [[puerperal fever]] following a bacterial infection contracted during the birth.&lt;ref name="JANE SEYMOUR:THIRD WIFE OF HENRY VIII OF ENGLAND" /&gt; The same author has also speculated, after medical consultation, that the cause of her death may have been a [[pulmonary embolism]].

Jane was buried on 12 November 1537 in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St. George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]] after the funeral in which her stepdaughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], acted as chief [[mourner]]. A procession of 29 mourners followed Mary, one for every year of Queen Jane's life.{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UsWO_odsZAC&amp;pg=PA372 372]}} She was the only one of Henry's wives to receive a queen's funeral.&lt;ref name="JANE SEYMOUR:THIRD WIFE OF HENRY VIII OF ENGLAND" /&gt;

After her death, Henry wore black for the next three months. He married [[Anne of Cleves]] two years later, although marriage negotiations were tentatively begun soon after Jane's death. He put on weight during his widowerhood, becoming obese and swollen and developing [[diabetes]] and [[gout]]. Historians have speculated she was his favourite wife because she gave birth to a male heir. When he died in 1547, he was buried beside her, on his request, in the grave he had made for her.&lt;ref name="JANE SEYMOUR:THIRD WIFE OF HENRY VIII OF ENGLAND" /&gt;

[[File:Phoenix and Castle Badge.svg|thumb|upright|Phoenix and Castle badge used by Jane Seymour]]

Jane gave the king the son he so desperately desired, helped to restore Mary to the succession and her father's affections, and used her influence to bring about the advancement of [[Seymour family|her family]].{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UsWO_odsZAC&amp;pg=PA373 373]}} Two of her brothers, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas]] and [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward]], used her memory to improve their own fortunes.&lt;ref name="JANE SEYMOUR:THIRD WIFE OF HENRY VIII OF ENGLAND"/&gt; Thomas was rumoured to have been pursuing the future [[Elizabeth I]], but married the queen dowager [[Catherine Parr]] instead. In the reign of the young King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], Edward set himself up as [[Lord Protector]] and [[de facto]] ruler of the kingdom. Both eventually fell from power, and were executed.&lt;ref name="JANE SEYMOUR:THIRD WIFE OF HENRY VIII OF ENGLAND" /&gt;

* The English ballad "[[The Death of Queen Jane]]" ([[Child Ballads|Child]] No. 170) is about the death of Jane Seymour following the birth of Prince Edward.

The historical fact is that Prince Edward was born naturally, and that his mother succumbed to infection and died 12 days later. Most versions of the song end with the contrast between the joy of the birth of the Prince and the grief of the death of the Queen.&lt;ref name="Vannan"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+death+of+Queen+Jane%3a+ballad%2c+history%2c+and+propaganda-a0321683005 |title=The death of Queen Jane: ballad, history, and propaganda |last=Vannan |first=Alastair |date=1 January 2013 |journal=Folk Music Journal |issn=0531-9684 |access-date=28 May 2018 |df=dmy-all |via=[[The Free Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justus Miles Forman''' (November 1, 1875 &amp;ndash; May 7, 1915) was an American novelist and playwright.

==Biography==
Forman was born on November 1, 1875 in [[Le Roy, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1949 |title=Forman, Justus Miles |encyclopedia=The New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia |volume=14 |page=5112|publisher=Unicorn Publishers, Inc. |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Yale University]].

His only play, ''The Hyphen'', appeared in 1915 but did not receive the success Forman expected. ''The Hyphen'' was a topical drama about "German-Americans" and "Irish-Americans" whose patriotism and fidelity to the United States is questioned due to events in Europe during [[World War I]]. Forman hoped that the drama would do better business in a production in London and decided to book a first-class passage aboard the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]''. Days before he was to board the liner, however, he received a mysterious phone call from a man with a thick German accent who warned him not to board the ''Lusitania''. Forman ignored the phone call and embarked on the ''Lusitania'' on May 1, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmslusitania.info/people/saloon/justus-miles-forman/ |title=Justus Miles Forman |publisher=The Lusitania Resource |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lusitania'' was torpedoed on May 7, 1915, and Forman was among the 1,198 passengers who perished in the sinking. His body was never recovered.

[[Meat]] is animal [[flesh]] that is eaten as food.&lt;ref name="Lawrie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrie|first=R. A.|author2=Ledward, D. A.|title=Lawrie’s meat science|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Limited|location=Cambridge|year=2006|edition=7th|isbn=978-1-84569-159-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Accuracy==
{{see|List of countries by meat consumption per capita}}
The figures tabulated below do not represent [[per capita]] amounts of meat eaten by humans.  Instead, they represent [[FAO]] figures for carcass mass availability (with “carcass mass” for poultry estimated as ready-to-cook mass),&lt;ref&gt;FAOSTAT.  (Statistical database of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.  Methods and Standards.   http://faostat3.fao.org/mes/methodology_list/E &lt;/ref&gt; divided by population.  The amount eaten by humans differs from carcass mass availability because the latter does not account for losses, which include bones, losses in retail and food service or home preparation  (including trim and cooking), spoilage and “downstream” waste, and amounts consumed by pets (compare [[dressed weight]]).&lt;ref&gt;Loss-adjusted food availability documentation.  United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service.  http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-(per-capita)-data-system/loss-a&lt;djusted-food-availability-documentation.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buzby, J. C. H. F. Wells, B. Axtman and J. Mickey.  2009.  Supermarket loss estimates for fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, and seafood and their use in the ERS loss-adjusted food availability data.  United States Department of Agriculture.  Econ. Infor. Bull.  EIB-44.  26 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muth, M. K., S. A.Karns, S. J. Nielsen, J. C. Buzby and H. F. Wells.  2011.  Consumer-level food loss estimates and their use in the ERS loss-adjusted food availability data.  United States Department of Agriculture Tech. Bull. TB-1927.  123 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  As an example of the difference, for 2002, when the FAO figure for US per capita meat consumption was {{convert|124.48|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, the [[USDA]] estimate of US per capita loss-adjusted meat consumption was {{convert|62.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Food availability (per capita) data system. (Excel files).

For example, the FAO (2002) figure for [[Denmark]], which has one of the highest meat export rates compared to its population, was {{convert|145.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (highest in the world). More recent FAO figures (2009) have taken the earlier discrepancy into account, resulting in a significantly lower {{convert|95.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for Denmark (13th in the world).&lt;ref name=FCDen&gt;{{cite web | last = Foodculture.dk | title = Forkerte tal om danskernes forbrug fordrejer køddebatten | url = http://www.foodculture.dk/samfund-og-forbrug/forbrug/2013/tal-om-koedforbrug-forvirrer#.V02dyOTVzcs | accessdate = 31 May 2016 | date = 11 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LFDen&gt;{{cite web|last=Landbrug &amp; Fødevarer |title=Danskernes forbrug af kød |url=https://www.lf.dk/Tal_og_Analyser/Analyser/Forbrug_og_detail/Analyse_af_danskernes_koedforbrug.aspx |date=14 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925074214/http://www.lf.dk/~/media/lf/Tal%20og%20analyser/Forbrug%20og%20detail/Markedsanalyse%20om%20k%C3%B8d.ashx |archive-date=25 September 2013 |access-date=31 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When further adjusted for loss, calculations by [[Technical University of Denmark|DTU]] Fødevareinstituttet suggest the actual consumption was {{convert|48|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per adult.&lt;ref name=LFDen/&gt;

Total meat includes meat from animals slaughtered in countries, irrespective of their origin, and comprises horsemeat, poultry, and meat from all other domestic or wild animals such as camels, rabbits, reindeer, and game animals
* Per capita calculations were conducted by WRI using FAO data on meat production and trade, and using U.N. data on population. Meat consumption was calculated using a trade balance approach - total production plus imports, minus exports

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2906">'''Maschalismos''' (μασχαλισμός) is the practice of physically rendering the dead incapable of rising or haunting the living in [[undead]] form. It comes from the Ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] word and was also the term for procedural rules on such matters in later Greek customary [[law]].

Such acts considered ''maschalismos'' were not limited to [[folkloric]] physical risings but also meant to escape the ill will of those wrongfully slain by a [[murder]]er after death. One common method was the cutting off of the feet, hands, ears, nose, et cetera, tying them under the armpits of the corpse all strung together. The piercing of the infant [[Oedipus]]' feet at the time he was abandoned may be considered a kind of maschalismos on the still-living.

In [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[Choephori]]'' and [[Sophocles]]' tragedy ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', [[Clytemnestra]] performs maschalismos on the body of [[Agamemnon]] after his murder, to prevent his taking vengeance on her. In the [[Argonautica]] of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], [[Jason]] performs maschalismos on the body of [[Medea]]'s brother [[Apsyrtus]] after treacherously murdering him; in addition to cutting off the extremities, Jason licks the dead man's blood three times and spits it out three times. "The scholiast says that the blood was spat into the mouth of the deceased," according to a footnote in the Loeb edition.

The term ''maschalismos'' has widened to include the customs throughout the different cultures of the world in ritually mutilating their dead to prevent their wrath from affecting the living. In the [[Molucca]]s, a woman who has died in [[childbirth]] is buried with pins stuck through the joints, and an [[egg (biology)|egg]] under the chin and or armpits; believing that the dead fly like birds and the presence of eggs will bring out maternal instincts which make the [[ghost]] not leave the eggs and thus stay with its former body. In [[Europe]], it was sometimes common that [[suicide]]s were buried with a stake driven through the heart, the body buried upside down, or the head cut off and placed between the legs. The [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], a tribe of [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]], slit the soles of the feet of those killed by lightning; the [[Basuto]] and [[Bechuana]] slit the [[sinew]]s and [[spinal cord]] of their dead; the [[Herbert River]] [[indigenous Australians|aborigine]]s of [[Australia]] beat the body enough to break its bones and fill incisions made in the body with stones. Further forms of maschalismos are equally common among peoples the world over.

'''Mixed transcortical aphasia''' is the least common of the three transcortical [[aphasia]]s (behind [[transcortical motor aphasia]] and [[transcortical sensory aphasia]], respectively).  This type of aphasia can also be referred to as "Isolation Aphasia". This type of aphasia is a result of damage that isolates the language areas ([[Broca's aphasia|Broca’s]], [[Wernicke's aphasia|Wernicke]]’s, and the arcuate fasciculus) from other brain regions. Broca’s, Wernicke’s, and the arcuate fasiculus are left intact; however, they are isolated from other brain regions.&lt;ref name="Brookshire, R. 2007"/&gt;

A [[stroke]] is one of the leading causes of disability in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;American Heart Association. Heart and Stroke Statistical Update—2000. Dallas, Tex: American Heart Association; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a stroke, 40% of stroke patients are left with moderate functional impairment and 15% to 30% have a severe disability as a result of a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bates B., Choi J., Duncan P., Glasberg J., Graham G., Katz R., Zorowitz R. | year = 2005 | title = Veterans affairs/department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of adult stroke rehabilitation care: Executive summary | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 71 | issue = 330| pages = 2049–2056 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.0000180432.73724.AD }}&lt;/ref&gt; A neurogenic cognitive-communicative disorder is one result of a stroke.

==Symptoms/Language Characteristics==

Mixed transcortical aphasia is characterized by severe speaking and comprehension impairment, but with preserved repetition.&lt;ref name="BerthierStarkstein1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berthier|first1=Marcelo L.|last2=Starkstein|first2=Sergio E.|last3=Leiguarda|first3=Ramon|last4=Ruiz|first4=Adelaida|last5=Mayberg|first5=Helen S.|last6=Wagner|first6=Henry|last7=Price|first7=Thomas R.|last8=Robinson|first8=Robert G.|title=TRANSCORTICAL APHASIA|journal=Brain|volume=114|issue=3|year=1991|pages=1409–1427|issn=0006-8950|doi=10.1093/brain/114.3.1409}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who suffer mixed transcortical aphasia struggle greatly to produce propositional language or to understand what is being said to them, yet they can repeat long, complex utterances or finish a song once they hear the first part. Persons with mixed transcortical aphasia are often nonfluent, and in most cases do not speak unless they are spoken to, do not comprehend spoken language, cannot name objects, and cannot read or write. However, they often have the ability to repeat what is said to them. In fact, persons with mixed transcortical aphasia often repeat in a parrot-like fashion.&lt;ref name="Brookshire, R. 2007"/&gt; Some patients with this disorder can experience many different types neurological symptoms including, bilateral [[paralysis]], lack of voluntary speech, and difficulty with producing spontaneous speech.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, S.

A conversation between a clinician and person with transcortical mixed aphasia would have similar characteristics to the conversation below:&lt;ref name="Brookshire, R. 2007"/&gt;
        Clinician: Hello, Mrs. Fenton
        Patient: Mrs. Fenton. Yes.
        Clinician: How are you doing today?
        Patient: How are you doing today?
        Clinician: I’m very fine, thank you. How are you doing?
        Patient: I’m very fine, thank you.
        Clinician: My name is Mary. I’ll be working with you today.
        Patient: My name is Mary. I’m working today.

In this rare type of aphasia, [[Broca's area]], [[Wernicke's area]], and the [[arcuate fasciculus]] are intact but the [[Watershed stroke|watershed region]] around them is damaged.&lt;ref name="pmid1000280"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heilman KM, Tucker DM, Valenstein E |title=A case of mixed transcortical aphasia with intact naming |journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]] |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=415–26 |date=September 1976 |pmid=1000280 |doi= 10.1093/brain/99.3.415|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1000280 |issn= |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This damage isolates these areas from the rest of the brain.

==Treatment and Therapy==
After a stroke, many patients feel the devastating impacts of the loss of language.   Studies have looked into ways to enhance verbal communication with therapy, and one of the treatment approaches that proved to be successful is "Drawing Therapy". Drawing offers an alternative route to access semantic information.  Because of this, it provides adults who have lost language with a means to access and express their ideas, emotions, and feelings.  Drawing has also been shown to activate right hemisphere regions.  This makes drawing a non-linguistic intervention that can access semantic knowledge in the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Farias, 2006"&gt;Farias, et al, (2006). Drawing; Its contribution to naming in aphasia. Brain and Language, 53-63.&lt;/ref&gt; The study conducted on drawing therapy found that it increased naming abilities in patients with acute and chronic aphasia.  It also produced fewer error attempts during naming tasks.&lt;ref name="Farias, 2006"/&gt;  The study also found that the act of drawing itself, not the quality, was critical for the activation of the semantic-lexical network required for naming tasks.&lt;ref name="Farias, 2006"/&gt; Other studies have also reported that family members have seen the effects of therapy at home.&lt;ref name="Sacchett, C 1999"&gt;Sacchett, C, et al, (1999). Drawing together: Evaluation of a therapy program for severe aphasia. International Journal of Language and Communication Disroders, 26-289.&lt;/ref&gt;  The gains made from drawing therapy were not ones that could have been made from spontaneous recovery.&lt;ref name="Sacchett, C 1999"/&gt; Drawing therapy was especially found to be useful in individuals with global and anomic aphasia.  Both of these individuals were found to have produced more verbalizations post-therapy.&lt;ref name="Farias, 2006"/&gt;  This reinforces the idea that drawing provides a mean of recruiting areas or networks that were not otherwise sufficient for producing speech. Across the majority of patients, the quality of drawing improved as well as written output and sentence structure.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, J. (1999). Drawing on the semantic system: The use of drawing as a therapy medium. In S. Byng, K. Swinburn &amp; C. Pound (Eds.), The Aphasia Therapy File (pp. 41-60). Hove: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing therapy has proved to be effective even after a few periods of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;(Hunt, 199Hunt, J. (1999). Drawing on the semantic system: The use of drawing as a therapy medium. In S. Byng, K. Swinburn &amp; C. Pound (Eds.), The Aphasia Therapy File (pp. 41-60). Hove: Psychology Press.9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this therapy is aimed at patients with aphasia, it can be implemented for any patient with expressive deficits.&lt;ref name="Farias, 2006"/&gt;
 
Drawing therapy can be implemented in the following hierarchy:

  1. Clinician gives patient a prompt and asks them to draw a response
  2. Clinician asks for clarification of drawing if it is unclear (add more detail, enlarge one aspect of the drawing)
  3. If possible, patient verbalizes about their drawing and assigns language
 
Drawing therapy can also be made harder through the type of prompt given and the task difficulty. Prompts and questions that are opened ended and with broad semantic categories are going to be harder to conceptualize and draw.&lt;ref name="Farias, 2006"/&gt;  It is a harder task when the client is asked to draw abstract concepts or sequenced actions/events.
 
  If a client has deficits in the following areas, drawing therapy might be an appropriate therapy technique:
 
   [[Western Aphasia Battery]] (WAB)
   1. Responsive Speech ("What do you write with?")
   2. Spontaneous Speech
        a. Conversational questions
        b. Picture descriptions
 
   [[Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination]] (BDAE)
   1. Oral expression (word reading, sentence reading)
   2. Written section (writing to dictation, writing to describe a picture)
 
Overall, drawing therapy offers a means of accessing language to patients with aphasia who have difficulty expressing themselves with different modalities.&lt;ref name="Farias, 2006"/&gt;

==Assessment==

For most patients, formal and informal language assessments are initially administered during his/her acute hospital stay by a licensed speech-language pathologist.  However, a [[standardized assessment]] may provide further information regarding an aphasia classification. While there are different classifications of aphasia (i.e., Broca’s, Wernicke’s, Conduction, Anomia), they each have hallmark deficits.  Research has shown, a patient presenting with mixed transcortical aphasia will have impairments in all communicative areas, with the exception of the preserved ability to repeat a person’s words or phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Brookshire, R. H. (2007). Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders (Seventh edition). St. Louis, MO.: Mosby Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;  Patients with mixed transcortical aphasia demonstrate similar deficits as those seen in patients with global aphasia. Therefore, assessment of repetition is most critical in order to differentially diagnose.Specifically, language based standardized assessments such as the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), and the Folstein Mini Mental State Exam include a repetition subtest amongst all other language-related areas.

Other possible assessments that can provide further differentiation include: 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)
CT scan
Informal observation

It is important to remain diligent in providing therapy regardless of aphasia classification.

==Prognosis==

If brain damage is minimal then a patient may recover language skills over time without treatment, however if the damage is severe it may be necessary to receive speech and language therapy.&lt;ref name="cirrie.buffalo.edu"/&gt; Recovery from this type of brain injury is a slow process and very few patients regain the same level of language and communication skills that they have before the injury. Patients with aphasia usually undergo speech therapy where they relearn and practice supplementary communication methods.&lt;ref name="cirrie.buffalo.edu"/&gt; Speech therapy is not a cure for the aphasia, but instead helps patients use skills that remain intact.&lt;ref name="cirrie.buffalo.edu"/&gt; When considering the prognosis for individuals with aphasia it is necessary to consider internal factors, patient specific factors, and external factors as these factors are considered most critical to post-stroke recovery.&lt;ref name="Thompson, C. K. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thompson C. K. | year = 2000 | title = Neuroplasticity: Evidence from aphasia | url = | journal = Journal of Communication Disorders | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 357–366 | doi=10.1016/s0021-9924(00)00031-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal factors are factors related to the stroke such as aphasia severity, lesion site and lesion size . Individuals with milder forms of aphasia, lesions that insignificantly impact language function and smaller lesions tend to have a higher degree of aphasia recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Plowman E., Hentz B., Ellis C. | year = 2012 | title = Post-stroke aphasia prognosis: a review of patient-related and stroke-related factors | url = | journal = Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 689–694 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2011.01650.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) produce a more persistent global aphasia, which is associated with poor aphasia recovery.&lt;ref name="Watila, M. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Watila M., Balarabe S. | year = 2015 | title = Review article: Factors predicting post-stroke aphasia recovery | url = | journal = Journal of the Neurological Sciences | volume =  352| issue = | pages =  12–18| doi = 10.1016/j.jns.2015.03.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = | year = | title = Post-stroke aphasia prognosis: a review of patient-related and stroke-related factors | url = | journal = Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 689–694 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2011.01650.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patient specific factors relate to the patient's age of onset, education level and motivation for recovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3748">The '''murders of Blake and Mary-Jo Hadley''' occurred on July 16, 2011 in [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]]. Tyler Hadley, their son, was convicted of the murder.

==Timeline==

===Murder===
Shortly before 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Tyler took his parents' cell phones. He took three pills of [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and then went to his parents' room. He stood behind Mary-Jo while she worked at a computer for five minutes and then beat her to death with a hammer. Hearing Mary-Jo's screams, Blake rushed to the scene and saw Tyler. They stared at each other for several moments before he beat his father to death. He spent three hours cleaning up the blood before hosting a party. He hid their bodies in the master bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rich|first=Nathaniel|title=Tyler Hadley's Killer... Party: The Shocking Florida House Party Murders - Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/tyler-hadleys-killer-party-20131218|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=December 18, 2013|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party===
Some time after the murders, Tyler made a [[Facebook]] post letting people know that he was having a party that night. He then stopped at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and then picked up some friends. About 60 people gathered for the party, playing beer pong, smoking cigars and drinking. That night Tyler told his best friend, Michael Mandell, that he bludgeoned his parents with a hammer. He showed Michael the master bedroom and the blood that was in the room. News of the crime was then spread by word of mouth. Hadley was arrested early the next morning.

==Perpetrator==
During his teenage years Tyler began skipping school and taking drugs. He had mental health problems; his parents took him to a psychiatrist and an outpatient mental health and substance abuse program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dooley|first1=Sean|last2=Smith|first2=Jenner|last3=Valiente|first3=Alexa|title=Best Friend ‘Ruined My Life’ When He Killed His Own Parents|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/best-friend-ruined-life-killed-parents/story?id=23189582|publisher=ABC News|date=April 4, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions==
Tyler was 17 and could not be sentenced to death by Florida law. In 2014, he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|first=Crimesider|title=Teen who killed parents, threw party, gets life without parole|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tyler-hadley-who-killed-his-parents-at-17-then-threw-party-sentenced-to-life/|publisher=CBS|date=March 21, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In April 2015, the Hadley house was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holsman|first=Melissa|title=Home where Tyler Hadley killed parents is being demolished|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/st-lucie-county/home-where-tyler-hadley-killed-parents-is-being-demolished-ep-1037143671-335356281.html|publisher=TC Palm|date=April 14, 2015|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, his sentencing was overturned by an appeal judge who stated the lower court "did not consider the correct alternative to a life sentence"; Hadley is awaiting a new sentencing hearing.&lt;ref&gt;http://cbs12.com/news/local/sentence-for-tyler-hadley-overturned-in-hammer-killings-of-parents&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45692">'''Neurotechnology''' is any [[technology]] that has a fundamental influence on how people understand the [[brain]] and various aspects of [[consciousness]], thought, and higher order activities in the brain. It also includes technologies that are designed to improve and repair brain function and allow researchers and clinicians to visualize the brain.

==Background==

The field of neurotechnology has been around for nearly half a century but has only reached maturity in the last twenty years. The advent of [[brain imaging]] revolutionized the field, allowing researchers to directly monitor the brain's activities during experiments. Neurotechnology has made significant impact on society, though its presence is so commonplace that many do not realize its ubiquity. From pharmaceutical drugs to brain scanning, neurotechnology affects nearly all industrialized people either directly or indirectly, be it from drugs for depression, sleep, [[ADHD predominantly inattentive|ADD]], or anti-neurotics to cancer scanning, [[stroke rehabilitation]], and much more.

As the field's depth increases it will potentially allow society to control and harness more of what the brain does and how it influences lifestyles and personalities. Commonplace technologies already attempt to do this; games like [[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!|BrainAge]],&lt;ref&gt;Nintendo Company of America. BrainAge (2006). Based on the work of [[Ryuta Kawashima]], M.D.&lt;/ref&gt; and programs like [[Fast ForWord]]&lt;ref name="Merzenich1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sarah H. Broman|author2=Jack Fletcher|title=The changing nervous system: neurobehavioral consequences of early brain disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=paxE8PFrsLEC|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-512193-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aim to improve brain function, are neurotechnologies.

Currently, modern science can image nearly all aspects of the brain as well as control a degree of the function of the brain. It can help control [[Depression (mood)|depression]], over-activation, sleep deprivation, and many other conditions. Therapeutically it can help improve [[stroke]] victims' motor coordination, improve brain function, reduce epileptic episodes (see [[epilepsy]]), improve patients with degenerative motor diseases ([[Parkinson's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], [[ALS]]), and can even help alleviate [[phantom pain]] perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Doidge |title=The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science |publisher=Viking Adult |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-670-03830-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in the field promise many new enhancements and rehabilitation methods for patients suffering from neurological problems. The neurotechnology revolution has given rise to the [[Decade of the Mind]] initiative, which was started in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Decade of the Mind |url=http://www.dom2009.de/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also offers the possibility of revealing the mechanisms by which [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] emerge from the brain.

==Current technologies==

===Live Imaging===
[[Magnetoencephalography]] is a [[functional neuroimaging]] technique for mapping brain activity by recording [[magnetic field]]s produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the [[human brain|brain]], using very sensitive [[magnetometer]]s. Arrays of [[SQUID]]s (superconducting quantum interference devices) are the most common magnetometer. Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of various parts of the brain, and [[neurofeedback]]. This can be applied in a clinical setting to find locations of abnormalities as well as in an experimental setting to simply measure brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Neil R. (2013). ''Physiology of Behavior.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education Inc. {{ISBN|9780205239399}} pp 152-153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is used for scanning the brain for topological and landmark structure in the brain, but can also be used for imaging activation in the brain.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience4thEdp19"&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Purves |title=Neuroscience, Fourth Edition |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-87893-697-7 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While detail about how MRI works is reserved for the actual MRI article, the uses of MRI are far reaching in the study of neuroscience. It is a cornerstone technology in studying the mind, especially with the advent of functional MRI (fMRI).&lt;ref name="Neuroscience4thEdp24"&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Purves |title=Neuroscience, Fourth Edition |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-87893-697-7 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional MRI measures the oxygen levels in the brain upon activation (higher oxygen content = neural activation) and allows researchers to understand what loci are responsible for activation under a given stimulus. This technology is a large improvement to single cell or loci activation by means of exposing the brain and contact stimulation. Functional MRI allows researchers to draw associative relationships between different loci and regions of the brain and provides a large amount of knowledge in establishing new landmarks and loci in the brain.&lt;ref name="deCharms2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Decharms | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Maeda | first2 = F. | last3 = Glover | first3 = G. H. | last4 = Ludlow | first4 = D. | last5 = Pauly | first5 = J. M. | last6 = Soneji | first6 = D. | last7 = Gabrieli | first7 = J. D. E. | last8 = MacKey | first8 = S.

[[Computed tomography]] (CT) is another technology used for scanning the brain. It has been used since the 1970s and is another tool used by neuroscientists to track brain structure and activation.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience4thEdp19"/&gt; While many of the functions of CT scans are now done using MRI, CT can still be used as the mode by which brain activation and brain injury are detected. Using an X-ray, researchers can detect radioactive markers in the brain that indicate brain activation as a tool to establish relationships in the brain as well as detect many injuries/diseases that can cause lasting damage to the brain such as aneurysms, degeneration, and cancer.

[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) is another imaging technology that aids researchers. Instead of using magnetic resonance or X-rays, PET scans rely on positron emitting markers that are bound to a biologically relevant marker such as glucose.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience4thEdp20"&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Purves |title=Neuroscience, Fourth Edition |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-87893-697-7 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more activation in the brain the more that region requires nutrients, so higher activation appears more brightly on an image of the brain. PET scans are becoming more frequently used by researchers because PET scans are activated due to metabolism whereas MRI is activated on a more physiological basis (sugar activation versus oxygen activation).

===Transcranial magnetic stimulation===
[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) is essentially direct magnetic stimulation to the brain. Because electric currents and magnetic fields are intrinsically related, by stimulating the brain with magnetic pulses it is possible to interfere with specific loci in the brain to produce a predictable effect.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, E.M. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study is currently receiving a large amount of attention due to the potential benefits that could come out of better understanding this technology.&lt;ref name="Illes2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Illes | first1 = J | last2 = Gallo | first2 = M | last3 = Kirschen | first3 = MP | title = An ethics perspective on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and human neuromodulation | journal = Behavioural neurology | volume = 17 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 149–57 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17148834| doi=10.1155/2006/791072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcranial magnetic movement of particles in the brain shows promise for drug targeting and delivery as studies have demonstrated this to be noninvasive on brain physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=B|last2=Kulkarni|first2=SD|last3=Villar|first3=PS|last4=Smith|first4=RS|last5=Eberly|first5=C|last6=Araneda|first6=RC|last7=Depireux|first7=DA|last8=Shapiro|first8=B|title=Movement of magnetic nanoparticles in brain tissue: mechanisms and impact on normal neuronal function.|journal=Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine|date=October 2015|volume=11|issue=7|pages=1821–9|doi=10.1016/j.nano.2015.06.003|pmid=26115639|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S154996341500132X|pmc=4586396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcranial direct current stimulation===
[[Transcranial direct current stimulation]] (tDCS) is a form of [[neurostimulation]] which uses constant, low current delivered via electrodes placed on the scalp. The mechanisms underlying tDCS effects are still incompletely understood, but recent advances in neurotechnology allowing for ''in vivo'' assessment of brain electric activity during tDCS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Soekadar SR, Witkowski M, Cossio EG, Birbaumer N, Robinson SE, Cohen LG | year = 2013 | title = In vivo assessment of human brain oscillations during application of transcranial electric currents | url = | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 2032 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms3032 | bibcode = 2013NatCo...4E2032S }}&lt;/ref&gt; promise to advance understanding of these mechanisms. Research into using tDCS on healthy adults have demonstrated that tDCS can increase cognitive performance on a variety of tasks, depending on the area of the brain being stimulated. tDCS has been used to enhance language and mathematical ability (though one form of tDCS was also found to inhibit math learning),&lt;ref name=PMID_25970697&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Grabner |first1 = Roland H |last2 = Rütsche |first2 = Bruno |last3 = Ruff |first3 = Christian C |last4 = Hauser |first4 = Tobias U |year = 2015 |title = Transcranial direct current stimulation of the posterior parietal cortex modulates arithmetic learning. |journal = The European Journal of Neuroscience |quote = Cathodal tDCS (compared with sham) decreased learning rates during training and resulted in poorer performance which lasted over 24 h after stimulation.

===Cranial surface measurements===
[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) is a method of measuring brainwave activity non-invasively. A number of electrodes are placed around the head and scalp and electrical signals are measured. Typically EEGs are used when dealing with sleep, as there are characteristic wave patterns associated with different stages of sleep.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience4thEdp715"&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Purves |title=Neuroscience, Fourth Edition |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-87893-697-7 |page=715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinically EEGs are used to study epilepsy as well as stroke and tumor presence in the brain. EEGs are a different method to understand the electrical signaling in the brain during activation.

[[Magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) is another method of measuring activity in the brain by measuring the magnetic fields that arise from electrical currents in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=M. |last=Hämäläinen |date=November 2007 |title=Magnetoencephalography (MEG) |publisher=Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging |url=http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/research/technologiesMEG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit to using MEG instead of EEG is that these fields are highly localized and give rise to better understanding of how specific loci react to stimulation or if these regions over-activate (as in epileptic seizures).

===Implant technologies===
Neurodevices are any devices used to monitor or regulate brain activity. Currently there are a few available for clinical use as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. The most common neurodevices are deep brain stimulators ([[Deep Brain Stimulation|DBS]]) that are used to give electrical stimulation to areas stricken by inactivity.&lt;ref name="Gross2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = R. | title = What Happened to Posteroventral Pallidotomy for Parkinson's Disease and Dystonia? | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 281–293 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18394570 | pmc = 5084170 | doi = 10.1016/j.nurt.2008.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkinson's disease is known to be caused by an inactivation of the [[basal ganglia]] (nuclei) and recently DBS has become the more preferred form of treatment for Parkinson's disease, although current research questions the efficiency of DBS for movement disorders.&lt;ref name="Gross2008"/&gt;

[[Neuromodulation (medicine)|Neuromodulation]] is a relatively new field that combines the use of neurodevices and neurochemistry. The basis of this field is that the brain can be regulated using a number of different factors (metabolic, electrical stimulation, physiological) and that all these can be modulated by devices implanted in the neural network. While currently this field is still in the researcher phase, it represents a new type of technological integration in the field of neurotechnology.  The brain is a very sensitive organ, so in addition to researching the amazing things that neuromodulation and implanted neural devices can produce, it is important to research ways to create devices that elicit as few negative responses from the body as possible.  This can be done by modifying the material [[Surface Chemistry of Neural Implants|surface chemistry of neural implants]].

===Cell therapy===
Researchers have begun looking at uses for stem cells in the brain, which recently have been found in a few loci. A large number of studies{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} are being done to determine if this form of therapy could be used in a large scale. Experiments have successfully used stem cells in the brains of children who suffered from injuries in gestation and elderly people with degenerative diseases in order to induce the brain to produce new cells and to make more connections between neurons.

===Pharmaceuticals===
Pharmaceuticals play a vital role in maintaining stable brain chemistry, and are the most commonly used neurotechnology by the general public and medicine. Drugs like [[sertraline]], [[methylphenidate]], and [[zolpidem]] act as chemical modulators in the brain, and they allow for normal activity in many people whose brains cannot act normally under physiological conditions. While pharmaceuticals are usually not mentioned and have their own field, the role of pharmaceuticals is perhaps the most far-reaching and commonplace in modern society (the focus on this article will largely ignore neuropharmaceuticals, for more information, see [[neuropsychopharmacology]]). Movement of magnetic particles to targeted brain regions for drug delivery is an emerging field of study and causes no detectable circuit damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=B|last2=Kulkarni|first2=SD|last3=Villar|first3=PS|last4=Smith|first4=RS|last5=Eberly|first5=C|last6=Araneda|first6=RC|last7=Depireux|first7=DA|last8=Shapiro|first8=B|title=Movement of magnetic nanoparticles in brain tissue: mechanisms and impact on normal neuronal function.|journal=Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine|date=October 2015|volume=11|issue=7|pages=1821–9|pmid=26115639|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S154996341500132X|doi=10.1016/j.nano.2015.06.003|pmc=4586396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low field magnetic stimulation===

Stimulation with [[Low field magnetic stimulation|low-intensity magnetic fields]] is currently under study for depression at Harvard Medical School, and has previously been explored by Bell (et al.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alterations in brain electrical activity caused by magnetic fields: detecting the detection process|author1=Bell GB|author2=Marino AA|author3=Chesson AL|displayauthors=1|pmid=1281085 |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology|year=1992|volume=83|issue=6|pages=389–397|doi=10.1016/0013-4694(92)90075-s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marino (et al.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effect of low-frequency magnetic fields on brain electrical activity in human subjects

==How these help study the brain==
Magnetic resonance imaging is a vital tool in neurological research in showing activation in the brain as well as providing a comprehensive image of the brain being studied. While MRIs are used clinically for showing brain size, it still has relevance in the study of brains because it can be used to determine extent of injuries or deformation. These can have a significant effect on personality, sense perception, memory, higher order thinking, movement, and spatial understanding. However, current research tends to focus more so on [[fMRI]] or real-time functional MRI (rtfMRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = RW | last2 = Jesmanowicz | first2 = A | last3 = Hyde | first3 = JS | title = Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging | journal = Magnetic Resonance in Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 230–6 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7707914| doi=10.1002/mrm.1910330213}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two methods allow the scientist or the participant, respectively, to view activation in the brain. This is incredibly vital in understanding how a person thinks and how their brain reacts to a person's environment, as well as understanding how the brain works under various stressors or dysfunctions. Real-time functional MRI is a revolutionary tool available to neurologists and neuroscientists because patients can see how their brain reacts to stressors and can perceive visual feedback.&lt;ref name="deCharms2005" /&gt; CT scans are very similar to MRI in their academic use because they can be used to image the brain upon injury, but they are more limited in perceptual feedback.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience4thEdp19"/&gt; CTs are generally used in clinical studies far more than in academic studies, and are found far more often in a hospital than a research facility. PET scans are also finding more relevance in academia because they can be used to observe metabolic uptake of neurons, giving researchers a wider perspective about neural activity in the brain for a given condition.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience4thEdp20"/&gt; Combinations of these methods can provide researchers with knowledge of both physiological and metabolic behaviors of loci in the brain and can be used to explain activation and deactivation of parts of the brain under specific conditions.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a relatively new method of studying how the brain functions and is used in many research labs focused on behavioral disorders and hallucinations. What makes TMS research so interesting in the neuroscience community is that it can target specific regions of the brain and shut them down or activate temporarily; thereby changing the way the brain behaves. Personality disorders can stem from a variety of external factors, but when the disorder stems from the circuitry of the brain TMS can be used to deactivate the circuitry. This can give rise to a number of responses, ranging from “normality” to something more unexpected, but current research is based on the theory that use of TMS could radically change treatment and perhaps act as a cure for personality disorders and hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Illes2006" /&gt; Currently, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ([[rTMS]]) is being researched to see if this deactivation effect can be made more permanent in patients suffering from these disorders. Some techniques combine TMS and another scanning method such as EEG to get additional information about brain activity such as cortical response.&lt;ref name="Veniero2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Veniero | first1 = D. | last2 = Bortoletto | first2 = M. | last3 = Miniussi | first3 = C. | title = TMS-EEG co-registration: on TMS-induced artifact | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 120 | issue = 7 | pages = 1392–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19535291 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinph.2009.04.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both EEG and MEG are currently being used to study the brain's activity under different conditions. Each uses similar principles but allows researchers to examine individual regions of the brain, allowing isolation and potentially specific classification of active regions. As mentioned above, EEG is very useful in analysis of immobile patients, typically during the sleep cycle. While there are other types of research that utilize EEG,&lt;ref name="Veniero2009"/&gt; EEG has been fundamental in understanding the resting brain during sleep.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience4thEdp715"/&gt; There are other potential uses for EEG and MEG such as charting rehabilitation and improvement after trauma as well as testing neural conductivity in specific regions of epileptics or patients with personality disorders.

Neuromodulation can involve numerous technologies combined or used independently to achieve a desired effect in the brain. Gene and cell therapy are becoming more prevalent in research and clinical trials and these technologies could help stunt or even reverse disease progression in the central nervous system. Deep brain stimulation is currently used in many patients with movement disorders and is used to improve the quality of life in patients.&lt;ref name="Gross2008"/&gt; While deep brain stimulation is a method to study how the brain functions per se, it provides both surgeons and neurologists important information about how the brain works when certain small regions of the basal ganglia (nuclei) are stimulated by electrical currents.

==Future technologies==
The future of neurotechnologies lies in how they are fundamentally applied, and not so much on what new versions will be developed. Current technologies give a large amount of insight into the mind and how the brain functions, but basic research is still needed to demonstrate the more applied functions of these technologies. Currently, rtfMRI is being researched as a method for pain therapy. deCharms et al. have shown that there is a significant improvement in the way people perceive pain if they are made aware of how their brain is functioning while in pain. By providing direct and understandable feedback, researchers can help patients with chronic pain decrease their symptoms. This new type of bio/mechanical-feedback is a new development in pain therapy.&lt;ref name="deCharms2005"/&gt; Functional MRI is also being considered for a number of more applicable uses outside of the clinic. Research has been done on testing the efficiency of mapping the brain in the case when someone lies as a new way to detect lying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Langleben | first1 = D. | last2 = Schroeder | first2 = L. | last3 = Maldjian | first3 = J. | last4 = Gur | first4 = R. | last5 = McDonald | first5 = S. | last6 = Ragland | first6 = J. | last7 = O'Brien | first7 = C. | last8 = Childress | first8 = A. | title = Brain Activity during Simulated Deception: an Event-Related Functional Magnetic Resonance Study | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 727–732 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11848716 | doi = 10.1006/nimg.2001.1003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same vein, EEG has been considered for use in lie detection as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Farwell | first1 = LA | last2 = Smith | first2 = SS | title = Using brain MERMER testing to detect knowledge despite efforts to conceal | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–43 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11210899}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMS is being used in a variety of potential therapies for patients with personality disorders, [[epilepsy]], [[PTSD]], [[migraine]], and other brain-firing disorders, but has been found to have varying clinical success for each condition.&lt;ref name="Illes2006"/&gt; The end result of such research would be to develop a method to alter the brain's perception and firing and train patients' brains to rewire permanently under inhibiting conditions (for more information see [[rTMS]]).&lt;ref name="Illes2006"/&gt; In addition, PET scans have been found to be 93% accurate in detecting [[Alzheimer's disease]] nearly 3 years before conventional diagnosis, indicating that PET scanning is becoming more useful in both the laboratory and the clinic.&lt;ref&gt;Mosconi, L., et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stem cell]] technologies are always salient both in the minds of the general public and scientists because of their large potential. Recent advances in stem cell research have allowed researchers to ethically pursue studies in nearly every facet of the body, which includes the brain. Research has shown that while most of the brain does not regenerate and is typically a very difficult environment to foster regeneration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sur | first1 = M. | last2 = Rubenstein | first2 = J. L. R. | title = Patterning and Plasticity of the Cerebral Cortex | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = 5749 | pages = 805–10 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16272112 | doi = 10.1126/science.1112070|bibcode = 2005Sci...310..805S }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are portions of the brain with regenerative capabilities (specifically the [[hippocampus]] and the [[olfactory bulbs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eriksson | first1 = P.

It is important to note that there are therapies that improve cognition and increase the amount of neural pathways,&lt;ref name="Merzenich1999"/&gt; but this does not mean that there is a proliferation of neural cells in the brain. Rather, it is called a plastic rewiring of the brain (''plastic'' because it indicates malleability) and is considered a vital part of growth. Nevertheless, many problems in patients stem from death of neurons in the brain, and researchers in the field are striving to produce technologies that enable regeneration in patients with stroke, Parkinson's diseases, severe trauma, and [[Alzheimer's disease]], as well as many others. While still in fledgling stages of development, researchers have recently begun making very interesting progress in attempting to treat these diseases. Researchers have recently successfully produced [[dopaminergic]] neurons for transplant in patients with Parkinson's diseases with the hopes that they will be able to move again with a more steady supply of dopamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sacchetti | first1 = P. | last2 = Sousa | first2 = K.

Novel drug delivery systems are being researched in order to improve the lives of those who struggle with brain disorders that might not be treated with stem cells, modulation, or rehabilitation. Pharmaceuticals play a very important role in society, and the brain has a very selective barrier that prevents some drugs from going from the blood to the brain. There are some diseases of the brain such as meningitis that require doctors to directly inject medicine into the spinal cord because the drug cannot cross the [[blood–brain barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=D. |last=Ala'Aldeen |last2=University of Nottingham |date=May 15, 2009 |title=Breakthrough In The Treatment Of Bacterial Meningitis |publisher=ScienceDaily |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090513121048.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is being conducted to investigate new methods of targeting the brain using the blood supply, as it is much easier to inject into the blood than the spine. New technologies such as [[nanotechnology]] are being researched for selective drug delivery, but these technologies have problems as with any other. One of the major setbacks is that when a particle is too large, the patient's [[liver]] will take up the particle and degrade it for excretion, but if the particle is too small there will not be enough drug in the particle to take effect.&lt;ref name="Tsuji2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tsuji | first1 = J.

Neuromodulation is a technology currently used for patients with movement disorders, although research is currently being done to apply this technology to other disorders. Recently, a study was done on if DBS could improve depression with positive results, indicating that this technology might have potential as a therapy for multiple disorders in the brain.&lt;ref name="PersonalGross"/&gt;{{Request quotation|date=July 2010}} DBS is limited by its high cost however, and in developing countries the availability of DBS is very limited.&lt;ref name="Gross2008"/&gt; A new version of DBS is under investigation and has developed into the novel field, [[optogenetics]].&lt;ref name="Lynch2009"/&gt; Optogenetics is the combination of deep brain stimulation with [[fiber optics]] and gene therapy. Essentially, the fiber optic cables are designed to light up under electrical stimulation, and a protein would be added to a neuron via [[gene therapy]] to excite it under light stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adamantidis | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = F. | last3 = Aravanis | first3 = A.

Neuromodulation offers a wide degree of therapy for many patients, but due to the nature of the disorders it is currently used to treat its effects are often temporary. Future goals in the field hope to alleviate that problem by increasing the years of effect until DBS can be used for the remainder of the patient's life. Another use for neuromodulation would be in building neuro-interface prosthetic devices that would allow quadriplegics the ability to maneuver a cursor on a screen with their thoughts, thereby increasing their ability to interact with others around them. By understanding the motor cortex and understanding how the brain signals motion, it is possible to emulate this response on a computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hochberg | first1 = L.

==Ethics==
{{Essay|section|date=June 2010}}

===Stem cells===
The ethical debate about use of embryonic stem cells has stirred controversy both in the United States and abroad; although more recently these debates have lessened due to modern advances in creating induced pluripotent stem cells from adult cells. The greatest advantage for use of embryonic stem cells is the fact that they can differentiate (become) nearly any type of cell provided the right conditions and signals. However, recent advances by Shinya Yamanaka et al. have found ways to create pluripotent cells without the use of such controversial cell cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Takahashi | first1 = K. | last2 = Yamanaka | first2 = S. | authorlink2 = Shinya Yamanaka| title = Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–76 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the patient's own cells and re-differentiating them into the desired cell type bypasses both possible patient rejection of the embryonic stem cells and any ethical concerns associated with using them, while also providing researchers a larger supply of available cells. However, induced pluripotent cells have the potential to form benign (though potentially malignant) tumors, and tend to have poor survivability ''in vivo'' (in the living body) on damaged tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Laflamme | first1 = M.

Enhancements of traits, use of animals for tissue scaffolding, and even arguments for moral degeneration have been made with the fears that if this technology reaches its full potential a new paradigm shift will occur in human behavior.

===Military application===
New neurotechnologies have always garnered the appeal of governments, from lie detection technology and virtual reality to rehabilitation and understanding the psyche. Due to the Iraq War and War on Terror, American soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan are reported to have percentages up to 12% with [[PTSD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Center for PTSD Home |publisher=National Center for PTSD |url=http://www.ptsd.va.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many researchers hoping to improve these peoples' conditions by implementing new strategies for recovery. By combining pharmaceuticals and neurotechnologies, some researchers have discovered ways of lowering the "fear" response and theorize that it may be applicable to PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ressler | first1 = K. J. | last2 = Rothbaum | first2 = B. O. | last3 = Tannenbaum | first3 = L. | last4 = Anderson | first4 = P. | last5 = Graap | first5 = K. | last6 = Zimand | first6 = E. | last7 = Hodges | first7 = L. | last8 = Davis | first8 = M. | title = Cognitive Enhancers as Adjuncts to Psychotherapy: Use of D-Cycloserine in Phobic Individuals to Facilitate Extinction of Fear | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 61 | issue = 11 | pages = 1136–44 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15520361 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.61.11.1136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual reality is another technology that has drawn much attention in the military. If improved, it could be possible to train soldiers how to deal with complex situations in times of peace, in order to better prepare and train a modern army.

===Privacy===
{{See also|Brain implant#Concerns and ethical considerations}}
Finally, when these technologies are being developed society must understand that these neurotechnologies could reveal the one thing that people can always keep secret: what they are thinking. While there are large amounts of benefits associated with these technologies, it is necessary for scientists, citizens and policy makers alike to consider implications for privacy.&lt;ref name="Wolpe2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wolpe | first1 = P. | last2 = Foster | first2 = K. | last3 = Langleben | first3 = D. | title = Emerging Neurotechnologies for Lie-Detection: Promises and Perils | journal = American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 39–49 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16036700 | doi = 10.1080/15265160590923367}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is important in many ethical circles concerned with the state and goals of progress in the field of neurotechnology (see [[Neuroethics]]). Current improvements such as “brain fingerprinting” or lie detection using EEG or fMRI could give rise to a set fixture of loci/emotional relationships in the brain, although these technologies are still years away from full application.&lt;ref name="Wolpe2005"/&gt; It is important to consider how all these neurotechnologies might affect the future of society, and it is suggested that political, scientific, and civil debates are heard about the implementation of these newer technologies that potentially offer a new wealth of once-private information.&lt;ref name="Wolpe2005"/&gt; Some ethicists are also concerned with the use of TMS and fear that the technique could be used to alter patients in ways that are undesired by the patient.&lt;ref name="Illes2006" /&gt;

===Cognitive liberty===
[[Cognitive liberty]] refers to a suggested right to self-determination of individuals to control their own mental processes, cognition, and consciousness including by the use of various neurotechnologies and psychoactive substances. This perceived right is relevant for reformation and development of associated laws.

'''Marcos Orlando Letelier del Solar''' (13 April 1932 – 21 September 1976) was a [[Chile]]an [[economist]], [[politician]] and [[diplomat]] during the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|presidency]] of [[Salvador Allende]]. A refugee from the [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|military dictatorship]] of General [[Augusto Pinochet]], Letelier accepted several academic positions in [[Washington, D.C.]] following his exit from Chile. In 1976, agents of [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional]] (DINA), the Pinochet regime's secret police, assassinated Letelier in Washington via the use of a car bomb. These agents had been working in collaboration with members of the [[Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations]], a U.S.-sponsored, anti-[[Fidel Castro]], militant group.&lt;ref name="Lettieri 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lettieri|first1=Mike|title=Posada Carriles, Bush's Child of Scorn|journal=Washington Report on the Hemisphere|date=1 June 2007|volume=27|issue=7/8|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Letelier was born in [[Temuco, Chile]], the youngest child of Orlando Letelier Ruiz and Inés del Solar. He studied at the [[Instituto Nacional]] and, at the age of sixteen, he was accepted as a cadet of the Chilean Military Academy, where he completed his secondary studies. Later, he abandoned the military life. He did not finish college and never received a university degree. In 1955, he joined the recently formed [[CODELCO|Copper Office]] (''Departamento del Cobre'', now CODELCO), where he worked until 1959 as a research analyst in the [[copper]] industry.

In the same year, Letelier married Isabel Margarita Morel Gumucio on December 17, 1955, with whom he had four children: Cristián, José, Francisco, and Juan Pablo.

Later in 1955, Letelier was fired from the Copper Office, ostensibly for supporting [[Salvador Allende]]'s unsuccessful [[Chilean presidential election, 1952|second presidential campaign]]. The Letelier family left for [[Venezuela]], where Orlando became a copper consultant for the Finance Ministry.

==Political career==

When he was in the university, Letelier became a student representative at the [[University of Chile]]'s Student Union. In 1959,  he joined the [[Chilean Socialist Party]] (PS).  In 1971, President Allende appointed him [[ambassador]] to the United States. His specific mission was to try to defend the [[Chilean nationalization of copper]] against the previous private ownership favored by the [[US government]].

During 1973, Letelier was recalled to Chile and served successively as minister of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Chile)|Foreign Affairs]], [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Interior]] and [[Ministry of National Defense (Chile)|Defense]].

In the [[Chilean coup of 1973|coup d'état]] of September 11, 1973, he was the first high-ranking member of the Allende administration to be arrested. He was held for twelve months in different concentration camps suffering severe [[torture]]: first at the Tacna Regiment, then at the Military Academy; later he was sent for eight months to a [[political prison]] on [[Dawson Island]] and from there he was transferred to the basement of the Air Force War Academy, and finally to the concentration camp of Ritoque, until international diplomatic pressure, especially from [[Diego Arria]], then Governor of Distrito Federal of [[Venezuela]], resulted in the sudden release of Letelier on the condition that he immediately leave Chile.

After his release in September 1974, he and his family resettled in [[Caracas]], but then Letelier decided to head for [[United States]], at the proposal of American writer [[Saul Landau]].

In 1975, Letelier moved to [[Washington D.C.]] where he became senior fellow of the Washington, D.C.-based [[Institute for Policy Studies]], where Landau worked at the time. Letelier became director of the [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]]-based [[Transnational Institute]], and taught at the [[School of International Service]] of the [[American University]], in Washington, D.C. Letelier wrote several articles criticizing the "[[Chicago Boys]]", a group of South American economists trained at the [[University of Chicago]] by [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Arnold Harberger]] who went to their home countries to promote and advise leaders on the benefits of a [[Market economy|free-market economy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Letelier, Orlando. "The Chicago Boys in Chile: Economic Freedom's Awful Toll", ''The Nation'' 223, no. 28 (1976): 137-42.
&lt;/ref&gt;

This was used to great effect in Chile where General Pinochet looked to remove a socialist economic system and replace it with a free market economy. Letelier believed that in a resource driven economy such as Chile, allowing markets to operate freely simply guaranteed the shift of wealth from the lower and middle classes to the monopolists and financial speculators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He soon became the leading voice of the [[Chilean resistance]], preventing several loans (especially from Europe) from being awarded to the Chilean government. On September 10, 1976, he was deprived of his Chilean nationality by decree.

==Assassination==

Moffit's husband, Michael Moffitt, was injured but survived. Several people were [[prosecute]]d and [[conviction (law)|convicted]] for the murder. Among them were [[Michael Townley]], a U.S. [[expatriate]] working for [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], General [[Manuel Contreras]], former head of the DINA, and Brigadier [[Pedro Espinoza]], also formerly of DINA. Townley was convicted in the United States in 1978 and served 62 months in prison for the murder;&lt;ref&gt;Freudenheim, Milt and Roberts, Katherine [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/weekinreview/the-world-chilean-admits-role-in-76-murder.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Michael%20V.%20Townley&amp;st=cse "Chilean Admits Role in '76 Murder"] ''The New York Times'', 8 February 1987; retrieved 20 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; he is now free as a participant in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program]]. Contreras and Espinoza were convicted in Chile in 1993.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

General [[Augusto Pinochet]], who died on December 10, 2006, was never brought to trial for the murders, despite evidence implicating him as having ordered them. Following the assassination, the United States cut military aid to Chile, and took a stance of 'unobtrusiveness' within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chile's Return to Democracy|last=Constable|first=Pamela|last2=Valenzuela|first2=Arturo|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|year=1988|page=186}}&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Following the death of Pinochet in December 2006, the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] (IPS), for which both Letelier and Moffitt worked, called for the release of all the classified documents related to the Letelier–Moffitt assassination.

According to the IPS, the [[Clinton administration]] de-classified more than 16,000 documents related to Chile, but withheld documents related to the Letelier-Moffitt assassination in Washington on the grounds that they were associated with an ongoing investigation. The IPS says that the Clinton administration did re-activate the investigation into the Letelier-Moffitt murders and sent agents to Chile to gather additional evidence that Pinochet had authorized the crime. The former Chilean Secret Police Chief, Manuel Contreras, who, was convicted for his role in the crime in 1993, later pointed the finger at his superiors, claiming that all relevant orders came from Pinochet.

==Subsequent disclosures==
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}
A [[US State Department]] document made available by the [[National Security Archive]] on 10 April 2010 reveals that a [[démarche]] protesting Pinochet's [[Operation Condor]] assassination program was proposed and sent on 23 August 1976 to [[US diplomatic missions]] in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] to be delivered to their host governments but later rescinded on 16 September 1976 by [[Henry Kissinger]], following concerns raised by US ambassadors assigned there of both personal safety and a likely diplomatic contretemps. Five days later, the Letelier assassination took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Docs Show Kissinger Rescinded Warning on Assassinations Days Before Letelier Bombing in DC|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/4/12/new_docs_show_kissinger_rescinded_warning|quote=[A senior analyst at the National Security Archive, Peter Kornbluh, noted] Then you have the US ambassador in Chile saying, basically, well, Pinochet's feelings will be hurt and he'll be insulted if I tell him ... that we think that he's involved in international assassinations. I think that that's not a very good idea...give me further instructions. And you had our ambassador--these are some other documents that we've recently obtained through the FOIA--our ambassador in Uruguay, Ernest Siracusa, writes back and says: I'm worried that my life will be in danger if I actually raise this subject here. Why don't you take the security risk in Washington.}}
On 16 September 1976, Henry Kissinger rescinded the démarche order to his staff, and on 20 September 1976 US diplomats were duly informed of the revised directive. The next day, 21 September 1976, Letelier and Moffit were killed in the bomb blast.&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents released in 2015 revealed a CIA report dated April 28, 1978, which showed that the agency by then had knowledge that Pinochet ordered the murders.&lt;ref name=ippppppoint/&gt; The report stated "Contreras told a confidant he authorized the assassination of Letelier on orders from Pinochet."&lt;ref name=ippppppoint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/10/30/bombshell-pinochets-guilt-delivered-too-late-383121.html|title=A BOMBSHELL ON PINOCHET'S GUILT, DELIVERED TOO LATE|date=14 October 2015|publisher=Newsweek|author=Dinges, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A State Department document also referred to eight separate CIA reports from around the same date, each sourced to "extremely sensitive informants" who provided evidence of Pinochet's direct involvement in ordering the assassination and in directing the subsequent cover-up.&lt;ref name=ippppppoint/&gt;

During the tenure of [[Richard Downie]] at the [[William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies]], a [[U.S. Southern Command]]  educational institution located at the [[National Defense University]], the alleged (and as yet unproven) role of Jaime Garcia Covarrubias, a Chilean professor who worked in the 1970s for the DINA, in the torture and murder of seven detainees was revealed inside the Center. His alleged role was first brought to Downie's attention in early 2008 by Center Assistant Professor [[Martin Edwin Andersen]], a senior staff member who earlier, as a senior advisor for policy planning at the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, was the first national security whistleblower to receive the U.S. Office of Special Counsel's "Public Servant Award."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://progressive.org/dispatches/no-good-deed-unpunished-whistleblower-martin-edwin-andersen-180713 |title= No Good Deed Goes Unpunished: The Story of Whistleblower Martin Edwin Andersen |work= progressive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 1987 investigative report in [[The Nation]], Andersen broke the story of how, in a June 1976 meeting in the Hotel Carrera in Santiago, Kissinger gave the bloody military junta in neighboring Argentina the "green light" for their own dirty "war." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 4 March 2016| first=Martin Edwin |last=Andersen | title = How Much Did the US Know About the Kidnapping, Torture, and Murder of Over 20,000 People in Argentina? |work= The Nation |url= http://www.thenation.com/article/how-much-did-the-us-know-about-the-kidnapping-torture-and-murder-of-over-20000-people-in-argentina/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brawl occurred between players of the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine]] and [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australian]] men's national basketball teams during a match held on July 2, 2018 at the [[Philippine Arena]] in [[Bocaue]], [[Bulacan]], Philippines. The match was part of the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)|2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualification]] process.

The brawl caused a disruption of the game in the third quarter lasting more than 30 minutes. Officials suspended 4 Australian players and 9 Filipino players and the game was briefly resumed. All but one of the three remaining Filipino players intentionally fouled out prematurely, ending the game within the same quarter. The Philippines lost by default in favour of Australia.

FIBA imposed sanctions on both sides; game suspensions were given to 10 Filipino players (for a maximum of 6 games) and 3 Australian players (maximum of 5 games). The Philippines' head coach and assistant coach were also sanctioned. Both the national federations of the Philippines and Australia were fined. The three referees who officiated at the match were also suspended for a year. Despite the brawl, both Australia and the Philippines advance to the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers.

The Philippine national team is obliged to play their next home match in the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers behind closed doors with the succeeding two home games being placed under probation. The brawl also played a part in their withdrawal from the [[Basketball at the 2018 Asian Games – Men's tournament|2018 Asian Games]], a decision which was later reversed.

==Background==
===Road to 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup===
For the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup]], members of [[FIBA Asia]] and [[FIBA Oceania]] confederations participated in one qualification process.
For the first round of the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)|joint Asia and Oceania qualifiers]], the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippines]] and [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] were drawn part of Group B along with [[Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team|Chinese Taipei]] and [[Japan men's national basketball team|Japan]].

The Philippines and Australia first played against each other in the qualifiers in [[Melbourne]]. The home side, Australia won over the visitors 84–68. Prior to the start of their second face off, this time in [[Bocaue]], Philippines, the two teams has already qualified for the second round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers.

The last FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifier match of the Philippines prior to their second match-up against Australia was against Chinese Taipei away from home. They won the game by 22 points. The Philippines decided to retain 10 players from the Chinese Taipei game for their next match replacing [[Jio Jalalon]] and [[Allein Maliksi]] with [[Baser Amer]] and [[Carl Bryan Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lintag |first1=Paul |title=Amer added to Gilas for Australia rematch |url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/basketball/news/2018/07/01/fiba-amer-added-gilas-australia-rematch-43779 |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia suffered a 78-79 defeat to Japan prior to their second Philippines game but decided to retain the 12 players in their roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zarate |first1=Noel |title=Australia to use same lineup in Japan loss against Gilas |url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/gilas/story/_/id/23968195/australia-use-same-lineup-japan-loss-gilas |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=ESPN |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed door practice===
There were already tensions between the Australian and Philippine side prior to the start of the brawl-marred game.&lt;ref name="naredo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=FIBA World Cup: After bench-clearing brawl, Gilas loses by default to Australia |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/02/18/fiba-world-cup-after-bench-clearing-brawl-gilas-loses-by-default-to-australia |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the closed-door practice by the Australia national team on July 1, 2018,&lt;ref name="dioquino"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dioquino |first1=Delfin |title=SBP accepts Australia apology for PH Arena incident |url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/gilas-pilipinas/206296-sbp-accepts-australia-apology-removing-sponsors-decals-philippine-arena |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=Rappler |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australians removed the decals of corporate sponsors [[PLDT]] and [[Chooks-to-Go]] on the court reportedly due to player safety issues. Officials from the Philippines national basketball association, the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]] (SBP) criticized the move stating that the Australians should have asked permission. Philippine head coach [[Chot Reyes]] said that the Australians removed the decals for being slippery and added that the decals were approved to use by FIBA. He also mentioned that SBP and FIBA officials were at the venue. Reyes along with SBP official [[Manny V. Pangilinan]] posted the video of the act through [[Twitter]] expressing displeasure of the move saying that they will "not back down" from the Australians.&lt;ref name="removes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Australians remove PLDT decals from PH Arena court |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/01/18/watch-australians-remove-pldt-decals-from-ph-arena-court |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia apologized for the incident and the SBP accepted the apology. The SBP however maintained that the actions of the Australian side were unacceptable. The decals were restored two hours prior to tip-off.&lt;ref name="dioquino"/&gt;

===Pre-game confrontations===
During the pre-game warm-ups, Philippine players began crowding onto the Australian half of the court. [[Calvin Abueva]], a member of the Philippine national basketball team, attempted to trip Australian player Daniel Kickert who countered back by pushing and shoving another member of the Philippine basketball team whom he mistook for Abueva. A short confrontation between the two teams resulted thereafter which had to be defused by the referees before the start of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/basketball/video-shows-pregame-incident-sparked-philippines-brawl/news-story/4909ca06a912a0d6d1c4a7d57346b81e|title=What really sparked brawl madness|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abueva admitted to trying to trip Kickert but insisted that the Australians were already 'bullying' them even before he did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.spin.ph/basketball/fiba/abueva-admits-tripping-kickert-but-insists-sila-nagsimula-a2437-20180704?ref=site_search|title = Abueva admits tripping Kickert but insists: 'Sila nagsimula'|date =July 4, 2018|accessdate = July 8, 2018|website = [[Sports Interactive Network Philippines|Spin]]|publisher = |last = Leongson|first = Randolph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match details==
The Australians dominated the match, outscoring the Philippines in all three quarters played. The host was competitive against the visitors in the first quarter until Australia gained a 9-point lead by second quarter. The Philippines never recovered as Australia later achieved a double-digit lead against the hosts. [[Chris Goulding]] led the Australians in the scoring by contributing 20 points while [[Andray Blatche]] led the Philippines with 12 points.&lt;ref name="gilasloses"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lintag |first1=Paul |title=Gilas loses to Australia by default after fight-marred game |url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/basketball/news/2018/07/02/fiba-gilas-loses-aus-default-fight-marred-game-43830 |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three referees who officiated the match were Ahmed Al Bulushi of Oman, Hatim Alharbi of Saudi Arabia and Paul Skayem of Lebanon. Jordanian official Fadi Adnan As’Ad Sabbah was the FIBA game commissioner.&lt;ref name=reffire&gt;{{cite news |last1=Henson |first1=Joaquin |title=Refs under fire for losing control |url=https://www.philstar.com/sports/2018/07/04/1830471/refs-under-fire-losing-control |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=The Philippine Star |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines was trailing 48–79 when the brawl began.

The brawl caused a 30-minute stoppage of the match.&lt;ref name="sbs"&gt;{{cite news |title='Sickening': Australia's Boomers in wild qualifier brawl with Philippines |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/sickening-australia-s-boomers-in-wild-qualifier-brawl-with-philippines |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=SBS News |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referees along with security officials left the court and went to the [[OB Van]] of [[ESPN 5]] outside the arena, which was covering the match, to review the brawl from different camera angles. They returned to the court to announce sanctions.&lt;ref name=reffire/&gt;

Match officials ruled that 13 players should be ejected before play was resumed. Officials [[Ejection (sports)|ejected]] four Australian players&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt; and nine Filipino players&lt;ref name=dioquino2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dioquino |first1=Delfin |title=Gilas loses to Australia by default in World Cup Qualifiers |url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/gilas-pilipinas/206321-philippines-australia-game-july-2-2018 |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=Rappler |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This meant that the Philippine national team was left with only three players. The match was resumed despite this since FIBA rules state that play should continue as long as both teams have more than one player.&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt;  [[June Mar Fajardo]], [[Gabe Norwood]] and [[Baser Amer]] were the only Philippine players to remain. Fajardo intentionally [[Foul out (basketball)|fouled out]] and was followed by Norwood leaving Amer as the last Filipino player on the court&lt;ref name="philstar"/&gt; to prematurely end the game with one minute and fifty-seven seconds remaining in the third quarter.&lt;ref name="gilasloses"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
The Philippines lost [[Forfeit (sport)|by default]] due to a lack of eligible players because of the ejection of nine of its players and the remaining players intentionally fouling out. The result of the Philippines-Australia game was allowed to stand. The Philippines ended its first round campaign with four wins and two defeats, both against Australia, settling for second place in Group B while Australia lost only one of its six games topping the group. Both teams advanced to the second round of the qualifiers.&lt;ref name=dioquino2/&gt;

Fearing for their own safety, the Australia national team remained in the Philippine Arena for several hours after the match. They also changed hotels following the game.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKern |first1=James |title=Video shows pre-game incident sparked Philippines brawl |url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/basketball/video-shows-pregame-incident-sparked-philippines-brawl/news-story/4909ca06a912a0d6d1c4a7d57346b81e |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=News.com.au |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basketball Australia]] apologized for the brawl, accepting the Australia national team's role in the incident but expressing concern for the involvement of officials and fans in the fight.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Basketball Australia apologises for Boomers 'unsavoury' brawl with Philippines, says players 'bruised and battered' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-03/boomers-left-bruised-and-battered-after-brawl-in-philippines/9934478 |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=ABC.net |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]] apologized to Filipino fans and to the international basketball community for the brawl saying that the incident "breached the bounds of traditional Filipino hospitality" and asserting that "violence has no place in sports".&lt;ref name="sbpsorry"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Saldajeno |first1=Ivan |title=SBP says sorry after it "breached the bounds of traditional Filipino hospitality" |url=https://www.dugout.ph/2018/07/sbp-says-sorry-after-it-breached-bounds.html |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=Dugout Philippines |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both federations later issued a joint statement apologizing for the brawl and admitting full responsibility for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SBP, Basketball Australia apologize for Gilas-Boomers ‘basketbrawl’ |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/659321/sbp-basketball-australia-apologize-for-gilas-boomers-basketbrawl/story/ |accessdate=July 9, 2018 |work=GMA News |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other reactions====
Australia's [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] on their part said while the Australia national team should accept consequences regarding the brawl, they also condemned players, officials, and fans of the Philippine national team, stating what happened to the Australian side following the brawl is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bacnis |first1=Justine |title=Aussie league NBL condemns Boomers actions, Filipino fans |url=https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/aussie-league-nbl-condemns-boomers-actions-filipino-fans/120399 |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=Tiebreaker Times |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippine Basketball Association]] on 3 July 2018 invited players of the Philippine national team for a closed-door meeting scheduled on July 5, 2018 to discuss the incident, which could possibly impose its own fines and suspensions to members of the Philippine basketball team who were involved. No similar actions as of late were to be seen from Basketball Australia.&lt;ref name="pbameeting"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bacnis |first1=Justine |title=PBA sets up meeting with Gilas regarding brawl |url=https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/pba-sets-meeting-gilas-regarding-brawl/120361 |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=Tiebreaker Times |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group selfie took by Filipino player Marc Pingris with the rest of the Philippine national team was criticized as insensitive but head coach [[Chot Reyes]] and [[Quinito Henson]] said that based on how they knew Pingris personally that the selfie was an attempt to defuse tension.&lt;ref name=sawit/&gt;&lt;ref name=insensitive/&gt; Reyes said that he would have stopped Pingris from taking the selfie given the circumstances.&lt;ref name=sawit/&gt;

According to Australia head coach [[Andrej Lemanis]], the brawl may cause the [[National Basketball Association]], who is already reluctant to release its players for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers, to hesitate even more about releasing its players for international play short of the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup]] or the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NBA may react badly to Philippines brawl, says Australia coach |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/04/daniel-kickert-admits-his-elbow-in-filipino-basketball-brawl-was-regrettable |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=The Guardian |agency=Australian Associated Press |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Further allegations====
=====Close door practice sabotage=====
After the brawl-marred game, Australia's coach [[Andrej Lemanis]] accused the Philippines of sabotaging his side's training the day before the match. He stated that when the Australian team went to the training venue, one of the courts in the venue had a rim which was "obviously too high" and when officials came to measure the rim it was too high by {{convert|6|to|7|in|cm}}. Lemanis then alleged that the people helping them in the court disappeared from the venue. He added that it was then that it became evident to his team that the court was unsafe to play on because of the way the decals were installed while reiterating Australia's early acknowledgement of not following the "correct process" in removing the decals. Lemanis said they decided to remove the decals due to time constraints caused by their limited practice time.&lt;ref name=sabotage&gt;{{cite news |title=Boomers coach Andrej Lemanis accuses Philippines of sabotaging Australia’s training session |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/boomers-coach-andrej-lemanis-accused-philippines-of-sabotaging-australias-training-session/news-story/63f83b1fc0d52b2286f09e658102839b |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=Fox Sport |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Racism=====
Alleged incidents of [[racism]] were raised after the brawl. Winston Baltasar, a Filipino freelance photographer covering the event, alleged that Australian players had used [[racial slurs]] [[Anti-Filipino sentiment|against Filipinos]] during an interview at ''The Ticket'', a radio program of Australia's [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. He said that Filipino players had been called "monkeys". The Australian Basketballers' Association and Basketball Australia issued a joint statement calling Baltasar's remarks as "unsubstantiated and highly defamatory" and expressed disappointment with ABC's decision to publish material relating to the remark. In an earlier interview on ''SportsCenter Philippines'', Philippine coach [[Chot Reyes]] said that he hadn't heard any incident of Australian players hurling derogatory remarks towards their Filipino counterparts during the half-time of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Basketball Australia issues statement on allegation |url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/gilas/story/_/id/24039686/basketball-australia-issues-statement-allegation |accessdate=July 9, 2018 |work=ESPN5 |date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
[[FIBA]] opened disciplinary proceedings against both Australia and the Philippines following the brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Philippines v Australia basketball: Mass brawl at World Cup qualifier |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/basketball/44688264 |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee of the match submitted statements and presented evidence to FIBA regarding the match and the brawl&lt;ref name="fibaaskms"&gt;{{cite news |title=FIBA asks Gilas PH to explain side |url=http://manilastandard.net/sports/basketball/269698/fiba-asks-gilas-ph-to-explain-side.html |accessdate=6 July 2018 |work=Manila Standard |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both the basketball federations of Australia and the Philippines were given video copies recording the incident. Both the Australian and Philippine federation were asked by FIBA to submit their own positions stating their sides regarding the brawl by July 10, 2018 but the deadline was later extended to midnight of July 13, 2018 ([[GMT+6]]).&lt;ref name=extend&gt;{{cite news |last1=Terrado |first1=Jonas |title=FIBA extends deadline for SBP, Basketball Australia |url=https://sports.mb.com.ph/2018/07/12/fiba-extends-deadline-for-sbp-basketball-australia/ |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |work=Manila Bulletin |date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions===
Prior to the imposition of sanctions by FIBA, [[Al Panlilio]] of Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) expressed hope that FIBA would view the incident as an isolated case and not affect the hosting rights of the Philippines for the [[2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup]]. He also expected that both federations of Australia and the Philippines would be fined and that it would be a surprise if FIBA would choose to impose indefinite suspensions of the respective basketball federations of Australia and the Philippines. He pointed to [[2010 Acropolis International Basketball Tournament|the incident]] between [[Serbia men's national basketball team|Serbia]] and [[Greece men's national basketball team|Greece]] in 2010 as a precedent for his expectation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Galvez |first1=Waylon |title=Panlilio hopes Gilas-Boomers brawl won’t affect 2023 FIBA World Cup PH hosting |url=https://sports.mb.com.ph/2018/07/04/panlilio-hopes-gilas-boomers-brawl-wont-affect-2023-fiba-world-cup-ph-hosting/ |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=Manila Bulletin |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July, FIBA handed down their decision after conducting disciplinary investigation. 10 players from the Philippine basketball team, its coach [[Chot Reyes]] and assistant coach [[Jong Uichico]], as well as 3 players from Australia were given suspension from playing future games in the qualifiers (six games maximum).&lt;ref name=handsout&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/gilas/story/_/id/24002291/fiba-hands-sanctions-gilas-boomers-brawl|title=FIBA hands out sanctions over Gilas-Boomers brawl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reyes was suspended for a single match while Uichico was suspended for three games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=James |title=Players, coaches and referees banned after mass brawl in FIBA World Cup qualifier |url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1067672/players-coaches-and-referees-banned-after-mass-brawl-in-fiba-world-cup-qualifier |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=Inside the Games |date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the SBP, FIBA was clear that the ban imposed on the Philippine players does not apply to the national team's planned participation in the [[Basketball at the 2018 Asian Games|2018 Asian Games]] in Indonesia, as well as their participation with their respective teams in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], and that the match suspensions are to served in the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers.&lt;ref name="asiangamessanc"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=SBP assures FIBA sanctions won’t apply to Asian Games |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/19/18/sbp-assures-fiba-sanctions-wont-apply-to-asian-games |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines played their next home court match [[Behind closed doors (sport)|behind closed doors]] (against Qatar on September 17, at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Quezon City]], with media coverage{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}), while a ban for two more home games as the country have been placed under a probationary period of three years. However, Samahang Basketball ng Pilipinas executive director Sonny Barrios stated if the behind-closed-doors game went well, the homecourt game ban can be possibly lifted and will be open for fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/20/18/fiba-world-cup-ph-hoops-exec-saddened-to-lose-6th-man-in-closed- FIBA World Cup: Philippine hoops exec saddened to lose 6th man in closed door game] [[ABS-CBN News]] Accessed July 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The country's co-hosting of the [[2023 FIBA World Cup]] is not affected by the sanctions.&lt;ref name=handsout/&gt;

The three referees who officiated the brawl-marred match also faced immediate removal from the FIBA Elite Program and suspension from officiating international competitions sanctioned or organized by FIBA for 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Referees in Gilas Pilipinas-Australia Boomers brawl banned for a year |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2018/07/19/Gilas-Pilipinas-Australia-Boomers-brawl-referees-one-year.html |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=CNN Philippines |date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact===
====Philippines' Asian Games participation====
The brawl played a part in the Philippines' withdrawal from the [[Basketball at the 2018 Asian Games|basketball competition of the 2018 Asian Games]]. Before the brawl incident, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) planned to send a national team composed of the core of the [[TNT KaTropa]] of the Philippine Basketball Association. However such plan was cancelled after several players of the ball club along with naturalized player Andray Blatche got involved in the brawl. Though the player suspensions has no bearing in the Asian Games since the sanctions will be served in the next round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers, the SBP decided not to include any of players suspended due to the brawl in the Philippines' Asian Games roster.&lt;ref name="clarkson"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=Clarkson included in Gilas line-up, but will he play in Asian Games? |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/24/18/clarkson-included-in-gilas-line-up-but-will-he-play-in-asian-games |accessdate=July 27, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan was devised to send a national team composed of the core of the [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]] instead of TNT with [[NLEX Road Warriors]] coach Yeng Guiao to mentor the team. The Philippine Basketball Association officially announced the participation of Rain or Shine in the Asian Games on July 26, 2018 with the SBP declaring on the same day that the Philippine national team's withdrawal from the continental games saying that it and the national team intends "regroup, prepare for the process of appealing the FIBA Disciplinary Panel's recent decision, and aim for sustainable success in future tournaments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sarmenta |first1=Yoyo |title=SBP withdraws national basketball team from Asian Games |url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/24199532/sbp-withdraws-national-basketball-team-asian-games |accessdate=July 27, 2018 |work=ESPN 5 |date=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to withdraw was reversed on August 5, 2018 due to "clamor from fans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Manglinong|first=Dan |title=Gilas Pilipinas will compete in 2018 Asian Games after clamor against withdrawal |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/gilas-pilipinas-will-compete-in-2018-asian-games-after-clamor-against-withdrawal/ |accessdate=August 10, 2018 |work=InterAksyon |date=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the 1939 film|Poison Pen (film)}}

A '''poison pen letter''' is a [[Letter (message)|letter]] or note containing unpleasant, [[abuse|abusive]], or [[:wikt:malicious|malicious]] statements or accusations about the recipient or a third party. It is usually sent [[anonymity|anonymously]]. In the term "poison pen", the word [[poison]] is used [[Poison#Figurative use|figuratively]], rather than literally. Poison pen letters are usually composed and sent to upset the recipient. They differ from [[blackmail]], which is intended to obtain something from the recipient. In contrast, poison pen letters are purely malicious.

In the [[United Kingdom]], Section 1 of the [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]] covers most cases of poison pen letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/#an13|title=Communications Offences: Legal Guidance|date=7 November 2013|publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]]|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Princess Hermine of [[Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym]]''' ({{lang-de|Prinzessin Hermine Amalie Marie von Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym}}; 2 December 1797 in [[Hoym, Germany]] &amp;ndash; 14 September 1817 in [[Budapest, Hungary]]) was by birth a princess of the [[House of Ascania]] and by marriage an [[Archduchess of Austria]].

==Family==
She was the eldest daughter of [[Victor II, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym]], and Princess [[Amelia of Nassau-Weilburg]]. Hermine had three younger sisters: Adelheid, Emma, and Ida.

She was married 30 August 1815 at [[Schaumburg Castle, Rhineland-Palatinate|Schaumburg Castle]]. The princess was just 17 years old when she married the 39-year-old archduke.

'''Psychological torture''' is a type of [[torture]] that relies primarily on [[psychological]] effects, and only secondarily on any physical harm inflicted. Although not all psychological torture involves the use of physical violence, there is a continuum between psychological torture and physical torture. The two are often used in conjunction with one another, and often overlap in practice, with the fear and [[pain]] induced by physical torture often resulting in long-term psychological effects, and many forms of psychological torture involving some form of pain or coercion.

The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (commonly known as the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]]) is an [[International human rights instruments |international human rights treaty]], under the review of the [[United Nations]], that aims to prevent [[torture]] and other acts of [[cruel and unusual punishment |cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment]] around the world. The Convention requires states to take effective measures to prevent torture in any state under their [[jurisdiction]], and forbids states to transport people to any country where there is reason to believe torture could occur.&lt;ref&gt; [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "White Paper "The Rule of Law and Psychological Torture: Absence of a Legal Defininion, Prospects and Problem", in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform"], edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Convention was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 December 1984&lt;ref name="untc"&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection: [http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]. Retrieved on 13 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and, following ratification by the 20th state party, it came into force on 26 June 1987. 26 June is now recognized as the [[International Day in Support of Victims of Torture]], in honor of the Convention. As of May 2015, the Convention has 158 state parties.

The Convention gave for the first time in history a definition of psychological torture:

{{quote|Torture is any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx|title=Convention against Torture|date=10 December 1984|work=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Optional Protocol to such Convention (OPCAT, 2006) is an important addition to the United Nations Convention. The Committee Against Torture (CAT) is a body of independent experts that monitors implementation of the Convention by State parties. All State parties are obliged under the Convention to submit regular reports to the CAT on how the rights are being implemented. Upon ratifying the Convention, States must submit a report within one year, after which they are obliged to report every four years. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations". Under certain circumstances, the CAT may consider complaints or communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Convention have been violated. The CAT usually meets in May and November each year in Geneva.

Many forms of psychological torture methods attempt to destroy the subject's normal [[self-image]] by removing them from any kind of control over their environment, creating a state of [[learned helplessness]], [[psychological regression]] and [[depersonalization]]. Other techniques include forced [[nudity]] and [[head shaving]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[hooding]] and other forms of [[sensory deprivation]].

A strictly fear-inducing method is the [[mock execution]]. Various threats operate on the same fear-inducing principle.

Another method is indirect torture, in which a victim is forced to witness the torture of another person, often a loved one. This preys on the victim's affection for and loyalty to a partner, relative, friend, comrade-in-arms etc, whose real pain induces vicarious suffering in the targeted psychological victim, who is thus loaded with guilt but spared physical harm that might affect his or her ability to comply.

While psychological torture may not leave any lasting physical damage—indeed, this is often one of the motivations for using psychological rather than physical torture—it can result in similar levels of permanent mental damage to its victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11313-psychological-torture-as-bad-as-physical-torture.html|title=Psychological torture 'as bad as physical torture'|author=Roxanne Khamsi|publisher=New Scientist|date=5 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been alleged that some psychological torture methods may have been devised by, or in conjunction with, doctors and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2008/02/psychological_tortur.html|title=Psychological torture: a CIA history|publisher=Mind Hacks|date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] has been accused of making extensive use of psychological torture techniques at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] and other sites subsequent to the [[9/11]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;John Hickman. 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15287">'''Aelianus''' (P. Aelius Aelianus) was a senior officer in the Roman Army in the mid-Third Century AD who rose from relatively lowly origins to become the prefect of a legion under the Emperor [[Gallienus]] He was one of the earliest beneficiaries of Gallienus’s policy that effectively excluded senators from army commands in favour of career-soldiers of equestrian rank. His later life is obscure.

He was possibly ''procurator'' (i.e. Chief Financial Officer) of Epirus in the late-260s, but the foremost authorities query this identification. However, there are stronger grounds for believing that he was appointed a ''praeses'' (provincial governor of equestrian rank) in ''[[Africa Province|Africa]]'', most likely under the Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]].

==Sources==

The sum total of our knowledge of this man derives from five epigraph inscriptions from:

(a) A fragment of an epigraphic inscription from ''Poetovio'' (now [[Pluj]] in [[Slovenia]]) that indicates that one ''AEL...I'' (presumed to be Aelianus) commanded ''vexillationes'' (detachments) of the four legions of ''[[Pannonia]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1934|223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;;

(b)	A sarcophagus dedicated by one Aelianus to the memory of his parents found at Obuda, a district of modern [[Budapest]] on the west bank of the [[River Danube]] which was the site of ''[[Aquincum]] Castrum'', ''Pannonia Inferior'', the base of ''[[Legio II Adiutrix]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|3|3529}}.&lt;/ref&gt;;

(c)	An altar dedicated one Aelianus to ''Herculi Augusti'' - i.e. to the Majestic [[Hercules]] - from Szentendre, the site of ''Ulcisia Castra'' an [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] fortress 12&amp;nbsp;km north of ''Aquincum'';&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1965|9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

(d)	A stone from ''Photike'' in the Roman province of ''Epirus'', nowadays a province of Greece;&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1915|74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and

(e)   A stone from [[Zucchabar]] in [[Algeria]], in the Roman province of ''Mauritania Caesaensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|8|21486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last four of these inscriptions are analysed in great detail by T. Nagy.&lt;ref name=Nagy &gt;{{cite book |title=Commanders of Legions in the Age of Gallienus |last=Nagy |first= Prof. T.|year=1965 |publisher=Acta Archeologica Academiae Scientarum Hungaricae, Tm. XVII|location=Budapest }}&lt;/ref&gt; This article largely reflects Prof. Nagy’s findings and conclusions.

==Origins==

It is likely that Aelianus was born at ''Aquincum'' in ''[[Pannonia Inferior]]'' which, as noted above, was the base of ''Legio II Adiutrix''. His father was [[Martialis (P. Aelius)]] who had been a ''Custos Armorum'' (i.e. Warden of the Armoury) of ''Legio II'' (obviously he was described as ''ex custode armorum'' - i.e.'formerly Warden etc.' on his tomb) and his mother Fl. Agathe.

The ''gentilicum 'Aelius''' suggests that the family was either descended from one of the settlers who arrived in Pannonia in the century after the Roman conquest or from one of many native Pannonian clans that was given Roman citizenship when the future Emperor [[Hadrian]] was governor in the early years of the second century AD (around 106AD).&lt;ref name ="Nagy"/&gt;  If the Aelius ancestor was indeed enfranchised during the reign of Hadrian or his successeor, [[Antoninus Pius]] he would have taken the name of the imperial dynasty as his own ''nomen'' as was the custom of the day. Thus by this interpretation of the onomastics Aelianus’s clan had been Roman citizens for well over 100 years by the time he dedicated his parents’ sarcophagus and possibly more than 150 years and it is likely that the family had had connections with ''Legio II'' for generations.

==Early career==

It can be safely assumed that, as a ''castrensis'' (i.e. 'Son of the Camp' - born of a serving soldier), Aelianus  would have enlisted at the earliest age – i.e. 18-20 – probably in his father’s legion. It is likely that he would have risen ''ex caliga'' – i.e. 'from the ranks of those who wear hobnailed sandals' (the footwear of legionary rankers).&lt;ref name ="Nagy" /&gt; However, given that patronage and influence were major determinants (often the major determinants) of advancement in the Roman Army, it is not unreasonable to suppose that, as the son of a ''principalis'', Aelianus would have enjoyed some advantages ''vis-à-vis'' his fellow-recruits that would have helped promote his career.

Nevertheless, the inscriptions cited make it clear beyond all doubt that Aelianus showed himself a highly capable soldier and probably a lucky one as well who prospered in the conditions of crisis that prevailed on Rome’s northern frontiers in the middle years of the Third Century AD.

Although he probably enlisted in ''Legio II'' and certainly commanded it at a high point of his career, he is unlikely to have served solely with that legion. Like many of the soldiers who rose to prominence in his era, it seems safer to postulate that he rose through the centurionate receiving progressively more senior postings in different legions before he achieved ''primipilaris'' status (i.e. had been promoted ''[[primus pilus]]'' of a legion and had served a year at that rank) and then continued his career as an equestrian officer.&lt;ref&gt;For the career paths of centurions see {{cite book |title=The Imperial Roman Army pp 43-5|last=Le Bohec| first=Yann |authorlink = Yann Le Bohec|year=2000 |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably after achieving equestrian rank as a ''primipilaris'' he had gone on to command ''[[vexillationes]]'' as a ''praepositus'' and had then been promoted to the rank of ''Praefectus Legionis'' - formerly ''Praefectus Castrorum Legionis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dobson, B.|title= The significance of the Centurion and 'Primipilaris'|journal = ANWR II 1|year = 1974|pages = 393–434}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that he ever served as ''tribunus'' of ''cohortes'' of the Rome garrison often a prelude to ducal commands and equestrian governorships.

==Apogée in the Balkans==

The first Aelianus inscription cited above is incomplete, but it mentions an ''AELI...'' ''V E, DUX'' as the commander of detachments drawn from the four legions of the Pannonian provinces at ''Poetovio'', a highly strategic fortress commanding the approaches to Italy through the Julian Alps. Whether or not this man is to be identified with P. Aelius Aelianus, the subject of this paper, is uncertain. Prof. Nagy and Jones ''et al.'' did not make the connection. However, Fitz believed that they were one and the same person).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Age of Pannonia (AD 193-284). |last=Fitz |first=J. (Trans. Ikdiko Varga, revised George L. Duncan)|year=1982 |publisher=Athenaeum Printing House |location=Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitz also suggests that the inscription should be dated to the period 262-4 AD - i.e he was put in post in 262 after the expulsion of the [[Roxolani]] who had ravaged ''Illyricum'' after they had defeated and killed the usurper [[Regalianus]] and removed when he was made ''Praefectus legionis'' at ''Aquincum'' in 264&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Fitz's supposition that the Aelianus referred to was the P. Aelius Aelianus identified in the later inscriptions seems plausible, partly because: (i) it seems highly unlikely that there would have been two very senior officers of that name commissioning lapidary inscriptions in ''Pannonia'' within a very short period yet making no attempt to differentiate themselves from each other; and (ii) the ''Poetovio'' posting seems a highly probable career move for a man who was soon to be re-manifested as one of Gallienus's legionary prefects.

As the ''Praefectus Legionis II Adiutricis'' referred to on the ''Aquincum'' sarcophagus of [[Martialis]] and his wife Fl. Agathe(a), Aelianus is likely to have been one of the earliest beneficiaries of Gallienus’s policy of excluding senators from army commands in favour of professional equestrian officers who would, more often than not, have risen from the ranks. Nagy argues that, as a non-senator, Aelianus would not have been given this posting prior to the Persian captivity in 260 AD of Gallienus’s father and senior Augustus, the Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]. The measures that opened the legionary commands to equestrian officers were taken by Gallienus during his sole reign - possibly in 261 AD. Nor could Aelianus have been given the command after 267 in which year Valerius Marcellinus was in command of ''Legio II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{{CIL|3|3525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagy is inclined to ascribe Aelianus's promotion to the earlier part of this five year ’window’.

The ''Ulcisia'' altar describes the dedicator, P. Aelius Aelianus, as prefect of the Second legion, thus confirming that he was the same man as the one who had commissioned the sarcophagus of Martialis and Fl. Agathe. It adds the additional information that he was ''protector nostri augusti Gallieni'' – i.e. 'Protector of Our Majestic Lord Gallienus'. He was, thus, one of the earliest known recipients of that title. However, that the honorific should refer to 'Our Majestic Gallienus' rather than to 'Our Majestic Lords' (i.e. Valerian and Gallienus) as in the case of [[L. Petronius Taurus Volusianus]] shows that the inscription can be dated to the period of Gallienus's sole reign, but in the early part of that period when the honour was still awarded to senior officers rather than centurions as was later the case.(See ''[[Protectores Augusti Nostri]]''. His membership of the ''Protectores nostril augusti Gallieni'' also suggests that when he commanded ''Leg. II Adjutrix'' that legion was brigaded with the Imperial field-army (''[[Comitatenses|comitatus]]'') rather than serving with the provincial garrison of ''[[Pannonia Inferior]]'' - its usual station during High Empire period&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|last=Christol|first=M.|title=La carriere de Traianus Mucianus et l'origine des ''protectores''|journal=Chiron|volume=7|pages=393–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

More important, perhaps, the inscription indicates that he was ''praefectus legionis agens vice legati'' – i.e. 'Prefect of the Legion acting on behalf of the (senatorial) legate' who we know was never to be appointed. However, the use of this terminology - presumably a formula to ensure that the prefect had the legal authority of a legate - seems to throw doubt on the proposition advanced by many historians &lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite book |last=Bray|first=John|title=Gallienus: A study in reformist and sexual politics|year= 1997|publisher= Wakefield Press|location=Adelaide}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Gallienus had always intended the removal of senators from legionary commands as a permanent reform as opposed to an expedient resorted to in the crisis following the captivity of Valerian that was never reversed. In other words, it suggests Aurelius Victor was mistaken when he said that Gallienus had issued an edict incorporating the change in law.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelius Victor: De Caesaribus 37.6&lt;/ref&gt; If such a law had been promulgated the formula ''agens vices legati'' would surely have been superfluous. Recent scholarship has suggested that the real purpose of Gallienus's Edict was not to exclude senators from army appointments - otherwise why did he continue to appoint senatorial provincial governors with supreme military authority within their ''provinciae''(?) - but to make it possible for the Emperor to appoint equestrian officers to these positions thus broadening his powers choice at a time when the Empire was under particular pressure to find commanders with adequate military experience.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see:{{cite journal|last=Malcus|first=B.|title=Notes sur la revolution du système administratif romaine au III siècle|journal=Opuscula Romana|year=1969|volume=7|pages=213–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==

The ''Photike'' inscription is in Greek and it identifies an 'Aelius Aelianus' as the chief financial officer (''Lat. Procurator'') of the province of ''[[Epirus]]'' sometime in the period 275-80 AD who had previously taken part in the census of the frontier province of ''[[Noricum]]''. It is unlikely that the Aelianus who was a legionary prefect before 266 could have held these offices at a later date as the posts were lower in the equestrian career structure.&lt;ref&gt;Nagy, 1965, ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the work of Brunt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brunt |first1=P. |title=Roman Imperial Themes (Princeps and Equites) |date=1990 |location=London and Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; has thrown doubt on the theory that the Roman [[principate]] ever had a highly-structured equestrian administrative service such as that envisaged by Pflaum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pflaum |first1=Prof H.-G. |title=Les Carrierès Procuratoriennes Équestres sous le Haute-Empire Romaine |date=1960 |publisher=Paris |edition=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others and, in the light of this, it is possible to propose that Aelianus might have gone on from the command of a legion to a ducenarian procuratorship in the later 260s. 

Less controversially, Nagy considered that the 'Aelius Aelianus' who was identified as ''V(ir) P(erfectissimus), praeses provinciae Mauritaniae Caesarensis'' (i.e. 'Best of Men, Governor of the province of ''Mauritania Caesarensis'') in around 276 could well have been the same man as the ''praefectus legionis II'' in Aquincum of a dozen years earlier. It is to be noted that he had by then been elevated to the perfectissimate, the second rank of the equestrian order. Nagy believed that this appointment would have been a promotion quite compatible with theories then current as to the equestrian career structure. Furthermore, it would also fit in with the known tendency to appoint military men to governing posts in ''Africa'' from the later years of the Emperor Probus onwards to deal with increased restlessness on the part of the Berber tribes of the Mauretanian interior. As Nagy observes, the Aelianus whose early experience of independent command had been against  Sarmatian steppe nomads in ''Illyricum'' would have been well qualified to deal with Berber ''razzias'' in Rome’s west African provinces.&lt;ref&gt;See Nagy, ''Op.Cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rank and social status==
As a ''Praefectus legionis vice legati'' Aelianus had been ''egregius'' - i.e. a member of the third grade of the equestrian order - but, as ''Praeses Mauritaniae'', he was a ''perfectissimus''. His promotion in rank had brought with it a promotion in his social status.

In addition it was not considered necessary to use the formula ''agens vice praesidis'' to emphasise that, as an equestrian, his rank as ''praeses'' was only 'acting'. This seems to have been a fairly recent development in the status of equestrian governors who were replacing senators in pro-praetorian provinces. For instance, not many years before in the 260s, as governor of the province of ''Pannonia Inferior'', [[Lucius Flavius Aper]] had only had the status of ''vir egregius'' and the formula ''agens vice praesidis'' had been used to qualify his rank as though it was deemed necessary to emphasise that his governorship was only 'acting'.

In [[operant conditioning]], '''punishment''' is any change in a human or animal's surroundings that occurs after a given behavior or response which reduces the likelihood of that behavior occurring again in the future. As with [[reinforcement]], it is the ''behavior'', not the animal, that is punished. Whether a change is or is not punishing is determined by its effect on the rate that the behavior occurs, not by any "hostile" or [[aversives|aversive]] features of the change. For example, a painful stimulus which would act as a punisher for most people may actually reinforce some behaviors of [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] individuals.

==Types==
{{See also|Operant conditioning}}
There are &lt;!-- basic types or models of punishment? --&gt; two types of punishment in operant conditioning:

*'''positive punishment''', '''punishment by application''', or '''type I punishment''', an experimenter punishes a response by presenting an aversive [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] into the animal's surroundings (a brief electric shock, for example).
*'''negative punishment''', '''punishment by removal''', or '''type II punishment''', a valued, appetitive stimulus is removed (as in the removal of a feeding dish). As with reinforcement, it is not usually necessary to speak of positive and negative in regard to punishment.

Punishment is not a mirror effect of reinforcement. In experiments with laboratory animals and studies with children, punishment decreases the likelihood of a previously reinforced response only temporarily, and it can produce other "emotional" behavior (wing-flapping in pigeons, for example) and physiological changes (increased heart rate, for example) that have no clear equivalents in reinforcement.

Punishment is considered by some behavioral psychologists to be a "primary process" – a completely independent phenomenon of learning, distinct from reinforcement. Others see it as a category of [[negative reinforcement]], creating a situation in which any punishment-avoiding behavior (even standing still) is reinforced.

Positive punishment occurs when a response produces a stimulus and that response decreases in probability in the future 
in similar circumstances.
* Example: A mother yells at a child when he or she runs into the street. If the child stops running into the street, the yelling ceases. The yelling acts as positive punishment because the mother presents (adds) an unpleasant stimulus in the form of yelling.
* Example: A barefoot person walks onto a hot asphalt surface, creating pain, a positive punishment. When the person leaves the asphalt, the pain subsides.  The pain acts as positive punishment because it is the addition of an unpleasant stimulus that reduces the future likelihood of the person walking barefoot on a hot surface.

=== Negative ===
Negative punishment occurs when a response produces the removal of a stimulus and that response decreases in probability in the future in similar circumstances.
* Example: A teenager comes home after curfew and the parents take away a privilege, such as cell phone usage. If the frequency of the child coming home late decreases, the privilege is gradually restored. The removal of the phone is negative punishment because the parents are taking away a pleasant stimulus (the phone) and motivating the child to return home earlier.
* Example: A child throws a temper tantrum because he wants ice cream.  His mother subsequently ignores him, making it less likely the child will throw a temper tantrum in the future when he wants something. The removal of attention from his mother is a negative punishment because a pleasant stimulus (attention) is taken away.

==Versus reinforcement==
Simply put, reinforcers serve to increase behaviors whereas punishers serve to decrease behaviors; thus, positive reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to attain, and negative reinforcers are stimuli that the subject will work to be rid of or to end.&lt;ref name="D'Amato"&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Amato|first=M. R.|title=Learning Processes: Instrumental Conditioning|year=1969|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=Toronto|editor=Melvin H. Marx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below illustrates the adding and subtracting of stimuli (pleasant or aversive) in relation to reinforcement vs. punishment.

|}

==Aversives==
''Aversive stimulus'', ''punisher'', and ''punishing stimulus'' are somewhat synonymous. ''Punishment'' may be used for (a) an aversive stimulus or (b) the occurrence of any punishing change or (c) the part of an experiment in which a particular response is punished. However, some things considered aversive (such as [[spanking]]) can become [[reinforcement|reinforcing]]. In addition, some things that are aversive may not be punishing if accompanying changes are reinforcing. A classic example would be mis-behavior that is 'punished' by a teacher but actually increases over time due to the reinforcing effects of attention on the student.

== Primary versus secondary ==
Pain, loud noises, foul tastes, bright lights, and exclusion are all things that would pass the "caveman test" as an aversive stimulus, and are therefore primary punishers.  The sound of someone booing, the wrong-answer buzzer on a game show, and a ticket on your car windshield are all things you have learned to think about as negative, and are considered secondary punishers.

== Effectiveness ==
Contrary to suggestions by Skinner and others that punishment typically has weak or impermanent effects,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "Science and Human Behavior" (1953)McMIllan, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  a large body of research has shown that it can have a powerful and lasting effect in suppressing the punished behavior. However, it may also have powerful and lasting side effects.  For example, an aversive stimulus used to punish a particular behavior may also elicit a strong emotional response that may suppress unpunished behavior and become associated with situational stimuli through classical conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B, Wasserman, E. A., &amp; Robbins, S. J. "Psychology of Learning and Behavior" (5th Ed) (2002) Norton, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Such side effects suggest caution and restraint in the use of punishment to modify behavior. (Further reading:  {{cite web|last1=Ayotte|first1=R.|last2=Muster|first2=H.|last3=Morais|first3=F.|last4=PheonixEnder|title=Positive and negative reinforcement and punishment effectiveness|url=https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/510/positive-and-negative-reinforcement-and-punishment-effectiveness|website=Cognitive Sciences Stack Exchange|accessdate=10 May 2017|displayauthors=3}})

==Importance of contingency and contiguity==
One variable affecting punishment is [[Contingency (psychology)|contingency]], which is defined as the dependency of events. A behavior may be dependent on a stimulus or dependent on a response. The purpose of punishment is to reduce a behavior, and the degree to which punishment is effective in reducing a targeted behavior is dependent on the relationship between the behavior and a punishment. For example, if a rat receives an aversive stimulus, such as a shock each time it presses a lever, then it is clear that contingency occurs between lever pressing and shock. In this case, the punisher (shock) is contingent upon the appearance of the behavior (lever pressing). Punishment is most effective when contingency is present between a behavior and a punisher. A second variable affecting punishment is [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], which is the closeness of events in time and/or space. Contiguity is important to reducing behavior because the longer the time interval between an unwanted behavior and a punishing effect, the less effective the punishment will be. One major problem with a time delay between a behavior and a punishment is that other behaviors may present during that time delay. The subject may then associate the punishment given with the unintended behaviors, and thus suppressing those behaviors instead of the targeted behavior. Therefore, immediate punishment is more effective in reducing a targeted behavior than a delayed punishment would be.

==Applied behavior analysis==
{{main|Applied behavior analysis}}
Punishment is sometimes used for treatment programs in [[applied behavior analysis]] in the most extreme cases, to reduce dangerous behaviors such as head banging or biting exhibited most commonly by children or people with special needs or disabilities. Punishment is considered one of the [[ethical challenges to autism treatment]] and is one of the major reasons for discussion of professionalizing behavior analysis. Professionalizing behavior analysis through licensure would create a board to ensure that consumers or families had a place to air disputes. (see [[Professional practice of behavior analysis]])

Controversy regarding ABA persists in the autism community. A 2017 study found that 46% of people with autism spectrum undergoing ABA met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the risk of developing it as a result of ABA is more than 86% higher in people with autism spectrum than in non-obese people. type of therapy. According to the researchers, the risk of PTSD was increased when ABA was used regardless of the age of the patient (adults and children were examined).&lt;ref&gt;Henny Kupferstein. Evidence of increased PTSD symptoms in autism exposed to applied behavior analysis . "Advances in Autism". 4 (1), pp. 19-29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

===Psychological manipulation===
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
Braiker identified the following ways that manipulators [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes praise, [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or [[smile]], and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: may involve removing one from a negative situation
* [[Reinforcement#Intermittent reinforcement.3B schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist - for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall.
* [[Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], yelling, the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using [[verbal abuse]], explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

===Traumatic bonding===
{{Main|Traumatic bonding}}
Traumatic bonding occurs as the result of ongoing [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Traumatic Bonding: The development of emotional attachments in battered women and other relationships of intermittent abuse|last = Dutton|first = |date = 1981|journal = Victimology: An International Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Painter|issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson2008"&gt;Chrissie Sanderson.

Around the world, there were stunned '''reactions to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]''', the [[President of the United States]], on November 22, 1963 in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|United Press International|''American Heritage'' Magazine|1964|pp=43, 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first hour after the shooting, before Kennedy's death was announced, was a time of great confusion. Taking place during the [[Cold War]], it was at first unclear whether the shooting might be part of a larger attack upon the U.S., and whether [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who had been riding two cars behind in the motorcade, was safe.

The news shocked the nation. Many people wept openly. Many gathered in public places to watch the television coverage. Traffic in some areas came to a halt as the news spread from car to car, even gathering around cars to listen to radio reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Associated Press|1963|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools across the U.S. dismissed their students early.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Associated Press|1963|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misplaced anger against Texas and Texans was reported from some individuals. Various [[Cleveland Browns]] fans, for example, carried signs at the next Sunday's home game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] decrying the city of Dallas as having "killed the president."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Browns Set Back Cowboys, 27 to 17|date=November 25, 1963|author=Associated Press|newspaper=New York Times|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruby is Regarded a 'Small-Timer'|date=November 25, 1963|first=Joseph A.|last=Loftus|newspaper=New York Times|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there were also instances of Kennedy's opponents cheering the assassination. A journalist reported rejoicing in the streets of Amarillo, with a woman crying out, “Hey, great, JFK’s croaked!”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.texasobserver.org/welcome-to-texas-mr-obama/|title=Welcome to Texas, Mr. Obama|last=Moser|first=Bob|date=2010-08-04|work=The Texas Observer|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event left a [[Flashbulb memory|lasting impression]] on many worldwide. As with the December 7, 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] before it and the [[September 11 attacks]] after it, asking "Where were you when you heard about President Kennedy's assassination" would become a common topic of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brinkley's Beat|first=David|last=Brinkley|location=New York|publisher=Knopf|year=2003|authorlink=David Brinkley|isbn=0-375-40644-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|1965|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Shock Like Pearl Harbor|first=Joseph F.|last=Dinneen|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 24, 1963|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2011/09/01/united-in-remembrance-divided-over-policies/|title=United in Remembrance, Divided over Policies|date=1 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
In the  United States, Kennedy's assassination dissolved differences among many people as they were brought together in one common theme: shock and sorrow after the assassination.&lt;ref name="Reaction"/&gt; It was seen in statements by the former presidents and members of Congress, etc.&lt;ref name=Reaction/&gt; The news was so shocking and hit with such impact;&lt;ref name="Reaction"&gt;{{harvnb|White|1965|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Audimeter Service]], within 40 minutes of the first reporting of the assassination, the television audience doubled, by early evening, 70% were at their television sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|1965|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBS News|CBS]] Washington correspondent [[Roger Mudd]] summed it up: "It was a death that touched everyone instantly and directly; rare was the person who did not cry that long weekend. In our home, as my wife (E.J.) watched the television, her tears caused our five-year-old son, [[Daniel Mudd|Daniel]], to go quietly and switch off of what he thought was the cause of his mother's weeping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The place to be: Washington, CBS, and the glory days of television news|first=Roger|last=Mudd|authorlink=Roger Mudd|location=New York|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58648-576-4|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial ===
The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] had been up 3.31 points (0.5%) for the day, at the moment shots were fired at Kennedy. 40 minutes later, as news of Kennedy's death was breaking, it had already plunged 21.16 points (-2.8%), on very heavy trading volume. With the stock exchange already running 20 minutes behind floor transactions, the Board of Governors of the NYSE announced that they had closed orders for the day. [[NYSE American|AMEX]] and [[List of commodities exchanges#Americas|commodities exchanges]] quickly followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/299145687|title=Stock Markets Close on President's Death|last=UPI|first=|date=1963-11-23|work=Quad-City Times|access-date=2018-05-23|page=15|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first trading day after the assassination, November 26, market averages rebounded sharply, recording the largest gains for any single day in history, and the fourth highest single day trading volume in NYSE history to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/01/1963-trading-volume-highest-in-history-of-stock-exchange.html|title=1963 Trading Volume Highest In History of Stock Exchange|date=1964|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign===
After Kennedy's assassination, many world leaders expressed shock and sorrow, some going on television and radio to address their nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Leaders Voice Sympathy and Shock as Their Countries Mourn President|date=November 23, 1963|newspaper=The New York Times|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|United Press International|''American Heritage'' Magazine|1964|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries around the world, state premiers and governors and mayors also issued messages expressing shock over the assassination. Many of them wondered if the new president, [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]], would carry on many of Kennedy's policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Law Permits 2 Full Terms for Johnson|first=William|last=Moore|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 24, 1963|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; LBJ and the world would sympathize from the "concern etched on Mr. Johnson's face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LBJ Gets [[House of Commons of Canada|Commons]] Tributes|date=January 24, 1973|author=Canadian Press|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, radio and television networks, after breaking the news, either went off the air except for funeral music or broke schedules to carry uninterrupted news of the assassination, and if Kennedy had made a visit to that country, recalled that visit in detail.&lt;ref name="Nations"&gt;{{cite news|title=Many Nations Share America's Grief|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 24, 1963|page=6|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/24/many-nations-share-americas-grief.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NBC News|1966|pp=20–21, 24, 28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in London, there were reports that the [[BBC]] and the [[Independent Television Authority]] in London suspended their regular programs upon breaking the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Networks Drop Regular Shows|first=Val|last=Adams|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 23, 1963|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several nations, monarchs ordered the royal family into days of mourning.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt; Fidel Castro announced Cuba mourned Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/120460/fidel-castro-reaction-kennedy-assassination-cuba|title=I Was With Fidel Castro When JFK Was Assassinated|last=Daniel|first=Jean|date=December 7, 1963|work=New Republic|access-date=2018-01-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, switchboards lit up and were flooded with phone calls.&lt;ref name="Embassies"&gt;{{harvnb|Associated Press|1963|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; At many of them, shocked personnel let telephones go unanswered. They later opened up [[condolence book]]s for people to sign.&lt;ref name="Embassies"/&gt; In Europe, the assassination tempered Cold War sentiment, as people on both sides expressed shock and sorrow.&lt;ref name="Associated Press 1963 40"&gt;{{harvnb|Associated Press|1963|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of Kennedy's assassination reached Asia during the early morning hours of November 23, 1963, because of the time difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Associated Press|1963|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Capitals of Asia Express Sorrow|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 23, 1963|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the news became the first television broadcast from the United States to Japan via the [[Relay 1]] satellite, instead of a prerecorded message from Kennedy to the Japanese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Television Comes of Age in 70 Hours of Assassination Coverage|date=November 6, 1983|first=Fred|last=Rothenberg|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan Sees U.S. TV by Relay Satellite|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 24, 1963|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Back in the U.S. where it was still November 22, the cancelled broadcast of Kennedy's message was shown on NBC-TV's ''Huntley-Brinkley Report'').

=== Hostile ===
Hostile reactions to the late President Kennedy were registered from far right elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.texasobserver.org/welcome-to-texas-mr-obama/|title=Welcome to Texas, Mr. Obama|last=Moser|first=Bob|date=2010-08-04|work=The Texas Observer|access-date=2018-01-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the South, where Kennedy wasn't popular because of his position on civil rights, some isolated incidents occurred, where some expressed joy to the death of Kennedy: schools in [[Mississippi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/nov/21/doug-clark-cheering-at-mississippi-school-added/|title=Doug Clark: Cheering at Mississippi school added to JFK assassination horror|last=Clark|first=Doug|date=November 21, 2013|work=The Spokesman-Review|access-date=2018-01-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.10tv.com/article/reaction-jfks-death-varied-across-us|title=Reaction To JFK's Death Varied Across The U.S.|last=|first=|date=2013-11-22|work=WBNS-10TV|access-date=2018-01-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisiana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2013/11/hatred_of_catholics_led_some_t.html|title=Hatred of Catholics led some to cheer JFK's assassination: Jarvis DeBerry|last=DeBerry|first=Jarvis|date=November 21, 2013|work=NOLA.com|access-date=2018-01-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alabama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/11/alabamians_recall_mixed_reacti.html|title=Alabamians recall mixed reactions to news of JFK's assassination|last=Sawyer|first=Jessica|date=November 21, 2013|work=AL.com|access-date=2018-01-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suburbs of Dallas itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/daily-news/2013/11/dallas-schoolchildren-jfk|title=In Dallas, Some Schoolchildren Cheered the Day J.F.K.

President of the Memphis [[Citizens' Councils|Citizens Council]] Richard Ely told the Nashville White Citizens Council that "Kennedy died a tyrant's death. . . . He encouraged integration, which has the support of communism. He was a tyrant.", causing half of the room to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jcvcWF5mG8C&amp;q=%22Kennedy+died+a+tyrant's+death.+He+encouraged+integration%22&amp;dq=%22Kennedy+died+a+tyrant's+death.+He+encouraged+integration%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSxcPl0tPYAhWQbFAKHe1JC-gQ6AEIJzAA|title=Who killed Kennedy|last=Buchanan|first=Thomas G.|date=1964|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], student Thomas Hansen was thrown across the front glass door after protesting against the banners of celebration of the local section of the [[John Birch Society]] before being hit with ultimately abandonated charges of vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://addictinginfo.com/2013/11/16/john-birch-society/|title=John Birch Society – Original Tea Party Anti-American Group Had Role In Kennedy Assassination|last=Downes|first=Nathaniel|work=AddictingInfo|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As written by [[William Manchester]] in ''Death of a President'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;An Oklahoma City physician beamed at a grief-stricken visitor and said, "Good, I hope they got Jackie." In a small [[Connecticut]] city a doctor called ecstatically across Main Street — to an internist who worshiped Kennedy — "The joy ride's over. This is one deal [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.|Papa Joe]] can't fix." A woman visiting Amarillo, the second most radical city in Texas, was lunching in the restaurant adjacent to her motel when a score of rejoicing students burst in from a high school directly across the street. "Hey, great, JFK's croaked!" one shouted with flagrant delight, and the woman, leaving as rapidly as she could, noticed that several diners were smiling back at the boy. In Dallas itself a man whooped and tossed his expensive Stetson in the air, and it was in a wealthy Dallas suburb that the pupils of a fourth-grade class, told that the President of the United States had been murdered in their city, burst into spontaneous applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXtmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP234&amp;dq=%22to+an+internist+who+worshiped+Kennedy%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPk5a60NPYAhXFhrQKHUZYCOYQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22to%20an%20internist%20who%20worshiped%20Kennedy%22&amp;f=false|title=The Death of a President: November 20-November 25, 1963|last=Manchester|first=William|date=2013-10-08|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=9780316370721|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On December 1, after [[Malcolm X]] made a speech, reporters asked him for a comment about the assassination of President Kennedy. The spokesman for the [[Nation of Islam]] said that it was a case of "[[wikt:come home to roost|chickens coming home to roost]]" and added that "chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they've always made me glad."&lt;ref name=Times63-12-02&gt;{{cite web |title=Malcolm X Scores U.S. and Kennedy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/12/02/archives/malcolm-x-scores-us-and-kennedy-likens-slaying-to-chickens-coming.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=21 |date=December 2, 1963 |accessdate=October 2, 2018 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "in further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of [[Patrice Lumumba]], Congo leader, of [[Medgar Evers]], civil rights leader, and of the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Negro girls bombed]] earlier this year in a [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] church. These, he said, were instances of other 'chickens coming home to roost'."&lt;ref name=Times63-12-02/&gt; The newspaper noted that his comments were greeted by "loud applause and laughter" from the all-black audience, although it quoted an unnamed audience member who told a reporter he applauded Malcolm X's remarks "more for the fact that he had the nerve to say it than that I really approved of it".&lt;ref name=Times63-12-02/&gt;

==Unofficial mourning==
Hastily organized memorial services for Kennedy were held throughout the world, allowing many to express their grief. Governments ordered flags to half-staff and days of mourning. A [[national day of mourning|day of national mourning and sorrow]] was declared in the U.S. for Monday, November 25, the day of the [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|state funeral]].&lt;ref name="Associated Press 1963 40"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|United Press International|''American Heritage'' Magazine|1964|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries such as [[Ireland]] did the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-review.com/latest+headlines/2013/11/16/jfk-death-news-sent-wave-of-grief-around-world|title=JFK death news sent 'wave of grief' around world|first=GREGORY KATZ Associated|last=Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the United States, many states declared the day of the funeral a legal holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business Near Standstill to Pay Its Last Respects to President|first=William|last=Clark|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 25, 1963|page=C7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government Offices Closed by President|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1963|page=A15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all recreational and sporting events scheduled for November 22 and during the weekend after were canceled. Those that went on shared the sentiment NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] expressed in deciding to play NFL games that weekend: "It has been traditional...to perform in times of great personal tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brady|first=Dave|title=It's Tradition To Carry on, Rozelle Says|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1963|page=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their win over the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in [[Franklin Field|Philadelphia]], players on the [[Washington Redskins]] asked Coach [[Bill McPeak]] to send the game ball to the White House, thanking Rozelle for allowing the games to be played that weekend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Game Ball Going to White House|newspaper=The Washington Post|first=Jack|last=Walsh|date=November 25, 1963|page=A16}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that they were "playing...for President Kennedy and in his memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Redskins Send Game Ball to White House|date=November 25, 1963|author=Associated Press|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of Kennedy's funeral, November 25, 1963, people around the world attended memorial services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='A Sudden Extinction of a Shining Light'|date=November 26, 1963|newspaper=Washington Post|page=A11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a day of national mourning in the United States and in many countries around the world.&lt;ref name=USMourning&gt;{{cite news|title=Cities Throughout U.S. Pause for Tribute to Kennedy|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 26, 1963|page=A4|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events were called off because of the mourning. Town streets were deserted while services were held. Everyone who could followed the proceedings on television. Others heeded the call for the day of national mourning by going to their place of worship for a memorial service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grieving People Flock to Kennedy Memorial Services Here and Across the Nation|first=McCandlish|last=Phillips|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1963|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world, footage of the funeral procession was sent abroad via satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Telstar Carries Rites|date=November 26, 1963|author=Reuters|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools, offices, stores, and factories in the U.S. were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business of City Will Halt Today|first=Leonard|last=Ingalls|date=November 25, 1963|page=1|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that were open scheduled a minute of silence.&lt;ref name=USMourning/&gt; Others permitted employees time off to attend memorial services.

In many states, governors declared the day of national mourning a legal holiday, allowing banks to close.&lt;ref name=USMourning/&gt; There was silence across the United States at 12:00 EST (17:00 [[UTC]]) for five minutes to mark the start of the funeral.&lt;ref name=USMourning/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New York Like a Vast Church|first=R.W.|last=Apple Jr.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1963|page=1|authorlink=R.

===Early example of breaking news===
The somber mood across the U.S. during the weekend following Kennedy's death was evident on the broadcast airwaves. The assassination of President Kennedy was the longest uninterrupted news event in the history of American television until the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Viewers Again Return To Traditional Networks|date=September 15, 2001|first=Bill|last=Carter|first2=Jim|last2=Rutenberg|newspaper=New York Times|page=A14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/15/us/after-the-attacks-television-viewers-again-return-to-traditional-networks.html?pagewanted=print|quote=Sometime around 9 a.m. yesterday a television milestone was reached: three broadcast networks had covered one news event for more consecutive hours than any previous event in American history. The terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon have truly become the story of a lifetime on television, surpassing even the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which no network covered for more than 70 consecutive hours. As of yesterday morning, CBS, NBC and ABC, the three networks at the time of Kennedy's assassination and funeral, had been on the air continuously, without commercial interruption, for 72 hours (though some affiliates continued to air regularly-scheduled local newscasts during that time).}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 3 p.m. (EST) on November 22, nearly every television station canceled their commercial schedules to stay with around-the-clock news coverage provided by the three U.S. television networks in 1963: [[ABC News|ABC]], [[CBS News|CBS]], and [[NBC News|NBC]]. From 3 p.m. that day until November 26, all network entertainment and commercial programming ceased on U.S. television, and as such, this coverage was one of the earliest examples of what modern television viewers commonly known as a ''breaking news'' event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A permanent record of what we watched on television from Nov. 22 to 25, 1963|journal=[[TV Guide]]|volume=12|number=4|date=January 25, 1964|pages=24–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnights included taped footage of earlier news mixed with a few breaking news items. On Sunday night, NBC broadcast continuous live coverage of mourners passing the flag-draped bier in the [[Capitol rotunda]] as an estimated 250,000 people filed by.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NBC News|1966|pp=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, a concert performance of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 2]]'', with [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducting, was telecast by CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486604/combined|title=John F. Kennedy Memorial Concert (1963) (TV)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of NBC's coverage of the assassination and funeral, which ended past 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. ET, November 26, the network broadcast a live special post-midnight concert by the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by the director, Dr. [[Howard Mitchell]], at [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National symphony Gives Concert for 'Neighbor'|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 27, 1963|page=22|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NBC News|1966|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many radio stations – even many [[Top 40]] [[rock and roll]] outlets – also went commercial-free, with many non-network stations playing nothing but classical and/or [[easy listening]] instrumental selections interspersed with news bulletins.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} (It has been reported, though, that some stations, such as [[WAPE (defunct)|WAPE]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and other stations in parts of the country where Kennedy was unpopular carried on with their normal programming as usual.) Most stations did return to normal programming on the day after the funeral.

==Tributes==
Tributes to Kennedy abounded in the months following his murder, particularly in the world of recordings. Many individual radio stations released album compilations of their news coverage of Kennedy's assassination; [[ABC News]] released a two-LP set of its radio news coverage.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Major record labels also released tribute albums; at one point there were at least six Kennedy tribute albums available for purchase in record stores, with the most popular being [[Dickie Goodman]]'s ''John Fitzgerald Kennedy: The Presidential Years 1960–1963'' (20th Century 3127), which climbed to number eight on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] album chart and stood as the biggest-selling tribute album of all time until the double-CD tribute to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] thirty-four years later.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Two days after the assassination (and one day before the funeral), a special live television program titled ''A Tribute to John F. Kennedy from the Arts'' was broadcast by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on network television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV Will Continue a Sober Approach|first=Val|last=Adams|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 24, 1963|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program featured dramatic readings from such actors as [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Sidney Blackmer]], [[Florence Eldridge]], [[Albert Finney]], and [[Charlton Heston]], as well as musical selections performed by such artists as [[Marian Anderson]]. Actor [[Fredric March]] (Eldridge's real-life husband) hosted the program. Plummer and Finney performed [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]'s dying speech (''I am dead, Horatio'') with Finney taking the role of Horatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0284577|A Tribute to John F. Kennedy from the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has never been repeated, nor has it ever been released on video in any form.

Perhaps the most successful Kennedy tribute song released in the months after his assassination (although later hit songs such as "[[Abraham, Martin and John]]" and "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]" also referenced the tragedy) was the controversial "[[In the Summer of His Years (song)|In the Summer of His Years]]", introduced by [[United Kingdom|British]] singer [[Millicent Martin]] on a special edition of the [[BBC]]-TV comedy series ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'', conceived as a somber and respectful tribute to Kennedy. Martin recorded the song soon afterward, and though it was not deemed suitable for single release in the U.K., it was released in the U.S. and "Bubbled Under" the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart at No. 104. A cover version by [[Connie Francis]] climbed the Hot 100 chart to number 46 in early 1964 despite being banned by a number of major-market radio stations who felt that capitalizing on a national tragedy was in poor taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Those Kennedy Singles Show Lively Sales Despite Slough-Off By Disc Jockeys|first=Ren|last=Grevatt|journal=Billboard|date=28 December 1963|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions of the song were recorded by [[Toni Arden]], [[Kate Smith]], [[Bobby Rydell]], and gospel legend [[Mahalia Jackson]].&lt;ref name="MusicAsWritten"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Music As Written|journal=Billboard|date=21 December 1963|pages=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phil Spector]]'s [[Christmas]] album, ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector]]'', was pulled from store shelves at Spector's request, having sold terribly since the public was not in the mood for cheery holiday music; it was put back for sale for the 1964 season but did not chart until 1972.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The highly successful comedy album ''[[The First Family (album)|The First Family]]'' that parodied the Kennedys was quickly pulled from circulation which remained that way for many years.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Also in Britain (where the publishers of "In the Summer of His Years" refused to allow the song a single release by any British artist), [[Joe Meek]], composer of [[The Tornados|The Tornado(e)s]]' hit "[[Telstar (song)|Telstar]]", released an instrumental titled "The Kennedy March" on [[Decca Records]], with royalties marked to be sent to [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] for her to donate to charity.&lt;ref name="MusicAsWritten"/&gt; The [[Briarwood Singers]] "Bubbled Under" the ''Billboard'' singles chart in December 1963 with a recording of the traditional folk song "[[He Was a Friend of Mine]]", which was later recorded (with new lyrics written specially by [[Jim McGuinn]]) in 1965 by the popular American band, [[The Byrds]], on their second album, ''[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (album)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In 1964, songwriter William Spivery penned "Mr. John," which became popular in the midwestern United States. Topical folksinger [[Phil Ochs]] paid tribute to Kennedy in his song, "[[I Ain't Marching Anymore|That Was the President]]", written shortly after the assassination, and again two years later in his masterpiece "[[Crucifixion (song)|Crucifixion]]", connecting Kennedy and Christ.&lt;ref&gt;The following are among many works that discuss "Crucifixion" as an allegory about Kennedy and Christ:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3404">'''Robert of Durazzo''' (1326 &amp;ndash; 19 September 1356, [[Poitiers]]) was the third son of [[John, Duke of Durazzo]] and [[Agnes de Périgord]].

He was the lord of Cappacio, Muro, and Montalbano in the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. Captured in 1350 at the siege of [[Aversa]], he was held prisoner by [[Louis I of Hungary]] until 1352. After his release, he took refuge with his uncle the [[Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord, Bishop of Auxerre|Cardinal de Périgord]] in [[Avignon]], which had just been sold to the Papacy by [[Joan I of Naples]].

His uncle attempted to arrange a marriage for him with the niece of [[Giovanni Visconti (Archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], lord of [[Milan]], but on his journey to Milan, Robert was arrested by [[James of Piedmont]]. James' wife, Sibylle des Baux, was convinced that Robert and his Durazzeschi kin had arranged the recent murder of her nephew Robert, Count of Avellino. (Robert had married, by force, [[Maria of Calabria]]; but falling into the hands of [[Louis of Taranto]], was murdered by his wife's orders in the [[Castel dell'Ovo]].) Robert was not released until 18 March 1355, through the efforts of his uncle and [[Pope Innocent VI]], and was made to swear to take no revenge on his captors. He immediately broke the promise by seizing the fortress of [[Les Baux de Provence|Les Baux]] on 6 April 1355. This was the Provençal seat of [[Raymond III of Baux|Raymond des Baux]], brother and successor of the murdered Robert. The Pope was outraged; Robert was defended by his uncle in the papal curia, but did not escape excommunication. After an unsuccessful attempt at mediation by [[Walter VI of Brienne]] and others, local levies besieged the castle, and by July, Robert was compelled to surrender it to its rightful owner.

He accompanied the Cardinal to the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]]. Before the battle, the Cardinal attempted to mediate between the English forces under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] and the French forces under [[John II of France]]. Robert, like many of the Cardinal's men, joined the fight on the French side, and was killed there. This violation of the neutrality which ought to adhere to a churchman and mediator so provoked Edward the Black Prince that he had Robert's body borne on a shield to the Cardinal as a mocking salute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18396">A '''self-induced abortion''' (or '''self-induced miscarriage''') is an [[abortion]] performed by the pregnant woman herself or with the help of other, non-medical assistance.  Although the term includes abortions induced with legal [[over-the-counter medication]], it also refers to efforts to terminate a pregnancy through alternative, sometimes more dangerous means. Such practices may present a threat to the health of women.&lt;ref name="Haddad 2009 122–126"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haddad|first=Lisa B|last2=Nour|first2=Nawal M|date=2009|title=Unsafe Abortion: Unnecessary Maternal Mortality|journal=Reviews in Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=122–126|issn=1941-2797|pmc=2709326|pmid=19609407}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the abortion does not result in termination of the pregnancy, damage to the fetus can occur.

Self-induced abortion is often attempted during the earliest stages of pregnancy (the first eight weeks from the last [[menstruation|menstrual period]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/511/about-the-i-need-an-abortion-project|title=About the "I need an abortion" project — Women on Web|first=Marc|last=Worrell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sage-Femme Collective, ''Natural Liberty: Rediscovering Self-Induced Abortion Methods'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, significant reductions in [[maternal death]] and injury resulting from self-induced abortions have been attributed to the growing use of [[misoprostol]] (known commercially at "Cytotec"), an inexpensive, widely available drug with multiple uses, including the treatment of [[Postpartum bleeding|post-partum hemorrhage]], [[peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]], and [[Labor induction|induction of labor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM200101043440107 |title=Misoprostol and Pregnancy |year=2001 |last1=Wood |first1=Alastair J.

This regimen has been shown to be up to 83% effective in terminating a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gynuity.org/resources/read/misoprostol-selfguide-engpdf/|title=Gynuity Health Projects » Abortion With Self-Administered Misoprostol: A Guide For Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods attempted==
Women in [[India]] are reported to use the following to induce abortion:
* Lifting of heavy weights;
* Consumption of [[mutton]] [[bone marrow|marrow]];
* Consumption of dried [[henna]] powder;
* Consumption of carrot seed soup;&lt;ref name="KhokharGulati-ProfileInducedAbortion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khokhar|first=A.|author2=Gulati, N. |year=2000|title= Profile of Induced Abortions in Women from an Urban Slum of Delhi|journal=Indian Journal of Community Medicine|publisher=Indian Association of Preventive &amp; Social Medicine|location=[[Chandigarh]], [[Republic of India]]|volume=25|issue=4|pages=177–80|issn=1998-3581|oclc=60622662|url=http://medind.nic.in/iaj/t00/i4/iajt00i4p177g.pdf|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of narratives that have described self-induced abortions. Many of the following methods present significant danger (see below) to the life or health of the woman:
* physical exertion designed to bring about a miscarriage
* [[wikt:belly flop|bellyflop]]ping onto a hard surface, or throwing herself down a flight of stairs
* attempted removal of the fetus with a steel wire [[Clothes hanger|coat-hanger]] or similar device inserted into the [[uterus]] through the [[cervix]] (the historical use of this method has led to instances of its use as a symbol of the pro-choice movement, illustrating dangers of barring medically-administered legal abortion)&lt;ref&gt;Tom Strode, "[http://mail.erlc.com/article/life-digest-berkeley-sends-coat-hangers-to-congress Berkeley sends coat hangers to Congress]", ''LIFE DIGEST'' (December 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fielding"&gt;Waldo L. Fielding, M.D., Tony Cenicola, ed., "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/health/views/03essa.html?_r=1&amp; Repairing the Damage, Before Roe]", ''[[The New York Times]]'' (June 3, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* attempted piercing of the fetus with a knitting needle, crochet hook, hat pin, bobby pin or similar device inserted into the uterus through the cervix
* insertion of a rubber tube or catheter into the uterus and attempting to suck the fetus out, or, alternatively, blowing air into the uterus to cause a miscarriage (if the tube or catheter pierced a blood vessel, this would sometimes lead to air embolism, which could be fatal{{Medical citation needed|date=April 2018}})
* ingesting [[abortifacient]]s, [[vitamin C megadosage]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]] or other substances believed to induce miscarriage
* [[douche|douching]] with substances believed to induce miscarriage, such as turpentine, clorox bleach, or lye, all of which could cause intense chemical burns (beginning in the 1960s, many women used [[Coca-Cola]] for this purpose, although its utility is at best dubious)
* [[Pessary|vaginal pessaries]]
* [[yoga]]
* [[acupuncture]] at points linked to miscarriage
* [[hypothermia]] (many women would lie for periods of time in snowbanks, which could be fatal to them) or [[hyperthermia]] (women would lie in tubs filled with hot or even scalding water for periods of time, often while simultaneously drinking gin)

In a letter to the ''New York Times'', gynecologist Waldo L. Fielding wrote:

{{quote|The familiar symbol of illegal abortion is the infamous "coat hanger" — which may be the symbol, but is in no way a myth. In my years in New York, several women arrived with a hanger still in place. Whoever put it in — perhaps the patient herself — found it trapped in the cervix and could not remove it...However, not simply coat hangers were used. Almost any implement you can imagine had been and was used to start an abortion — darning needles, crochet hooks, cut-glass salt shakers, soda bottles, sometimes intact, sometimes with the top broken off.&lt;ref name="Fielding"/&gt;}}

Charles Jewett wrote ''The Practice of Obstetrics'' in 1901.  In it, he stated, "Oil of tansy and oil of rue are much relied on by the laity for the production of abortion, and almost every day one may read of fatal results attending their use.  Oil of tansy in large doses is said to excite epileptiform convulsions; quite recently one of my colleagues met such a case in his practice."

In the 1994 documentary ''Motherless: A Legacy of Loss from Illegal Abortion'', Louis Gerstley, M.D., said that, in addition to knitting needles, some women would use the spokes of bicycle wheels or umbrellas. "Anything that was metal and long and thin would be used," he claimed. He stated that a common complication from such a procedure was that the object would puncture through the uterus and injure the intestines, and the women would subsequently die from [[peritonitis]] and infection. Later in the film he mentioned that [[potassium permanganate]] tablets were sometimes used.  The tablets were inserted into the vagina where they caused a chemical burn so intense that a hole may be left in the tissue.  He claimed the tablets left the surrounding tissue in such a state that doctors trying to stitch up the wound couldn't do so because "the tissue was like trying to suture butter."   Dr. Mildred Hanson also described the use of potassium permanganate tablets in the 2003 documentary ''Voices of Choice: Physicians Who Provided Abortions Before Roe v. Wade''.  She said, "the women would bleed like crazy because it would just eat big holes in the vagina."

Dr. [[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben]] mentions that many African women use a carved wooden ''abortion stick'' to induce, which has often been handed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuben|first=David|authorlink=David Reuben (sex author)|title=[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]|edition=17th|date=c. 1971|publisher=Bantam|isbn=0-553-05570-4&lt;!-- from SBN --&gt;|pages=323–324|chapter=Abortion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to insert hazardous objects into the uterus are particularly dangerous, as they can cause punctures leading to [[septicemia]]. Ingesting or douching with harmful substances can have poisonous results. Receiving blows to the abdomen, whether self-inflicted or at the hands of another, can damage organs. Furthermore, the less dangerous methods – physical exertion, abdominal massage, and ingestion of relatively harmless substances thought to induce miscarriage – are less effective, and may result in the fetus developing [[birth defect]]s. However, abdominal massage abortion is traditionally practised in [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[the Philippines]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Potts, Martha Campbell, [http://big.berkeley.edu/ifplp.history.pdf History of Contraception] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217025152/http://big.berkeley.edu/ifplp.history.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}, Vol. 6, Chp. 8, Gynecology and Obstetrics, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Population Policy Data Bank maintained by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, [https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/thailand.doc Thailand: Abortion Policy].&lt;/ref&gt;

The prescription synthetic [[prostaglandin]] drug [[misoprostol]] – used in the U.S. to treat [[Peptic ulcer|gastric ulcers]] – is often used as an abortifacient in self-induced abortion in [[Latin America]]n countries where legal abortions are unavailable, and its use has also been observed in immigrant populations in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]]: "Abortion Might Outgrow Its Need for Roe v. Wade", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Although proponents of this method deem it to be safer than those using insertion of objects or chemicals into the uterus, they also note that failure to effect an abortion by this method can lead to the child being born with serious birth defects. Furthermore, the drug causes a drastic drop in blood pressure, and women may hemorrhage as a result of misusing the drug for the purpose of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Simmonds, Susan Yanow, ''[http://www.abortionaccess.org/AAP/publica_resources/fact_sheets/use_of_Misoprostol.htm Use of Misoprostol for Self-induced Abortion Around the World]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rates==
Methods of inducing abortion vary globally. An estimated twenty-five million unsafe abortions occur each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs388/en/|title=Preventing unsafe abortion|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 69,000 women die of unsafe abortion each year, though not all as a result of self-induced abortions.&lt;ref name="lancet-grimes2"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Grimes DA, Benson J, Singh S, etal|date=November 2006|title=Unsafe abortion: the preventable pandemic|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/general/lancet_4.pdf|journal=Lancet|volume=368|issue=9550|pages=1908–19|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69481-6|pmid=17126724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors of self-induced abortion can have long-term consequences related to their health. From 1995 to 2003 the number of total abortions including those supervised by medical personnel and those that were self-induced declined.&lt;ref name="Haddad 2009 122–126" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;While maternal morbidity and mortality from unsafe abortion has continued to increase due to population growth, in Latin America, from 2005 to 2012, there was a 31% decrease in the number of complications from unsafe abortion, from 7.7/1,000 to 5.3/1,000.  Researchers believe that this may be due to the wide availability of misoprostol in Latin America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Susheela|date=August 2015|title=Facility-based treatment for medical complications resulting from unsafe pregnancy termination in the developing world, 2012: a review of evidence from 26 countries|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281146041_Facility-based_treatment_for_medical_complications_resulting_from_unsafe_pregnancy_termination_in_the_developing_world_2012_A_review_of_evidence_from_26_countries|journal=BJOG|volume=123-9|pages=|doi=10.1111/1471-0528.13552|via=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|pmc=4767687}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
The practice of attempted self-induced abortion has long been recorded in the [[United States]]. Turn-of-the-20th-century [[birth control]] advocate [[Margaret Sanger]] wrote in her autobiography of a 1912 incident in which she was summoned to treat a woman who had nearly died from such an attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Sanger. ''An Autobiography''. (New York, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

A study concluded in 1968&lt;ref&gt;Richard Schwarz, ''Septic Abortion'' (Philadelphia: JB Lippincott Co., 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; determined that over 500,000 illegal abortions were performed every year in the [[United States]], a portion of which were performed by women acting alone. The study suggested that the number of women dying as a result of self-induced abortions exceeded those resulting from abortions performed by another person.  A 1979 study noted that many women who required hospitalization following self-induced abortion attempts were admitted under the pretext of having had a [[miscarriage]] or [[spontaneous abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;Bose C., ''A comparative study of spontaneous and self-induced abortion cases in married women.'' J Indian Med Assoc. 1979 August; 73 (3-4): 56-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO estimates that approximately 22 million abortions continue to be performed unsafely each year, resulting in the death of an estimated 47,000 women and disabilities for an additional 5 million women. Almost every one of these deaths and disabilities could have been prevented through sexual education, family planning, and the provision of safe abortion services. Abortion pills, which began be used by women themselves in Brazil in the 1980s, can prevent many of these deaths from unsafe abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeZordo|first=Silvia|date=January–March 2016|title=The biomedicalisation of illegal abortion: the double life of misoprostol in Brazil|journal=Hist. cienc. saude-Manguinhos|volume=Vol 23, No. 1|issn=1678-4758|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Although ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', [[Case citation|410 U.S. 113]] (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; made abortion more readily available throughout the U.S., it remains a crime in most jurisdictions for a woman to attempt to perform an abortion on herself. In May 2005, Gabriela Flores – a 22-year-old [[Mexico|Mexican]] immigrant farm worker and mother of three living in Pelion, [[South Carolina]] – was charged under such a statute, which carried a maximum penalty of two years in [[prison]]. She had induced abortion at roughly 16 weeks by ingesting [[misoprostol]] under the brand name Cytotec, an [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] medication with [[abortifacient]] potential. She was sentenced to 90 days in jail. [[Mississippi]] classifies self-induced abortions as deaths which affect the public interest, requiring that physicians report them to the local [[medical examiner]]. By contrast, [[New Mexico]]'s "Unborn Victims of Violence Act" exempts self-induced abortion from the criminal liability the act creates.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The '''septum transversum''' is a thick mass of cranial [[mesenchyme]], formed in the [[embryo]], that gives rise to parts of the [[thoracic diaphragm]] and the [[ventral mesentery]] of the foregut in the developed human being.

== Origins ==
The septum transversum originally arises as the most cranial part of the [[mesenchyme]] on day 22. During craniocaudal folding it assumes a position caudal to the developing heart at the level of the cervical vertebrae. During subsequent weeks the dorsal end of the embryo grows much faster than its ventral counterpart resulting in an ''apparent descent'' of the ventrally located septum transversum. At week 8 it can be found at the level of the thoracic vertebrae.&lt;ref&gt;Persaud, T.V.N; Moore, K.L.: ''The Developing Human: Clinically oriented embryology''; Saunders, 7th ed., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nerve supply==
After successful craniocaudal folding the septum transversum picks up innervation from the adjacent [[ventral rami]] of spinal nerves C3, C4 and C5, thus forming the precursor of the [[phrenic nerve]]. During the descent of the septum, the [[phrenic nerve]] is carried along and assumes its descending pathway.

During embryonic development of the [[thoracic diaphragm]], [[myoblast]] cells from the septum invade the other components of the diaphragm. They thus give rise to the motor and sensory innervation of the muscular diaphragm by the [[phrenic nerve]].

== Derivatives ==
The [[cranium|cranial]] part of the septum transversum gives rise to the [[central tendon of diaphragm|central tendon]] of the diaphragm and is the origin of the [[myoblasts]] that invade the [[pleuroperitoneal]] folds resulting in the formation of the muscular diaphragm.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, N.A.; Roy, W.A.: ''Rapid Review Gross and Developmental Anatomy''; Mosby, 2nd ed., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] part of the septum transversum is invaded by the [[hepatic diverticulum]] which divides within it to form the liver and thus gives rise to the [[ventral mesentery]] of the foregut, which in turn is the precursor of the [[lesser omentum]], the [[visceral peritoneum]] of the [[liver]] and the [[falciform ligament]].

Though not derived from the septum transversum, development of the liver is highly dependent upon signals originating here.  [[Bone morphogenetic protein 2]] (BMP-2), [[Bone morphogenetic protein 4|BMP-4]] and [[Bone morphogenetic protein 7|BMP-7]] produced from the septum transversum join [[fibroblast growth factor]] (FGF) signals from the cardiac mesoderm induce part of the foregut to differentiate towards a hepatic fate.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, B: ''Human Embryology and Developmental Biology''.  Mosby, 3rd ed., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Siberia]]n Ice Maiden''', also known as the '''Princess of [[Ukok Plateau|Ukok]]''' ({{lang-ru|Принце́сса Уко́ка}}), the '''[[Altai Mountains|Altai]] Princess''' ({{lang-ru|Алтайская принцесса}}), '''Devochka''' and '''Ochy-bala''' ({{lang-ru|Очы-бала}}, the heroine of the [[Altaic epic]]), is a [[mummy]] of a woman from the 5th century BC, found in 1993 in a [[kurgan]] of the [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk culture]] in [[Republic of Altai]], [[Russia]]. It was among the most significant [[Russian archaeology|Russian archaeological findings]] of the late 20th century. In 2012 she was moved to a special mausoleum at the Republican National Museum in [[Gorno-Altaisk]].

== Introduction ==

The mummified remains of the “Ice Maiden,” a [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Siberian woman who lived on the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s in the 5th century BC, were found undisturbed in a subterranean burial chamber. [[Natalia Polosmak]] and her team discovered the Ice Maiden during the summer of 1993, when she was a senior research fellow at the Russian Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography in Novosibirsk. It was Polosmak’s fourth season working on the [[Ukok Plateau]] where the Institute was continuing its research into the early habitation of southern Siberia.&lt;ref name="Polosmak 80–103"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polosmak|first=Natalia|title=A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven|journal=National Geographic|date=October 1994|pages=80–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly two decades later, there are few English language sources available for the important discovery: Polosmak’s ''National Geographic'' article from October 1994, and a BBC documentary (1997) featuring Polosmak and members of her team are the most informative and accessible.

The Ice Maiden was a representative of the [[Pazyryk culture]] that thrived between the 6th and 2nd centuries BC in the Siberian steppe.

The Ice Maiden’s tomb was found on the Ukok Plateau near the border of China, in what is now the [[Altai Republic|Autonomous Republic of Altai]]. The plateau, part of the Eurasian Steppes, is characterized by a harsh, arid climate. The area is known by the local people as the “second layer of heaven,” one step above ordinary people and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polosmak|first=Natalia|title=A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven|journal=National Geographic|date=October 1994|pages=80–103}} p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Present day Altai herdsmen still bring their sheep and horses to the plateau during winter because the fierce wind blows the snow off the grass and provides grazing land for the animals despite the freezing temperatures.

== Discovery and excavation ==
[[File:Ukok Ak-Alakha.jpg|thumb|The [[Ukok Plateau]]]]
[[Natalia Polosmak|Polosmak]] and her team were guided by a border guard, Lt. Mikhail Chepanov, to a group of [[kurgan]]s located in a strip of territory disputed between Russia and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polosmak|first=Natalia|title=A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven|journal=National Geographic|date=October 1994|pages=80–103}}  p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; A kurgan is a burial mound filled in with smaller sediment and covered with a pile of rocks; typically, the mound covered a tomb chamber, which contained a burial inside a log coffin, with accompanying grave goods. Such burial chambers were built from notched wood logs to form a small cabin, which may have resembled the semi-nomads’ winter shelters. The Ice Maiden's tomb chamber was constructed in this way, and the wood and other organic materials present have allowed her burial to be dated. A core sample from the logs of her chamber was analyzed by a [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronologist]], and samples of organic matter from the horses’ stomachs were examined as well, indicating that the Ice Maiden was buried in the spring, at some point during the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polosmak|first=Natalia|title=A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven|journal=National Geographic|date=October 1994|pages=80–103}}, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Polosmak and her crew reached the Ice Maiden’s chamber, they hit upon a second later burial in the same kurgan positioned on top of the Maiden's wooden tomb chamber. The contents included a stone and wood coffin containing a skeleton, along with three horses. Polosmak believes that this secondary burial was that of an outside group, perhaps of subordinate peoples, who considered it honorable to bury their dead in Pazyryk kurgans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polosmak|first=Natalia|title=A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven|journal=National Geographic|date=October 1994|pages=80–103}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; A shaft dug into the kurgan indicated that this later grave had been robbed, another means by which water and snow entered and seeped into the Ice Maiden’s hollow burial chamber. The water collected, froze, and formed an ice block within the chamber which never fully thawed because of the steppe climate, permafrost, and the rocks piled on top of the mound which deflected the sun’s rays. The contents of the burial remained frozen for 2400 years, until the time of Polosmak’s excavation.

== Tomb chamber ==

Inside the Maiden’s tomb chamber was her coffin, which was made of a solid [[larch]] wood tree trunk decorated with leather appliqués depicting deer figures. The chamber also contained two small wood tables with tray-shaped tops, which were used to serve food and drink. Horsemeat and mutton had been placed on the tables; the residue of a dairy product, perhaps yogurt, was found in a wooden vessel with a carved handle and stirrer; and some kind of beverage was served in a horn cup to sustain her on her journey.&lt;ref name="Polosmak 80–103"/&gt;

The Ice Maiden and her horses were oriented with their heads toward the east, as was the case in other Pazyryk burials. She was between 20 and 30 years old at the time of her death. The cause of the Ice Maiden's death was unknown&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2517siberian.html Transcript of the BBC/NOVA documentary "Ice Mummies: Siberian Ice Maiden", Nov. 24, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; until 2014, when new research suggested breast cancer, combined with injuries sustained in a fall, as likely culprits. The finding of cannabis in a container near the body led to the supposition that the drug was used to relieve the chronic pain that the woman would have suffered.&lt;ref name="the Siberian Times"&gt;[http://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/features/iconic-2500-year-old-siberian-princess-died-from-breast-cancer-reveals-unique-mri-scan/ 14 October 2014 Siberian Times article by Anna Liesowska on MRI study]&lt;/ref&gt; She may have had the elevated status of a priestess in her community based upon the items found in her chamber. The Ice Maiden’s preserved skin has the mark of an animal-style deer tattoo on one of her shoulders, and another on her wrist and thumb.&lt;ref name=sbn&gt;{{cite web|title=Siberian Princess reveals her 2,500 year old tattoos|url=http://siberiantimes.com/culture/others/features/siberian-princess-reveals-her-2500-year-old-tattoos/|publisher=Siberian Times|accessdate=11 March 2014|date=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in a yellow silk tussah blouse, a crimson-and-white striped wool skirt with a tassel belt, thigh-high white felt leggings, with a marten fur, a small mirror made from polished metal and wood with carved deer figures, and a headdress that stood nearly three feet tall. The size of the headdress necessitated a coffin that was eight feet long. The headdress had a wooden substructure with a molded felt covering and eight carved feline figures covered in gold. There were remains of coriander seeds in a stone dish that may have been provided for the Maiden’s medicinal use.

== Controversy ==

The excavation of the Ice Maiden was carried out with great care, although in some ways it has been seen as problematic, due to the methods used to melt the ice and remove the artifacts and body from the coffin. The mummy also suffered deterioration during her transport from the site to the lab, and even when she was in a refrigerated space, which resulted in her tattoos fading. Upon discovering the tomb, the ice mummy was reported to have opium on her. 

A dispute developed between the Russian authorities and the local inhabitants, who lay claim to the Ice Maiden and other Pazyryk kurgans. For 19 years after her discovery, she was  kept mainly at a scientific institute in Novosibirsk, but in 2012, the mummy was returned to the Altai, where she is to be kept in a special mausoleum at the [[Anokhin Museum|Republican National Museum]] in the capital Gorno-Altaisk. Future excavations of the site have since been forbidden, even though it is suspected more artifacts are inside the tomb.&lt;ref name=sbn /&gt;

A reconstruction of the Ice Maiden’s face was created using her skull, in conjunction with measurements taken from the skulls, facial features, and skin thickness of present-day Altai inhabitants. The artist who created the reconstruction, Tanya Balueva, was documented as saying that the Ice Maiden “is a clear-cut example of the Caucasian race with no typically Mongolian features.”

'''Sid James''' (born '''Solomon Joel Cohen'''; 8 May 1913 – 26 April 1976) was a [[Union of South Africa|South African]]-born [[Union of South Africa|British]] [[character actor|character]] and comic actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Andy|title=Beyond Carry On:Sid James's 20 best - and weirdest - films|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/26/beyond-carry-on-sid-jamess-20-best---and-weirdest---films/|website=Telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing in British films from 1947, he was cast in numerous small and supporting roles into the 1950s. His profile was raised as [[Tony Hancock]]'s co-star in ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', first in the radio series and later when it was adapted for television and ran from 1954 to 1961. Afterwards, he became known as a regular performer in the [[Carry On (franchise)|''Carry On'']] films, appearing in nineteen films of the series, with the [[Billing (filmmaking)|top billing]] role in 17 (in the other two he was cast below [[Frankie Howerd]]). Meanwhile, his starring roles in [[sitcom|television sitcoms]] continued for the rest of his life. He starred alongside [[Diana Coupland]] in the 1970s sitcom ''[[Bless This House (UK TV series)|Bless This House]]'' until his death in 1976.

Remembered for a lascivious persona in the ''Carry On'' films, with the ''[[Snopes.com|Snopes]]'' website describing him as "the grand old man of dirty laughter",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/onstage.asp |title=Died Onstage |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became known for his amiability in his later television work. [[Bruce Forsyth]] described him as "a natural at being natural".&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, speaking on the TV programme ''Heroes of Comedy'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 1976, while touring in ''The Mating Season'', James suffered a heart attack while performing on stage at the [[Sunderland Empire Theatre]]; he died in hospital an hour later. Some, including comedian [[Les Dawson]], claim to have seen the ghost of James at the theatre, and subsequently refused to appear at the theatre again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/CustomPages/CustomPage.aspx?PageID=58275&amp;sectionID=6150 |title=Theatre Stage An Old Haunt For Sid? |accessdate=15 March 2008 |format=newspaper |work=The Shields Gazette |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111091700/http://www.shieldsgazette.com/CustomPages/CustomPage.aspx?PageID=58275&amp;sectionID=6150 |archivedate=11 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/retro1980s/1989-Ghostly-tale.4331124.jp|title=Ghostly tale|date=28 July 2008|publisher=Sunderland Echo|accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
James was born Solomon Joel Cohen on 8 May 1913, to [[History of the Jews in South Africa|Jewish]] parents in [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], later changing his name to Sidney Joel Cohen, and then '''Sidney James'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=|title=The Classic Carry On Film Collection|first=|last=|publisher=DeAgostini|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family lived on Hancock Street in [[Hillbrow]], [[Johannesburg]]. Upon moving to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] later in life, he claimed various previous occupations, including [[diamond cutting|diamond cutter]], dance tutor and boxer;&lt;ref&gt;also reported in a BBC Radio 4 tribute (to be broadcast in celebration of the centenary of his birth) as short-term jobs before he 'settled down' as a trainee in his mother's hairdressing salon&lt;/ref&gt; in reality, he had trained and worked as a hairdresser.&lt;ref name="denofgeek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/books-comics/5901/sid-james-cockney-rebel-book-review|title=Sid James: Cockney Rebel book review|work=Den of Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at a hairdressing salon in [[Kroonstad]], [[Orange Free State]], that he met his first wife. He married Berthe Sadie Delmont, known as Toots, on 12 August 1936 and they had a daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1937. His father-in-law, Joseph Delmont, a Johannesburg businessman, bought a hairdressing salon for James, but within a year he announced that he wanted to become an actor and joined the Johannesburg Repertory Players. Through this group, he gained work with the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]].

During the [[Second World War]], he served as a lieutenant in an entertainment unit of the [[South African Army]], and subsequently took up acting as a career. He moved to Britain immediately after the war, financed by his service gratuity. According to rumour, Sid had an affair with the daughter of an important member of Johannesburg society; his decision to move away from South Africa was partly because he was "advised" to leave due to the possible controversy.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Initially, he worked in [[repertory]] before being spotted for the nascent British post-war film industry.

==Career==
===From 1947 to 1964===
James made his first credited film appearances in ''Night Beat'' and ''Black Memory'' (1947), both crime dramas. He played the alcoholic hero's barman in [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]'s ''[[The Small Back Room]]'' (1949).

His first major comedy role was in ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' (1951): with [[Alfie Bass]], he made up the bullion robbery gang headed by [[Alec Guinness]] and [[Stanley Holloway]]. In the same year, he also appeared in ''[[Lady Godiva Rides Again]]'' and ''[[The Galloping Major (film)|The Galloping Major]]''. In 1953, he appeared as Harry Hawkins in ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]'', and also had a major, starring role in ''[[The Wedding of Lilli Marlene]]''. In 1956, he appeared in ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' (1956) as Harry the snake charmer, a circus film which was one of the most successful films of its year, and he played Master Henry in "Outlaw Money", an episode of ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''. He also had a supporting part as a TV advertisement producer in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[A King in New York]]'', a non-comic supporting role as a journalist in the science-fiction film ''[[Quatermass 2]]'', and he performed in ''[[Hell Drivers (film)|Hell Drivers]]'' (all 1957), a film with [[Stanley Baker]]. The next year, James starred with [[Miriam Karlin]] in ''East End, West End'' by [[Wolf Mankowitz]], a half-hour comedy series for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] company [[Associated Rediffusion]]. Set within the Jewish community of London's East End, the series of six episodes was transmitted in February and March 1958, but plans for further episodes were abandoned after a disappointing response. For a while though, it had looked as if his commitment elsewhere might end his work with [[Tony Hancock]], one of the most popular television comedians of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cliff Goodwin ''Sid James: A Biography'', London: Virgin Books, 2001, p.121-22&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, he had begun working with Tony Hancock in his [[BBC Radio]] series ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]''. Having seen him in ''The Lavender Hill Mob'', it was the idea of Hancock's writers, [[Galton and Simpson|Ray Galton]] and [[Galton and Simpson|Alan Simpson]], to cast James. He played a character with his own name (but having the invented middle name Balmoral) who was a petty criminal and would usually manage to con Hancock in some way, although the character eventually ceased to be Hancock's adversary. With the exception of James, the other regular cast members of the radio series were dropped when the series made the transition to television. His part in the show now greatly increased and many viewers came to think of Hancock and James as a double act.
[[File:Hancocks-Half-Hour.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Tony Hancock]] (right) with James]]

Feeling the format had become exhausted, Hancock decided to end his professional relationship with James at the end of the sixth television series in 1960. Although the two men remained friends, James was upset at his colleague's decision. The experience led to a shift away from the kind of roles for which he had become best known. He remained the lovable rogue but was keen to steer clear of criminal characters - in 1960 he turned down the part of Fagin in the original West End staging of ''[[Oliver!]]'' for that very reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Robert|title=Sid James - The Authorised Biography|publisher=JR Books|isbn=978-1-906779-35-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Galton and Simpson continued to write for both James and Hancock for a while, and the Sidney Balmoral James character resurfaced in the ''[[Citizen James]]'' (1960–1962) series. Sid James was now consistently taking the lead role in his television work. ''[[Taxi! (UK TV series)|Taxi!]]'' (1963–64) was his next series. A comedy-drama rather than a sitcom, it was created by [[Ted Willis, Baron Willis|Ted Willis]], but although it ran to two series, the programme was not particularly successful.&lt;ref&gt;Cliff Goodwin ''Sid James: A Biography'', London: Virgin Books, 2001, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Carry On'' films===
James became a leading member of the [[Carry On (franchise)|''Carry On'' films]] team, originally to replace [[Ted Ray (comedian)|Ted Ray]], who had appeared in ''[[Carry On Teacher]]'' (1959). It had been intended that Ray would become a recurring presence in the ''Carry On'' series, but he was dropped after just one film because of contractual problems.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin ''Sid James'', p.125&lt;/ref&gt; James ultimately made 19 ''Carry On'' films,&lt;ref name="denofgeek.com"/&gt; receiving top-billing in 17, making him one of the most featured performers of the regular cast.

The characters he portrayed in the films were usually very similar to the wise-cracking, sly, lecherous Cockney he was famed for playing on television, and in most cases they bore the name Sid or Sidney, examples being, Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond in ''[[Carry On Up the Khyber]]'' and Sid Boggles in ''[[Carry On Camping]]''.
His trademark "dirty laugh" was often used and became, along with a world-weary "Cor, blimey!", his catchphrase. His laugh can be heard here [http://www.carryon.org.uk/sounds/yak_yak_yak.wav]. (Similarly, other regular members of the Carry On cast abbreviated their real first names in the films: [[Bernard Bresslaw]] was Bernie and [[Barbara Windsor]] Babs.)

There were ''Carry On'' films in which James played characters who were not called Sid or Sidney: ''[[Carry On Constable]]'' (1960), in which he played Sergeant Frank Wilkins; ''[[Carry On Henry]]'' (1971), a parody of the TV series ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (BBC TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]''; ''[[Carry On Abroad]]'' (1972), in which James's character was named Vic Flange; and ''[[Carry On Dick]]'' (1974), a parody version of the legend of the [[highwayman]] [[Dick Turpin]]. In ''Henry'' and ''Dick'', James played the title roles, while in ''Carry On Cleo'' he played [[Mark Antony]]. In ''[[Carry On Cowboy]]'', he adopted an American accent for his part as "The Rumpo Kid". According to [[Adrian Rigelsford]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The cast make valiant attempts to maintain American accents, with the most convincing belonging to—surprisingly—Sid James, who made no attempt to disguise his accent in any other film, either before or after this one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Rigelsford|title= ''Carry On Laughing&amp;nbsp;— A Celebration''|publisher=London: Virgin Books|year= 1996| page=151 |isbn=1-85227-554-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rigelsford was mistaken, as James had previously played an American (with an American accent) in the films ''[[Give Us This Day (1949 film)|Give Us This Day]]'' (1949), ''[[Orders Are Orders]]'' (1954), ''[[A Yank in Ermine]]'' (1955) and Chaplin's ''[[A King in New York]]'' (1958).

===Later career===
In 1967, James was intending to play Sergeant Nocker in ''[[Follow That Camel]]'', but was already committed to recording the TV series ''[[George and the Dragon (TV series)|George and the Dragon]]'' (1966–1968) for [[Associated Television|ATV]], then one of the ITV contractors. James was replaced in ''[[Follow That Camel]]'' by the American comic actor [[Phil Silvers]]. On 13 May 1967, two weeks after the filming began of what eventually became an entry in the ''Carry On'' series, James suffered a severe [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. In the same year in ''[[Carry On Doctor]]'', James was shown mainly lying in a hospital bed, owing to his real-life health problems. After his heart attack, James gave up his heavy cigarette habit and instead smoked a pipe or an occasional cigar; he lost weight, ate only one main meal a day, and limited himself to two or three alcoholic drinks per evening.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, Cliff ''Sid James: A Biography'' p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, his success in TV situation comedy continued with the series ''[[Two in Clover]]'' (1969–70), and ''[[Bless This House (UK TV series)|Bless This House]]'' (1971–1976) as Sid Abbott, a successful enough series in its day to spawn [[Bless This House (film)|its own film version]] in 1972.

==Death==
On 26 April 1976, while on a revival tour of ''The Mating Season'', a 1969 farce by the Northern Irish playwright [[Sam Cree]], James suffered a [[heart attack]] on stage at the [[Sunderland Empire Theatre]]. Actress [[Olga Lowe]] thought that he was playing a practical joke at first when he failed to reply to her dialogue.  When he failed to reply to her ad libs, she moved towards the wings to seek help. The technical manager, Melvyn James, called for the curtain to close and requested a doctor, while the audience - who were unaware of what was happening - laughed, believing the events to be part of the show. He was taken to hospital by ambulance, but was pronounced dead at the age of 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/history-nostalgia/the-night-sid-james-died-on-stage-1-7712207 |title=The Night Sid James Died On Stage |work=Sunderland Echo |date= |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James was cremated and his ashes were scattered at [[Golders Green Crematorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/famous-names-whose-final-stop-was-golders-green-crematorium-1921813.html|title=Famous names whose final stop was Golders Green crematorium|date=16 March 2010|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
James married three times. He and his first wife, Berthe Sadie Delmont, were divorced in 1940, mainly as a result of his many relationships with other women; it was a pattern which continued throughout his life.

In 1943, he married a dancer, Meg Sergei, née Williams (born 1913). Five years later they had a daughter, [[Reina James|Reina]], before divorcing on 17 August 1952.

James has another daughter called Sue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lost Sid James interview rediscovered |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45088173 |work=BBC News |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 1952, James married Valerie Elizabeth Patsy Assan (born 1928), an actress who used Ashton as her stage name. In 1954, they had a son, Steve James, who is now a music producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asharp.com.au/audio-engineers/steve-james|title=Audio Engineers|publisher=A Sharp Recording Studio.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter part of their marriage, they lived in a house partly designed by James himself, called Delaford Park, situated in [[Iver]], [[Buckinghamshire]], a location close enough to [[Pinewood Studios]] to allow him to return home for lunch while filming. During his marriage to Valerie, he had a well-publicised affair with ''Carry On'' co-star [[Barbara Windsor]] lasting more than 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1319048/Barbara-Windsor-fling-Maurice-Gibb-George-Best.html|title=Barbara Windsor: My secret flings with George Best and a Bee Gee|date=8 October 2010|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/719630.stm|title=The Sid and Babs carry on|date=22 April 2000|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affair was dramatised in the 1998 stage-play ''[[Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick]]'' and its 2000 television adaptation ''[[Cor, Blimey!]]''. James's obsession with Windsor was such that it was rumoured that her then husband [[Ronnie Knight]] had all of James's furniture rearranged at home as a subtle threat and, on another occasion, that he had put an axe in James's floor,&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; but close friends of the time, including [[Vince Powell]] and [[William G. Stewart]], have dismissed the suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;Heroes of Comedy, Thames Television, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

James was an inveterate and largely unsuccessful gambler, losing tens of thousands of pounds over his lifetime. His gambling addiction was such that he had an agreement with his agent, Michael Sullivan, under which his wife was not told how much he was being paid, so that a portion could be set aside for gambling.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=Cliff|title=Sid James: A Biography|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=978-0-7535-0554-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
James has been the subject of at least five tribute shows: a 1996 one-off tribute, ''The Very Best of Sid James''; as the focus of a 2000 episode of the series ''[[The Unforgettable]]''; a 2002 episode of ''[[Heroes of Comedy]]''; Channel Four's ''With Out Walls, Seriously Seeking Sid'' in the late 1980s; and in 2013, the BBC's ''The Many Faces Of Sid James''.

In August 2018 it was announced that a radio interview which James had recorded for [[BBC Radio Solent]] on 22 March 1976 had been re-discovered during research for a forthcoming BBC radio documentary celebrating the ''Carry On'' film series. The recording had been kept by BBC presenter Jeff Link, who had carried out the original interview. In the interview, James discusses his attempts to keep fit by skipping, his preference for working in films, his genuine affection for the ''Carry On'' films, and other topics. The interview is notable for its relaxed, humorous style. The producer of the forthcoming BBC ''Carry On'' documentary, Richard Latto, contacted James's surviving daughters after confirming the recording's authenticity. Reina James commented: "To hear him talking just before he's about to die.. there's something hugely moving about that". Sue James called the interview "lovely and sympathetic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lost Sid James interview rediscovered |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45088173 |work=BBC News |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
