      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5865">The '''1888–1893 Uprisings of Hazaras''' occurred when the [[Treaty of Gandomak]] was signed and the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] ended in 1880, causing [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] to set out on a goal to bring Hazarajat and [[Kafiristan]] under his control. He launched several campaigns in Hazarajat due to resistance from the Hazaras in which his forces committed atrocities. The southern part of Hazarajat was spared as they accepted his rule, while the other parts of Hazarajat rejected Abdur Rahman and instead supported his uncle, [[Sher Ali Khan]]. In response to this Abdur Rahman waged a war against tribal leaders who rejected his policies and rule.&lt;ref name="Monsutti"&gt;"HAZĀRA: ii. HISTORY". Alessandro Monsutti (Online ed.).

==First uprising==
The first Hazara uprising against Abdur Rahman Khan took place between 1888 and 1890. When Emir Abdur Rahman's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq, revolted against him, tribal leaders of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras joined the revolt. The revolt was short lived as the Emir extended his control over large parts of Hazarajat.

After all of Sheikh Ali Hazaras' chiefs were sent to [[Kabul]], opposition within the leadership of Sawar Khan and Syed Jafar Khan continued against the government troops, but at last were defeated. Taxes were imposed and Afghan administrators were sent to occupied places, where they subjugated the people with abuses.&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; People were disarmed, villages were looted, local tribal chiefs were imprisoned or executed, and the better lands were confiscated and given to Afghan [[nomad]]s ([[Kuchis]]).&lt;ref name=Mousavi/&gt;

==Second uprising==
The second uprising occurred in the Spring of 1892. According to [[Syed Askar Mousavi]], the cause of the uprising was an assault on the wife of a Hazara Chieftain by Afghan soldiers.  The families of both the man and his wife, deciding that death was one hundred times better than such humiliation, killed the soldiers involved and attacked the local garrison, from whence they recovered their confiscated arms".&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; Several other tribal chiefs who supported Abdur Rahman now turned against him and joined the rebellion which rapidly spread through the entire Hazarajat. In response to the rebellion, the Emir declared a "[[jihad]]" against the Shias&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Refworld {{!}} World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Afghanistan : Hazaras|url = http://www.refworld.org/docid/49749d693d.html|website = Refworld|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised an army of up to 40, 000 soldiers, 10, 000 mounted troops, and 100,000 armed civilians (most of which were Pashtun nomads).&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; He also brought in [[British Raj|British]] military advisers to assist his army.&lt;ref name=Mousavi&gt;{{cite book |last= Mousavi|first= Sayed Askar|title= The Hazaras of Afghanistan: An Historical, Cultural, Economic and Political Study|origyear= 1997|year= 1998 |publisher= St. Martin's Press|location = Richmond, NY|isbn= 0-312-17386-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third uprising of Hazara was in response to the harsh repression; the Hazara revolted again by early 1893. This revolt took the government forces by surprise and the Hazara managed to take most of Hazarajat back. However, after months of fighting, they were eventually defeated due to a shortage of food. Small pockets of resistance continued to the end of the year as government troops committed atrocities against civilians and deported entire villages.&lt;ref name=Mousavi/&gt;

Abdur Rahman's subjugation of the Hazara due to fierce rebellion against the Afghan king gave birth to strong hatred between the Pahstun and Hazara for years to come. Massive forced displacements, especially in Oruzgan and [[Daychopan District|Daychopan]], continued as lands were confiscated and populations were expelled or fled. Some 35,000 families fled to northern Afghanistan, [[Mashhad]] (Iran) and [[Quetta]] (Pakistan). Hazara farmers were often forced to give up their property to Pashtuns&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = تاریخ باستانی هزاره ها|last = دلجو|first = عباس|publisher = انتشارات امیری|year = 2014|isbn = 9936801504|location = کابل|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result many Hazara families had to leave seasonally to the [[List of cities in Afghanistan|major cities in Afghanistan]], Iran, or Pakistan in order to find jobs and a source of income. Quetta in Pakistan is home to the third largest settlements of Hazara outside Afghanistan.

The '''Agatha Christie indult''' is a nickname applied to the permission granted in 1971 by [[Pope Paul VI]] for the use of the [[Tridentine Mass]] in England and Wales. ''Indult'' is a term from Catholic canon law referring to a permission to do something that would otherwise be forbidden.

==Description==
Following the introduction of the [[Mass of Paul VI]] to replace the former rite in 1969–1970, a petition was sent to the Pope asking that the Tridentine rite be permitted to continue for those who wished in England and Wales. The petition noted the exceptional artistic and cultural heritage of the Tridentine liturgy, and was signed by many prominent non-Catholic figures in British society, including [[Agatha Christie]], [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], [[Kenneth Clark]], [[Robert Graves]], [[F. R. Leavis]], [[Cecil Day-Lewis]], [[Nancy Mitford]], [[Iris Murdoch]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Joan Sutherland]] and two Anglican bishops, those [[Bishop of Exeter|of Exeter]] and [[Bishop of Ripon (modern diocese)|of Ripon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/yes/rediscovering-traditionalism Rediscovering Traditionalism], John Casey&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Carmel Heenan|John Cardinal Heenan]] approached [[Pope Paul VI]] and asked that use of the Tridentine Mass be permitted. On 5 November 1971, the Pope granted the request. Between then and the granting of the worldwide "universal indult" in 1984, the bishops of England and Wales were authorized to grant permission for the occasional celebration of Mass in the old form, with the modifications introduced in 1965 and 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latin-mass-society.org/desavent.htm The English Indult - "an Object of Fraternal Envy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112031437/http://latin-mass-society.org/desavent.htm |date=12 November 2006 }} by [[Eric de Savanthem]]&lt;/ref&gt;

English Roman Catholics had a particular attachment {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} to the Tridentine Mass, as the Mass which had been celebrated by the [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation|English Martyrs]] of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and by priests in the years in which Catholicism had been subjected to sometimes severe persecution. The indult acquired its nickname by virtue of a story told about the Pope's acceptance of the petition:&lt;blockquote&gt;The story is that Pope Paul read through the letter in silence then suddenly exclaimed, "Ah, Agatha Christie!" and then signed it. Though not a Catholic at the time, Christie rejected the 20th century rite as the desecration of the historic church that it was. The indult was granted in 1971. Ever since it has been known informally as "the Agatha Christie indult".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latin-mass-society.org/leomass.htm THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MASS SINCE 1960 (What Vatican II Really Said)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616103214/http://www.latin-mass-society.org/leomass.htm |date=16 June 2006 }}, Speech by Leo Darroch, Deputy Chairman of the [[Latin Mass Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Often misunderstood is the fact that the indult itself did not refer to the 1962 Liturgy, but the revisions of 1965, with the incorporation of the revisions of ''Tres abhinc annos'' in 1967.

The text of the indult itself reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sacra Congregatio pro Cultu Divino
E Civitate Vaticana,
die 5 Novembre 1971
Prot. N. 1897/71

Your Eminence,

His Holiness Pope Paul VI, by letter of 30 October 1971, has given special faculties to the undersigned Secretary of this Sacred Congregation to convey to Your Eminence, as Chairman of the Episcopal Conference of England and Wales, the following points regarding the Order of the Mass:

1. Considering the pastoral needs referred to by Your Eminence, it is permitted to the local Ordinaries of England and Wales to grant that certain groups of the faithful may on special occasions be allowed to participate in the Mass celebrated according to the Rites and texts of the former Roman Missal. '''The edition of the Missal to be used on these occasions should be that published again by the Decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites (27 January 1965), and with the modifications indicated in the Instructio altera (4 May 1967).'''

This faculty may be granted provided that groups make the request for reasons of genuine devotion, and provided that the permission does not disturb or damage the general communion of the faithful. For this reason the permission is limited to certain groups on special occasions; at all regular parish and other community Masses, the Order of the Mass given in the new Roman Missal should be used. Since the Eucharist is the sacrament of unity, it is necessary that the use of the Order of Mass given in the former Missal should not become a sign or cause of disunity in the Catholic community. For this reason agreement among the Bishops of the Episcopal Conference as to how this faculty is to be exercised will be a further guarantee of unity of praxis in this area.

2. Priests who on occasion wish to celebrate Mass according to the above-mentioned edition of the Roman Missal may do so by consent of their Ordinary and in accordance with the norms given by the same. When these priests celebrate Mass with the people and wish to use the rites and texts of the former Missal, the conditions and limits mentioned above for celebration by certain groups on special occasions are to be applied.

With my highest respects, I am

Yours sincerely in Christ,

(Signed:)
A. Bugnini
Secretary
Sacra Congregatio pro Cultu Divino&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Ahurani'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; is the [[Avestan]] language name of a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] (class of) divinity associated with "the waters" ([[Aban|''āpō'']]). In scripture, the expression ''ahurani'' appears both in the singular and in the plural, and may - subject to context - either denote a specific divinity named Ahurani, or a class of divinities that are ''ahurani''s.

The [[Avestan]] feminine suffix ''-ani'' denotes "companion, wife, mate", hence ''ahurani'' means "partner of ''ahura''." The ''ahura'' of the name may or may not be a reference to [[Ahura Mazda]] or to the other [[Ahura]]s. Following recent scholarship (see [[Ahura]] for details), it is now generally supposed that there was once been a divinity whose proper name was *Ahura, and from whom the various ''ahura''s of the [[Avesta]] receive this epithet.

==In scripture==

===In the ''Yasna Haptanghaiti''===
In the ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'', the ''ahurani''s are invoked in the plural, as "companions of the ''[[ahura]]''."&lt;!--  (''Yasna'' 38.3) --&gt; In these verses of great antiquity and linguistically as old as the [[Gathas]], they are also said to be "created by [[Ahura Mazda]]" (''Yasna'' 38.4).

===In the Younger Avesta===
In the Younger Avesta, the expression appears in the singular: Ahurani bears gifts of health, prosperity, renown, and for the well-being of the soul (''Yasna'' 68.3-4). In ''Yasna'' 68.11, the devotee asks Ahurani for a long life and a welcome in the radiant abode of the righteous (i.e. paradise, cf. ''[[ashavan]]'').

In ''Yasna'' 68, which is a "hidden" (since not explicitly dedicated to them) ''[[Yasht]]'', the "''ahuric'' one of (the) Ahura," appears to represent water in all its variations: rivers, wells, lakes, seas, snow and rain (''Yasna'' 68.6). As such, the single divinity appears to be synonymous with the ''*apas'', the group of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] divinities of the waters.

In other verses, the waters are themselves revered as the ''ahurani''s (''Yasna'' 38.3). The ''ahurani''s enlighten thought, speech and actions (''Yasna'' 68.4). This is in line with the Indo-Iranian tradition of identifying water with wisdom (Avestan: ''[[Ahura Mazda|mazda]]''). The ''ahurani''s as described as bringers of fertility and peace. In ''Yasna'' 68.1-2 (cf. [[Ab-Zohr]], "offering to water"), the celebrant priest offers the ''ahurani''s a libation of milk and butter (representing animal creation).

==In tradition==
Ahurani(s) are not included in any list of [[yazatas]], nor do they/does she have a day-name dedication in the [[Zoroastrian calendar]]. This may be because in later Zoroastrianism [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]] dominates as divinity of the waters, and it is to her that the hymn to the waters (the ''Aban Yasht'') is dedicated.

There appear to be historic parallels between the Avestan ''ahurani''s and the [[RigVeda|RigVedic]] ''varunani''s, the "wives of [[Varuna]]." These parallels are one of the points of comparison for the theory that Ahura Mazda and Varuna both descend from a common predecessor (see [[Ahura Mazda]] for details).

[[Image:O3m AryaSamaj.PNG|right|thumb|260px|&lt;center&gt;AUM or OM is considered by the Arya Samaj to be the highest and most proper name of God.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''[[Arya Samaj]]''' is a [[Hindu reform movement]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=Vinay|author2=Goolam Vahed|title=Hinduism in South Africa: Caste, Ethnicity, and Invented Traditions, 1860-Present|journal=J Sociology Soc Anth|year=2013|volume=4|issue=1-2|pages=1–15|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSSA/JSSA-04-0-000-13-Web/JSSA-04-1-2-000-13-Abst-PDF/JSSA-04-(1-2)-001-13-063-049-Lal-V/JSSA-04-(1-2)-001-13-049-Lal-V-Tt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other parts of the world where people of [[India]]n origin are settled, the teachings of [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayanand Saraswati]], founder of the [[Arya Samaj]], made their way to South Africa during the beginning of the twentieth century. The Arya Samaj encouraged [[Indian South African]]s to take pride in their heritage and culture and promoted education and social reform.

==History==
===Early preachers and missionaries ===
[[Bhai Parmanand]], the first Arya Samaj missionary to arrive in South Africa, arrived on 5 August 1905.{{citation needed| date=May 2012}}  During his four-month stay, he travelled to [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]. He was a dynamic orator in both English and [[Hindi]] and was received with enthusiasm by the local Indian community, including [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hindustan.net/discus/messages/59/7813.html?940177813|title=Pakistan : Past Future Solutions Policy: 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Hindustan Network|accessdate=5 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927033550/http://hindustan.net/discus/messages/59/7813.html?940177813|archivedate=September 27, 2007}} &lt;/ref&gt; He delivered discourses on [[Hindu culture]], religion, Indian civilisation, faith in God, ceremonies, the importance of the mother tongue and education.  He emphasised the importance and significance of festivals and since then ''[[Deepavali]]'' has come to be recognised as a festival of Hindus.  He established grassroots Arya Samaj committees to consolidate Hinduism amongst the Indians, established the Hindu Reform Society of Durban and the Hindu Young Men's Association in Pietermaritzburg and motivated the formation of the ''Hindu Maha Sabha'', an organisation bringing together the diverse Hindu groups under one banner.

Swami Shankaranand, who arrived in South Africa on 4 October 1908, urged Hindus to have pride in their religion and stressed the importance of religious lectures, rites and the study of Indian vernaculars. He succeeded in making Deepavali, the birth of Lord Rama and the birth of Lord Krishna important dates in the Hindu calendar. He founded  Veda Dharma Sabhas in Durban and Pietermaritzburg but his greatest contribution was the establishment of the ''Hindu Maha Sabha'' in 1912.

The first locally born Arya Samaj activist was Pundit Bhawani Dayal, who returned from India at the age of twenty in 1912. He preached the [[Śrauta|Vedic religion]] and pioneered the propagation of Hindi in South Africa.   He and his wife, involved themselves in Gandhi's ''satyagraha'' and were both imprisoned. In 1916, he organised a Hindi literary conference in Ladysmith and was the editor of two local Hindi language newspapers.

Another preacher, Swami Mangalanand Puri, came to [[Natal Province|Natal]] in 1913.  He delivered lectures under the auspices of the ''Arya Yuvak Sabha'' and proved to be an eloquent Hindi orator.  During his time, he attracted many young men who joined the Arya Samaj. In 1921 Pundit Ishwardutt Vedalankar, a graduate of Gurukul Kangadi (in India), came to Natal under the banner of the ''Arya Yuvak Sabha''.  As an eloquent speaker he attracted large audiences of all faiths.  He concentrated on the correct performance of religious ceremonies and drew large crowds at ''Ramayan'' recitals.

=== Establishment of a central organisation ===
By the beginning of the 1920s, a number of Arya Samajs had been established in Natal. Under the guidance of D.G. Satyadeva, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha in Natal was established on 22 February 1925, with its headquarters in [[Durban]]. The first officials elected were Pt Bhawani Dayal (President), B A Maghrajh (Secretary), P R Pather (assist Secretary), and R K Kaptain (Treasurer). Two years later on 23 October 1927, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, Natal, was to affiliated to the Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (International Arya League).

== Aims and activities of Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (SA) ==
The aims of Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (SA) are to encourage the establishment, organisation and consolidation of Arya Samajs and Vedic institutions in South Africa, elucidate the tenets of Arya Samaj and to foster these principles in the country, disseminate Vedic religion and philosophy, promote the art, culture and civilisation of India, encourage and advocate the study of Hindi and other Indian languages, protect and defend the rights of Hindus and to concern itself with their spiritual, moral and social upliftment, and to co-operate with other Hindu organisations on matters affecting the Hindu Community.

=== Visiting preachers and missionaries ===
Many learned Vedic scholars and highly trained preachers visited South Africa under the auspices of the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha to promote Vedic Culture. These included: 
* Professor Ralaram of D A V College, Hoshiarpur, India who arrived in 1931 and delivered lectures on the Vedic religion.
* Mehta Jaimini who arrived in 1934 and launched the South African Hindu Maha Sabha.
* Pundit Anand Priyaji, who arrived with a contingent of girls' guides from Arya Kanya Mahavidyalaya of Baroda, India, and gave a display of physical culture, sang national and religious songs and through their forceful impressive speeches spread the teachings of the Vedic Religion.
* Professor Yashpal in 1937 and demonstrated the powers of Yoga.
* Pundit Rishiram visited South Africa in 1937 and 1945 and carried out teachings based on the Vedas, Upanishads and Gita.

=== Veda Niketan ===
The Veda Niketan concentrates on the dissemination of the Vedic religion by means of publication of literature and production of any material e.g. cassettes - audio and video, compact discs, software, websites and conducts a series of graded examinations on Hindu Dharma.

=== Vedic Purohit Mandal ===
The Vedic Purohit Mandal (Academy of Vedic Priests) conducts systematic classes for the training of priests regardless of caste, creed, gender or colour.  The Mandal enjoys a large membership of women priests.

=== Hindi Education ===
Arya Samaj has always encouraged the teaching of Hindi. In 1925, an organisation for the promotion of [[Hindi]] within the Arya Samaj, the ''Hindi Siksha Sangh'' (Hindi Education Union) was established. The Sangh established a uniform syllabus, conducted Hindi classes and wrote examinations.

It was reported to have been led by a "Pakistani citizen of Xinjiang origin" -- a [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] named [[Abdul Rasul (Uyghur)|Abdul Rasul]].

In 1999 the ''[[Kashmir Sentinel]]'', a newspaper published in the [[India]]n part of the
disputed region of [[Kashmir]], asserted that Pakistan was encouraging expatriate Uyghur militants in an attempt to destabilize China's Xinjiang Province, and named the Asian Muslim Human Rights Bureau as a "front group".&lt;ref&gt;

'''The Australian National Imams Council''' (ANIC) was formed in 2006 during a meeting of more than 80 Sunni [[imam]]s which had gathered to discuss the crisis created by comments made by [[Taj El-Din Hilaly]].&lt;ref name=Duffy&gt;{{cite news|last=Duffy|first=Conor|title=Reclaim the Streets rally protests Hilali comments|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2006/s1775716.htm|newspaper=ABC|date=28 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rane&gt;{{cite book|last=Rane|first=Halim|title=Islam and the Australian News Media|year=2010|publisher=Melbourne University Press|isbn=978-0522856408|author2=Jacqui Ewart |author3=Mohamad Osman imran dushbag |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they requested that the Darulfatwa-supported [[2MFM|Muslim Community Radio Incorporated]] not have its licence renewed due to ties with [[Al-Ahbash]] and because of its promotion of "sectarian fringe views".&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Natalie|title=Muslims call for 'radical' radio station to be closed|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/muslims-call-for-radical-radio-station-to-be-closed-20110108-19j9r.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANIC has called for the offence of "advocating terrorism" to be removed from the "Foreign Fighters Bill", currently before the Australian Parliament, saying a cleric could fall foul of the law if he simply "advocated the duty of a Muslim to defend his land" or referred to stories in the Quran, Bible and Torah in his sermons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/muslims-warn-antiterror-laws-could-prevent-teaching-from-koran-20141008-1137lj.html  |title=Muslims warn anti-terror laws could prevent teaching from Koran |author=Aston, Heath|date=8 October 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Though a Bahá'í was in nearby Mauritius in 1910&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | title = The Mashrak-el-Azkar| journal = Star of the West | volume = 01 | issue = 03 | page = 15| publisher = Bahá'í News Service | location = Chicago, USA | date =  April 28, 1910 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_star_west_1&amp;chapter=3 | editor-last = Windust | editor-first = Albert R | editor2-last = Buikema | editor2-first = Gertrude | accessdate = 2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first mention of Madagascar in the literature of the Bahá'í Faith was in a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in 1916-1917 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, who asked the followers of the religion to travel to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].&lt;ref name="tablets"/&gt;  The publication was delayed until 1919 in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919. after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá” in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.…. Similarly, if possible, they should travel to the continent of Africa, (islands like) Mauritius, etc., and in those countries summon the people to the Kingdom of God and raise the cry of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” They must also upraise the flag of the oneness of the world of humanity in the island of Madagascar.&lt;ref name="tablets"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1953 [[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, planned an international teaching plan to systematically implement the goals outlined termed the [[Ten Year Crusade]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South Africa |title=Bahá'ís in South Africa - Progress of the Bahá'í Faith in South Africa since 1911 |work=Official Website |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South Africa |year=1997 |url=http://www.bahai.org.za/cm/node/19 |accessdate=2008-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408202119/http://www.bahai.org.za/cm/node/19 |archivedate=8 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Bahá'í to [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] to Madagascar arrived in 1953&lt;ref name="50thAnniv"/&gt; when Meherangiz Munsiff, an [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Asian Indian]] arrived from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = International News; Great Britain; African Goals Achieved | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1953 | number = 267 | page = 9 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to stay through the hospitality of a local Muslim family&lt;ref name="50thAnniv"/&gt; and later with the Robert family, of Tananarive (now Antananarivo), who were among the first to become Bahá'ís in Madagascar and who later played an outstanding role in the history of the religion here. Suffering ill health, Munsiff left in January 1954 a day after Danile Randrianarivo, 29, joined the religion, becoming the first Malagasy Bahá'í. Jalal Nakhjavani, brother of [[Ali Nakhjavani]], was elected to the first National Spiritual Assembly of Central and East Africa in 1954. It was at this time that he made extensive teaching trips visiting the islands of Zanzibar, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and the Comoro Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | page = 798 | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/773-800.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 the first Assembly of Madagagar was elected.&lt;ref name="50thAnniv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another source notes 1956:[http://www.bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/light/time-line-bahai.htm Major events of the Century of Light] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517111900/http://bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/light/time-line-bahai.htm |date=2008-05-17 }} Prepared by Dr. Ahmadi&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1955 five introductory pamphlets on the religion were published by the British Baha'i Publishing Trust in the [[Malagasy language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = World Crusade; Translations in African Languages | journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1955 | number = 292 | page = 12 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1956 the religion was present in small numbers across 15 countries of southern Africa including islands.&lt;ref name ="history"/&gt;  To administer the Bahá'í communities across southern Africa a regional governing body was elected based in South Africa to cover them all called the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South &amp; West Africa in 1956.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on Research on National Spiritual Assemblies | work = Research notes | publisher = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation | accessdate = 2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
In March 1960 the islands of Mauritius and Madagascar were swept by cyclone Carol. In both places some of the Bahá'ís lost their homes, but it is reported they still kept the [[Nineteen Day Fast]] and to hold their meetings, often in the open air. One community in Madagascar held a [[Nineteen Day Feast]] during the cyclone, with only three absentees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= Rabbani, Ruhiyyih |authorlink=Rúhíyyih Khanum |year= 1992 |title= The Ministry of the Custodians 1957-1963 |publisher= Bahá'í World Centre |isbn= 0-85398-350-X |url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians |page = 222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June Madagascar gained independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Timeline Madagascar  | publisher = TimelinesDb.com  | url = http://timelines.ws/countries/MADAGASCAR.HTML | accessdate = 2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963 there was still one Bahá'í assembly in the country - in [[Antananarivo]] - but groups of Bahá'ís lived in [[Ambohimanga]], [[Juan de Nova Island]], Mangatany, [[Nosy Be]] Island.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

In 1966 Arthur J. Gustave Ruggoo pioneered to the Seychelles for several years but occasionally he would undertake special projects promulgating the religion in Réunion and Madagascar.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre  | pages = 755, 761 | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/748-772.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 1967 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]], the first to visit Madagascar spent several days there as part of a trip through the Islands of the Indian Ocean basin.&lt;ref name="BN442"/&gt; Counter to most of her trips she spent the whole period in the city - Tananarive, the capital, because of the 10 days she spent in Madagascar she was taking bed rest for five days. Nevertheless, of her five active days she spoke at nine gatherings.

In 1969 a youth committee was organized and operating in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = News Briefs (con.) | journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1955 | number = 456 | page = 9| url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1970 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir]] visited the island consulting with its institutions and participating in events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Hand of the Cause Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir; In East Africa | journal = Bahá'í News |date=October 1970 | number = 476 | page = 7| url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the first national convention was gathered to elect the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Madagascar and Hand of the Cause Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir represented the [[Universal House of Justice]] at the proceedings.&lt;ref name="50thAnniv"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Malagasy Republic-First Annual Convention | journal = Bahá'í News |date=November 1972 | number = 499 | page = 8 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1977 a regional conference on the progress of the religion on the island was held in [[Manakara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Around the World; MAdagascar; Thirty deflare during conference | journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1972 | number = 499 | page = 12 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bahá'í refugee from the [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]] in Iran, Martha Sobhani, left Iran in 1978. She moved to Madagascar to work with Bahá'í youth and fell in love with her future husband, a native of Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Kaplan | first = David| title = Family firm pulls through | newspaper = Houston Chronicle | publisher = Hearst Newspapers | date = May 10, 2007 | url = http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/4790654.html | accessdate = 2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1979, the Bahá'ís of Tananarive hosted a conference in celebration of [[Universal Children's Day]]. The proceedings were chaired by an 11-year-old pre-youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Around the World; Madagascar; Thirty deflare during conference | journal = Bahá'í News |date=July 1980 | number = 592 | ISSN = 0195-9212 | page = 16 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long time Bahá'í Seewoosumbur Jeehoba Appa of Mauritius died in 1981 when he accompanied [[Institution of the Counsellors|Continental Counsellor]] Shídán Fath-i-A'zam to Madagascar.&lt;ref name="xviii"/&gt; In Sept-Oct 1983 twenty-one Malagasy Bahá'í volunteers took part in trips following three regional institutes on the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The World; Madagascar | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1984 | number = 638 | ISSN = 0195-9212 | page = 16 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiplication of involvements==
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen  | first = Moojan  | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran  | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith"  | publisher = Bahai-library.com  | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development  | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon  | first = Geeta Gandhi | title  = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"/&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 |  url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988|volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

In September 10–15, 1986 Bahá'í youth participated in a national Youth Fair in Antananarivo and won first prize for their display and second prize for their musical event at this fair, whose theme was "Youth, Peace and Development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Special Report; The International Year of Peace | journal = Bahá'í News |date=September 1987 | number = 678 | ISSN = 0195-9212 | page = 8 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 1989 Bahá'ís in several communities organized a campaign to engage the awareness of governmental and neighborhood leaders with the religion. At these meetings books were presented and the Bahá'ís described ways they had engaged in socio-economic development projects and asked what more they could do. Displays on the religion were set up and invitations were sent out for neighbors to attend prayer meetings at local Bahá'í centers. These events resulted in some 700 people joining the religion in a year's time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The World; Madagascar | journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1989 | number = 700 | ISSN = 0195-9212 | page = 15 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Malagasy Republic | journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1990 | number = 712 | ISSN = 0195-9212 | page = 17 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern community==
At the 2003 50th anniversary of the arrival of the religion on the island celebrations were held and two ministers from the Malagasy government gave speeches praising the religion for its teachings of universal unity and peace. The media covered the events. Several newspapers published articles about the events, and the national television channel covered the closing ceremony.&lt;ref name="50thAnniv"/&gt;

===Demographics===
By 2003 there were 33 local assemblies.&lt;ref name="50thAnniv"/&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] in 2005 estimated about 17,900 (0.1% of the national population) Bahá'ís in the country.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt;

'''Bhuee/Bhooi/Bhui/Bhooee/Bhuopolus''' is an Indian Clan name of Greek origin. Typically, Bhuopolus people were carpenters in [[ancient Greece]]. In India, Bhuee are categorized as [[Vishwakarmas]], or in North India as a subdivision of [[Kshatriya]]/[[Rajput]] tribe) clan found in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] (India), mostly in [[Jalandhar]], [[Mohali]], [[Kartarpur, India|Kartarpur]], [[Amritsar]], and [[Chandigarh]]. Bhuees are of [[Indo-Scythian]] and [[Georgian people|Georgian]] origin, like some other Kshatriya/Rajput clans. Like most North Indians, Bhuees found their way into [[India]] when they accompanied [[Alexander]] as his soldiers.  The name of the clan is thought to have adopted from an ancient river in [[Bisaltes]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Lal, B.B. 2005. The Homeland of the Aryans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28490">[[File:SunMyungMoonBlessing.jpg|thumb|Rev and Mrs Moon preside over a mass blessing ceremony]]
The '''Holy Marriage Blessing Ceremony''' is a large-scale [[wedding]] or [[marriage rededication ceremony]] sponsored by the [[Unification Church]]. It is given to married or engaged couples. Through it, members of the Unification Church believe that the couple is removed from the lineage of [[sin]]ful humanity and engrafted into God’s sinless lineage.   As a result, the couple’s marital relationship—and any children born after the Blessing—exist free from the consequences of [[original sin]]. (Children born into Blessed Central Families are known as Blessed Children or second generation, third generation, etc.)

For [[Unificationist (religion)|Unificationist]]s, these interracial, interreligious and international mass marriage ceremonies symbolize the family as the hope for [[peace]].  The Blessing ceremony has become the most famous [[ritual]] of the Unification Church.&lt;ref name=siegler2007&gt;[[Elijah Siegler]], 2007, ''New Religious Movements'', [[Prentice Hall]], {{ISBN|0131834789}}, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The men and women who receive the Blessing are called "Blessed Central Families" who are conducive to the establishment of Cheon Il Guk (the Kingdom of Heaven.)

==Purpose==
[[Frank Kaufmann]], a leading Unificationist scholar, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not have mass weddings because Reverend Moon doesn't know any better, doesn't know how Americans react to things, or that he stubbornly adheres to some odd Korean habit. Our matchings and weddings are a direct and perfect manifestation of a profound theology and world view. You see, Unificationists believe that all the problems on Earth, from the Gulf War, to child abuse, to the crumbling school system (you name it) are fruits of the fact that self-interest crept into the family, the love between husband and wife, reproductive affairs, and parent-child relationships, thus since the beginning there has never been even one family whose members were not dominated by some significant degree of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tparents.org/library/unification/talks/kaufmann/MATCH.htm|title=The Words of Frank Kaufmannn|website=www.tparents.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholars have noted the Blessing ceremony allows Unification Church members to express their belief in an international, inter-racial "family of God."&lt;ref name = siegler2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene V. Gallagher]], 2004, ''The New Religious Movement Experience in America'', [[Greenwood Press]], {{ISBN|0313328072}}, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the words of the Reverend Moon, he once described the meaning of the Marriage Blessing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then what is the ultimate reason why we need to do it?  It is because our human ancestors fell.  If our first ancestors had not fallen, it would not be necessary for us to receive the Blessing.  But we have to reverse the fallen process.  We have no other way to return to God's realm of authority than through a course that restores the fall.  That is why human beings until now have pursued religion, for this is the direction and purpose of human history.&lt;ref name="tparents.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tparents.org/Moon-Talks/SunMyungMoon76/761003.htm|title=Perfection and Gratitude - Sun Myung Moon|website=tparents.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Blessings of church members===
The Blessing ceremony was first held in 1961 for 36 couples in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] by [[Sun Myung Moon]] and his wife [[Hak Ja Han]], shortly after their own marriage in 1960.  All the couples were members of the Unification Church.  Moon matched all of the couples except the 12 who were already married to each other from before joining the church, which was officially founded in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dci.dk/?artikel=388 Duddy, Neil ''Interview: Dr. Mose Durst] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015615/http://www.dci.dk/?artikel=388 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Blessing ceremonies were larger in scale but followed the same pattern with all participants Unification Church members and Moon matching most of the couples.  In 1982 the first large scale Blessing held outside of Korea took place in [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. In 1988, Moon matched 2,500 Korean members with Japanese members for a Blessing ceremony held in Korea, partly in order to promote unity between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petermaass.com/core.cfm?p=3&amp;news=2&amp;newspaper=39 MARRIAGE BY THE NUMBERS; MOON PRESIDES AS 6,500 COUPLES WED IN S.

The Blessing ceremonies have attracted a lot of attention in the press and in the public imagination, often being labeled "mass weddings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/chi-0604sushi-1-sidebar,0,6972307.htmlstory Despite controversy, Moon and his church moving into mainstream] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725201717/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/chi-0604sushi-1-sidebar,0,6972307.htmlstory |date=2008-07-25 }} [[Chicago Tribune]], April 11, 2006. 'The church's most spectacular rite remains mass weddings, which the church calls the way "fallen men and women can be engrafted into the true lineage of God."'&lt;/ref&gt; However, in most cases the Blessing ceremony is not a legal [[wedding]] ceremony. Some couples are already married and those that are engaged are later legally married according to the laws of their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/unification/wedd97.htm At RFK, Moon Presides Over Mass Wedding], ''The Washington Post'', November 3, 1997, "Church and stadium officials estimated that more than 40,000 people, mostly couples, attended the event, including the Moon-matched couples who took their marriage vows on the football field and exchanged gold rings displaying the church symbol. Those couples, however, must still fulfill whatever requirements exist where they live to be considered legally married."&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' referred to a 1997 ceremony for 28,000 couples as a "marriage affirmation ceremony," adding: "The real weddings were held later in separate legal ceremonies." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/30/us/28000-couples-gather-for-rev-moon-rites.html 28,000 Couples Gather for Rev.

===Blessing extended to non-members===
The 1990s saw a big change when Rev. Moon allowed the Blessing to be given to other people besides Unification Church members. This liberalization led to a great increase in the number of Blessed couples, with most of them having been already married and not Unification Church members.  It is possible for any Blessed couple to give the Blessing to other couples and this is being done in many cases by ministers of other churches who have received the Blessing though their association with the Unification Church. Ministers of other faiths, including [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] have served as "co-officiators" at Blessing ceremonies presided over by Rev. and Mrs. Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/moon_1199.htm From the Unification Church to the Unification Movement, 1994-1999: Five Years of Dramatic Changes] Massimo Introvigne, [[Center for Studies on New Religions]] "The ceremony in Washington, D.C., included six "co-officiators" from other faiths, including controversial minister Louis Farrakhan from the Nation of Islam. The Blessing ceremony in Seoul on February 7, 1999 also featured seven co-officiators including Orthodox Rabbi Virgil Kranz (Chairman of the American Jewish Assembly), controversial Catholic Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo and the General Superintendent of the Church of God in Christ (a large African American Pentecostal denomination), Rev. T.L. Barrett."&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001 couples Blessed by Moon have been able to arrange marriages for their own children, without his direct guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/02/AR2010010200621.html?hpid=moreheadlines&amp;sid=ST2010010201386 Children of Moon church's mass-wedding age face a crossroads], ''The Washington Post'', January 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Adult Unificationists (those who joined on their own without family ties) and Blessed Children (those whose parents received the Blessing of Marriage) each follow a similar yet distinct process in preparing for marriage, being matched (engaged) and finally receiving the Blessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matching and Blessing|url=http://bfm.familyfed.org|publisher=FFWPU USA|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Non-Unificationists (people of other faiths, nonreligious) who believe in the ideals of the church teachings can also be part of the Marriage Blessing.  People who are already married are also welcome and can begin walking a path towards the Blessing.  On October 3, 1976 Reverend Moon is quoted saying "The international Blessing developed by the Unification Church is not a wedding which is limited to only Unification Church members.  This is the official course that all human beings must pass through.  We should clearly understand this fact."&lt;ref name="tparents.org"/&gt;

The basic process for children who grew up in the church and others who want to get married is described in their [http://bfm.familyfed.org/ official website.]  There, it also describes the training and workshops one must go through to understand the value of the Blessing, become candidates and learn why marriage is the key for building God's Kingdom.  Adult Unificationists and Blessed Children can receive support from either their parents or their matching advisors as they prepare for the matching and the Blessing.  Married couples can go through marriage enhancement workshops after being Blessed.

==Ceremonial practices==
The traditional steps for completing the sanctity of the blessing ceremony is the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unification.org/intro_blessing.html Introduction to the Blessing Ceremony] Official website of the United States Unification Church.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Chastening Ceremony. The couple strike each other{{clarify|reason=They actually hit each other?!|date=April 2017}} three times to symbolically make an end to sin and prepare for a new beginning.
#The Holy Wine Ceremony.  The couple share a cup of Holy Wine (or grape juice) symbolizing their engrafting into God’s sinless lineage.
#The Holy Blessing Ceremony.  The couple exchange vows.  A prayer is offered by the officiators.  The couple is sprinkled with [[holy water]].
#The Separation Period.  The couple refrains from having sexual relations for a period (most often 40 days, but in some cases much longer) before consummating or re-consummating their marriage.
#The Three Day Ceremony.  The couple begins, or re-begins, their married life in a highly symbolic ceremony over three days which is considered to reverse the [[Fall of Man|fall]] of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]].

Couples taking part in Blessing ceremonies exchange these four vows:&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Introvigne, [http://www.cesnur.org/testi/moon_1199.htm From the Unification Church to the Unification Movement, 1994-1999: Five Years of Dramatic Changes], 1999, [[Center for Studies on New Religions]]&lt;/ref&gt;

#To become a true man or woman who practices sexual purity and lives for the sake of others.
#To become a true husband or wife who respects True Parents' example and establishes an eternal family which brings joy to God.
#To become a parent who educates his or her children to follow the tradition of true love for the sake of the family and world.
#To create an ideal family which contributes to world peace.

==Reaction==
Moon's practice of matching couples was very unusual in both Christian tradition and in modern Western culture and attracted much attention and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;The men and women entered a large room, where Moon began matching couples by pointing at them."[http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/sides-moon-marriages-article-1.267920 NY Daily News]  "In the Unification tradition, romantic liaisons are forbidden until the members are deemed by Mr. Moon to be spiritually ready to be matched at a huge gathering where he points future spouses out to one another. His followers believe that his decisions are based on his ability to discern their suitability and see their future descendants. Many are matched with people of other races and nationalities, in keeping with Mr. Moon's ideal of unifying all races and nations in the Unification Church.  Though some couples are matched immediately before the mass wedding ceremonies, which are held every two or three years, most have long engagements during which they are typically posted in different cities or even continents, and get to know one another through letters."[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/22/nyregion/look-life-after-mass-marriage-for-2075-couples-give-take-200-10-years-together.html?pagewanted=all NY Times] "Many were personally matched by Moon, who taught that romantic love led to sexual promiscuity, mismatched couples and dysfunctional societies. Moon’s preference for cross-cultural marriages also meant that couples often shared no common language."[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/03/moonies-mass-wedding-south-korea-unification-church-hak-ja-han-sun-myung-moon Manchester Guardian]  "Moon’s death Sept. 2 and funeral Saturday signaled the end of the random pairings that helped make Moon’s Unification Church famous — and infamous — a generation ago."

It led to some strange pairs such as a 71-year-old African Catholic archbishop who wed a 43-year-old Korean acupuncturist.

Although they were often lumped together with monstrous races such as [[Cyclops|cyclopes]] and [[Cynocephali]], Bragmanni were normal in appearance, and differed from other humans because of their unique lifestyle.&lt;ref name=fritze&gt;Fritze, Ronald H. ''Travel Legend and Lore: An Encyclopedia''. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bragmanni were unclothed, cave-dwelling wise men who were extremely moralistic and ascetic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwestern.edu/ACS/latin/team9/worldview.htm Medieval World View (Southwestern University)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193431/http://www.southwestern.edu/ACS/latin/team9/worldview.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often merged or confused with [[Gymnosophists]], a similar group of wise men.&lt;ref name=fritze/&gt;

'''''Brugmansia''''' is a [[genus]] of seven species of flowering plants in the family [[Solanaceae]]. They are woody trees or shrubs, with pendulous flowers, and have no spines on their fruit. Their large, fragrant flowers give them their common name of '''angel's trumpets''', a name sometimes used for the closely related genus ''[[Datura]]''. (''Datura'' differ from ''Brugmansia'' in that they are herbaceous bushes, with erect rather than pendulous flowers - and most have spines on their fruit).

Like many ornamental plants, all parts of ''Brugmansia'' can be toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucanr.edu/sites/poisonous_safe_plants/Toxic_Plants_by_Scientific_Name_685/|title=Toxic Plants (by scientific name)|first=University of California Agriculture and Natural|last=Resources|website=ucanr.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; All seven species are known only in [[horticulture|cultivation]] or as escapes from cultivation, and no wild plants have ever been confirmed.  They are therefore listed as [[Extinct in the Wild]] by the [[IUCN Red List]], although they are popular ornamental plants and still exist wild outside their native range as introduced species.&lt;ref name='Preissel'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Preissel, U. |author2=Preissel, H. G. | title = Brugmansia and Datura: Angel's Trumpets and Thorn Apples | publisher = Firefly Books | year = 2002 | location = Buffalo, New York | pages = 106–129 | isbn = 1-55209-598-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is suspected that their extinction in the wild is due to the extinction of some animal which previously dispersed the seeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org IUCN Red List: search on ''Brugmansia'' and select any of the species.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Brugmansia'' are large shrubs or small trees, with semi-woody, often many-branched trunks.  They can reach heights of {{convert|3|–|11|m|abbr=on|0}}. The leaves are [[Phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]] along the stems, generally large, {{convert|10|–|30|cm|abbr=on|0}} long and {{convert|4|–|18|cm|abbr=on|0}} across, with an entire or coarsely toothed margin, and are often covered with fine hairs. The name "angel's trumpet" refers to the large, pendulous, trumpet-shaped flowers, {{convert|14|–|50|cm|abbr=on|0}} long and {{convert|10|–|35|cm|abbr=on|0}} across at the opening. They come in shades of white, yellow, pink, orange, green, or red.  Most have a strong, pleasing fragrance that is most noticeable in the evening.  Flowers may be single, double, or more.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Brugmansia'' are native to tropical regions of South America, along the Andes from Venezuela to northern Chile, and also in south-eastern Brazil.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt; They are grown as ornamental container plants worldwide, and have become [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in isolated tropical areas around the globe, including within North America, Africa, Australia, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Newmark | first = W.

==Ecology==
Most ''Brugmansia'' are fragrant in the evenings to attract pollinating moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Barwick | first = M. | title = Tropical and Subtropical Trees: An Encyclopedia | publisher = Timber Press | year = 2004 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Tropical-Subtropical-Trees-Margaret-Barwick/dp/0500511810/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323061514&amp;sr=1-1 | isbn = 978-0-88192-661-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One species lacking scent, the red-flowered ''[[Brugmansia sanguinea]]'',  is pollinated by long-billed hummingbirds.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;
''Brugmansia'' have two main stages to their life cycle.  In the initial vegetative stage the young seedling grows straight up on usually a single stalk, until it reaches its first main fork at {{convert|80|-|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high.  It will not flower until after it has reached this fork, and then only on new growth above the fork.  Cuttings taken from the lower vegetative region must also grow to a similar height before flowering, but cuttings from the upper flowering region will often flower at a very low height.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;

One interesting example of plant/animal interaction involves the butterfly ''[[Placidina|Placidula euryanassa]]'', which uses ''[[Brugmansia suaveolens]]'' as one of its main larval foods.  It has been shown that these can sequester the plant's tropane alkaloids and store them through the [[pupa]]l stage on to the adult butterfly, where they are then used as a defense mechanism, making themselves less palatable to [[vertebrate]] predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Eich | first = E. | title = Solanaceae and Convolvulaceae - Secondary Metabolites | year = 2008 | pages = 157–158 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-3-540-74540-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpYtUED_DSsC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=scopolamine+truth+drug+brugmansia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tnLYTsDuMunhiAK_49mfCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=scopolamine%20truth%20drug%20brugmansia&amp;f=false | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180217193534/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpYtUED_DSsC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=scopolamine+truth+drug+brugmansia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tnLYTsDuMunhiAK_49mfCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=scopolamine%20truth%20drug%20brugmansia&amp;f=false | archivedate = 2018-02-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
[[image:Brugmansia bicolor.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Antique painting of the red ''Brugmansia sanguinea''|''Brugmansia sanguinea'']][[Linnaeus]] first classified these plants as part of ''Datura'' with his 1753 description of ''[[Brugmansia arborea|Datura arborea]]''. Then in 1805, [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon|C. H. Persoon]] transferred them into a separate genus, ''Brugmansia'', named for Dutch naturalist [[Sebald Justinus Brugmans]].&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt; For another 168 years, various authors placed them back and forth between the genera of ''Brugmansia'' and ''Datura'', until in 1973, with  his detailed comparison of morphological differences, T.E. Lockwood settled them as separate genera, where they have stayed unchallenged since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lockwood | first = T. E. | title = Generic Recognition of ''Brugmansia''  | journal = Botanical Museum Leaflets | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 273–283 | year = 1973 | url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pdf3/005346200031872.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are 7 recognized species:&lt;ref name="Hay2012"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hay | first1 = A. | last2 = Gottschalk | first2 = M. | last3 = Holguín | first3 = A. | title = Huanduj: Brugmansia | publisher = Royal Botanic Gardens Kew | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-84246-477-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

These species are then divided into two natural, genetically isolated groups.&lt;ref name="Shaw, Julian M. H. 1999"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Shaw, J. M. H. | year = 1999 | title = Nomenclature Notes on ''Brugmansia'' | journal = The New Plantsman | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 148–151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Brugmansia'' section ''Brugmansia'' (the warm-growing group) includes the species ''aurea'', ''insignis'', ''sauveolens'', and ''versicolor''.  ''Brugmansia'' section ''Sphaerocarpium'' (the cold group) includes the species ''arborea'', ''sanguinea'', and ''vulcanicola''.&lt;ref name="Hay2012"/&gt;

Two of these species were challenged by Lockwood in his 1973 doctoral thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = T. E.  | title = A taxonomic revision of ''Brugmansia'' (Solanaceae) | oclc = 38575671 | year = 1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
First, ''Brugmansia vulcanicola'' was said to be a subspecies of ''B. sanguinea'', but this was refuted by Lockwood's former mentor, [[Richard Evans Schultes|R. E. Schultes]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schultes | first = R. E. | author2 = Bright, A. | title = A Native Drawing of an Hallucinogenic Plant From Colombia | journal = Botanical Museum Leaflets | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | publisher = Harvard University | location = Cambridge, MA | year = 1977 | url = http://www.wlbcenter.org/Schultes%20Publications/BotMusLeaf_25_151-159.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022427/http://www.wlbcenter.org/Schultes%20Publications/BotMusLeaf_25_151-159.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Second, Lockwood proposed that the species ''B. insignis'' was instead a hybrid of the combination (''B. suaveolens'' x ''B. versicolor'') x ''B. suaveolens''.  This was later disproved by crossbreeding experiments done by the Preissels, published in 1997.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Urarina shaman B Dean.jpg|thumb|right|Urarina [[shaman]], 1988. The [[Urarina people#Society and culture|Urarina]] use ''Brugmansia'' in their rituals.]]
''Brugmansia'' are most often grown today as flowering ornamental plants.

In modern medicine, important [[alkaloid]]s such as [[scopolamine]], [[hyoscyamine]], and [[atropine]], found in ''Brugmansia'' and other related members of Solanaceae, have proven medical value for their [[Muscle relaxant#Spasmolytics|spasmolytic]], [[asthma#medicine|anti-asthmatic]], [[anticholinergic]], [[narcotic]] and [[anesthetic]] properties, although many of these alkaloids, or their equivalents, are now artificially synthesized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schultes | first = R. E. | title = Ethnobotany and History of ''Brugmansia'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''Brugmansia'' have also traditionally been used in many South American indigenous cultures in medical preparations and as an [[entheogen]] in religious or spiritual ceremonies.&lt;ref name="The Way of the Shaman"&gt;{{cite book |last= Harner|first= Michael|date= 1980|title= The Way of the Shaman| location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medicinally, they have mostly been used externally as part of a [[poultice]], [[tincture]], ointment, or where the leaves are directly applied [[transdermal]]ly to the skin.  Traditional external uses have included the treating of aches and pains, [[dermatitis]], [[orchitis]], [[arthritis]], [[rheumatism]], headaches, infections, and as an [[anti-inflammatory]]. They have been used internally much more rarely due to the inherent dangers of ingestion. Internal uses, in highly diluted preparations, and often as a portion of a larger mix, have included treatments for stomach and muscle ailments, as a [[decongestant]], to induce vomiting, to expel worms and parasites, and as a sedative.&lt;ref name="Ritual use of Brugmansia"&gt;{{cite journal | last = de Feo | first = V. | title = The ritual use of ''Brugmansia'' species in traditional Andean medicine in Northern Peru | journal = Economic Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 58 | issue = Supplement 1 | pages = S221-S229 | doi = 10.1663/0013-0001(2004)58[S221:TRUOBS]2.0.CO;2 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/mn97320362543853/fulltext.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Duke | first1 = J.

Several South American cultures have used ''Brugmansia'' as a treatment for unruly children, that they might be admonished directly by their ancestors in the spirit world, and thereby become more compliant. Mixed with maize beer and tobacco leaves, it has been used to drug wives and slaves before they were buried alive with their dead lord.&lt;ref name="Ritual use of Brugmansia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultes1&gt;{{cite book | last = Schultes | first = R.

==Toxicity==
All parts of ''Brugmansia'' are potentially poisonous, with the seeds and leaves being especially dangerous.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Shamanism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biology Digest | publisher = Plexus | volume = 18 | year = 1991 | lccn = 75646463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Brugmansia'' are rich in [[scopolamine]] (hyoscine), [[hyoscyamine]], and several other [[tropane alkaloids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Evans, W. C. |author2=Lampard, J.

==Cultivation==
''Brugmansia'' are easily grown in a moist, fertile, well-drained soil, in sun to part shade, in frost-free climates. They begin to flower in mid to late spring in warm climates and continue into the fall (autumn), often continuing as late as early winter in warm conditions.  In cool winters, outdoor plants need protection from frost, but the roots are hardier, and may resprout in late spring.  The species from the higher elevations, in ''B''. section ''Sphaerocarpium'', prefer moderate temperatures and cool nights, and may not flower if temperatures are very hot.  Most ''Brugmansia'' may be propagated easily by rooting {{convert|10|-|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} cuttings taken from the end of a branch during the summer.

Several [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] and numerous [[cultivar]]s have been developed for use as ornamental plants. ''B. ''×'' candida'' is a hybrid between ''B. aurea'' and ''B. versicolor''; ''B. ''×'' flava'' is a hybrid between ''B. arborea'' and ''B. sanguinea''; and ''B. ''×'' cubensis''&lt;ref name="Shaw, Julian M. H. 1999"/&gt; is a hybrid between ''B. suaveolens'', ''B. versicolor'', and ''B. aurea''.  There are cultivars producing double flowers, and some with variegated leaves. The cultivar ''B.'' × ''candida'' '[[Grand Marnier]]' has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Brugmansia'' × ''candida'' 'Grand Marnier'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=263|accessdate=18 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807064451/http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=263|archivedate=7 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other Monpa, they are also adherents of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Like most [[Buddhist]] tribes, they built houses based on stones and follow a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] culture, though they might not be as advanced as the [[Monpa people|Monpa]]. Their language belongs to the [[Tibeto-Burman]] group.

{{Criticism of Islam}}

'''Criticism of Islam''' has existed since its formative stages. Early written disapproval came from [[Christian]]s as well as by some former Muslims such as [[Ibn al-Rawandi]].&lt;ref name="John of Damascus2"&gt;De Haeresibus by [[John of Damascus]]. See [[Migne]]. ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', vol. 94, 1864, cols 763–73. An English translation by the Reverend John W Voorhis appeared in ''The Moslem World'', October 1954, pp. 392–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Western criticism has grown in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islam's Problem With Blasphemy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/opinion/islams-problem-with-blasphemy.html|date=13 January 2015|first=Mustafa|last=Akyol|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects of criticism include the morality and authenticity of the [[Quran]] and the [[hadith]]s,&lt;ref name="BibleInQuran"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1032&amp;letter=B#3068 Bible in Mohammedian Literature.], by Kaufmann Kohler Duncan B.

== History ==

=== Early Islam ===
[[Image:John Damascus (arabic icon).gif|thumb|[[John of Damascus]] a Syrian [[monk]] and [[presbyter]], 19th-century Arabic [[icon]]]]
The earliest surviving written criticisms of Islam are to be found in the writings of [[Christian]]s who came under the early dominion of the Islamic [[Caliphate]]. One such Christian was [[John of Damascus]] (c. 676–749 [[Common Era|CE]]), who was familiar with Islam and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The second chapter of his book, ''The Fount of Wisdom'', titled "Concerning Heresies", presents a series of discussions between Christians and Muslims. John claimed an [[Arian]] [[monk]] (whom he did not know was [[Bahira]]) influenced Muhammad and viewed the Islamic doctrines as nothing more than a hodgepodge culled from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx Critique of Islam] St. John of Damascus&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2018}}

Other notable early critics of Islam included: [[Abu Isa al-Warraq]] and I[[Ibn al-Rawandi|bn al-Rawandi]], two 9th-century critics of Islam and religion in general,&lt;ref name="Doubt"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doubt: A History: The Great Doubters and Their Legacy of Innovation from Socrates and Jesus to Thomas Jefferson and Emily Dickinson|last=Hecht|first=Jennifer Michael|publisher=Harper San Francisco|year=2003|isbn=0060097957|authorlink=Jennifer Michael Hecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[al-Ma'arri]], an 11th-century Arab poet and critic of Islam and all other religions who was also known for his [[veganism]] and [[antinatalism]].&lt;ref name="Nicholson319"&gt;Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', p. 319. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Islamic world ===
In the early centuries of the Islamic [[Caliphate]], including the period ruled by the four [[Rashidun|Rashidun caliphs]] (often called the ''rightly guided caliphs)'',  [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permitted citizens to freely express their views, including criticism of Islam and religious authorities, without fear of persecution.&lt;ref name=Boisard&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Probable Influence of Islam on Western Public and International Law|first=Marcel A.|last=Boisard|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=11|issue=4|date=July 1980|pages=429–50|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|doi=10.1017/s0020743800054805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/nahjul/letters/letter53.htm|title=Nahjul Balagha Part 1, The Sermons|work=Al-Islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and Democracy|last=Ronald Bontekoe|first=Mariėtta Tigranovna Stepaniants|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0824819268|page=251|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there have been several notable critics and skeptics of Islam that arose from within the Islamic world itself. In tenth and eleventh-century Syria there lived a blind poet called [[Al-Ma'arri]]. He became well known for a poetry that was affected by a "pervasive pessimism." He labeled religions in general as "noxious weeds" and said that Islam does not have a monopoly on truth. He had particular contempt for the ''[[ulema]]'', writing that:

{{quotation|They recite their sacred books, although the fact informs me that these are fiction from first to last. O Reason, thou (alone) speakest the truth. Then perish the fools who forged the religious traditions or interpreted them!&lt;ref name="WarraqPoetry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warraq|first=Ibn |title=Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2003 |isbn=1591020689 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Moosa| first= Ebrahim | title=Ghazālī and the Poetics of Imagination | publisher=UNC Press | year= 2005 | isbn=0807829528| page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1280, before the [[Religion_in_the_Mongol_Empire#Islam|Mongol conversion to Islam]], Jewish philosopher [[Ibn Kammuna]] wrote his best known book ''Examination of the Three Faiths'' (also called ''Tanqih''). ''Tanqih'' is noted as having some recognizable bias in favor of [[rabbinic Judaism]], but the larger work also includes criticsms of Christianity and Judaism. Although the work is not considered a [[polemic]] against any one faith as a whole, his glosses for [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]]'s ''al-Ma‘alim'' contain some elements of anti-Islam polemic. Part of the highly technical [[theological]] discussion in this gloss contains a rejection of al-Razi's proofs for the establishment of Muhammad's prophetic mission, which al-Razi has based the validity of on miracles called ''[[mu'jizah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = Spring 2018| publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| editors = Edward N.

The section goes on to explain what Kammuna perceives to be the real reasons motivating converts to Islam (what [[Bernard Lewis]] calls "baser motives"):  "He is moved by fear or ambition; he is liable to a heavy tax, or wishes to escape from humiliation, or is taken prisoner, falls in love with a Muslim woman, or some other motives like these."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-691-00807-3| last = Lewis| first = Bernard| title = The Jews of Islam| date = 1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT84Jn7zjU0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pourjavadi /&gt; Scholars are uncertain whether Kammuna himself may have converted.&lt;ref name=pourjavadi /&gt;

=== Enlightenment Europe ===
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]]]

[[David Hume]] was critical of traditional religion and scholars generally agree that Hume was both a [[naturalist]] and a [[skeptic]] (though there is no agreement about whether Hume should be considered an [[atheist]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = Summer 2017| publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| editors = Edward N. Zalta (ed.)| last1 = Russell| first1 = Paul| last2 = Kraal| first2 = Anders| title = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| chapter = Hume on Religion| accessdate = 2018-12-03| date = 2017| chapterurl = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/hume-religion/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Natural Histories of Religion'' Hume argued that the main advantage [[monotheism]] offered over what he considered the primitive [[polytheistic]] form of religion was that monotheistic religions were "comformable to sound reason". In Hume's view Islam was an even stricter form of [[theism]] then the Christian doctrine of [[Trinity]]; as Hume associated the rise of theistic religions with [[rationalism]], Hume also finds Islam to be more "rational" then Christianity. Hume uses Islam to launch humorous critiques of the [[Eucharist]], namely he tells a story of a Turkish prisoner who is catechised and asked how many gods there were after taking his [[first communion]]; the prisoner replies "none" believing he had just eaten the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-134-60914-7| last1 = MacEoin| first1 = Denis| last2 = Al-Shahi| first2 = Ahmed| title = Islam in the Modern World (RLE Politics of Islam)| date = 2013-07-24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZQqAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commonly held view in Europe during the Enlightenment was that Islam, then synonomous with the [[Ottoman Empire]], was a bloody, ruthless and intolerant religion. In the European view, Islam lacked moral or divine authority, but Hume makes similar critical comments about the "bloody" and prolonged conflict fought between [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]] during the [[Reformation]]. There were many contemporary works by authors such as [[Isaac Barrow]], [[Humphrey Prideaux]], [[John Jackson (controversialist)|John Jackson]], [[Sir Charles Wolseley, 2nd Baronet|Charles Wolseley]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Paul Rycaut]], [[Thomas Hyde]], [[Pierre Bayle]], and [[Blaise Pascal]] that had been published on Islam that may have informed Hume's opinions. The writers of this period was also influenced by [[George Sale]] who, in 1743, had translated the Quran into [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Clarendon Press| isbn = 978-0-19-925188-9| last = Hume| first = David| title = A Dissertation on the Passions: The Natural History of Religion : a Critical Edition| date = 2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-VbQ2TPA70C&amp;pg=PA139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern world ===
In the early 20th century, the prevailing view among Europeans was that Islam was the root cause of Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] "backwardness". They saw Islam as an obstacle to assimilation, a view that was expressed by a writer in colonial [[French Algeria]] named [[André Servier]]. In his book, titled ''Islam and the Psychology of the Musulman'', Servier wrote that "The only thing Arabs ever invented was their religion. And this religion is, precisely, the main obstacle between them and us". Servier describes Islam as a "religious nationalism in which every Muslim brain is steeped". According to Servier, the only reason this nationalism has not "been able to pose a threat to humanity" was that the "rigid dogma" of Islam had rendered the Arabs "incapable of fighting against the material forces placed at the disposal of Western civilization by science and progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Syracuse University Press| isbn = 978-0-8156-3074-6| last = Lorcin| first = Patricia M.

==== Modern Christianity ====
The early 20th-century [[missionary]] James L. Barton argued that Islam's view of the sovereignty of God is so extreme and unbalanced as to produce a fatalism that stifles human initiative:&lt;ref name="Barton 1918"&gt;Barton, J. L. (1918). The Christian Approach to Islam (p. 139). Boston; Chicago: The Pilgrim Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Man is reduced to a cipher. Human agency and human freedom are nullified. Right is no longer right because it is right, but because Allah wills it to be right. It is for this reason that monotheism has in Islam stifled human effort and progress. It has become a deadening doctrine of fate. Man must believe and pray, but these do not insure salvation or any benefit except Allah wills it. Why should human effort strive by sanitary means to prevent disease, when death or life depends in no way on such measures but upon the will of Allah? One reason why Moslem countries are so stagnant and backward in all that goes to make up a high civilization is owing to the deadening effects of monotheism thus interpreted. ... even in the most extreme forms of the Augustinian and Calvinistic systems there were always present in Christianity other elements which prevented the conception of the divine sovereignty from paralyzing the healthy activities of life as the Mohammedan doctrine has done.&lt;ref name="Barton 1918"/&gt;}}

During a [[Regensburg lecture|lecture]] given at the [[University of Regensburg]] in 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] quoted an unfavorable remark about Islam made at the end of the 14th century by [[Byzantine]] ruler [[Manuel II Palaiologos]]:  "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5348436.stm BBC Article.

[[Nobel prize]]-winning novelist [[V.S. Naipaul]] stated that Islam requires its adherents to destroy everything which is not related to it. He described it as having a "calamitous effect on converted peoples, to be converted you have to destroy your past, destroy your history. You have to stamp on it, you have to say 'my ancestral culture does not exist, it doesn't matter'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/04/afghanistan.terrorism9 VS Naipaul launches attack on Islam], 4 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel prize]]-winning playwright [[Wole Soyinka]] stated that Islam had a role in denigrating African spiritual traditions. He criticized attempts to whitewash what he sees as the destructive and coercive history of Islam on the African continent: "Let those who wish to retain or evaluate religion as a twenty-first project feel free to do so, but let it not be done as a continuation of the game of denigration against the African spiritual heritage as in a recent television series perpetrated by Islam's born again revisionist of history"&lt;ref&gt;"Debating the African Condition: Race, gender, and culture conflict", by Alamin M. Mazrui, Willy Mutunga, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Soyinka also regarded Islam as "superstition", and said that it does not belong to Africa.

{{See also|History of the Quran|The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran|Criticism of the Quran|Historicity of Muhammad}}
'''Originality of Quranic manuscripts'''. According to traditional Islamic scholarship, all of the Quran was written down by Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]] while he was alive (during  610–632 CE), but it was primarily an orally related document. The written compilation of the whole Quran in its definite form as we have it now was completed around 20 years after the death of Mohammed.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 136–139"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415326397|pages=136–39|chapter=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wansbrough]], [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Yehuda D. Nevo]] argue that all the primary sources which exist are from 150–300 years after the events which they describe, and thus are chronologically far removed from those events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehuda D. Nevo]] "Towards a Prehistory of Islam," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam, vol.17, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1994 p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Wansbrough]] The Sectarian Milieu: Content and Composition of Islamic Salvation History, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1978 p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia Crone]], ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam,'' Princeton University Press, 1987 p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imperfections in the Quran'''. Critics reject the idea that the Quran is miraculously perfect and impossible to imitate as asserted in the Quran itself.&lt;ref&gt;See the verses {{Cite quran|2|2|style=ns}}, {{Cite quran|17|88|end=89|style=ns}}, {{Cite quran|29|47|style=ns}}, {{Cite quran|28|49|style=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901-1906 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', for example, writes: "The language of the Koran is held by the Mohammedans to be a peerless model of perfection. Critics, however, argue that peculiarities can be found in the text. For example, critics note that a sentence in which something is said concerning Allah is sometimes followed immediately by another in which Allah is the speaker (examples of this are suras xvi. 81, xxvii. 61, xxxi. 9, and xliii. 10.) Many peculiarities in the positions of words are due to the necessities of rhyme (lxix. 31, lxxiv. 3), while the use of many rare words and new forms may be traced to the same cause (comp. especially xix. 8, 9, 11, 16)."&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=363&amp;letter=K&amp;search=Koran "Koran"]. From the ''Jewish Encyclopedia''. Retrieved January 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; More serious are '''factual inaccuracies'''. For instance, Sura 25.53 claims that [[fresh water]] and salt water do not mix. While there may be cases in which these two bodies of water mix only slowly, every (fresh water) [[river]] that reaches an ocean will mix with salt water. Such areas of mixing are called [[Estuary|estuaries]] (e.g. at the mouth of the [[Río de la Plata]]).

'''Judaism and the Quran'''. According to the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', "The dependence of Mohammed upon his Jewish teachers or upon what he heard of the Jewish Haggadah and Jewish practices is now generally conceded."&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=363&amp;letter=K&amp;search=Koran "Koran"].

S. (1910). History of the Christian church. Third edition. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. Volume 4, Chapter III, section 44 "The Koran, And The Bible"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammed and God as speakers'''. According to [[Ibn Warraq]], the Persian rationalist, [[Ali Dashti]] criticized the Quran on the basis that for some passages, "the speaker cannot have been God."&lt;ref name="Warraq - Why I am Not"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Why I am Not a Muslim|last1=Warraq|first=|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=|isbn=0879759844|location=|page=106|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warraq gives Surah [[Al-Fatiha]] as an example of a passage which is "clearly addressed to God, in the form of a prayer."&lt;ref name="Warraq - Why I am Not"/&gt; He says that by only adding the word "say" in front of the passage, this difficulty could have been removed. Furthermore, it is also known that one of the companions of Muhammad, [[Ibn Masud]], rejected Surah Fatihah as being part of the Quran; these kind of disagreements are, in fact, common among the companions of Muhammad who could not decide which surahs were part of the Quran and which not.&lt;ref name="Warraq - Why I am Not"/&gt;

=== Reliability of the Hadith ===
{{Main|Criticism of Hadith}}
[[File:Syed Ahmed Khan.jpg|thumb|[[Syed Ahmad Khan]]]]
[[Hadith]] are Muslim traditions relating to the ''[[Sunnah]]'' (words and deeds) of Muhammad. They are drawn from the writings of scholars writing between 844 and 874 CE, more than 200 years after the death of Mohammed in 632 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atheists.org/Islam/mohammedanism.html An Atheist's Guide to Mohammedanism] by Frank Zindler&lt;/ref&gt; Within Islam, different [[Islamic schools and branches|schools, branches and sects]] have different opinions on the proper selection and use of Hadith. The four schools of Sunni Islam all consider Hadith second only to the Quran, although they differ on how much freedom of interpretation should be allowed to legal scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Goddard | first=Hugh| author2=Helen K. Bond (Ed.), Seth Daniel Kunin (Ed.), Francesca Aran Murphy (Ed.) | title=Religious Studies and Theology: An Introduction | publisher=New York University Press | year=2003| isbn=0814799140 | page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'i scholars disagree with Sunni scholars as to which Hadith should be considered reliable. The Shi'as accept the Sunnah of Ali and the Imams as authoritative in addition to the Sunnah of Muhammad, and as a consequence they maintain their own, different, collections of Hadith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Esposito| first=John | title=Islam: The Straight Path | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998| isbn=0195112342 | page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that there exists around the Hadith three major sources of corruption: political conflicts, sectarian prejudice, and the desire to translate the underlying meaning, rather than the original words verbatim.&lt;ref name="fedex"&gt;Brown, Daniel W. "Rethinking Tradition in Modern Islamic Thought", 1999. pp. 113, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim critics of the hadith, [[Quranism|Quranists]], reject the authority of hadith on theological grounds, pointing to verses in the Quran itself: "''Nothing have We omitted from the Book''",&lt;ref&gt;Quran, [[s:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/6. The Cattle|Chapter 6. The Cattle]]: 38&lt;/ref&gt; declaring that all necessary instruction can be found within the Quran, without reference to the Hadith. They claim that following the Hadith has led to people straying from the original purpose of God's revelation to Muhammad, adherence to the Quran alone.&lt;ref&gt;Donmez, Amber C. "The Difference Between Quran-Based Islam and Hadith-Based Islam"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghulam Ahmed Pervez]] (1903–1985) was a noted critic of the Hadith and believed that the Quran alone was all that was necessary to discern God's will and our obligations. A [[fatwa]], ruling, signed by more than a thousand orthodox clerics, denounced him as a 'kafir', a non-believer.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Aziz. "Islamic Modernism in India and Pakistan, 1857–1964". London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His seminal work, ''Maqam-e Hadith'' argued that the Hadith were composed of "the garbled words of previous centuries", but suggests that he is not against the ''idea'' of collected sayings of the Prophet, only that he would consider any hadith that goes against the teachings of Quran to have been falsely attributed to the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Pervez, Ghulam Ahmed. [http://www.tolueislam.com/Parwez/mh/mh.htm Maqam-e Hadith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113215748/http://www.tolueislam.com/Parwez/mh/mh.htm |date=2011-11-13 }}, [http://www.tolueislam.com/Urdu/mhadith/mh.htm Urdu version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004044003/http://www.tolueislam.com/Urdu/mhadith/mh.htm |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 Malaysian book "Hadith: A Re-evaluation" by [[Kassim Ahmad]] was met with controversy and some scholars declared him an [[apostate]] from Islam for suggesting that ""the hadith are sectarian, anti-science, anti-reason and anti-women."&lt;ref name="call"&gt;Latif, Abu Ruqayyah Farasat.

[[John Esposito]] notes that "Modern Western scholarship has seriously questioned the historicity and authenticity of the ''hadith''", maintaining that "the bulk of traditions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad were actually written much later." He mentions [[Joseph Schacht]], considered the father of the revisionist movement, as one scholar who argues this, claiming that Schacht "found no evidence of legal traditions before 722," from which Schacht concluded that "the Sunna of the Prophet is not the words and deeds of the Prophet, but apocryphal material" dating from later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Esposito| first=John | title=Islam: The Straight Path | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998| isbn=0195112342 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, such as [[Wilferd Madelung]], have argued that "wholesale rejection as late fiction is unjustified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Madelung| first=Wilferd | title=The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1997 | isbn=0521646960 | page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox Muslims do not deny the existence of false hadith, but believe that through the scholars' work, these false hadith have been largely eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;By Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, "Shi'ism", 1988. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of secondary evidence ===
[[Image:SanaaQuoranDoubleVersions.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sana'a manuscript]]s of the [[Quran]]]]
{{See also|Historiography of early Islam}}
The traditional view of Islam has also been criticised for the lack of supporting evidence consistent with that view, such as the lack of archaeological evidence, and discrepancies with non-Muslim literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-europe_islam/mohammed_3866.jsp|title=What do we actually know about Mohammed?|work=openDemocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, what has been described as a "wave of sceptical scholars" challenged a great deal of the received wisdom in Islamic studies.&lt;ref name="Donner 1998"&gt;Donner, Fred ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'', Darwin Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} They argued that the Islamic historical tradition had been greatly corrupted in transmission. They tried to correct or reconstruct the early history of Islam from other, presumably more reliable, sources such as coins, inscriptions, and non-Islamic sources. The oldest of this group was [[John Wansbrough]] (1928–2002). Wansbrough's works were widely noted, but perhaps not widely read.&lt;ref name="Donner 1998"/&gt;{{rp|38}} In 1972 a cache of ancient Qurans in a mosque in Sana'a, Yemen was discovered – commonly known as the [[Sana'a manuscripts]]. The German scholar [[Gerd R. Puin]] has been investigating these Quran fragments for years. His research team made 35,000 microfilm photographs of the manuscripts, which he dated to early part of the 8th century. Puin has not published the entirety of his work, but noted unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography. He also suggested that some of the parchments were [[palimpsest]]s which had been reused. Puin believed that this implied an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one.&lt;ref name="Lester" /&gt;

In the twentieth century, Indian writer [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]] challenged the [[Hadith]] showing that Aisha was as young as the traditional sources claim; arguing that instead a new interpretation of the [[Hadith]] compiled by [[Mishkat al-Masabih]], Wali-ud-Din Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al-Khatib, could indicate that Aisha would have been nineteen years old around the time of her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ali|1997|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some critics, the morality of the Quran appears to be a moral regression when judged by the standards of the moral traditions of Judaism and Christianity it says that it builds upon. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', for example, states that "the ethics of Islam are far inferior to those of [[Judaism]] and even more inferior to those of the New Testament" and "that in the ethics of Islam there is a great deal to admire and to approve, is beyond dispute; but of originality or superiority, there is none."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10424a.htm "Mohammed and Mohammedanism"].

=== Slavery ===
{{Main|Islamic views on slavery}}
[[Image:Slaves Zadib Yemen 13th century BNF Paris.jpg|thumb|left|upright|13th-century [[Arab slave trade|slave market]] in [[Yemen]]]]

Bernard Lewis writes: "In one of the sad paradoxes of [[History of the world|human history]], it was the humanitarian reforms brought by Islam that resulted in a vast development of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] inside, and still more outside, the Islamic empire." He notes that the Islamic injunctions against the enslavement of Muslims led to massive importation of slaves from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard (1990). Race and Slavery in the Middle East. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195053265}}, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], Islam by recognizing and codifying the slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Patrick (1990). Slavery and African Life: Occidental, Oriental, and African Slave Trades. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521348676}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Western societies which in their opposition to slavery spawned anti-slavery movements whose numbers and enthusiasm often grew out of church groups, no such grass-roots organizations ever developed in Muslim societies. In Muslim politics the state unquestioningly accepted the teachings of Islam and applied them as law. Islam, by sanctioning slavery, also extended legitimacy to the traffic in slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon, "Slavery in the Arab World." New Amsterdam Press, New York, 1989. Originally published in French by Editions Robert Laffont, S.A. Paris, 1987, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only in the early 20th century (post [[World War I]]) that slavery gradually became outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France.&lt;ref name="eois"&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon describes the lack of homegrown Islamic abolition movements as owing much to the fact that it was deeply anchored in Islamic law. By legitimizing slavery and – by extension – traffic in slaves, Islam elevated those practices to an unassailable moral plane. As a result, in no part of the Muslim world was an ideological challenge ever mounted against slavery. The political and [[Social structure|social system]] in Muslim society would have taken a dim view of such a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon, "Slavery in the Arab World." New Amsterdam Press, New York, 1989. Originally published in French by Editions Robert Laffont, S.A. Paris, 1987, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of slavery in the Islamic world in modern times is controversial. Critics argue there is hard evidence of its existence and destructive effects. Others maintain slavery in central Islamic lands has been virtually extinct since mid-twentieth century, and that reports from Sudan and Somalia showing practice of slavery is in border areas as a result of continuing war&lt;ref&gt;[[The Oxford Dictionary of Islam]], ''slavery'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; and not Islamic belief. In recent years, according to some scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl and William Clarence-Smith&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a "worrying trend" of "reopening" of the issue of slavery by some conservative [[Salafi]] Islamic scholars after its "closing" earlier in the 20th century when [[Muslim-majority countries]] banned slavery and "most Muslim scholars" found the practice "inconsistent with Qur'anic morality."&lt;ref&gt;Abou el Fadl, ''Great Theft'', HarperSanFrancisco, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/economicHistory/GEHN/GEHNPDF/Islam&amp;SlaveryWGCS.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208090322/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/economicHistory/GEHN/GEHNPDF/Islam&amp;SlaveryWGCS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-02-08|title=Islam and Slavery|publisher=|author=William Gervase Clarence-Smith|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri of [[Karbala]] expressed the view in 1993 that the enforcement of servitude can occur but is restricted to war captives and those born of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;In 'The Elements of Islam' (1993) cited in Clarence-Smith, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[sharia|Islamic law]] [[apostasy]] is identified by a list of actions such as conversion to another religion, denying the existence of [[God of Islam|God]], rejecting the [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]], mocking God or the prophets, idol worship, rejecting the [[sharia]], or permitting behavior that is forbidden by the sharia, such as [[Zina|adultery]] or the eating of forbidden foods or drinking of alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;''Reliance of the Traveller and Tools of the Worshipper'', trans.

Laws prohibiting [[religious conversion]] run contrary to Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which states that "[e]veryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|date= September 22, 2012 |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English historian [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] suggests the traditional view of apostasy hampered the development of Islamic learning, arguing that while the organizational form of the [[medieval university|Christian university]] allowed them to develop and flourish into the modern university, "the [[Madrasa|Muslim ones]] remained constricted by the doctrine of [[waqf]] alone, with their physical plant often deteriorating hopelessly and their curricula narrowed by the exclusion of the non-traditional religious sciences like philosophy and natural science," out of fear that these could evolve into potential toe-holds for [[kufr]], those people who reject God."&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Bosworth: Untitled review of "The Rise of Colleges. Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West by George Makdisi", ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', No. 2 (1983), pp. 304–05&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rechtsgutachten betr Apostasie im Islam.jpg|thumb|left|Decision of a [[Fatwa]] committee on the case of a convert to [[Christianity]]: "Since he left Islam, he will be invited to revert. If he does not revert, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the Islamic law." The fatwa outlines the same procedure and penalty for the male convert's children, on reaching the age of puberty.]]

[[Bernard Lewis]] summarizes:

{{quotation|The penalty for apostasy in Islamic law is death. Islam is conceived as a polity, not just as a religious community. It follows therefore that apostasy is treason. It is a withdrawal, a denial of allegiance as well as of religious belief and loyalty. Any sustained and principled opposition to the existing regime or order almost inevitably involves such a withdrawal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite news| last=Lewis | first=Bernard | title=Islamic Revolution | date=1998-01-21 | publisher=The New York Review of Books | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4557}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The four [[Sunni]] schools of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], as well as [[Shi'a]] scholars, agree on the difference of punishment between male and female. A sane adult male apostate may be executed. A female apostate may be put to death, according to the majority view, or imprisoned until she repents, according to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam | year=2003 | title=Murtadd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quran]] threatens apostates with punishment in the next world only, the historian W. Heffening states, the traditions however contain the element of death penalty. Muslim scholar Shafi'i interprets verse {{Quran-usc|2|217|style=ns}} as adducing the main evidence for the death penalty in Quran.&lt;ref&gt;W. Heffening, in Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Wael Hallaq states the later addition of death penalty "reflects a later reality and does not stand in accord with the deeds of the Prophet." He further states that "nothing in the law governing apostate and apostasy derives from the letter of the holy text."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Quran, Apostasy&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Montgomery Watt]], in response to a question about Western views of the Islamic Law as being cruel, states that "In Islamic teaching, such penalties may have been suitable for the age in which Muhammad lived. However, as societies have since progressed and become more peaceful and ordered, they are not suitable any longer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/articles/2000_watt.htm Interview: William Montgomery Watt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807045042/http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/articles/2000_watt.htm |date=2011-08-07 }}, by Bashir Maan &amp; Alastair McIntosh&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary Islamic jurists from both the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] denominations together with [[Quran only]] Muslims have argued or issued [[fatwa]]s that state that either the changing of religion is not punishable or is only punishable under restricted circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2005/02/050202_mj-montzari-renegade.shtml Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri: "Not Every Conversion is Apostasy"], by Mahdi Jami, In Persian, ''BBC Persian'', February 2, 2005.

Montazeri defines different types of apostasy. He does not hold that a reversion of belief because of investigation and research is punishable by death but prescribes capital punishment for a desertion of Islam out of malice and enmity towards the Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2005/02/050202_mj-montzari-renegade.shtml Ayatollah Montazeri: "Not Every Conversion is Apostasy"], by Mahdi Jami, In Persian, ''BBC Persian'', February 2, 2005.

According to [[Yohanan Friedmann]], an Israeli Islamic Studies scholar, a Muslim may stress tolerant elements of Islam (by for instance adopting the broadest interpretation of Quran 2:256 ("No compulsion is there in religion...") or the humanist approach attributed to Ibrahim al-Nakha'i), without necessarily denying the existence of other ideas in the Medieval Islamic tradition but rather discussing them in their historical context (by for example arguing that "civilizations comparable with the Islamic one, such as the Sassanids and the Byzantines, also punished apostasy with death. Similarly neither Judaism nor Christianity treated apostasy and apostates with any particular kindness").&lt;ref name="Yohanan Friedmann p.5"&gt;Yohanan Friedmann, ''Tolerance and Coercion in Islam'', Cambridge University Press, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Friedmann continues:

{{quotation|The real predicament facing modern Muslims with liberal convictions is not the existence of stern laws against apostasy in medieval Muslim books of law, but rather the fact that accusations of apostasy and demands to punish it are heard time and again from radical elements in the contemporary Islamic world.&lt;ref name="Yohanan Friedmann p.5"/&gt;}}

{{quotation|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.}}

To implement this, Article 18 (2) of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] states:

{{quotation|No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion of his choice.}}

The right for Muslims to change their religion is not afforded by the Iranian Shari'ah law, which specifically forbids it. In 1981, the Iranian representative to the [[United Nations]], [[Said Rajaie-Khorassani]], articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by saying that the UDHR was "a [[secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;Littman, David. "Universal Human Rights and 'Human Rights in Islam'". ''Midstream'', February/March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of law, on the basis of its obligations as a state party to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]], Iran is obliged to uphold the right of individuals to practice the religion of their choice and to change religions, including converting from Islam. The prosecution of converts from Islam on the basis of religious edicts that identify apostasy as an offense punishable by death is clearly at variance with this obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/iran/Iran-04.htm|title=IRAN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="article18"&gt;''Sharia as traditionally understood runs counter to the ideas expressed in Article 18'':[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=227 Religious freedom under Islam]: By Henrik Ertner Rasmussen, General Secretary, Danish European Mission&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim-majority countries such as [[Sudan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], have the death penalty for [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy from Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html|title=Apostacy, "Leaving Islam" – The Peace FAQ|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118171026/http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html|archivedate=2007-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries have criticized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for its perceived failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-[[Western world|Western]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/26/saudi-arabias-troubling-death-sentence&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] published a separate [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] compliant with Shari'ah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religlaw.org/interdocs/docs/cairohrislam1990.htm The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828144624/http://www.religlaw.org/interdocs/docs/cairohrislam1990.htm |date=2005-08-28 }}, Adopted and Issued at the Nineteenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers in Cairo, ''Religion and Law Research Consortium'', August 5, 1990.

David Cook, author of ''Understanding Jihad'', said "In reading Muslim literature – both contemporary and classical – one can see that the evidence for the primacy of spiritual jihad is negligible. Today it is certain that no Muslim, writing in a non-Western language (such as Arabic, Persian, Urdu), would ever make claims that jihad is primarily nonviolent or has been superseded by the spiritual jihad. Such claims are made solely by Western scholars, primarily those who study Sufism and/or work in interfaith dialogue, and by Muslim apologists who are trying to present Islam in the most innocuous manner possible."&lt;ref name="Cook166"&gt;Cook, David.

[[Dennis Prager]], columnist and author, in responding to a movement that contends that Islam is "a religion of peace," wrote: "Now, Islam has never been a religion of peace.

Most international human rights organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], condemn Islamic laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime.

{{transl|ar|DIN|Nikāḥ al-Mutʿah}} ({{lang-ar|نكاح المتعة}} literally ''pleasure marriage'') is a fixed-term or short-term contractual marriage in [[Shia Islam]].

====Contractually limited marriage====
{{main|Nikah Misyar}}
Nikah Misyar ({{lang-ar|المسيار}}) is a type of [[Nikah]] (marriage) in Sunni Islam only carried out through the normal contractual procedure, with the provision that the husband and wife give up several rights by their own free will, such as living together, equal division of nights between wives in cases of [[polygamy]], the wife's rights to housing, and maintenance money (''"[[nafaqa]]"''), and the husband's right of homekeeping and access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 Al-Qaradawi, Yusuf : Misyar marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104035953/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |date=2011-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the couple continue to live separately from each other, as before their contract, and see each other to fulfil their needs in a legally permissible ([[halaal]]) manner when they please.
Misyar has been suggested by some western authors to be a comparable marriage with [[Nikah mut'ah]] and that they find it for the sole purpose of "sexual gratification in a licit manner"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zEkmJAeJYBkC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=misyar+muta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7gpFUZatJtL02wXPrYDYCw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=misyar%20muta&amp;f=false|title=Islam and the West|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S2kZfdrEBlAC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=misyar+mut'a&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jQ1FUYanDaP02gWCk4GADQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=campaigns%20Encyclopedia%20&amp;f=false|title=The Islamic Shield|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Florian Pohl, assistant professor of religion at [[Oxford College of Emory University|Oxford College]], Misyar marriage is controversial issue in the Muslim world, as many see it as practice that encourages marriages for purely sexual purposes, or that it is used as a cover for a form of prostitutuion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=n4Eye4ilLVkC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Mutah#v=onepage&amp;q=Mutah&amp;f=false | title=Muslim World: Modern Muslim Societies | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | date=September 1, 2010 | accessdate=April 5, 2013 | author=Pohl, Florian | pages=52–53| isbn=978-0761479277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Al-Albani]], misyar marriage may even be considered as illicit, because it runs counter to the objectives and the spirit of marriage in Islam, as described in the Quran: "And among His signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquility with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts)…"&lt;ref&gt;Quran, 30: 21&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Albani also underlines the social problems which result from the "misyar" marriage, particularly in the event that children are born from this union. The children raised by their mother in a home from which the father is always absent, without reason, may suffer difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Wassel quoted in Hassouna addimashqi, Arfane : Nikah al misyar (2000), (in Arabic), p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt; The situation becomes even worse if the wife is abandoned or repudiated by her husband "misyar", with no means of subsistence, as usually happens.

Ibn [[Uthaymeen]] recognized the legality of "misyar" marriage under [[Shariah]], but came to oppose it due to what he considered to be its harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamqa.info/en/ref/82390 Misyaar marriage: definition and rulings] [[Islam Q&amp;A]] website (accessed 10/30/2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
{{main|Islam and domestic violence}}
Due to the way domestic violence is handled in some modern-day Muslim states, a few organizations have suggested ways to modify Shari'a-inspired laws to improve women's rights in Islamic n ations, including women's rights in domestic abuse cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musawah.org/sites/default/files/CEDAW%20%26%20Muslim%20Family%20Laws.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512091742/http://www.musawah.org/sites/default/files/CEDAW%20%26%20Muslim%20Family%20Laws.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-05-12|format=PDF|title=CEDAW and Muslim Family Laws, Sisters in Islam, Malaysia |year=2011|publisher=musawah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Michele, and Jeffrey A.

=== Personal status laws and child marriage ===
Shari'a is the basis for personal status laws in most Islamic majority nations. These personal status laws determine rights of women in matters of marriage, divorce and child custody. A 2011 [[UNICEF]] report concludes that Shari'a law provisions are discriminatory against women from a human rights perspective. In legal proceedings under Shari'a law, a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's before a court.&lt;ref name=unicef2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/REGIONAL-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011.pdf|format=PDF|title=MENA Gender Equality Profile – Status of Girls and Women in the Middle East and North Africa |date=October 2011|publisher=unicef.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for Iran, Lebanon and Bahrain which allow child marriages, the civil code in Islamic majority countries do not allow child marriage of girls. However, with Shari'a personal status laws, Shari'a courts in all these nations have the power to override the civil code. The religious courts permit girls less than 18 years old to marry. As of 2011, child marriages are common in a few Middle Eastern countries, accounting for 1 in 6 all marriages in Egypt and 1 in 3 marriages in Yemen. However, the average age at marriage in most Middle Eastern countries is steadily rising and is generally in the low to mid 20s for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quandl.com/c/society/age-at-first-marriage-female-by-country|title=Age at First Marriage – Female By Country – Data from Quandl|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape is considered a crime in all countries, but Shari'a courts in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia in some cases allow a rapist to escape punishment by marrying his victim, while in other cases the victim who complains is often prosecuted with the crime of ''[[Zina]]'' (adultery).&lt;ref name=unicef2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/challenges_to_women_security_mena_region.pdf|format=PDF|first1=Kendra |last1=Heideman |first2= Mona |last2=Youssef|title= Challenges to Women’s Security in the MENA Region, Wilson Center (March, 2013)|website=reliefweb.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/new-survey-assesses-womens-freedom-middle-east|title=Sanja Kelly (2010) New Survey Assesses Women's Freedom in the Middle East |publisher=Freedom House (funded by US Department of State's Middle East Partnership Initiative)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pascal Bruckner(2).jpg|thumb|French philosopher [[Pascal Bruckner]] has criticised the effects of multiculturalism and Islam in the West]]
The [[Islam in Europe|immigration of Muslims to Europe]] has increased in recent decades and conservative Muslim social attitudes on modern issues have caused controversy in Europe and other parts of the world. Scholars argue about how much these attitudes are a result of culture rather than Islamic beliefs, while some critics consider Islam to be incompatible with secular Western society. Some also believe that Islam positively commands its adherents to impose its [[sharia|religious law]] on all peoples, believers and unbelievers alike, whenever possible and by any means necessary.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Cite book| title=Multiculturalism, Muslims and Citizenship: A European Approach | author=Tariq Modood | publisher=Routledge | edition=1st | year=2006 | isbn=978-0415355155 | pages=3, 29, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kilpatrick | first =William | title =The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad | publisher =Regnery | year =2016 | page =256 | isbn =978-1621575771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their criticism has been partly influenced by a stance against [[multiculturalism]] advocated by recent philosophers, closely linked to the heritage of [[New Philosophers]]. Statements by proponents like [[Pascal Bruckner]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signandsight.com/features/1146.html Pascal Bruckner – Enlightenment fundamentalism or racism of the anti-racists? ] appeared originally in German in the online magazine ''Perlentaucher'' on January 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; describe multiculturalism as an invention of an "enlightened" elite who deny the benefits of democratic rights to non-Westerners by chaining them to their roots. They also state that multiculturalism allows a degree of religious freedom&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Bruckner – A reply to [[Ian Buruma]] and Timothy Garton Ash: "At the heart of the issue is the fact that in certain countries Islam is becoming Europe's second religion. As such, its adherents are entitled to freedom of religion, to decent locations and to all of our respect. On the condition, that is, that they themselves respect the rules of our republican, secular culture, and that they do not demand a status of extraterritoriality that is denied other religions, or claim special rights and prerogatives"&lt;/ref&gt; that exceeds what is needed for personal religious freedom&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Bruckner – A reply to Ian Buruma and Timothy Garton Ash "It's so true that many English, Dutch and German politicians, shocked by the excesses that the wearing of the Islamic veil has given way to, now envisage similar legislation curbing religious symbols in public space. The separation of the spiritual and corporeal domains must be strictly maintained, and belief must confine itself to the private realm."&lt;/ref&gt; and is conducive to the creation of organizations aimed at undermining European secular or Christian values.&lt;ref name=mnali&gt;{{cite news | title = Extremism flourished as UK lost Christianity | authorlink = Michael Nazir-Ali | first = Michael | last = Nazir-Ali | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/06/nislam206.xml | publisher = ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]] | date = 6 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses to criticism ==
[[John Esposito]] has written a number of introductory texts on Islam and the Islamic world. He has addressed issues including the rise of [[militant Islam]], the veiling of women, and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Esposito | first=John L. | title=What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam| publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002 | isbn=0195157133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Esposito | first=John L. | title=Unholy War: Terror in the Name of Islam| publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2003 | isbn=0195168860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito emphatically argues against what he calls the "pan-Islamic myth". He thinks that "too often coverage of Islam and the Muslim world assumes the existence of a monolithic Islam in which all Muslims are the same." To him, such a view is naive and unjustifiably obscures important divisions and differences in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Esposito | first=John L. | title=The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality? | pages=225–28 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0195130766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Montgomery Watt]] in his book ''Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman'' addresses Muhammad's alleged moral failings. Watt argues on a basis of [[moral relativism]] that Muhammad should be judged by the standards of his own time and country rather than "by those of the most enlightened opinion in the West today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Watt | first=W.

[[Karen Armstrong]], tracing what she believes to be the West's long history of hostility toward Islam, finds in Muhammad's teachings a theology of peace and tolerance. Armstrong holds that the "holy war" urged by the Quran alludes to each Muslim's duty to fight for a just, decent society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Armstrong | first=Karen | title=Muhammad: A Biography of the Prophet | publisher=HarperSanFrancisco | year=1993 | isbn=0062508865 | page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Said]], in his essay ''Islam Through Western Eyes'', stated that the general basis of [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] thought forms a study structure in which Islam is placed in an inferior position as an object of study. He claims the existence of a very considerable bias in Orientalist writings as a consequence of the scholars' cultural make-up. He claims Islam has been looked at with a particular hostility and fear due to many obvious religious, psychological and political reasons, all deriving from a sense "that so far as the West is concerned, Islam represents not only a formidable competitor but also a late-coming challenge to Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/islam-through-western-eyes?page=full|title=Islam Through Western Eyes|author=Edward W.

[[Cathy Young]] of Reason Magazine claims that "criticism of the religion is enmeshed with cultural and ethnic hostility" often painting the Muslim world as monolithic. While stating that the terms "[[Islamophobia]]" and "anti-Muslim bigotry" are often used in response to legitimate criticism of [[fundamentalist Islam]] and problems within Muslim culture, she claimed "the real thing does exist, and it frequently takes the cover of anti-jihadism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/36677.html|title=The Jihad Against Muslims|work=Reason.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''donation box''' or '''collecting box''' is a receptacle for receiving donations. These are typically found in public places, as a means of generating additional revenue in small increments. Churches, libraries, museums, and many non-profit organizations make use of donation boxes.

In churches it is common to find a [[Mite box]] or Alms Box, and in [[Shinto shrine]]s a [[Saisen|Saisen-bako]].

The {{Nihongo|'''''Engishiki'''''|延喜式||extra="Procedures of the Engi Era"}} is a  [[Japan]]ese book about laws and customs. The major part of the writing was completed in 927.&lt;ref name="nussbaum178"&gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq= "''Engi-shiki''"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 905, [[Emperor Daigo]] ordered the compilation of the ''Engishiki''.  Although previous attempts at codification are known to have taken place, neither the ''Konin'' nor the ''Jogan Gishiki''&lt;ref&gt;"Jogan Gishiki" in Stuart D. B. Pecken, ed., ''Historical Dictionary of Shinto''. Second edition. (Lanham, MD, USA: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2011) p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  survive making the Engishiki important for early Japanese historical and religious studies.&lt;ref&gt;" Engishiki" in Stuart D. B. Pecken, ed., ''Historical Dictionary of Shinto''. Second edition. (Lanham, MD, USA: Scarecrow Press, Inv, 2011) p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fujiwara no Tokihira]] began the task, but work stalled when he died four years later in 909. His brother [[Fujiwara no Tadahira]] continued the work in 912 eventually completing it in 927.&lt;ref name="nussbaum178"/&gt; 

After a number of revisions, the work was used as a basis for reform starting in 967.{{fact|date=February 2013}}

==Contents==

The text is 50 volumes in lengths and is organized by department:
*volumes 1–10: [[Jingi-kan|Department of Worship]] In addition to regulating ceremonials including [[Niiname-no-Matsuri#Name|Daijyō-sai]] (first Niineme-sai fellowing the accession of new emperor) and worship at the [[Ise Grand Shrine]] and [[Saikū]], this section of the ''Engishiki'' recorded liturgical texts, listed all 2,861 [[Shinto shrine]]s existing at the time, and listed the 3,131 official-recognized and enshrined [[Kami]].&lt;ref&gt;" Engishiki" in Stuart D.

In 2008, the camp was visited by nearly 1 &amp;nbsp; 000 young people, representing about 1.5% of the age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotkanpesa.net/protu/protu-ukk.php |title=Kotkanpesä |website=Kotkanpesa.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

True to its name Prometheus camp has received [[Greek mythology|Greek jumaltaruston]] [[Prometheus]] - the Titans, who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. The camp aims to encourage young people to reflect on things, to perceive and develop their own [[philosophy]] to, to respect themselves and others and to take responsibility for themselves and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Osma Suominen |url=http://www.protu.fi/yhdistys/periaatteet.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040102061016/http://www.protu.fi/yhdistys/periaatteet.html |archivedate=2004-01-02 |title=Prometheus-leiritoiminnan periaatteet |website=Web.archive.org |date=2004-01-02 |accessdate=2017-03-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the camp held in celebration, in which campers family members can participate. At the ceremony the campers got that idea from fresh twigs and flowers, laying a wreath on his neck, and [[Silver]] Prometheus jewelery, behind which is engraved with the name of the camper, camp site and camp date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Osma Suominen |url=http://www.protu.fi/leirit/kysyttya.html |title=Kysymyksiä ja vastauksia |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325033655/http://www.protu.fi/leirit/kysyttya.html |archivedate=2007-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international study, which examined young people's ideas before confirmation school in 2008 and then confirmed in the church in 2013, it became clear that young Finns criticality of the church and religious traditions has increased significantly. In 2013, responding to follow-up will continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/yha_useampi_sanoo_ei_kiitos_rippikoululle__nuorten_kriittisyys_kasvaa_muuta_eurooppaa_nopeammin/7781713 |title=Yhä useampi sanoo "ei kiitos" rippikoululle – nuorten kriittisyys kasvaa muuta Eurooppaa nopeammin &amp;#124; Yle Uutiset |website=yle.fi |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Marc Ela''' (27 September 1936 – 26 December 2008) was a sociologist, Diocesan Priest, Professor and author of many books on theology, philosophy, and social sciences in Africa. His most famous work, ''African Cry'' has been called the "soundest illustration" of the spirit of [[liberation theology]] in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;V.Y. Mudimbe, ''The Invention of Africa''. Bloomington, IN: Indiana UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; His works are widely cited as exemplary of sub-Saharan African Christian theology for their focus on contextualisation and their emphasis on community-centered approaches to theology.&lt;ref&gt;Stinton, D., "Africa, East and West." In ''An Introduction to Third World Theologies'' J. Parrat, Ed. New York: Cambridge UP, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried in his hometown of [[Ebolowa]], [[Cameroon]].

==Biography==
Jean-Marc Ela was born on 27 September 1936 in [[Ebolowa]], in the African nation of [[Cameroon]]. The son of a middle-class family in southern Cameroon, Ela claimed that he first began to think of theology as a discipline that should be concerned with the local needs of believers while he was studying philosophy and theology in France at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Assogba. ''Jean-Marc Ela: Le sociologue et theologien africain en boubou. Entretiens''. Paris: L'Harmattan, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied sociology at the University of Strasbourg as well as at the University of Sorbonne. 

However, it was during his sixteen-year experience as a missionary working among the [[Kirdi]] of northwestern Cameroon that he developed and articulated most of the arguments in ''African Cry'' and ''My Faith as an African''. He spent a great deal of his research and of his life beside Baba Simon, beloved minister to the Kirdis of the North Cameroon in [[Tokombéré]]. His thesis at Strausburg was on the image of the cross in Luther's theology.  

Ela was unique in that as a sociologist, he brought a social-science critique to his theology. As a theologian, he proved unorthodox not only in embracing social sciences but also in his penchant for studying topics that tested the boundaries of Catholic orthodoxy. As a missionary, he earned the respect and love of his community in Tokombere. As a Professor, he was popular with students around the globe. He held professorships in Cameroon, Belgium, USA, Canada, Benin, France, and Congo, among other places.

A vocal critic of both ecclesiastical and political institutions, Ela entered voluntary exile in Quebec after the assassination of fellow Cameroonian priest Englebert Mveng in 1995. Ela resided in Montreal, where he served as a Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Laval]] at Montreal, from 1995 until his death 26 December 2008, in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;Y. Assogba. ''Jean-Marc Ela: Le sociologue et théologien africain en boubou. Entretiens''. Paris: L'Harmattan, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
For Jean-Marc Ela and his generation of postcolonial Christian intellectuals in Cameroon, achieving redemption and meaningful spirituality depended fundamentally on acknowledging the value of the everyday practices of pagan village life. This also provided a mechanism of vigilance against destructive external forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jwtc.org.za/resources/docs/salon-volume-2/janeguyer_ela.pdf Guyer, Jane I., "In Commemoration of Jean-Marc Ela", African Studies Association, November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

''African Cry'' and ''My Faith as an African'', Ela's two most famous works, serve as an indictments of the [[Catholic Church]] for holding to a model of faith that ignores the needs of African people, especially those in poor and rural communities. Through an analysis of selected [[sacraments]], [[missionary]] structures, and biblical [[hermeneutics]], Ela identified ways in which the Catholic tradition subordinates Africans to a position of dependence vis-a-vis White Europeans. He countered these instances of oppression with opportunities for liberation based on the argument that the [[Gospel]] advocates for the restoration of dignity to marginalised people.

According to Ela, the only way to restore dignity to African peoples is to allow them to transform Christian traditions into forms that are familiar and useful to Africans. He argued that the Eucharist should be served with local rather than imported products. He believed that African churches should be self-funded. He also believed that biblical interpretation should be guided by a "shade-tree theology", in which small groups of believers can gather together to interpret the Gospel in the light of their own particular circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Ela, ''Ma foi d'Africain''. Paris: Editions Karthala, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interspersed between his hard-hitting theological tones, Ela produced several volumes on social sciences in Africa. He was a science-minded researcher dedicated to opening a conceptual framework to encompass and address the knowledge and the needs of his countrymen. For example, he wrote in 2001 a guide emphatically explaining the imperative African researchers have to direct new research to meeting the basic needs of the population and not only to improve industrial productions. Similarly, in several books published between 1998 and 2007, he showed the place of Africa in the world of rational science, and the necessity of high quality scientific work. In a book published in 2007, he studied and tried to explain the inseparability of knowledge and power and the importance of this for the well-being of Africa.

'''Juan Pablo Viscardo y Guzmán''' (1748–1798) was a [[Peru]]vian Jesuit, writer and campaigner for Latin American independence.  He is widely recognised as a precursor of [[Peruvian independence]] and more widely, as an ardent opponent of [[Spanish Colonialism]] in [[America]]. He played a crucial role in the development of [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[Latin American]] relations.

Born in [[Pampacolca District]], Peru to a Spanish colonial family, he was expelled from his own country and forced to live in exile. 
In 1791 he came to London, sponsored by the [[British Government]] to give account of the development of Latin America’s pursuit of independence.

Guzman wrote several important essays during his time in London promoting freedom for the Spanish Colonies, including  “Letter to Spanish Americans” (1792) and “Peace and Prosperity in a New World” (1796), in which he criticises Spanish colonialism and its economic control.

While living in [[London]], Guzman met [[Francisco de Miranda]] who translated his key manuscripts.

Juan Pablo Y Guzman died in London in 1798 at the age of 50. There is a memorial plaque at the site, which is now 185 Baker Street.&lt;ref&gt;City of Westminster green plaques {{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Interior-Small-Kenassa.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of Malaya (Small) kenesa in [[Yevpatoria]], [[Crimea]].]]
'''Kenesa''' is the term for an East European [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] or [[Persian Jews|Persian]] [[synagogue]]. The word derives from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word for "assembly" (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the word for synagogue is '''beit knesset''').

Modern Karaite kenesas are similar to [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinical]] synagogues. In [[Eastern Europe]] they are laid out along north-south axis ([[Jerusalem]] direction). Starting from the northern entrance, kenesa contains:
* [[Vestibule (architecture)|Vestibule]] (''azar''), where worshipers take off their shoes. Shoes are not permitted anywhere further.
* ''Moshav Zekenim'' ({{lang|he|מושב זקנים}}, ''old men's [[pew]]s''): wooden benches for the old and the mourners, usually under a low ceiling. The loft above this ceiling is reserved for the women, who remain invisible to the men on the main floor.
* ''Shulkhan'' ({{lang-arc|שולחן}} "table"): the main hall. Traditional Karaite worship was performed  on the knees. In the past, kenesa floors were carpeted; however, modern Karaite kenesas have pews in the main hall.
* ''Hekhal'', or [[altar]] ({{lang|he|היכל}}): raised stand for the ritual Ark and the priest.

Some Karaites kenesas also have a [[rood screen]]

==Surviving kenesas==
There were 20 kenesas in the former [[Russian Empire]], nine of them in [[Crimea]] (by 1918, two more were added). All surviving kenesas are listed memorial buildings, however, many are in a dilapidated state, and others, like [[Sevastopol|Sebastopol]] kenesa, although in better shape, are managed by public authorities or private owners, not the Karaite communities. The principal, operating place of Karaite worship in Ukraine is located in [[Yevpatoria]], [[Crimea]]. It actually contains two independent kenesas, re-opened to the public in 2005 and 1999.

Kenesas in Lithuania were built in the 14th century; in [[Trakai]], [[Biržai]], [[Kėdainiai]], [[Panevėžys]] and [[Vilnius]]. An early 20th-century kenesa still stands in [[Trakai]], [[Lithuania]] and another one in [[Vilnius]]; both are in service. No kenesas survived in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], where Karaites were present since the 13th century, the last kenesa in [[Halych]] was destroyed by the Soviets in 1985. The only surviving kenesa in [[Turkey]] is in [[Istanbul]], in [[Hasköy, Beyoğlu]].

'''Kids Alive International''' (KAI) is a Christian [[nonprofit organization]] founded to support child, family, and community development. KAI's stated belief is that every child deserves to live free from the bondage of hunger, abuse, and exploitation. Their mission is to deliver life’s essentials to these children with compassion and excellence.

==History==

'''1916'''   Official founding of the Home of Onesiphorus in Taian, [[China]], by Rev. and Mrs. Leslie Anglin. The ministry began when the Anglins opened their home to orphans and widows in the province.

'''1921'''   Leslie Anglin made a trip to Hopei Province (now [[Hebei]]), a severe famine area, to rescue children; included in this group of children was Samuel Hsaio who later traveled widely on behalf of Kids Alive and became the director of the Tsinan Home, the 2nd location in China.

'''1937'''   The home had a yearly average of 600 children, 95% of whom graduated from the home’s school.

'''1948'''   Dar El Awlad Boys' Home opened in [[Beirut, Lebanon]].

'''1953'''   Mission School established in [[Hong Kong]] for children of Chinese refuge families; by 1957 there were 350 pupils enrolled.

'''1962'''   Hong Kong missionaries started a Home for Boys in the New Territories, with 15 boys.

'''1975'''   Civil War began in [[Lebanon]], ending in 1992. KAI continued operating there during this time; children and staff remained safe even though there was some destruction to facilities.

'''1983'''   Name changed to Kids Alive International; home office moved to [[Valparaiso, Indiana]].

'''1992'''   ANIJA School in [[Dominican Republic]] opened with Kindergarten and first grade. Hauna Schools in Hauna Village, [[Papua New Guinea]], affiliated with Kids Alive.

'''2000'''   Kids Alive began ministry in [[Africa]], affiliating with the Mt. Kenya Boys’ Home, and a year later opened a children’s home in [[Lusaka, Zambia]].

'''2004'''   Kids Alive [[Peru]] purchased land for the Care Center in the Manchay slum of [[Lima]], with the goal of identifying and helping single mothers find work to support their kids.

==Programs==
'''Kids Alive Schools'''

KAI believes that quality education is the only reliable path out of poverty. Their schools vary in many ways depending on the country and community, but all aim to provide the most modern facilities and technology wherever possible, consistent teacher certification and ongoing training, up-to-date curriculum, and stringent safety and security measures. Currently, KAI has schools in [[Dominican Republic]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[Peru]], [[Kenya]], [[Lebanon]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Zambia]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kidsalive.org/meet-kids-alive/our-work/international-schools/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Care Centers and Medical Clinics'''

KAI states that care centers “provide quality supervision, stimulating activities, healthy role models, nutritious meals and snacks, help with homework, and counseling when necessary”. Medical clinics provide [[vaccinations]], screenings, nutritional evaluations, basic [[first aid]] care, and referrals to community medical facilities for advanced care.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kidsalive.org/meet-kids-alive/our-work/community-service-care-centers/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Family-style Residential Homes'''

KAI's stated goal is that a child should, if at all possible, remain with his or her natural family. In cases where children are abandoned or appear to be orphans, KAI can work with authorities to locate a child’s parents or other close family members. When a child has no home or is deemed unsafe in their own home because of abuse or exploitation concerns, KAI places them in small, family-style homes with dedicated caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kidsalive.org/meet-kids-alive/our-work/residential-childrens-homes/&lt;/ref&gt;
  
'''“Keeping Families Together”'''

When a child has biological, extended, or adoptive family willing to provide care but unable to afford the basics, KAI offers assistance with nutrition, education, medical care, and sometimes entrepreneurial help. Children are able to remain in a familiar setting with those who love them while receiving advantages their families cannot provide on their own.

[[Kayastha]] is a [[caste]] in the [[Hindu]] religion. In Bengal, the [[Bengali Kayastha|Kayasthas]] are subdivided into different classes or ranks. They are also divided in terms of their geographical locations.  According to legend, the Bengali Hindu King [[Ballal Sena]] started the ranking system of [[Bengali Brahmins|Brahmins]] and [[Bengali Kayastha|Kayasthas]]. The highest ranked Brahmins and Kayasthas are known as [[Kulin Brahmins]] and [[Kulin Kayastha]] respectively. The [[Bengali Kayastha|Kayasthas]] who are not [[Kulin Kayastha|Kulins]] (highest ranked) are considered Maulika (Maulik, Moulik or Moulika).&lt;ref name=Inden1976p1&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald B. |last=Inden|title=Marriage and Rank in Bengali Culture: A History of Caste and Clan in Middle Period Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8b9A7J_v-UC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=2011-10-31|year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02569-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bengali Kayastha]] were subdivided into different classes based on where they lived. Four geographical locations were used for such differentiation - '''Dakshin''' [[Rahr Bangla|'''Rahri''']], '''Uttar''' [[Rahr Bangla|'''Rahri''']], '''Bangaj''' (Bangaja or Vangaja) and '''[[Varendra]]''' (Barendra). In each region, the [[Bengali Kayastha|Kayasthas]] were divided into [[Kulin Kayastha|Kulina]] and Maulika ranks. Among the [[Kulin Kayastha|kulins]] of one region there were no more divisions, although [[Kulin Kayastha|kulins]] from different regions were considered very different. Depending on the region same family could be either Kulina or Maulika. Among Dakshin Radhi Kayasthas Guha is Maulika, among Bangaja Guha is a kulin. On the other hand, depending on the region, Maulikas were further classified into different ranks.

Dakshin [[Rahr Bangla|Rahri]] Maulika Kayasthas are ranked into only two classes - '''Siddhya''' Maulika and '''Sadhya''' Maulika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=University|first1=Calcutta|title=Bengal: Its castes and curses|journal=Calcutta Review|date=1895|volume=100-101|pages=144–172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4KcbAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight families were classified into '''Siddhya''' Maulika class and seventy two families were classified into '''Sadhya''' Maulika (also known as bahatture) class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=K. S.|title=India's communities|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Siddhya''' Maulikas were considered superior to '''Sadhya''' Maulika.

'''Bangaj''' (Bangaja or Vangaja) Maulika Kayasthas are divided into '''three''' classes - '''Madhyalaya''' (Madhyalya) (highest ranked) , '''Mahapatra''' (second ranked) and '''Sadharana''' (Achala) (lowest ranked). Among the '''Sadharana''' rank there were two subgroups as described below.

'''Michael Browne''', [[Dominican Order|OP]] (born David Browne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Máire|title=The Same Age as the State|year=2004|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299210308|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6 May 1887 – 31 March 1971) was an Irish priest of the [[Dominican Order]] and a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church]]. He served as [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General of the]] [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] from 1955 to 1962, and was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in 1962.

==Early Biography==
Michael Browne was born in [[Grangemockler]], [[County Tipperary]].

==Formation==
Browne joined the [[Dominican Order|Order of Friars Preachers]], commonly known as the Dominicans, in 1903. After studying at [[Rockwell College]], the Dominican [[convent]] at the [[Basilica of San Clemente]] in Rome, and the [[University of Fribourg]], he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood on 21 May 1910.

==Career==
Browne taught at the Dominican [[convent]] in [[Tallaght]], where he was [[Master of novices|Master of Novices]] until 1919 when he was appointed professor at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]], ''Angelicum'' in Rome.

Browne served as [[Prior]] of the convent of St. Clemente from 1925 to 1930.

He was the ''Angelicum'''s [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] ''magnificus'' from 1932 to 1941

Browne was appointed [[Master of the Sacred Palace]] from 1951 to 1955.

He became [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General]] of the Dominicans on 11 April 1955, remaining in that position until his resignation in 1962. He was created [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Deacon]] of [[List of titular churches in Rome|S. Paolo alla Regola]] by [[Pope John XXIII]] in the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of 19 March 1962, appointed [[Titular bishop|Titular Archbishop]] of Idebessus on 5 April 1962, and [[Bishop (Catholicism)|consecrated as bishop]] on 19 April by John XXIII, with Cardinals [[Giuseppe Pizzardo]] and [[Benedetto Aloisi Masella]] serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]], in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Lateran Basilica]].

Browne attended the [[Second Vatican Council]] from 1962 to 1965. A stern conservative, he was opposed to the reforms of the Council (including [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]]&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Marcel. "Religious Liberty Questioned". Kansas City: Angelus Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;) and was a friend of [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre]].&lt;ref&gt;SSPX, District of Asia. [http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Society_of_Saint_Pius_X/OpenLetterToConfusedCatholics/Chapter-9.htm The New Theology] 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|cardinal electors]] who participated in the [[Papal conclave, 1963|1963 papal conclave]] that selected [[Pope Paul VI]]. From 20 January 1971 until his death, Browne served as [[Protodeacon|Cardinal Protodeacon]].

He died in Rome, at age 83, and was buried in the priory cemetery in [[Tallaght]], County Dublin, Ireland.

==Family==
His brother [[Pádraig de Brún]] was a notable priest, poet and scholar, and he was an uncle of [[Máire Mhac an tSaoi]], scholar, poet, wife of Irish diplomat, writer and politician [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], and daughter of his sister, Margaret Browne and her husband, the Irish revolutionary and statesman [[Seán MacEntee]].

[[File:StAnthony.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony of Egypt|St. Anthony the Great]] of Egypt, considered the Father of [[Christian]] Monasticism]]

A '''monk'''  ({{IPAc-en|m|ʌ|ŋ|k}}, from {{lang-el|μοναχός}},  ''monachos'', "single, solitary" via [[Latin]] ''monachus''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmonaxo%2Fs μοναχός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"monk, n.1". OED Online, 3rd edn. March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a person who practices religious [[asceticism]] by [[monastic]]  living, either alone or with any number of other monks. A monk may be a person who decides to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave [[mainstream]] [[society]] and live his or her life in [[prayer]] and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy.

In the Greek language the term can apply to women, but in modern English it is mainly in use for men. The word [[nun]] is typically used for female monastics.

Although the term ''monachos'' is of Christian origin, in the English language ''monk'' tends to be used loosely also for both male and female ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds.  However, being generic, it is not interchangeable with terms that denote particular kinds of monk, such as [[cenobite]], [[hermit]], [[anchorite]], [[Hesychasm|hesychast]], or solitary.

==Orthodox Christianity==
[[File:07Athos St Dionysius02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dionysiou monastery|Monastery of St. Dionysius]] on [[Mount Athos]].]]

In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] monasticism holds a very special and important place: "Angels are a light for monks, monks are a light for laymen" ([[John Climacus|St. John Klimakos]]). Orthodox monastics separate themselves from the [[world (theology)|world]] in order to pray unceasingly for the world. They do not, in general, have as their primary purpose the running of social services, but instead are concerned with attaining [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], or union with God. However, care for the poor and needy has always been an obligation of monasticism,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} so not all monasteries are "cloistered". The level of contact though will vary from community to community. Hermits, on the other hand, have little or no contact with the outside world.

Orthodox monasticism does not have [[religious orders]] as are found in the West, nor do they have Rules in the same sense as the [[Rule of St. Benedict]]. Rather, Eastern monastics study and draw inspiration from the writings of the [[Desert Fathers]] as well as other [[Church Fathers]]; probably the most influential of which are the ''Greater Asketikon'' and ''Lesser Asketikon'' of St. Basil the Great and the ''[[Philokalia]]'', which was compiled by St. Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain and St. Makarios of Corinth. [[Hesychasm]] is of primary importance in the ascetical theology of the Orthodox Church.

[[File:Макарьево Свято-Троице-Макарьево-Желтоводский монастырь N56 05.402 E45 03.647.jpg|thumb|General view of [[Makaryev Monastery|Holy Trinity-Makaryev Monastery]], on the [[Volga River]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]], [[Russia]].]]

Most communities are self-supporting, and the monastic’s daily life is usually divided into three parts: (a) communal worship in the [[Katholikon|catholicon]] (the monastery's main church); (b) hard manual labour; and (c) private prayer, spiritual study, and rest when necessary. Meals are usually taken in common in a sizable dining hall known as a [[refectory|trapeza]] (refectory), at elongated [[refectory table]]s. Food is usually simple and is eaten in silence while one of the brethren reads aloud from the spiritual writings of the [[Church Fathers|Holy Fathers]]. The monastic lifestyle takes a great deal of serious commitment. Within the cenobitic community, all monks conform to a common way of living based on the traditions of that particular monastery. In struggling to attain this conformity, the monastic comes to realize his own shortcomings and is guided by his [[starets|spiritual father]] in how to deal honestly with them. For this same reason, [[Bishop#Bishops in Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches|bishops]] are almost always chosen from the ranks of monks.

Eastern monasticism is found in three distinct forms: [[anchorites|anchoritic]] (a solitary living in isolation), [[cenobitic]] (a community living and worshiping together under the direct rule of an abbot or abbess), and the "middle way" between the two, known as the [[skete]] (a community of individuals living separately but in close proximity to one another, who come together only on Sundays and feast days, working and praying the rest of the time in solitude, but under the direction of an elder). One normally enters a cenobitic community first, and only after testing and spiritual growth would one go on to the skete or, for the most advanced, become a solitary anchorite. However, one is not necessarily expected to join a skete or become a solitary; most monastics remain in the cenobium the whole of their lives.

In general, Orthodox monastics have little or no contact with the outside world, including their own families. The purpose of the monastic life is union with God, the means is through leaving the world (i.e., the life of the passions). After tonsure, Orthodox monks and nuns are never permitted to cut their hair. The hair of the head and the beard remain uncut as a symbol of the vows they have taken, reminiscent of the [[Nazarite]]s from the [[Old Testament]]. The [[tonsure]] of monks is the token of a consecrated life, and symbolizes the cutting off of their self-will.

===Degrees===

{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}
[[File:megaloschema.svg|thumb|upright|left|The Great Schema worn by Orthodox monks and nuns of the most advanced degree]]

The process of becoming a monk is intentionally slow, as the [[vows]] taken are considered to entail a lifelong commitment to God, and are not to be entered into lightly. In Orthodox monasticism after completing the novitiate, there are three ranks of monasticism. There is only one [[religious habit|monastic habit]] in the Eastern Church (with certain slight regional variations), and it is the same for both monks and nuns. Each successive grade is given a portion of the habit, the full habit being worn only by those in the highest grade, known for that reason as the "Great Schema", or "Great Habit".

The various profession rites are normally performed by the Abbot, but if the abbot has not been ordained a priest, or if the monastic community is a convent, a [[hieromonk]] will perform the service. The abbot or hieromonk who performs a tonsure must be of at least the rank he is tonsuring into. In other words, only a hieromonk who has been tonsured into the Great Schema may himself tonsure a Schemamonk. A bishop, however, may tonsure into any rank, regardless of his own.

''Novice'' ([[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: ''Poslushnik''), lit. "one under obedience"—Those wishing to join a monastery begin their lives as novices. After coming to the monastery and living as a guest for not less than three days, the revered abbot or abbess may bless the candidate to become a novice. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice, he or she simply receives permission to wear the clothing of a novice. In the Eastern monastic tradition, novices may or may not dress in the black [[Endorasson|inner cassock]] (Greek: ''Anterion'', ''Eisorasson''; Church Slavonic: ''Podriasnik'') and wear the soft monastic hat (Greek: ''[[Skoufos]]'', Church Slavonic: ''Skufia''), depending on the tradition of the local community, and in accordance to the abbot’s directives. The inner-cassock and the skoufos are the first part of the Orthodox monastic habit. In some communities, the novice also wears the leather belt. He is also given a [[prayer rope]] and instructed in the use of the [[Jesus Prayer]]. If a novice chooses to leave during the period of the novitiate, no penalty is incurred. He may also be asked to leave at any time if his behaviour does not conform to the monastic life, or if the superior discerns that he is not called to monasticism. When the abbot or abbess deems the novice ready, he is asked if he wishes to join the monastery. Some, out of humility, will choose to remain novices all their lives. Every stage of the monastic life must be entered into voluntarily.

''Rassophore'' (Church Slavonic: ''Ryassofor''), lit. "Robe-bearer"—If the novice continues on to become a monk, he is clothed in the first degree of monasticism at a formal service known as the [[Tonsure]]. Although there are no formal [[vows]] made at this point, the candidate is normally required to affirm his commitment to persevere in the monastic life. The abbot will then perform the tonsure, cutting a small amount of hair from four spots on the head, forming a cross. He is then given the outer cassock (Greek: ''Rasson'', ''Exorasson'', or ''Mandorasson''; Church Slavonic: ''Ryassa'')—an outer robe with wide sleeves, something like the [[cowl]] used in the West, but without a hood—from which the name of Rassophore is derived. He is also given a brimless hat with a veil, known as a [[klobuk]], and a leather belt is fastened around his waist. His habit is usually black, signifying that he is now dead to the world, and he receives a new name. Although the Rassophore does not make formal vows, he is still morally obligated to continue in the monastic estate for the rest of his life. Some will remain Rassophores permanently without going on to the higher degrees.

''Stavrophore'' (Church Slavonic: ''Krestonosets''), lit. "Cross-bearer"—The next level for Eastern monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure when the abbot feels the monk has reached an appropriate level of discipline, dedication, and humility. This degree is also known as the ''Little Schema'', and is considered to be a "betrothal" to the Great Schema. At this stage, the monk makes formal vows of stability, [[chastity, obedience and poverty]]. Then he is tonsured and clothed in the habit, which in addition to that worn by the Rassophore, includes the ''paramandyas'' (Church Slavonic: ''paraman''), a piece of square cloth worn on the back, embroidered with the instruments of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] (see picture above), and connected by ties to a wooden cross worn over the heart. The paramandyas represents the yoke of Christ. Because of this addition he is now called ''Stavrophore'', or ''Cross-bearer''. He is also given a wooden hand cross (or "profession cross"), which he should keep in his [[icon corner]], and a beeswax candle, symbolic of monastic vigilance the sacrificing of himself for God. He will be buried holding the cross, and the candle will be burned at his funeral. In the Slavic practice, the Stavrophore also wears the monastic [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]]. The rasson (outer robe) worn by the Stavrophore is more ample than that worn by the Rassophore. The abbot increases the Stavrophore monk’s prayer rule, allows a more strict personal ascetic practice, and gives the monk more responsibility.

''Great Schema'' (Greek: ''Megaloschemos'', Church Slavonic: ''Skhimnik'')—Monks whose abbot feels they have reached a high level of spiritual excellence reach the final stage, called the [[Great Schema]]. The tonsure of a Schemamonk follows the same format as the Stavrophore, and he makes the same vows and is tonsured in the same manner. But in addition to all the garments worn by the Stavrophore, he is given the ''Analavos'' (Church Slavonic: ''Analav'') which is the article of monastic vesture emblematic of the Great Schema. For this reason, the analavos itself is sometimes called the "Great Schema". The analavos comes down in the front and the back, somewhat like the [[scapular]] in Western monasticism, although the two garments are probably not related. It is often intricately embroidered with the instruments of the Passion and the [[Trisagion]] (the angelic hymn). The Greek form does not have a hood, the Slavic form has a hood and lappets on the shoulders, so that the garment forms a large cross covering the monk's shoulders, chest, and back. Another piece added is the ''Polystavrion'' or "Many Crosses", which consists of a cord with a number of small crosses plaited into it.  The polystavrion forms a yoke around the monk and serves to hold the analavos in place, and reminds the monastic that he is bound to Christ and that his arms are no longer fit for worldly activities, but that he must labor only for the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]].  Among the Greeks, the mantle is added at this stage.  The paramandyas of the Megaloschemos is larger than that of the Stavrophore, and if he wears the klobuk, it is of a distinctive thimble shape, called a ''[[cowl|koukoulion]]'', the veil of which is usually embroidered with crosses.  In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is only given to monks and nuns on their death bed, while in others they may be elevated after as little as 25 years of service.

Eastern Orthodox monks are addressed as "Father" even if they are not priests; but when conversing among themselves, monks will often address one another as "Brother".  Novices are always referred to as "Brother". Among the Greeks, old monks are often called ''Gheronda'', or "Elder", out of respect for their dedication.  In the Slavic tradition, the title of Elder (Church Slavonic: ''[[Starets]]'') is normally reserved for those who are of an advanced spiritual life, and who serve as guides to others.

For the Orthodox, ''Mother'' is the correct term for nuns who have been tonsured Stavrophore or higher. Novices and Rassophores are addressed as "Sister".  Nuns live identical ascetic lives to their male counterparts and are therefore also called ''monachai'' (the feminine plural of ''monachos''), and their community is likewise called a monastery.

Many (but not all) Orthodox [[seminary|seminaries]] are attached to monasteries, combining academic preparation for [[ordination]] with participation in the community's life of prayer, and hopefully benefiting from the example and wise counsel of the monks.  Bishops are required by the [[canon law|sacred canons]] of the Orthodox Church to be chosen from among the monastic clergy. The requirement is specifically that they be monastics, not simply celibate (see [[clerical celibacy]]).  Monks who have been ordained to the priesthood are called [[hieromonk]]s (priest-monks); monks who have been ordained to the [[diaconate]] are called [[hierodeacon]]s (deacon-monks).  A Schemamonk who is a priest is called a Hieroschemamonk.  Most monks are not ordained; a community will normally only present as many candidates for ordination to the bishop as the liturgical needs of the community require.

==Western Christianity==

===Roman Catholicism===
[[File:Kovelklein.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|left|Order of Saint Benedict]]
[[File:Czestochowa-bazylika.jpg|thumb|upright|The famed monastery of [[Jasna Góra]] is one of the last run by the [[Pauline Fathers]], an important order in the history of the monastic tradition.]]
[[File:Czerwony Klasztor.jpg|thumb|Monastery [[Červený Kláštor (monastery)|Červený Kláštor]] in [[Slovakia]]]]

Within Roman Catholicism, a monk is a member of a [[Catholic religious order|religious order]] who lives a communal life in a [[monastery]], [[abbey]], or [[priory]] under a monastic rule of life (such as the [[Rule of St. Benedict]]). [[St. Benedict of Nursia]], (480-543 or 547 AD) is considered to be the founder of western monasticism. He authored the [[Rule of St. Benedict]], which is the foundation for the [[Order of St. Benedict]] and all of its reform groups such as the [[Cistercians]] and the [[Trappists]]. He founded the great Benedictine monastery, [[Monte Cassino]], in 529.

The religious [[vows]] taken in the West were first developed by [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]].  These vows were three in number: obedience, conversion of life, and stability.  Obedience calls for the monk to obey Christ, as represented by the superior person of the monastery, which is an [[abbot]] or [[prior]].  Conversion of life means, generally, that the monk convert himself to the way of a monk, which is death to self and to the world and life to God and to his work. A Christian monk is to be an instrument of God's work. Stability entails that the monk commit himself to the monastery for the remainder of his life, and so, upon death, will be buried at its cemetery.  The vow of stability is unique to Benedictines.

The [[solemn vows]] in other religious communities were eventually established as vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity. Poverty requires that they renounce any ownership of property or assets, except for items that were allowed to them by their superior (such as a [[religious habit]], [[shoes]], a [[cloak]], etc.), and to live meekly, sharing whatever they might have with the poor.  Chastity requires that since they were willing to dedicate their lives to God, they sacrificed the love between men and women and would not marry. Also, they give up any act of sexual conduct.

To become a monk, one first must become a [[postulant]], during which time the man lives at the monastery to evaluate whether he is called to become a monk. As a postulant, the man is not bound by any vows, and is free to leave the [[monastery]] at any time. If the postulant and the community agree that the postulant should become a monk, the man is received as a [[novice]], at which time he is given his [[religious habit]], and begins to participate more fully in the life of the monastery. Following a period as a novice, usually six months to a year, the novice professes temporary vows, which can be renewed for a period of years. After a few years, the monk professes [[permanent vows]], which are binding for life.

The monastic life generally consists of prayer in the form of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] (also known as the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]) and divine reading (''[[lectio divina]]'') and manual labor. Among most [[religious orders]], monks live in simple, austere rooms called cells and come together daily to celebrate the [[Conventual Mass]] and to recite the [[Liturgy of the Hours]]. In most communities, the monks take their meals together in the [[refectory]]. While there is no vow of silence, many communities have a period of silence lasting from evening until the next morning and some others restrict talking to only when it is necessary for the monks to perform their work and during weekly recreation.

[[File:Germany München Monks.jpg|thumb|right|[[Munich]]'s city symbol celebrates its founding by [[Benedictine]] monks—and the origin of its name]]

Monks who have been or will be [[Ordination#Eastern, Roman, and Anglican Christianity|ordained]] into [[Holy Orders]] as [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] or [[deacons]] are referred to as ''choir monks'', as they have the obligation to recite the entire [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] daily in [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]. Those monks who are not [[Ordination#Eastern, Roman, and Anglican Christianity|ordained]] into [[Holy Orders]] are referred to as [[lay brothers]]. In most monastic communities today, little distinction exists between the lay brothers and the choir monks. However, historically, the roles of the two groups of monks within the monastery differed. The work of the choir monks was considered to be prayer, chanting the seven hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] and celebrating the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] daily whereas the lay brothers provided for the material needs of the community by growing food, preparing meals, maintaining the monastery and the grounds. This distinction arose historically because generally those monks who could read [[Latin]] typically became choir monks, while those monks who were illiterate or could not read [[Latin]] became [[lay brothers]]. Since the lay brothers could not recite the Divine Office in Latin, they would instead pray easily memorizable prayers such as the [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] or the [[Hail Mary]] as many as 150 times per day. Since the [[Second Vatican Council]], the distinction between choir monks and lay brothers has been deemphasized, as the council allowed the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] to be said in the vernacular language, effectively opening participation to all of the monks.

Within western monasticism, it is important to differentiate between monks and [[friars]]. Monks generally live a contemplative life of prayer confined within a monastery while [[friars]] usually engage in an active ministry of service to the outside community. The monastic orders include all [[Benedictines]] (the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] and its later reforms including the [[Cistercians]] and the [[Trappists]]) and the [[Carthusian]]s, who live according to their own [[Statutes of the Carthusian Order|Statutes]], and not according to the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] proper. Orders of [[friars]] include the [[Franciscan]]s, [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Carmelites]], and [[Augustinians]]. Although the [[Canons Regular]], such as the [[Norbertines]], live in community, they are neither monks nor friars as they are characterized by their [[cleric|clerical state]] and not by any monastic vows.

===Anglicanism===
Monastic life in [[England]] came to an abrupt end when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] broke from the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and made himself the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|head]] of the [[Church of England]]. He initiated the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], during which all of the [[monastery|monasteries]] within [[England]] were destroyed. A large number of monks were executed, others fled to continental [[Europe]]an monasteries where they were able to continue their monastic life.

Shortly after the beginning of the revival of the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic Movement]] in the Church of England, there was felt to be a need for a restoration of the monastic life. In the 1840s, the then Anglican priest and future Catholic Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]] established a community of men at [[Littlemore]] near [[Oxford]]. From then on, there have been established many communities of monks, [[friar]]s and other religious communities for men in the [[Anglican Communion]]. There are Anglican [[Benedictine]]s, [[Franciscan]]s, [[Cistercian]]s, and in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the United States, [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. There are also uniquely Anglican monastic orders such as the [[Society of Saint John the Evangelist]] and the [[Community of the Resurrection]] at [[College of the Resurrection|Mirfield]].

Some Anglican religious communities are contemplative, some active, but a distinguishing feature of the monastic life among Anglicans is that most practice the so-called "mixed life". Anglican monks recite the Divine Office in choir daily, either the full eight services of the [[Breviary]] or the four offices found in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and celebrate the [[Eucharist]] daily. Many orders take on external works such as service to the poor, giving religious retreats, or other active ministries within their immediate communities. Like [[Roman Catholic]] monks, Anglican monks also take the monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

In the early 20th century when the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic Movement]] was at its height, the Anglican Communion had hundreds{{cn|date=October 2015}} of orders and communities and thousands of religious followers. However, since the 1960s there has been a sharp falling off in the numbers of religious in many parts of the Anglican Communion. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery composed of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct.

There are however, still several thousand Anglican monks working today in approximately 200 communities around the world. The most surprising growth has been in the [[Melanesian]] countries of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[Melanesian Brotherhood]], founded at [[Tabalia]], [[Guadalcanal]], in 1925 by [[Ini Kopuria]], is now the largest Anglican community in the world with over 450 brothers in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the [[Philippines]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

===Lutheranism===
[[File:St augustine.jpg|left|thumb|St. Augustine's House Lutheran [[Monastery]] in [[Oxford, Michigan]]]]
[[Loccum Abbey]] and [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] have the longest traditions as Lutheran monasteries. Since the 19th and 20th century, there has been a renewal in the monastic life among Lutheranism. There are many present-day Lutherans who practice the monastic teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icdb.org/show.php?r=osb&amp;PHPSESSID=8ed75cc0dbee7b113b0e220ce70deacd Order of Saint Benedict]. Retrieved 13-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American Lutheran traditions, "The Congregation of the Servants of Christ" was established at St. Augustine's House in [[Oxford, Michigan]], in 1958 when some other men joined Father [[Arthur Kreinheder]] in observing the monastic life and offices of prayer. These men and others came and went over the years. The community has always remained small; at times the only member was Father Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829997,00.html The Lonely Lutheran Monk], [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] (March 1, 1963). Retrieved 13-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 35 years of its existence over 25 men tested their vocations to monastic life by living at the house for some time, from a few months to many years, but at Father Arthur's death in 1989 only one permanent resident remained. At the beginning of 2006, there was 2 permanent professed members and 2 long-term guests. Strong ties remain with this community and their brothers in Sweden ([[Östanbäck monastery]]) and in Germany ([[Priory of St. Wigbert]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staugustineshouse.org/ Staugustineshouse.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the [[Order of Lutheran Franciscans]], a religious community of friars and sisters within the tradition of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]].

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Bhikkhu}}
{{peoplepalicanon}}
[[File:Monks in Wat Phra Singh - Chiang Mai.jpg|thumb|left|Buddhist monks in [[Thailand]].]]
[[File:Monk resting outside Thag-Thok Gompa, Ladakh.jpg|thumb|left|Monk resting outside Thag-Thok Gompa, [[Ladakh]]]]
[[File:Monk with baby sparrow at Likir Gompa, Ladakh.jpg|thumb|Monk caring for baby [[sparrow]] at Likir Gompa, Ladakh]]

In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, ''[[bhikkhu]]'' is the term for monk. Their disciplinary code is called the ''[[patimokkha]]'', which is part of the larger ''[[Vinaya]]''. They live lives of [[mendicancy]], and go on a morning almsround ([[Pali]]: ''pindapata'') every day. The local people give food for the monks to eat, though the monks are not permitted to positively ask for anything. The monks live in monasteries, and have an important function in traditional Asian society. Young boys can be ordained as [[samanera]]s. Both bhikkhus and samaneras eat only in the morning, and are not supposed to lead a luxurious life. Their rules forbid the use of money, although this rule is nowadays not kept by all monks. The monks are part of the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]'', the third of the [[Triple Gem]] of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dhamma]], Sangha.

In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the term 'Sangha' strictly speaking refers to those who have achieved certain levels of understanding. They are therefore called 'community of the excellent ones' ({{lang-bo|mchog kyi tshogs}}); however, these in turn need not be monks (i.e., hold such [[religious vows|vows]]). Several Mahayana orders accept female practitioners as monks, instead of using the normal title of "nun", and they are considered equal to male ascetics in all respects.

The [[Bhikkhus]] are only allowed 4 items ''(other than their robes)'': a [[razor]], a [[Sewing needle|needle]], an alms bowl and a water strainer. {{citation needed|reason=Not found on Bhikkhu main page or this one|date=December 2015}}

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, monkhood is part of the system of 'vows of individual liberation'; these vows are taken in order to develop one's own personal ethical discipline. The monks and nuns form the (ordinary) ''sangha''. As for the Vajrayana vows of individual liberation, there are four steps: A lay person may take the 5 vows called 'approaching virtue' (in Tibetan &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''genyen''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt; ''dge snyan''&gt;). The next step is to enter the monastic way of life (Tib. ''rabjung'') which includes wearing monk's or nun's [[robes]]. After that, one can become a 'novice' (Pali ''[[samanera]]'', Tib. ''getshül''); the last and final step is to take all vows of the 'fully ordained monk' (''gelong''). This term 'gelong' (Tib. &lt; ''dge long''&gt;, in the female form ''gelongma'') is the translation of Skt. ''bikshu'' (for women ''bikshuni'') which is the equivalent of the Pali term ''[[bhikkhuni]]''; ''[[bhikkhu]]'' is the word used in Theravada Buddhism (Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand).
[[File:Chinese Buddhist Monks Ceremony Hangzhou.jpeg|thumb|right|Buddhist monks performing ceremony in Hangzhou, China.]]

[[China|Chinese]] Buddhist monks have been traditionally and stereotypically linked with the practice of the [[Chinese martial arts]] or ''Kung fu'', and monks are frequently important characters in [[martial arts film]]s.  This association is focused around the [[Shaolin Monastery]].  The Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]], traditionally credited as the founder of [[Zen]] Buddhism in China, is also claimed to have introduced [[Kalaripayattu]] (which later evolved into Kung Fu) to the country. This latter claim has however been a source of much controversy (see [[Bodhidharma, the martial arts, and the disputed India connection]]) One more feature about the Chinese Buddhist monks is that they practice the burning marks on their scalp, finger or part of the skin on their anterior side of the forearm with incense as a sign of ordination.

In [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]], it is common for boys to spend some time living as a monk in a monastery. Most stay for only a few years and then leave, but a number continue on in the ascetic life for the rest of their lives.

In [[Mongolia]] during the 1920s, there were about 110,000 monks, including children, who made up about one-third of the male population,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://countrystudies.us/mongolia/47.htm Mongolia – Buddhism]". [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom were killed in the purges of [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan|Choibalsan]].

==Jainism==
{{Main|Jain monasticism}}
One of the most intense forms of Asceticism can be found in [[Jainism]], one of the world's oldest religions. Jainism encourages fasting, yoga practices, meditation in difficult postures, and other austerities.&lt;ref&gt;Frank William Iklé et al. "A History of Asia", page ?. Allyn and Bacon, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jains, one's highest goal should be attaining [[Nirvana]] or [[Moksha]] (i.e., liberation from [[samsara]], the cycle of birth and rebirth). For this, a soul has to be without attachment or self-indulgence. This can be achieved only by the monks and nuns who take five great vows: of non-violence, of truth, of non-stealing, of non-possession and of celibacy.
[[File:Acharya5.jpg|thumb|[[Acharya Vidyasagar]], a possessionless and detached [[Digambara]] Jain monk]]
Most of the austerities and ascetic practices can be traced back to Vardhaman [[Mahavira]], the twenty-fourth "fordmaker" or [[Tirthankara]]. The [[Acaranga Sutra]], or Book of Good Conduct, is a sacred book within Jainism that discusses the ascetic code of conduct. Other texts that provide insight into conduct of ascetics include Yogashastra by Acharya [[Hemachandra]] and Niyamasara by Acharya [[Kundakunda]]. Other illustrious Jain works on ascetic conduct are ''Oghanijjutti, Pindanijjutti, Cheda Sutta, and Nisiha Suttafee.''

Full Jain monk in either [[Svetambara]] or [[Digambara]] tradition&lt;ref&gt;Anne Vallely (2002) ''Guardians of the Transcendent: An Ethnography of a Jain Ascetic Community''. University of Toronto
Press&lt;/ref&gt; can belong to one of these ranks:
* [[Acharya]]: leader of the order
* Upadhyaya: a learned monk, who both teaches and studies himself
* Muni: an ordinary monk

These three are mentioned is the three lines of the [[Namokar Mantra]]. In the [[Digambara]] tradition, a junior monk can be a:
* Ailak: they use one piece of cloth
* [[Kshullak]]: they may use two pieces of cloth

The [[Svetambar Terapanthi]] sect has a new rank of junior monks who are called samana. The nuns are called Aryikas in [[Digambar]] tradition and Sadhvi in the [[Svetambar]] tradition.

===Ascetic vows===
[[File:Mahavratas.jpg|thumb|Five [[Mahavrata]]s of Jain ascetics]]
As per the Jain vows, the monks and nuns renounce all relations and possessions. Jain ascetics practice complete non-violence. ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]]'' is the first and foremost vow of a Jain ascetic. They do not hurt any living being, be it an insect or a human. They carry a special broom to sweep away any insects that may cross their path. Some Jain monks wear a cloth over the mouth to prevent accidental harm to airborne germs and insects. They also do not use electricity as it involves violence. Furthermore, they do not use any devices or machines.

As they are without possession and attachment, they travel from city to city, often crossing forests and deserts, and always barefoot. Jain ascetics do not stay in a single place for more than two months to prevent themselves from becoming attached to any location. However, during four months of monsoon (rainy season) known as chaturmaas, they continue to stay in a single place to avoid killing the life forms that thrive during the rains.
Jain monks and nuns practice complete celibacy. They do not touch or share a sitting platform with a person of opposite sex.

===Dietary practices===
Jain ascetics follow a strict vegetarian diet without root vegetables. [[Shvetambara]] monks do not cook food but solicit alms from householders. [[Digambara]] monks have only a single meal a day. Neither group will beg for food, but a Jain ascetic may accept a meal from a householder, provided that the latter is pure of mind and body and offers the food of his own volition and in the prescribed manner. During such an encounter, the monk remains standing and eats only a measured amount. Fasting (i.e., abstinence from food and sometimes water) is a routine feature of Jain asceticism. Fasts last for a day or longer, up to a month. Some monks avoid (or limit) medicine or hospitalization due to their careful attention to body.

===Austerities and other daily practices===
[[File:Westindischer Maler um 1400 001.jpg|thumb|White-clothed Acharya Kalaka]]
Other austerities include meditation in seated or standing posture near river banks in the cold wind, or meditation atop hills and mountains, especially at noon when the sun is at its fiercest. Such austerities are undertaken according to the physical and mental limits of the individual ascetic. Jain ascetics are (almost) completely without possessions. Some Jains (Shvetambara monks and nuns) own only unstitched white robes (an upper and lower garment) and a bowl used for eating and collecting alms. Male Digambara monks do not wear any clothes and carry nothing with them except a soft broom made of shed peacock feathers (pinchi) and eat from their hands. They sleep on the floor without blankets and sit on special wooden platforms.

Every day is spent either in study of scriptures or meditation or teaching to lay people. They stand aloof from worldly matters. Many Jain ascetics take a final vow of Santhara or [[Sallekhana]] (i.e., a peaceful and detached death where medicines, food, and water are abandoned). This is done when death is imminent or when a monk feels that he is unable to adhere to his vows on account of advanced age or terminal disease.

Quotes on ascetic practices from the Akaranga Sutra as [[Hermann Jacobi]] translated it:&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Jacobi, "[[Sacred Books of the East]]", vol. 22: Gaina Sutras Part I. 1884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Jacobi (1884) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm Jaina Sutras, Part I]. Sacred-texts.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A monk or a nun wandering from village to village should look forward for four cubits, and seeing animals they should move on by walking on his toes or heels or the sides of his feet. If there be some bypath, they should choose it, and not go straight on; then they may circumspectly wander from village to village.|Third Lecture(6)}}

{{quote|I shall become a Sramana who owns no house, no property, no sons, no cattle, who eats what others give him; I shall commit no sinful action; Master, I renounce to accept anything that has not been given.' Having taken such vows, (a mendicant) should not, on entering a village or scot-free town, &amp;c., take himself, or induce others to take, or allow others to take, what has not been given.|Seventh Lecture (1)}}

==Vaishnava==
{{Main|International Society for Krishna Consciousness}}

Madhvaacharya ([[Madhvacharya]]), the [[Dwaita]] philosopher, established ''[[ashta matha]]'' (Eight Monasteries). He appointed a monk (called ''swamiji'' or ''swamigalu'' in local parlance) for each ''matha'' or monastery who has the right to worship Madhvacharya's [[murti]] of Lord [[Krishna]] by rotation. Each matha's swamiji gets a chance to worship after fourteen years. This ritual is called ''[[Paryaya]]'' and has been used also outside his [[sampradaya]], e.g. in [[Gaudiya Vaisnava]] [[Radharamana]] [[temple]] in [[Vrindavan]].

Similar in appearance to Buddhist monks, [[brahmacharya|brahmacari]] monks from the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] ([[ISKCON]]), or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]] as they are popularly known, are the best known [[Vaishnava]] monks outside India. They are a common sight in many places around the world. Their appearance—simple [[saffron]] ''[[dhoti]]'', shaved head with ''[[sikha]]'', ''[[Tulasi]]'' neckbeads and ''[[tilaka]]'' markings—and social customs (''[[sadhana]]'') date back many thousands of years to the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] era with its ''[[varnasrama]]'' society. This social scheme includes both monastic and lay stages meant for various persons in various stages of life as per their characteristics (''[[guna]]'') and work (''[[karma]]'').

ISKCON started as a predominantly monastic group but nowadays the majority of members live as lay persons. Many of them, however, spent some time as monks. New persons joining ISKCON as full-time members (living in its centers) first undergo a three-month ''[[Bhakta]]'' training, which includes learning the basics of [[brahmacharya|brahmacari]] (monastic) life. After that they can decide if they prefer to continue as monks or as married ''[[Grihastha]]s''.

Brahmacari older than fifty years (as per ISKCON rule) can become ''[[sannyasi]]''. ''[[Sannyasa]]'', a life of full dedication to spiritual pursuits, is the highest stage of life in the ''varnasrama'' society. It is permanent and one cannot give it up. A Sannyasi is given the title [[Swami]]. Older grihastha with grown-up children are traditionally expected to accept ''[[vanaprastha]]'' (celibate retired) life.

The role of monastic orders in [[India]]n and now also [[Western world|Western]] society has to some extent been adapted over the years in accordance with ever-changing social structures.

'''{{IAST|Oḍḍiyāna}}''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''Oḍḍiyāna''; {{bo|t=ཨུ་རྒྱན་|w=u rgyan}} {{lang-mn|Үржин}} ''urkhin'', {{lang-or|ଓଡ଼ିଆଣ}}), a small country in early [[medieval India]], is ascribed importance in the development and dissemination of [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]]. It is conventionally placed in what is now the [[Swat District]] of [[Pakistan]], although a case can also be made for its location in the [[states and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Odisha]]. Later Tibetan traditions view it as a [[beyul]], a legendary heavenly place inaccessible to ordinary mortals. [[Padmasambhava]], the eighth-century Buddhist master who was instrumental in the [[history of Tibetan Buddhism|introduction of Buddhism to Tibet]], was believed to have been born in Oddiyana.&lt;ref name="keown"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keown|first1=Damien|title=A Dictionary of Buddhism|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198605607|pages=203, 208|edition=1|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198605607.001.0001/acref-9780198605607-e-1294|accessdate=11 February 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The physical location of ''{{IAST|Oḍḍiyāna}}'' is disputed and open to conjecture. Possible locations that have been identified are:&lt;ref name="keown" /&gt;

* [[Odisha]] in Eastern India, through a case founded upon "literary, archeological and iconographic evidence". Scholars championing this location contend that the name Oḍḍiyāna derives from the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] ''{{IAST|Oṭṭiyan}}'', denoting a native or indigenous person of ''{{IAST|Oḍra}}'' ("Odisha") or from ''Oṭṭiyam'', [[Telugu language|Telugu]] for ''Oḍra''. ''{{IAST|Oḍḍiyāna}}'' is also the [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indic]] form of ''Udyāna'' "garden," the name by which [[Xuanzang]] knew the region around Odisha. Confusion about the identity of Oddiyana is conflated with confusion about the identity of [[Indrabhuti]] as Donaldson (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;11) observes:
{{quote|In his argument, P. C. Bagchi states that there are two distinct series of names in Tibetan: (1) O-rgyān, U-rgyān, O-ḍi-yā-na, and (2) O-ḍi-vi-śā, with the first series connected with Indrabhūti, i.e., Oḍiyăna and Uḍḍiyāna, while the second series falls back on Oḍi and Oḍiviśa, i.e., Uḍra (Odisha) and has nothing to do with Indrabhūti. N.K. Sahu objects, however, and points out that these two sets of names are seldom distinguished in Buddhist Tantra literature, and opines that the words Oḍa, Oḍra, Uḍra, Oḍiviśa and Oḍiyāna are all used as variants of Uḍḍiyāna. In the ''Sādhanamālā'', he further points out, Uḍḍiyāna is also spelt as Oḍrayāna while in the [[Kalika Purana|''Kālikā Purāṇa'']], as indicated earlier, it is spelt either Uḍḍiyāna or Oḍra. There is also evidence, Sahu continues, that Indrabhūti is the king of Odisha rather than of the Swāt valley. The [[Mahasiddha#Catur.C4.81siti-siddha-prav.E1.B9.9Btti|''Caturāsiti-siddha-Pravṛtti'']], for example, mentions him as the king of Oḍiviśa while Cordier, in his ''[[Tengyur|Bṣtān-ḥgyur]]'' catalogue, gives sufficient indications of his being the king of Orissa.

* In later Tibetan traditions, ''{{IAST|Oḍḍiyāna}}'' is either conflated or identified with [[Shambhala]], a land inhabited by [[dakini|''ḍākinī''s]] and inaccessible to or by ordinary mortals {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

==Orgyan or Orgyen==
In the 'Seven Line Prayer' (of [[Padmasambhava]]) revealed in Jigme Lingpa's terma of the [[Ngöndro]] of the [[Longchen Nyingthig]] and throughout the Longchen Nyingtig Ngondro, Oddiyana is rendered in the form {{bo|t=ཨོ་རྒྱན|w=o rgyan}}.

==Tibetan Buddhism==
In Tibetan Buddhist literature, ''{{IAST|Oḍḍiyāna}}'' is described as being ruled by several kings each of whom were named [[Indrabhuti|Indrabhūti]].&lt;ref name="keown" /&gt;

A number of Vajrayana and [[tantra|tantric]] practitioners are said to have stayed and practiced there. The first Vajrayana teachings were supposedly given there by [[Gautama Buddha]] at the request of the king.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyingma.com/nyingma%20History.htm Nyingma History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Udyāna==
'''Udyāna''' ([[Sanskrit]] "garden, orchard"; {{zh|t=烏萇|p=Wūcháng}}) was a Buddhist region located north of [[Peshawar]] along the [[Swat River]]; it was regarded as the furthest part of [[North India]] during the time of [[Faxian]].&lt;ref name="PoloYule1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Polo|first1=Marco|last2=Yule|first2=Sir Henry|last3=Cordier|first3=Henri|title=The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition : Including the Unabridged Third Edition (1903) of Henry Yule's Annotated Translation, as Revised by Henri Cordier, Together with Cordier's Later Volume of Notes and Addenda (1920).|year=1993|publisher=Courier Corporation|language=English |isbn=9780486275864|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is said to have supported some 500 [[vihara]]s of the [[Sthavira nikāya]], at which traveling monks were provided lodgings and food for three days. It was said to contain a [[Buddha footprint]], a rock on which he dried his clothes, and a locale where he converted a [[nāga]]. It is said that two schools derived from the Sthavira nikāya, the [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Kāśyapīya]], were established in this area. Both of these schools had proto-[[Mahayana]] doctrines.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Faxian stated that the food and clothing worn by those in Udyana were similar to those residing in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]].&lt;ref name="PoloYule1993"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5826">'''Pagan's Night Out''', or PNO, is a regularly scheduled social get-together, usually monthly, held in hundreds of [[Paganism|Pagan]] and [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] communities around the world. It began in [[Houston, Texas]] in 1992 as a way for users of the [[Brewers' Witch BBS]] to meet face to face, Pagan's Night Out has become a worldwide phenomena. Held in bars, pubs, coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and meeting halls, PNO is a social event for [[Wicca]]ns, [[Asatru]]ar, [[Thelema|Thelemites]], [[Druidism|Druids]], [[Temple of Set|Setians]] and the hundreds of other [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] sects and sub-divisions.

==Origins==
===The Brewers' Witch BBS===
The Brewers' Witch [[Bulletin Board System]] was started in May 1992, running on a DOS PC using the [[Waffle (bbs)|Waffle]] BBS software and a single phone line.&lt;ref name="bbsdoc"&gt;[http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/photos/034donal/index.html BBS: The Documentary]&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of three Pagan-oriented BBSs in Houston at that time and, thanks to its [[USENET]] newsgroups and email, quickly became a favorite haunt of the online [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] there.&lt;ref name="boardwatch"&gt;Boardwatch Magazine, October 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Later expanding to 5 phone lines and an [[ISDN]] feed running on a [[FreeBSD]] UNIX system, the BBS eventually spawned a webpage and, as the BBS era came to a close, moved totally onto the newly emerging [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://brewich.com/ The Brewers' Witch BBS website]&lt;/ref&gt; In its time the website garnered numerous 'Net awards including [[Pagan Best of the Web]], and the BBS was featured in [[Boardwatch Magazine]].&lt;ref name="boardwatch"/&gt; Although the dialup BBS ceased operations in 1998, and
the website saw the end of its heyday by 2000, the website still exists in a mostly static form. At their Beltaine celebration in 2005, Donal, the BBS's SysAdmin, received the first Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Council of Magickal Arts]] for his work on The Brewers' Witch BBS and Pagan's Night Out, as well as his work creating the [[USENET]] [[newsgroup]], [[soc.religion.paganism]]. Donal was the author of the newsgroup RFD and charter, and husbanded the newsgroup through its creation.&lt;ref name="srp cfv"&gt;*[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.pagan/browse_thread/thread/347363acd23c3eba/0b42c95c71a41444?lnk=gst&amp;q=soc.religion.paganism&amp;rnum=5#0b42c95c71a41444 Call For Votes (and results) for soc.religion.paganism] on Google Groups&lt;/ref&gt;

Donal had quickly realized that many tensions existed between the members of various traditions that were using his BBS and, influenced by a regular weekly party held by a chat board he was familiar with, decided to get his users together for a casual social outing to try to get them to view each other as friends first and practitioners of widely differing faiths second.&lt;ref name="bbsdoc"/&gt; The announcement on his BBS regarding Pagan's Night Out, made a few weeks before the suggested date, said everyone should "leave the [[Boline]]s and starched robes at home", meaning there was to be no discussion of inter-tradition politics.

===First PNO===
The first PNO was held on August 25, 1992&lt;ref&gt;Notes and on-line logs of the Brewers' Witch BBS in the possession of Silverflame, one of the original participants.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Houston, Texas]], with barely more than a dozen in attendance. By the next year monthly attendance was closer to 50 with occasional ''special'' PNO's (such as Yule and Samhain celebrations) exceeding 120.&lt;ref&gt;Signed logbooks of many of the early PNOs are in the possession of Donal, the SysAdmin of The Brewers' Witch BBS.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A PNO was started in the Washington, DC, area in 1998 when a resident from Houston moved to the nation's capital and wanted to offer a similar program for Pagans in the area.  Originally sponsored by the now defunct Mystic District Planning Coalition, the DC area PNO is currently sponsored by [http://www.openhearth.org The Open Hearth Foundation].  The DC-PNO originally met on the 13th of each month and rotated locations among DC, Northern Virginia, and suburban Maryland.  It now meets on the third Friday of the month.

Today there are PNOs all over the world and in every major city in the United States, even one that meets on a U.S. aircraft carrier. The U.S military has been instrumental in this spread and most non-U.S. PNOs are found on or near military bases.

==Impact==
Even through the internet age, PNO's were one of the only places people could come out of the 'broom closet' and talk with other Pagans and Neopagans. For those that aren't associated with other circles or covens, this was a very helpful place for the solitary practitioner to meet others in their area face to face. Pagan's Night Out began social networking with unaffiliated Pagans which would allow others to share ideas, discuss activities and even hold open rituals. It is perhaps the widely most used medium for in-person networking in the Pagan social scene.

==Trivia==
*'''Pagan Night Out''' is a song by [http://www.wiccabilly.com Loke E. Coyote's Wiccabilly Circus]. This song can be found on the MeGaPaGaTeXaPaLooZa CD which was recorded in April 2001 with songs from both [[SONA (band)|SONA]] and Trickster on it. 
*The band at the first two PNO's was the [[Celtic music|Celtic]] folk duo [[Céilí's Muse]]. This was not intentional, but merely serendipitous.

[[Christianity]] is the largest '''religion in [[Uruguay]]''', but over 41% of the population is [[Irreligion in Uruguay|irreligious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nigel-barber/uruguay-a-secular-utopia_b_1917005.html |title=Nigel Barber: Uruguay: A Secular Outpost Legalizes Abortion |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Church and state''' are officially separated since 1916.

== Demographics ==
According to a 2006 official survey approximately 58.2% of Uruguayans defined themselves as [[Christianity|Christian]] (47.1% [[Roman Catholic]], 11.1% [[Protestant]]), and approximately 40.4% of the population professes no religion (23.2% as "believing in God but without religion", 17.2% as [[atheist]] or [[agnostic]]), 0.6% as followers of [[Umbanda]] or other African religions, 0.5% as [[Jew]]ish, 0.1% [[Buddhist]] and 0.4% chose "other".&lt;ref name=enha_rel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gub.uy/enha2006/flash/Flash%206_Religion.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927091848/http://www.ine.gub.uy/enha2006/flash/Flash%206_Religion.pdf|archivedate=27 October 2013|title=Encuesta Nacional de Hogares Amplidada - 2006 | work = National Institute of Statistics | publisher = INHA |accessdate=7 September 2013|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the majority of Uruguayans do not actively practice a religion, they are nominally church members in the [[Catholic church]]. However, [[Protestants]] are more active. The first [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church in the country was erected in 1844 by British traders, and is considered a historical landmark. Other religious groups in Uruguay include the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. It is widely considered the most secular nation in the [[Americas]]. One cause of this{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--Christian missionaries caused secularism??--&gt; was that Spanish colonial missions sent priests to convert indigenous people, who had always been a very small population in Uruguay.&lt;ref name="JermynWong2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leslie Jermyn|author2=Winnie Wong|title=Uruguay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJp513dw1oUC&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=22 February 2016|year=2009|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-4482-4|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent study by Latinobarómetro in 2010, 39% of Uruguayans are Roman Catholics and 11% are Evangelical Protestants, this would form 50% of total Christians, now the population does not believe in God or atheist agnostic and has reached 47%. 3% of the population practice other religions such as Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, within that 3% also there were those who refused to answer the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latinobarometro, Dabatase|url=http://www.latinobarometro.org/lat.jsp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924115517/http://www.latinobarometro.org/lat.jsp|archivedate=24 October 2014|publisher=PNUD|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chhotte Sahibzade''' ({{lang-pa|ਛੋਟੇ ਸਾਹਿਬਜ਼ਾਦੇ}}) of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] attained martyrdom on 25/26 December 1705 at a very young age. This is known as Saka Sirhind. Every
year on 24 to 26 December, [[Shaheedi Jor Mela]] is organised at [[Fatehgarh Sahib]], to commemorate the supreme sacrifice at the place of their martyrdom.

Following are series of events related to Saka Sirhind:
* Eviction of [[Mata Gujri]], [[Sahibzada Fateh Singh]] and [[Sahibzada Zorawar Singh]] from [[Anandpur Sahib]] siege.
* Arrest of above three at Morinda and hearing at [[Sirhind]].
* innocent appearance at [[Sirhind]] Court.
* Nawab Sher Muhammad Khan defended young Sahibzadas.
* Declaration of Innocence of Sahibzadas, by Qazis and other officials.
* Provocative arguments by Diwan Sucha Nand and young Sahibzadas to support prosecution.
* Found guilty of keeping ideology rebellious to Mughal Government and religions.
* Punishment - Bricked alive
* Aftermath

What happened there
Hill rajas and Mughal forces had laid seize to Anandgarh Fort, Anandpur Sahib for about 8 months, in 1704. The Mughals and Hilly Rajas wanted Guru Gobind Singh to leave the fort they swore on Quran to give a safe passage to Guru. The Guru decided to leave the fort. Guru Sahib, four Sahibzadas, Mata Gujri, Guru's Mahil (wives), five Panj Piaras and a few hundred Sikhs left Anandpur Sahib on the chilly night of 20 December 1704 towards Ropar.  In the intervening night of 20–21 December, the rnemy breached the vows and attacked Guru's entourage at a site on Sarsa rivulet some 25&amp;nbsp;km from Anandpur Sahib. Guru's family separated. This spot is now known as Parwar Vichhora. Mata Gujri with two younger grandsons, accompanied Guru family cook, Gangoo, a Kashmiri pandit, to his village, Saheri near Morinda.  Guru's Mahil left with Bhai Mani Singh, towards Delhi. Guru Gobind Singh with two elder Sahibzadas, 5 Panj Piaras and 40 Sikhs proceeded towards Chamkaur and reached there, in the afternoon of 21 December. Both are in Ropar Distt.(Pb.). The famous Chamkaur battle, took place on 22 and 23 December 1704, where two elder Sahibzadas, 3 Panj Piaras and 40 Sikhs laid down their lives. Mata Gujri and the two younger Sahibzadas were arrested by Morinda Mughals sent by Wazir Khan at Saheri village. From there, they were handed over to Suba Sirhind. They were imprisoned, in the Thanda Burj (Cold Tower). A farcical Trial began, in the Kacheri, (Court) of Suba Sirhind. It lasted for three days. On 27 December 1704, a heinous and cold-blooded crime was committed in the Sarzameen of Sirhind. Guru Gobind Singh's two younger sons, Baba Fateh Singh and Baba Zorawar Singh aged 7 and 9 years were bricked alive and later killed in the presence of the Assembly of Shaitans, presided over by Suba Sirhind, Wazir Khan. Two younger Sahibzadas and Mata Gujri were cremated by a rich Hindu merchant [[Diwan Todar Mal]] who covered the cremation grounds in gold coins as their final rites couldn't be done on mughal ground (land), this place is now known as Joyti Saroop Gurudwara.

Samat Bikrmi dates and year: Leaving of Anandpur Sahib,5 Poh 1761, Battle of Chamkaur 6, 7 and 8 Poh 1761, Saka Sirhind 11,12 and 13 Poh 1761.

'''Sama''' ({{lang-tr|Sema}}, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]] and {{lang-ar|سَمَاع}} - ''samā‘&lt;sup&gt;un&lt;/sup&gt;'') is a [[Sufi]] ceremony performed as [[dhikr]]. Sama means "listening", while ''dhikr'' means "remembrance".&lt;ref name="During, J. 2010"&gt;During, J., and R. Sellheim. "Sama" Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition. Ed. P. Bearman, T. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. Van Donzel and W. P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These rituals often include singing, playing instruments, dancing, recitation of poetry and prayers, wearing symbolic attire, and other rituals.  It is a particularly popular form of worship in Sufism.

In 2008, [[UNESCO]] confirmed the "[[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] Sama Ceremony" of [[Turkey]] as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/39eur_uk.htm The Mevlevi Sama Ceremony] [[UNESCO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Islamic Culture}}
This term stems from the root-verb meaning ''acceptance by tradition'', from which derives the words سَمْع (''sam‘&lt;sup&gt;un&lt;/sup&gt;'') and اِسْتِمَاع (''’istimā‘&lt;sup&gt;un&lt;/sup&gt;'', listening), often paired with نَقْل (''naql&lt;sup&gt;un&lt;/sup&gt;'') and تَقْلِيد (''taqlīd&lt;sup&gt;un&lt;/sup&gt;'', tradition).&lt;ref&gt;[[Arabic]]: قاموس المنجد — Moungued Dictionary (paper); [[Persian language|Persian]]: Etymological Dictionary of the Iranian Verb — Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary 2 (paper), by Johnny Cheung, Brill Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been in use since the 10th century to refer to a type of ''[[dhikr]]'' (remembrance of [[God]]), a ''spiritual concert'', a ceremony used by various [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders, particularly the [[Chishti]] order of the [[Indian subcontinent|sub-continent]]. It often involves prayer, song and dance.&lt;ref name="avery p3-4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Avery|first=Kenneth S.|title=A Psychology of Early Sufi Samāʻ: Listening and Altered States|publisher=[[Routledge|RoutledgeCurzon]]|date=2004-09-24|pages=3–4|isbn=0-415-31106-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBcsCkzEE58C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=sama&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{Sufism|Practices}}
The origination of Sama in the Mevlevi Order of Turkish Sufis credited to [[Rumi]], Sufi master and creator of the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevis]]. The story of the creation of this unique form of dhikr is that Rumi was walking through the town marketplace one day when he heard the rhythmic hammering of the goldbeaters. It is believed that Rumi heard the dhikr,  {{lang|ar|لا إله إلا الله}} "''[[la ilaha ilallah]]''" or in English, "There is no god but Allah " in the apprentices beating of the gold and so entranced in happiness he stretched out both of his arms and started spinning in a circle ([[sufi whirling]]). With that the practice of Sama and the [[dervish]]es of the [[Mevlevi order]] were born.

Similarly, Abu Sa`id, (357 A.H.) (967 c.e.) was born in Mayhana, a town near Sarakhs, which today is in Iran, bordering Turkmanistan. He is noted for establishing a rule for conduct in the [[khanqah]] and also for the introduction of music (sama'), poetry and dance, as part of the Sufi collective devotional ritual of dhikr.

==Current practice==
===Mevlevi===
The [[Whirling Dervishes]] of the [[Mevlevi]] order are probably the best-known practitioners of Sama. Mevlevi practitioners of sema are adult initiates into the order, which historically only meant men. Participants move as a group in a circle while also turning each individually.

===Alevi/Bektashi===
Sema is prominent in the ceremonies of the [[Alevi]] community of [[Turkey]] and the closely related [[Bektashi Order]]. 

The most common forms of Alevi sema include kirklar semahı (sema of the forty) and turnalar semahı (crane sema).  They are performed by both male and female teenagers, often in mixed groups, and participants turn facing each other in pairs or small groups and do not necessarily whirl as individuals. Many [[cemevi|cemeviler]] (Alevi [[meetinghouses]]) have organized sema groups that perform at events such as the annual [[Hacı Bektaş Veli]] Festival.

===Tannoura===
In [[Egypt]], the Mevlevi form of Sama is known as [[tannoura]] and has been adopted (with some modifications) by other Sufi orders as well. It is also performed as a [[folk dance|folk]] and [[concert dance]].

==Symbolism==
The Sama represents a mystical journey of man's spiritual ascent through mind and love to perfection. Turning towards the truth, the follower grows through love, deserts his ego, finds the truth and arrives at perfection. He then returns from this spiritual journey as a man who has reached maturity and a greater perfection, so as to love and to be of service to the whole of creation.
Rumi has said in reference to Sama', "For them it is the Sama' of this world and the other. Even more for the circle of dancers within the Sama' who turn and have in their midst, their own Ka'aba." This relates Sama' to the pilgrimage to  Mecca, in that both are intended to bring all who are involved closer to God.

==Components==
Sama emphasizes singing, but also includes the playing of instruments, particularly for introductions and accompaniments.&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, Tony. "Untitled." Ethnomeditation Forum 13.2 (2004): 309-11. JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; However, only instruments which are symbolic and not considered profane are used. The most common of these are the tambourine, bells, and flute.&lt;ref name="Lewisohn, Leonard 1997"&gt;Lewisohn, Leonard. "The Sacred Meditation of Islam: Sama' in the Persian Sufi Tradition." British Journal of Ethnomeditation 6 (1997): 1-33. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; It often includes the singing of hymns, called ''qawl'' and ''bayt''.&lt;ref&gt;Rashow, Khalil J. "Jazn-A Jama'iya (Feast of The Assembly)." Encyclopedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry is often included in the ceremony as well, because while it is inadequate by itself, it works together with aid in spiritual contemplation. Any poetry, even the erotic, can be applied to God, and thus used for this ceremony. However, the listener's heart must first be pure, or the dancing components of sama' will make these people full of lust instead of love for God. Additionally, being in love with a person rather than with God clouds a person's mind when they are listening to erotic poetry.&lt;ref name="Lewisohn, Leonard 1997"/&gt; Verses from the Qur'an are never used for this purpose, and not only because their meanings are said to be somewhat dulled through repetition. Qur'anic verses are never to be set to meditation, nor ornamented or improvised in any way, so that they remain sacred texts.&lt;ref name="Lewisohn, Leonard 1997"/&gt;

==Purpose==
Sama is a means of meditating on God through focusing on melodies and dancing. It brings out a person's love of God, purifies the soul, and is a way of finding God. This practice is said to reveal what is already in one's heart, rather than creating emotions.&lt;ref name="During, J. 2010"/&gt; All of a person's doubt disappears, and the heart and soul can communicate directly with God.&lt;ref name="Gribetz, Arthur 1991"&gt;Gribetz, Arthur. "The Sama' Controversy: Sufi vs. Legalist." Studia Islamica 74 (1991): 43-62.JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate goal of sama' is to reach ''wajd'', which is a trance-like state of ecstasy.&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, Tony. "Untitled." Ethnomeditation Forum 13.2 (2004): 309-11. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, this state may include various and unexpected movements, agitation, and all types of dancing.&lt;ref name="During, J. 2010"/&gt;
Another state that people hope to reach through sama' is ''khamra'', which means "spiritual drunkenness".
Ultimately, people hope to achieve the unveiling of mysteries and gain spiritual knowledge through ''wajd''.&lt;ref&gt;During, J., and R. Sellheim. "Sama'" Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition. Ed. P. Bearman, T. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. Van Donzel, and W. P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes, the experience of ''wajd'' becomes so strong that fainting or even, in extreme circumstances, death&lt;sup&gt;citation required&lt;/sup&gt;, occurs.

==Etiquette==
Participants in sama are expected to remain silent and still, and controlled throughout the ceremony, unless wajd occurs.&lt;ref name="Lewisohn, Leonard 1997"/&gt; This way, a higher degree of spiritual contemplation  can be reached. Participants must restrain themselves from movement and crying until they reach a point in which they can no longer hold back. At this point, wajd can be reached. It is essential that the trance-like experience of wajd be genuine and not faked for any reason. Also, people must maintain proper intent and actions must be present throughout the sama'; otherwise, they cannot experience the ceremony's intended positive effects.

==Controversy==
Muslims are divided into two groups regarding the issue of sama and the use of music in general: 1) Opponents, particularly of the Salafi/Wahabbi sect. 2) Advocates, who are of the majority Sunnis.&lt;ref name="Lewisohn, Leonard 1997"/&gt;

Advocates view chants as a required practice for spiritual growth.&lt;ref name="Gribetz, Arthur 1991"/&gt; Al-Ghazzali wrote a chapter entitled "Concerning Music and Dancing as Aids to the Religious Life", where he emphasized how the practices of music and dance are beneficial to Muslims, as long as their hearts are pure before engaging in these practices.&lt;ref&gt;Ghazzālī, and Claud Field. The Alchemy of Happiness. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents find music as an Innovation [[bidah]] and associated with infidelity. They compare the physical sensations experienced by a person in the state of wajd to a state of physical drunkenness, and therefore do not condone it.&lt;ref name="Gribetz, Arthur 1991"/&gt;

==In practice==
Due to differences in culture between Muslim groups, participation in musical performance is condoned in some and considered questionable in others. Meditation and Sufi practices are allowed in Islam as long as they are within the limits of the Shari'ah (Islamic law).
People from all classes and walks of life can participate, although there is debate between Sufis and legalists about whether novice Sufis and ones more advanced in their faith are capable of achieving the same positive results from sama'. The same debate exists for the young, and whether they are capable of overcoming their lust and clearing their hearts to worship God.

'''Shigandang''' ({{zh|t=石敢當|w=shih-kan-tang|p=shí gǎn dāng}}; Japanese: {{lang|ja|石敢當}} ''ishigantō'') is an ornamental [[stone tablet]] with writings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fushantang.com/1003/c1011.html 石敢當][http://www.masterlung.com/course06.html 泰山石敢當][http://www.sinchew.com.my/node/67322 泰山石敢當]&lt;/ref&gt; which is used to exorcise evil spirits in [[east Asia]]. The Shigandang are often associated with [[Mount Tai]] and are often placed on street intersections or three-way junctions, especially in the crossing, which is often considered a fierce place (凶位). Many Shigandang have been replaced by stone written with [[Nianfo|Nāmó Ēmítuófó]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5891">'''Soheil Muhsin Afnan''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]/ [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|fa|سهیل محسن افنان}}) (b. 1904 - d. 1990) was a scholar of Philosophy, Arabic, Persian, and Greek whose intellectual works included translations of Greek texts into Persian as well as the publication of philosophical lexicons.&lt;ref name= "Kitaabun"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kitaabun.com/shopping3/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=25&amp;products_id=3207 |title= About the Author |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Kitaabun |publisher= |access-date= November 5, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and Family==
Soheil Afnan was born in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to a prominent [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|Bahá'í lineage]].  His parents were Mírzá Muḥsin Afnán, a cousin of the [[Báb]], and Túbá Khánum.   His maternal grandparents were [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the successor to the [[Bahá'í]] founder-prophet [[Bahá'u'lláh]], and [[Munirih Khánum]].  Soheil Afnan received his initial education at the [[De La Salle Brothers|LaSallian]] Collège des Frères in Haifa and later at the [[American University of Beirut]], where he would graduate in 1923.&lt;ref name="Kitaabun"/&gt;  He would continue to the Sorbonne and Oxford University but financial constraints imposed due the death of his father as well as the onset of World War II curtailed his studies at those institutions.  Despite having been declared a [[Covenant-breaker]] by  his first cousin [[Shoghi Effendi]], the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in 1971 Soheil Afnan established a scholarship, the Fuad Muhsin Afnan Memorial Fund, for "Bahai students in need" at the American University of Beirut in honor of his younger brother who died in 1941 during an aerial bombardment in London where he was volunteering as an [[Air Raid Warden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aub.edu.lb/advancement/advancement-services/sch/Pages/endowed-scholarships.aspx |title= Endowed Scholarships  |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= American University of Beirut, Advancement Services |publisher= |access-date= November 5, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soheil Afnan never married and did not have any children.

==Academic career==
In 1947, Soheil Afnan produced the first direct translation of Aristotle’s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]] from the Greek into Persian. Upon seeing this work, the Iranian poet [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]] serialized this translation in the literary magazine ''Iran-e Ma'' (''Our Iran''), of which he was the editor.  He praised Soheil Afnan with a poem published at the end of the series which was also published in his 1951 collection [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales#Works|''Arghanoon'' (ارغنون)]], which literally translates as [[Organon]].

Soheil Afnan obtained his PhD from [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] in 1956, and was a lecturer in Persian at the University of Cambridge from 1958 to 1961, where he collaborated with [[Arthur John Arberry]]. He continued to produce academic works, including translations and lexicons of philosophical terminology.  As late as 2006, [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] noted in his work ''Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present,'' that "There is not in fact even one satisfactory philosophical dictionary of Arabic and Persian terms with English equivalents. The only work of this kind available is that of Suhail Afnan, ''A Philosophical Lexicon in Persian and Arabic'' (Dar al Mashreq, Beirut, 1969).  This work is, however, far from being adequate, especially as far as technical vocabulary of later schools of Islamic philosophy is concerned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nasr |first= Seyyed Hossein | authorlink= Hossein Nasr |date= May 19, 2006  |title= Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present   |url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/301602339/Islamic-Philosophy-From-Its-Origin-to-the-Present |location= |publisher= State University of New York Press  |pages= 284–285 |isbn=978-0791468005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soheil Afnan passed away in 1990 in Istanbul where he was conducting research at the [[Topkapı Palace]] library.

'''Steve Jackson''' (born c. 1953{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}) is an American [[game designer]]. He designed the role-playing game ''[[GURPS]]'' and the card game ''[[Munchkin (card game)|Munchkin]]''.

==Education==
Steve Jackson is a 1974 [[alumnus|graduate]] of [[Rice University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/61711 "Rice University Class of 1974 Commencement program"]&lt;/ref&gt; where he was a resident of [[Baker College (Rice University)|Baker College]] before moving to [[Sid Richardson College]] when it opened in 1971.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Jackson briefly attended the [[University of Texas School of Law|UT Law School]], but left to pursue a career in game design.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|102}}

==Career==
===1970s: Metagaming Concepts===
While working at [[Metagaming Concepts]], Jackson developed ''[[Monsters! Monsters!]]'' (''ca''1976) based on a design by [[Ken St. Andre]] related to his ''[[Tunnels &amp; Trolls]]'' role-playing game, and ''[[Godsfire]]'' (1976), a 3D space conquest game designed by [[Lynn Willis]].&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} Jackson's first design for the company was ''[[Ogre (game)|Ogre]]'' (1977), followed by ''[[G.E.V. (board game)|G.E.V.]]'' (1978), which were set in the same futuristic universe that Jackson created.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|79}}

Jackson became interested in ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', but found the various-sized dice irritating and the combat rules confusing and unsatisfying, and did not like the lack of tactics, so he designed ''[[Melee (game)|Melee]]'' in response.&lt;ref name="designers" /&gt;{{rp|79}} Jackson joined the [[Society for Creative Anachronism|SCA]] to gain a better understanding of combat, but he soon became more interested and started fighting in SCA live-action combat as Vargskol, the Viking-Celt.&lt;ref name="designers" /&gt;{{rp|79}} Metagaming also published his game ''[[Wizard (board game)|Wizard]]''.&lt;ref name="HG"&gt;{{Cite book | contribution=[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]] | title=Hobby Games: The 100 Best | last=Jackson | first=Steve | authorlink= | editor-last=Lowder | editor-first=James | editor-link=James Lowder | publisher=[[Green Ronin Publishing]] | year=2007 | pages=231–235 | isbn=978-1-932442-96-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While designing ''Melee'', Jackson realized this idea could be expanded into a full fantasy role-playing game to compete with ''D&amp;D'', and started working on ''[[The Fantasy Trip]]''. While the game was originally scheduled for release in February 1978, the design and development required more work than Jackson had anticipated and the game was not released until March 1980.&lt;ref name="designers" /&gt;{{rp|79}} [[Howard Thompson (game designer)|Howard Thompson]], owner of Metagaming, decided to release ''The Fantasy Trip'' as four separate books instead of a boxed set, and changed his production methods so that Jackson would not be able to check the final proofs of the game. As a result of these actions, Jackson left Metagaming and founded [[Steve Jackson Games]] later that year.&lt;ref name="designers" /&gt;{{rp|79–80}}

===1980s-: Steve Jackson Games===
His game ''[[Raid on Iran]]'' was an immediate success.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; Jackson bought ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' from Metagaming, and sold the rights to ''The Fantasy Trip'' to Metagaming. However, Thompson sought legal action against SJG for the rights to a short wargame called ''One-Page Bulge'', and the lawsuit was settled with an agreement that was reached on November 26, 1981 which gave Jackson full rights to ''One-Page Bulge'', and to ''Ogre'' and ''G.E.V.'' (whose ownership was questioned during the legal proceedings).&lt;ref name="designers" /&gt;{{rp|80}} Jackson tried to purchase ''The Fantasy Trip'' from Thompson after Metagaming ceased operations in April 1983, but Thompson declined the offered price of $250,000.&lt;ref name="designers" /&gt;{{rp|81}}

Jackson designed or co-designed many of the games published by SJ Games, including minigames such as ''[[Car Wars]]'' (1981) and ''[[Illuminati (game)|Illuminati]]'' (1983), ''[[Undead (board game)|Undead]]'' (1981), and a published version of an informal game played on college campuses, called ''[[Killer: The Game of Assassination|Killer]]''.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|103}} Jackson wanted to get into computer gaming software in the early 1980s, but instead wound up licensing gaming rights to [[Origin Systems]], which produced games such as ''[[Autoduel]]'' (1985) and ''[[Ogre (video game)|Ogre]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|104}}

Jackson became interested in designing and publishing a new roleplaying system in the middle of 1981, intending it to be detailed and realistic, logical and well-organized, and adaptable to any setting and any level of play; he announced ''[[GURPS]]'' in 1983, although the company's magazines delayed development of ''GURPS'' until 1984, making the combat system book ''[[Man to Man: Fantasy Combat from GURPS]]'' (1985) available for Origins 1985, and the full ''GURPS Basic Set'' appeared the next year in 1986.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|105}} In 1995, [[Sean Punch]] took over for Jackson as the ''GURPS'' line editor.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|110}}

===Recent years===
Jackson also designed the strategy card games ''[[Munchkin (card game)|Munchkin]]'' (2001)&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|112}} and [[Ninja Burger]] (2003), and the dice games [[Zombie Dice]] (2010) and [[Cthulhu Dice]] (2010), as well as Zombie Dice variants [[Trophy Buck]] (2011) and [[Dino Hunt Dice]] (2013).

Jackson has exhibited his elaborate [[Chaos Machine]] at several science fiction or [[wargaming]] conventions, including the 2006 [[Worldcon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/worldcon/2007/01/chaos_machine.html |title=WorldCon 2006 |accessdate=2007-02-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214015243/http://blog.wired.com/worldcon/2007/01/chaos_machine.html |archivedate=December 14, 2007 |df=mdy-all }} from ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2012, Steve Jackson's [[Kickstarter]] funding project for the 6th Edition of his ''Ogre'' game became the highest grossing boardgame project at Kickstarter, with 5,512 backers pledging a total of $923,680. The success of the ''Ogre Designer's Edition'' project has prompted a new project (date of start/finish unknown at this time) to help re-launch the popular ''Car Wars'' franchise as well. The use of Kickstarter as a combination of market research tool and funding program for development is a first in the gaming industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kickstarter]] project page for [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/847271320/ogre-designers-edition ''Ogre Designer's Edition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===The two "Steve Jacksons"===
Jackson is often mistaken for [[Steve Jackson (UK game designer)|Steve Jackson]], a British [[gamebook]] and video game writer who co-founded [[Games Workshop]]. The confusion is exacerbated by the fact that while the UK Jackson was co-creator of the ''[[Fighting Fantasy]]'' gamebook series, the US Jackson also wrote three books in this series (''[[Scorpion Swamp]]'', ''[[Demons of the Deep]]'', and ''[[Robot Commando]]''), and the books did not acknowledge that this was a different 'Steve Jackson'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sj.sjgames.com/sjbio.html Steve Jackson – Biography and Public Warning] from Steve Jackson's personal website&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1990 Secret Service incident and legal actions ==
{{Main|Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service}}
On March 1, 1990, the [[United States Secret Service]] raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games based on suspicion of illegal hacker activity by game designer [[Loyd Blankenship]], and seized (among other materials and media) his manuscript for ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]''; when Jackson went to Secret Service headquarters the next day to retrieve his book drafts, he was told that ''GURPS Cyberpunk'' was a "handbook for computer crime", despite his protestations that it was just a game. SJG filed a successful lawsuit against the government, which went to trial in 1993 as ''[[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v.

The '''Temples of Humankind''' are a collection of subterranean temples buried {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip}} underground built by the [[Federation of Damanhur]].  They are decorated in several motifs stressing peaceful human collaboration.  The Temples are located in the foothills of the Alps in northern Italy, {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} from [[Turin]], in the valley of [[Valchiusella]].

The temples were created under the direction of [[Oberto Airaudi]] who, having claimed visions of ancient temples at age 10 from a [[reincarnation|previous life]], began excavation and building in August 1978.  By 1991 most of the chambers were reportedly complete when Italian police, acting on a tip from villagers, conducted a raid on the Temples.  However, since the temples were so well hidden, police were unable to locate them until state prosecutor Bruno Tinti threatened "show us these temples or we will dynamite the entire hillside."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eighth wonder of the world?

==Structure==
Parts of the Temples:
*Hall of Water – dedicated to the feminine principle, it is in the shape of a chalice and invites receptivity
*Blue Hall – for meditation on social matters and is used as a place of inspiration and reflection
*Hall of Earth – dedicated to the masculine principle, to the earth as an element and planet and to past and future reincarnations
*Hall of Metals – represents the different ages and developmental stages of humankind and the shadow elements of the human psyche
*Labyrinth Hall – showing Interfaith worship through the centuries, uniting different cultures and peoples
*Hall of Spheres – positioned where 3 synchronic lines merge, inviting planetary contact and transmission of messages, ideas and dreams to create harmony between nations
*Hall of Mirrors – dedicated to the sky, air and light, solar energy, strength and life. There are 4 altars to earth, water, air and fire

'''''The Einstein Intersection''''' is a 1967 [[science fiction]] novel by [[Samuel R. Delany]]. It won the [[Nebula Award]] for [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] in 1967&lt;ref name="WWE-1967"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1967 | title = 1967 Award Winners &amp; Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="WWE-1968"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1968 | title = 1968 Award Winners &amp; Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delany's intended title for the book was ''A Fabulous, Formless Darkness''.

The novel is purportedly influenced by [[Marcel Camus]]' 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]''.  The protagonist, Lo Lobey, is loosely based on the character of Orpheus, and the character of Kid Death is likewise based on Death in that film.

==Reception==
[[Algis Budrys]], after noting that Delany "has about as little discipline as any writer who has tried his hand" at science fiction and that ''The Einstein Intersection'' was a book "whose structure and purpose on its own terms are not realized", declared that the author "simply operates on a plane which [[Robert Heinlein]] never dreamed of, nor [[John W. Campbell]], nor – take a deep breath – [[Theodore Sturgeon|Ted Sturgeon]], [[Ray Bradbury]], nor anyone else we could have put forward as being a poet" before 1960 and "urgently recommended" the novel".&lt;ref name="budrys196710"&gt;{{Cite magazine

Sprague de Camp Bibliography''.

==Plot summary==
Virgil Hathaway, a [[Penobscot]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] shopkeeper in Gahato, New York, receives an odd visitor, Charlie Catfish of the [[Seneca people|Senecas]]. The fast-talking Catfish, caretaker to eight ''Gahunga'', quickly pawns his charges off on Hathaway before leaving. "You can handle 'em even though you're [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquin]]," he says, "being as you're a descendant of [[Great Peacemaker|Dekanawida]]." Hathaway is confused, but soon enough the Gahunga, stone-throwing spirits resembling miniature [[Iroquois]] warriors, appear to introduce themselves. Gaga, their chief, asks if there's anything Hathaway wants them to do.

Annoyed at the trick Catfish sprung on him, Virgil initially tells them to disappear, but later admits he would like more customers to come in and buy his Indian curios. Soon townspeople out on the street, pelted with pebbles by unseen assailants, are being driven into the shop. They are understandably perturbed, and some suspect Hathaway of having something to do with the situation. After calming them, he angrily orders Gaga to stop, and tells him he doesn't want any more favors. The Gahunga, offended, proclaim they will find someone who better appreciates them, and disappear. Hathaway worries. He tries to call them back, but they fail to respond.

Later, on leaving the shop, Hathaway hears of a number of inexplicable occurrences, all the result of the Gahunga invisibly attempting to "help" people, but causing more harm than good. The shopkeeper is again suspected, this time because of his earlier success in halting the stone throwing. The next day he researches the Gahunga in the public library of nearby [[Utica, New York|Utica]], learning that Iroquois [[Shamanism|shamans]] know how to control them. He rings up the [[Tonawanda Reservation]] for advice.

On returning to Gahato that evening Hathaway learns the Gahunga have been at it again when sawmill owner Dan Pringle runs into his shop. He had been at a phony seance conducted by his son Harvey's girlfriend Barbara Scott, whom he dislikes, only to see it disrupted by apparent evil spirits, which then drove him down the street with well-placed pebbles. Recalling the rumors current about Hathaway, Pringle appeals to him for help. Virgil realizes the Gahunga must have been trying to "help" the young lovers against the disapproving parent.

This time he knows what to do. With an offering of tobacco and a chant in bad Seneca, he summons the Gahunga and threatens them with retribution from Eitsinoha, the Iroquois earth goddess for their misbehavior. The Gahunga are cowed and promise not to do anything more unless he tells them to. As a result of his aid Hathaway is able to wrangle a lower rent from Pringle, who is also his landlord. He begins to think the medicine man business may not be so bad after all—maybe it has commercial possibilities!

==Reception==
[[E. F. Bleiler|Everett F. Bleiler]], reviewing ''[[The Reluctant Shaman and Other Fantastic Tales]]'', found the title story's background of Indian lore "particularly interesting," and praised the collection as a whole for its "well-handled humor."&lt;ref&gt;Bleiler, Everett F. ''The Guide to Supernatural Fiction'', Kent, Ohio, Kent State University Press, 1983, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other works==
"The Reluctant Shaman" is the second of a number of contemporary fantasy stories de Camp set in the fictional town of Gahato and the surrounding Adirondack region of New York, the others being "[[The Hardwood Pile]]" (''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'', Sep. 1940) and some of his [[The Purple Pterodactyls|Willy Newbury]] stories, notably "The Lamp" (''Fantasy and Science Fiction'', March 1975), "Algy" (''Fantastic'', Aug. 1976), "Darius" (''Escape!,'' fall 1977) and "The Huns" (''Fantasy and Science Fiction'', May 1978).

The tomb was discovered in 2003 in the east of Jingshang village in Daminggong township, [[Weiyang District, Xi'an]], and excavated between June and October in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://china.org.cn/english/features/Archaeology/131272.htm |title=Ancient Tombs of {{transl|zh|Laowai}} Found |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2005 |website=china.org.cn |access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially significant for the rich content of the reliefs on the stone structure contained in the tomb and a bilingual epitaph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24049308?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |title=Observations Concerning the Tomb of Master Shi |last=Dien |first=Albert E. |date=2003 |website=jstor.org |access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bilingual epitaph written in [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Sogdian language]] sheds light on the life of an 86-year-old man named Wirkak (493–579 AD) in Sogdian, but Shi Jun in Chinese, and his wife Wiyusi. The name {{transl|zh|Shi Jun}} is composed of the surname {{transl|zh|Shi}} with the honourific {{transl|zh|jun}} or "master". The couple came from the {{ill|Kesh (city state)|lt=State of Shi|zh|史國}} and the [[Kangju|State of Kang]] ([[Samarkand]] origin) respectively.&lt;ref name="Tomb-of-Master-Shi"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://edspace.american.edu/silkroadjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/984/2017/09/The-Tomb-of-the-Sogdian-Master-Shi.pdf |title=The Tomb of the Sogdian Master Shi: Insights into the Life of a Sabao |last=Dien |first=Albert E. |date=2009 |website=edspace.american.edu |access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his lifetime, Wirkak served as a {{transl|zh|sabao}} in the ancient province of [[Liang Province|Liangzhou]], or today's city of [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], a once-booming hub of international trade on the [[Silk Road]]. {{transl|zh|Sabao}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|薩保}}) is a Chinese translation of the Sogdian term {{transl|sog|s′rtp′w}}, meaning a "[[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] leader", but later became the title of an administrator in charge of the international and foreign religious affairs of Central Asian immigrants who settled in China at the time.

According to the epitaph, Wirkak had lived in the [[Western Regions]] but had moved to [[Chang'an]]. His grandfather, {{transl|sog|Rštßntk|italic=no}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|阿史盤陁}}, {{transl|zh|Ashipantuo|italic=no}}), had been a sabao in his native land. His father, named {{transl|sog|Wn’wk|italic=no}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|阿奴伽}}, {{transl|zh|Anujia|italic=no}}), but no offce is listed for him. Wirkak was appointed as chief of the judicial department of the sabao bureau in the Datong reign (535–546) during the [[Liang dynasty]], then in the 5th year of the same reign (539), he was made sabao of Liangzhou. He died in 579 at the age of 86; his wife Wiyusi died a month later. The tomb was built by their three sons, and the interment took place one year later in 580.

== Tomb ==
The total length of the tomb was 47.26 metres, with long slope path and yard faces south with an azimuth of 186º. It consists of ramp, yard, tunnel, a corridor and a chamber. The number of the yards and the tunnels are both five. The corridor measures 2.8 m long, 1.5 m wide and 1.9 m high with an arch ceiling. The chamber has a rectangular plan, it is 3.7 m long from the east to the west and 3.5 m from the north to the south.

There are two sealed gates of bricks and stones between the ramp and the chamber. The lintel and side posts of the stone gate are carved with interlocking grape and acanthus patterns, celestial musicians and [[lokapala]]s. Mural paintings can be seen in the ramping passage way and the chamber, however, the subjects are undistinguishable owing to the poor condition. A sarcophagus was found in the mid-north of the chamber.

[[File:Stone Sarcophagus in the Sa-pao Wirkak’s Tomb 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Line drawing copy of the front (South) side of Wirkak's sarcophagus.]]
The [[sarcophagus]] measures 2.46 m in length, 1.55 m in width and 1.58 m in height, shaped like a timber-framed Chinese house or temple with a [[East Asian hip-and-gable roof|hip-and-gable roof]], made of originally painted and gilded stone slabs, and is formed of a base, middle wall slabs and a top. It is densely decorated with [[bas-relief]]s to convey blind architectural details and a complex figural programme.&lt;ref name="Religion-of-Wirkak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academia.edu/30480398/_The_Religion_of_Wirkak_and_Wiyusi_The_Zoroastrian_Iconographic_Program_on_a_Sogdian_Sarcophagus_from_Sixth-Century_Xi_an._Bulletin_of_the_Asia_Institute_26_2012_2016_1-32_coauthored_with_Jason_BeDuhn |title=The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi: The Zoroastrian Iconographic Program on a Sogdian Sarcophagus from Sixth-Century Xi'an |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |date=2012–2016 |website=academia.edu |access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four sides are carved with four-armed guardian deities, along with other [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] divinities and scenes of sacrifice, rising to heaven, banqueting, hunting and procession. Their subjects and style demonstrate features of the [[Western Regions]] ([[Central Asia]]). The French historian [[Étienne de la Vaissière]] argues that the iconography of these bas-reliefs representing a [[religious syncretism]] by blending [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] symbols in the funerary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academia.edu/20031662/_Wirkak_Manichaean_Zoroastrian_Khurram%C3%AE_On_bilingualism_and_syncretism_in_Sogdian_funerary_art_Papers_in_Honour_of_Professor_Yutaka_YOSHIDA_and_Professor_Masaharu_ARAKAWA_on_Their_60th_Birthday_Studies_on_the_Inner_Asian_Languages_30_2015_p._95-112 |title=Wirkak: Manichaean, Zoroastrian, Khurramî? |last=La Vaissière |first=Étienne de |author-link=Étienne de la Vaissière |date=2015 |website=academia.edu |access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the sarcophagus has adopted a unique style to create a miniature model of a traditional Chinese temple, the [[sinicisation]] of Wirkak's tomb is of the lowest degree among the other two Sogdian tombs: those of {{ill|Tomb of Kang Ye|lt=Kang Ye|zh|康業墓}} and {{ill|Tomb of An Jia|lt=An Jia|zh|安伽墓}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Wu |editor-first=Tʻien-tʻai |date=2015 |title=族群與社會 |trans-title=Ethnicity and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsYgpuud5gMC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=%E5%BA%B7%E6%A5%AD%E5%A2%93+%E6%BC%A2%E5%8C%96&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x6FACl0aD-&amp;sig=243EbRyh7rP4XmmNZVN8EFhd8Yw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIr-KbxbHcAhXOIlAKHQQyBGMQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E5%BA%B7%E6%A5%AD%E5%A2%93%20%E6%BC%A2%E5%8C%96&amp;f=false |location=Taipei |publisher=Wu-Nan Book |language=zh-TW |page=290 |isbn=9789571141756 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The front (South) side of the sarcophagus is organised in strict formal symmetry around a large two-winged door. The Sogdian and Chinese inscriptions of the tomb occupants' career are manifested above the door. Flanking the door is a pair of inner panels with a guardian deity in each, and an additional pair of outer panels that feature three sections. From top to bottom, each outer panel contains a group of musicians, a stylised window ﬂanked by a pair of foreigners, and a half-human half-bird priest standing before the [[Atar|holy fire]] in a portable brazier. The six biographical panels (Panels "a–f", {{Numero|2–7|plural=on}}) start on the middle panel of the left side and conclude on the last-but-one panel of the back. They are preceded and followed by two single religious panels ({{Numero|1 and 8|plural=on}}), which continue with three additional religious panels ({{Numero|9–11|plural=on}}) on the right (East) side.&lt;ref name="Religion-of-Wirkak" /&gt; The description of the six biographical panels as stated by [[Albert E. Dien]]:&lt;ref name="Tomb-of-Master-Shi" /&gt;
* '''Panel "a" ({{Numero|2}})''': the young Wirkak and his father came by horse to call on a couple wearing crowns that indicate they are regal.
* '''Panel "b" ({{Numero|3}})''': the ruler hunts as a caravan moves at the bottom of the panel.
* '''Panel "c" ({{Numero|4}})''': the caravan now rests by a river as the Sogdians, presumably still Wirkak and his father, visit yet another ruler sitting in his yurt. 
* '''Panel "d" ({{Numero|5}})''': the regal couple have a grand reception, with music and dance.
* '''Panel "e" ({{Numero|6}})''': the grown Wirkak rides with his wife, both shielded by umbrellas.
* '''Panel "f" ({{Numero|7}})''': in this panel depicts a party, with five men at the top, sitting on a carpet, and exchanging toasts. Musicians and servants with large dishes of food surround them. Below, five women also sit on a rug and drink.

The description of the five religious panels as stated by [[Zsuzsanna Gulácsi]]:&lt;ref name="Religion-of-Wirkak" /&gt;
* '''Panel {{Numero|1}}''' ''Divine Being Giving a Sermon'': it constitutes a scene that organises nine figures in a clear visual hierarchy: one main figure appears as a sermonising deity, interacting with two laypeople flanked by two groups of three seated figures. Prominently placed in front of the deity at the lower left is a lay couple (referencing Wirkak and Wiyusi), sitting on their heels while assuming gestures of homage and prayer with their hands clasped.
* '''Panel {{Numero|8}}''' ''Sage in a Cave'' and ''Angelic Rescue'': the motif of a sage in a cave occupies the upper third of the carving, the scene is set in a forested mountainous landscape framed by ﬂowering trees. The body of the sage is seated casually with legs crossed and gesturing with right hand to a small four-legged animal that looks like a monkey. Below shows some winged [[apsara]]s or angelic beings flying above the water, with a man and a woman (possibly symbolising Wirkak and Wiyusi).
* '''Panel {{Numero|9}}''' ''Admittance to Paradise'': on the upper half of this panel shows a couple (symbolising the souls of Wirkak and Wiyusi after death) greeted by [[Weshparkar]]—the Sogdian god of the Atmosphere—as travellers who have just arrived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/vol9/srjournal_v9.pdf |title=The Silk Road: Zoroastrian Funerary Beliefs and Practices Known from the Sino-Sogdian Tombs in China |last=Lerner |first=Judith A. |date=2011 |website=silkroadfoundation.org |page=22 |access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; seated on their heels holding a footed plate and a drinking cup, respectively. The lower half depicts the [[Chinvat Bridge]].
* '''Panel {{Numero|10}}''' ''A Winged Figure, a Falling Figure, and a Pair of Winged Horses'': in the upper right, a winged ﬁgure, carrying a small object in the left hand, is shown flying ahead of a pair of winged horses. Directly below, is a unique falling figure, dressed in a long robe with hair piled up into a topknot, pointedly portrayed facing away from the viewer. The lower half portrays the extended scene of Chinvat Bridge of the previous panel.
* '''Panel {{Numero|11}}''': the final panel shows a number of winged figures ﬂying in a direction opposite to that of the Panel {{Numero|10}}, that is, towards the left. The riders—a man and a woman—representing the souls of Wirkak and Wiyusi. The context of their ride, surrounded by heavenly musicians, references their entrance into {{lang|pal-Latn|Garōdmān}}, the "House of Song" Paradise of Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name="Religion-of-Wirkak" /&gt;

A '''vision quest''' is a [[rite of passage]] in some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|cultures]]. It is usually only undertaken by young males entering adulthood.&lt;ref name=yellow&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/yellowwolfhisown002070mbp |title=Yellow Wolf: His Own Story |last=McWhorter|first=Lucullus Virgil |authorlink= |year=1940|publisher=Caxton Printers, Ltd |location=Caldwell, ID|isbn= |pages=295–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individual Indigenous cultures have their own names for their rites of passage. "Vision quest" is an English [[umbrella term]], and may not always be accurate or used by the cultures in question. 
 
Among Native American cultures who have this type of rite, it usually consists of a series of ceremonies led by Elders and supported by the young man's community.&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt; The process includes a complete [[fasting|fast]] for four days and nights, alone at a sacred site in nature which is chosen by the Elders for this purpose.&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt; Some communities have used the same sites for many generations. During this time, the young person prays and cries out to the spirits that they may have a vision, one that will help them find their purpose in life, their role in a community, and how they may best serve the People.&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt; Dreams or visions may involve natural symbolism - such as animals or forces of nature - that require interpretation by Elders.&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt; After their passage into adulthood, and guided by this experience, the young person may then become an apprentice or student of an adult who has mastered this role.&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt;
 
When talking to [[Yellow Wolf (Nez Perce)|Yellow Wolf]], [[Lucullus Virgil McWhorter]] came to believe that the person fasts, and stays awake and concentrates on their quest until their mind becomes "comatose."&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt; It was then that their [[Weyekin]] ([[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]] word) revealed itself.&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt;

Non-Native, [[New Age]] and "wilderness training" schools offer what they call "vision quests" to the non-Native public.&lt;ref name=King&gt;[[Thomas King (novelist)|King, Thomas]], "[http://hazlitt.net/feature/dead-indians-too-heavy-lift Dead Indians: Too Heavy to Lift]" in ''Hazlitt'', November 30, 2012. Accessed April 3, 2016. "A quick trip to the Internet will turn up an outfit offering a one-week “Canyon Quest and Spiritual Warrior Training” course for $850 and an eight-night program called “Vision Quest,” in the tradition of someone called Stalking Wolf, “a Lipan Apache elder” who has “removed all the differences” of the vision quest, “leaving only the simple, pure format that works for everyone.” There is no fee for this workshop, though a $300-$350 donation is recommended. Stalking Wolf, by the way, was supposedly born in 1873, wandered the Americas in search of spiritual truths, and finally passed all his knowledge on to Tom Brown, Jr., a seven-year-old White boy whom he met in New Jersey. Evidently, [[Tom Brown, Jr.]], or his protégés, run the workshops, having turned Stalking Wolf's teachings into a Dead Indian franchise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reed&gt;Sheets, Brian, "[http://law.lclark.edu/live/files/14090-lcb172art8sheetspdf Papers or Plastic: The Difficulty in Protecting Native Spiritual Identity]", ''[[Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review]]'', 17:2, p.596.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;G.

Canberra. pp. 268–269: "The [western] intellectual property rights system and the (mis)appropriation of Indigenous knowledge without the prior knowledge and consent of Indigenous peoples evoke feelings of anger, or being cheated"&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes includes New Age versions of a [[sweat lodge]], which has at times led to untrained people causing [[Sweat lodge#Risks|harm and even death]], such as in the [[James Arthur Ray]] manslaughter incident, which involved a 36-hour, [[Plastic shaman|non-Native idea]] of a vision quest, for which the participants paid almost $10,000.&lt;ref name="O'Neill"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/18/justice/arizona-sweat-lodge-sentencing/index.html Arizona sweat lodge sentencing], CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

Like a number of other Indigenous ceremonies, the vision quest has been mentioned in statements by Indigenous leaders concerned about the protection of ceremonies and other [[Indigenous intellectual property]] rights; one of these documents is the 1993 Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality.&lt;ref name=" LDNwar1"&gt;Mesteth, Wilmer, et al.

"WHEREAS   pseudo-religious corporations have been formed to charge people money for admission into phony "sweat lodges" and "vision quest" programs;"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"&gt;Taliman, Valerie (1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/warlakot.htm Article On The 'Lakota Declaration of War']."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (UNDRIP), which has given further support to Indigenous people's rights to protect their cultures and ceremonies, and address restitution when intellectual, religious and spiritual property is taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.&lt;ref name=UNDRIP-11&gt;"Indigenous peoples have the right to practice and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1817">'''Wisdom Tradition''' is a synonym for [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], the idea that there is a perennial or [[mysticism|mystic]] inner core to all [[Religion|religious]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[tradition]]s, without the trappings, doctrinal literalism, [[sectarianism]], and power structures that are associated with institutionalized religion. The Wisdom Tradition provides a conceptual framework for the development of the inner self, living a spiritual life, and the realization of enlightenment or of union with [[God]].

[[Ken Wilber]] frequently uses the term in the plural in his own books, shadowing the theologian [[Huston Smith]] who popularized the usage. In this context it can be considered synonymous with [[esotericism]], but does not have the faintly Western/Middle Eastern/theosophical nuances that are sometimes associated with the latter term.

In [[Christianity]] and in the [[Old Testament]], the term is used to describe female images of the divine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.renewedpriesthood.org/page.cfm?Web_ID=765 Goddesses and the Divine Feminine: A Western Religious History By Rosemary Radford Ruether]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Book of Wisdom]]. It is one of the seven [[Sapiential Books|Sapiential]] or wisdom books of the [[Septuagint]] [[Old Testament]], which includes [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Song of Solomon]] (Song of Songs), and [[Wisdom of Sirach|Sirach]].

{{Feminism sidebar|theory}}
'''Womanist theology''' is a religious conceptual framework which reconsiders and revises the traditions, practices, scriptures, and biblical interpretation  with a special lens to empower and liberate [[African-American]] women in [[United States|America]]. Womanist theology associates with and departs from [[Feminist theology]] and [[Black theology]] specifically because it integrates the perspectives and experiences of African American and other women of color. The former's lack of attention to the everyday realities of women of color and the latter's lack of understanding of the full dimension of liberation from the unique oppressions of black women require bringing them together in Womanist Theology. The goals of womanist theology include interrogating the social construction of black womanhood in relation to the black community and to assume a liberatory perspective so African American women can live emboldened lives within the African American community and within the larger society. Some of its tasks are excavating the life stories of poor women of African descent in the church and to understanding the "languages" of black women.{{sfn|Mitchem|2002}}

==Etymology==
The term ''womanish'' was commonly used in Black daily language by mothers to describe adolescent daughters who act outrageous and grown-up, in contrast to ''girlish''. ''[[Womanism|Womanist]]'' was then developed in 1983 by black writer and activist [[Alice Walker]] in her collection of essays, ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose]]''. In this text, she makes the point that "A Womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender."{{sfn|Walker|1983|p=xii}} Hence, while ''womanist'' referred primarily to African American women, it was also for women in general. Walker's works would have significant impact on later womanist theologians.{{sfn|Willis|2016}}

==Development==
The roots of modern womanist theology grew out of the theology of [[James Hal Cone]], [[Katie G. Cannon]], [[Jacquelyn Grant]], and [[Delores Williams]]. Cone developed black theology which sought to make sense out of theology from black experience in America. In his book ''A Black Theology of Liberation,'' Cone argued that "God is black" in an effort to demonstrate that God identifies with oppressed black Americans. Then, Grant, a first-generation womanist theologian, argued that Cone did not attend to the fullness of black experience – specifically that of black women. She argued that the oppression of black women is different from that of black men. Grant pointed out that lower-class black women must navigate between the threefold oppression of racism, sexism, and classism in her books ''Womanist Theology'' and ''White Women's Christ and Black Women's Jesus: Feminist Christology and Womanist Response.'' For her, Jesus is a "divine co-sufferer" who suffered in his time like black women today. Grant concludes that black women are more oppressed and in need of further liberation than black men and especially white women. Delores Williams took the work of theologians such as Cone and Grant and expanded upon them. She suggested that womanist theologians need to "search for the voices, actions, opinions, experience, and faith" of black women in order to experience the God who "makes a way out of no way." She defines womanist in the following way:{{quote|Womanist theology is a prophetic voice concerned about the well-being of the entire African-American community, male and female, adults and children. Womanist theology attempts to help black women see, affirm, and have confidence in the importance of their experience and faith for determining the character of the Christian religion in the African-American community. Womanist theology challenges all oppressive forces impeding black women's struggle for survival and for the development of a positive, productive quality of life conducive to women's and the family's freedom and well-being. Womanist theology opposes all oppression based on race, sex, class, sexual preference, physical ability, and caste.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=67}}}}

==Approaches to the Bible==
Womanist theologians use a variety of methods to approach the scripture. Some attempt to find black women within the biblical narrative so as to reclaim the role and identity of black people in general, and black women specifically, within the Bible. Examples include the social ethicist Cheryl Sanders and the womanist theologian Karen Baker-Fletcher. Some approach the Bible "objectively" to critically evaluate text that degrades women and people of color and to offer an African-centered form, to resist male domination and bias, or what could be termed anti-women or androcentric attitudes and forms. Others draw on resources outside the Bible to enhance the plurality and cohesion of the texts along with our life experiences and reject scripture as a whole or part which is seen to serve male interest only. These methods are not separated and can be endorsed together.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Patricia-Anne Johnson writes that "[[Renita J. Weems]], a womanist professor and scholar of the Hebrew Bible, examines scripture as a world filled with women of color. Through the use of womanist imagination, Weems helps students to understand female roles, personalities, and woman-to-woman relationships during the time when the biblical texts were written."{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=203}} Johnson, quoting further from Weems, also shows how Hagar and Esther can be seen as models of resistance for black women: "Womanism may be envisioned as a post-colonial discourse that allows African-American women to embrace a Jesus and a God free of the imperialism of white supremacy."{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=205}}

'''Yantra tattooing''' ({{lang-th|สักยันต์}} {{rtgs|''sak yan''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=สักยันต์|url=http://www.thai-language.com/id/218477|website=thai-language.com|accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;; {{lang-km|សាក់យ័ន្ត}} ''sak yoan''; {{lang-my|တက်တူးထိုး}}) is a form of tattooing originally introduced by [[Khmer people]] of the [[Khmer Empire]] which influenced much of its culture in the region during its reign. It consists of sacred geometrical, animal and deity designs accompanied by Pali phrases that offer power, protection, fortune, charisma and other benefits for the bearer. These days, it remains popular in [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], and also in [[Laos]] and [[Myanmar]] (Burma). ''Sak'' means [[tattoo]] in Thai and Khmer, while ''yan'' and ''yoan'' are the Thai and Khmer pronunciation for the Sanskrit word [[yantra]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sak-yant.com/archive/108yant/&lt;/ref&gt; a type of mystical diagram used in Dharmic religions.&lt;ref&gt;

Sak yan designs are normally tattooed by ''[[ruesi]]'' (the Thai form of [[rishi]]), ''wicha'' (magic) practitioners, and Buddhist monks, traditionally with a metal rod sharpened to a point (called a ''khem sak'').&lt;ref name=thaiguidetothailand&gt;http://www.thaiguidetothailand.com/magic-and-superstition/sak-yant-magic-tattoo/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Tattoos believed to offer protection and other benefits have been recorded everywhere throughout both [[mainland Southeast Asia]] and as far south as [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Krutak&gt;{{cite book|title=Spiritual Skin: Magical Tattoos and Scarification |author=Lars Krutak |publisher=Reuss |isbn=9783943105117}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the centuries the tradition spread to what is now [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], and parts of [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name="Cummings, Joe 2011"&gt;Cummings, Joe, (2011) ''Sacred Tattoos of Thailand: Exploring the Magic, Masters and Mystery of Sak Yan'', Marshall Cavendish.&lt;/ref&gt; While the tradition itself originates with indigenous tribal animism, it became closely tied to the Hindu-Buddhist concept of [[yantra]] or mystical geometric patterns used during meditation. Tattoos of yantra designs were believed to hold magic power, and were used much like the [[kolam]] tattoos of India. For these people, religion is closely tied to the notion of magic, health, and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Drouyer, Isabel Azevedo; Drouyer, Rene, (2013) ''Thai Magic Tattoos, The Art and Influence of Sak Yant'', Riverbooks editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The script used for yantra designs varies according to culture and geography. In Cambodia and central Thailand, Cambodian [[Khmer script]] is used, while in northern Thailand one sees yantra tattoos bearing [[Shan language|Shan]], northern Thai, or [[Tai Lü language|Tai Lu]] scripts, and in Laos the [[Lao Tham]] script is employed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacredtattoosofthailand.com&lt;/ref&gt; The script spells out abbreviated syllables from [[Pali]] incantations. Different masters have added to these designs over the centuries through visions received in their meditations. Some yantra designs have been adapted from pre-Buddhist [[shamanism]] and the belief in [[animism|animal spirits]] that was found in [[Southeast Asia]] and incorporated into Thai tradition and culture.

[[File:Sak Yant Tattoo performed in thailand.jpg|thumbnail]]

==Meaning==
Yantra tattoos are believed to be magic and bestow mystical powers, protection, or good luck.&lt;ref name=thaiguidetothailand /&gt; There are three main effects of a yantra tattoo. One is that which benefits the wearer, such as making them more eloquent. Another is that of protection and to ward off evil and hardship. This is commonly used by military personnel, police, taxi drivers, gangsters and others in perceived dangerous professions. Another type is that which affects people around the wearer, such as invoking fear. The tattoo only confers its powers so long as the bearer observes certain rules and taboos, such as abstaining from a certain type of food.&lt;ref name=Krutak/&gt;

It is believed that the power of sacred tattoos decreases with time. So to re-empower them each year, sak yan masters celebrate with their devotees  the [[Wai Khru]] ritual. Wai khru means "pay homage to one's guru". In Thailand, the most impressive Wai Khru is held at the temple of Wat Bang Phra.&lt;ref&gt;Drouyer Isabel; Drouyer, Rene. ''Thai Magic Tattoos The Art and Influence of Sak Yant''. River Books, 2013, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sak yan designs are also applied to many other media, such as cloth or metal, and placed in one's house, place of worship, or vehicle as a means of protection{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} from danger or illness, to increase wealth, and to attract lovers. In recent years Hollywood celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, whose tattoos were inked by Ajahn Noo Ganpai in Thailand, have made them popular among women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacredtattoosofthailand.com&lt;/ref&gt;

However a modern movement in Thailand seeks to progress away from their animistic past. As part of this movement, many modern-day Thais view yantra tattoos as nothing more than good-luck symbols that are stylish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thai.tattoo|title=Tattoo Chiang Mai - Your destination in northern Thailand|website=thai.tattoo|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Types and designs==
There are many traditional types and designs of yantra tattoos, but some of the most well-known and popular include:

* ''Ong Phra'' ({{lang-th|องค์พระ}}; translation: ''Buddha's body'') - one of the most commonly used elements in Yantra tattooing, but can also be a more complex standalone design. Meant to provide insight, guidance, illumination, etc.
* ''Ha-thaeo'' ({{lang-th|ห้าแถว}}; translation: ''five rows'') - Typically tattooed on the back left shoulder. Each of the five lines relates to a different blessing for success and good luck.
* ''Kao-yot'' ({{lang-th|เก้ายอด}}; translation: ''nine spires'') - typically tattooed on the center top of the back in various sizes and levels of complexity. Simple version pictured at the top of this article.
* ''Si-yot'' ({{lang-th|สี่ยอด}}; translation: ''four spires'') - to influence the feelings or actions of others and protect the bearer.
* ''Paet-thit'' ({{lang-th|แปดทิศ}}; translation: ''eight points'') - represents protection in the eight directions of the universe. Round shape; typically tattooed on the center of the back. Pictured in gallery below.
* ''Sip-thit'' ({{lang-th|สิบทิศ}}; translation: ''ten points'') - a version of ''paet-thit'', but protects in ten directions instead of eight.
* ''Maha-niyom'' ({{lang-th|มหานิยม}}; translation: ''great preference'') - to grant the bearer favor in the eyes of others. Round shape; typically placed on the back right shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sak-yant.com/?page_id=2150&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Yot Mongkut'' ({{lang-th|ยอดมงกุฎ}}; translation: ''spired crown'') - for good fortune and protection in battle. Round shape; typically tattooed on the top of the head.
* ''Panchamukhi'' ({{lang-th|ปัญจมุขี}}; translation: ''five Deva faces'') - intended to ward off illness and danger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sak-yant.com/?page_id=2153&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Suea'' ({{lang-th|เสือ}}; translation: ''tiger'') - typically depicts twin tigers. Represents power and authority.

==Locations==
Many internet sites recommend Thailand as the place to attain the most refined ritual tattoos and consider the country as the most popular for learning this art. Every year, hundreds of foreigners in search of original and magical tattoos come to Thailand to have their tattoos done.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tattoos-tattoos.com/book-preview.html&lt;/ref&gt; In Southeast Asia, Thailand is by far the country with the highest number of devotees.

* One of the most famous temples in the present day for yantra tattooing is [[Wat Bang Phra]] in [[Nakhon Chai Si District]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province]], Thailand. Ajaan Noo Kanpai, perhaps the most famous practitioner of sak yan in Thailand, trained here.
* One well-known temple in northern Thailand is Wat Nhong Khem (''khem'' means needle).&lt;ref&gt;http://northernthailand.com/a/en/chiangmai-cultural/tattoos/214-sak-yat-at-wat-kheam.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is in San Patong just outside [[Chiang Mai]] and was home to the late sak yan master Phra Ajaan Gamtawn, who died in Chiang Mai on 14 September 2010. This temple no longer applies tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thaiguidetothailand.com/magic-and-superstition/phra-ajarn-gamtorn-sak-yant-chiang-mai-r-i-p/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
While tattoos in the west are largely a matter of aesthetics, in Thailand they are imbued with both spirituality and superstition. The designs, lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, are deeply interwoven with Buddhist and [[animist]] imagery that some [[Thai people|Thais]] fear [[Westerners]] fail to appreciate.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Tattoos of religious deities are problematic, especially if they are below the waist. In Southeast Asian culture, the head is the most sacred part of the body. The further down the body, the less sacred, and foreigners with religious figures inked on their legs have caused upset. On the main highway into [[Bangkok]] from  [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]], 15-metre-wide billboards declare "It's wrong to use Buddha as a decoration or tattoo". Some groups want a complete ban on any tattoos of religious figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thibaut|first1=Marion|title=The sacred side of Sak Yant|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/life/The-sacred-side-of-Sak-Yant-30260203.html|accessdate=18 May 2015|work=The Nation|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ár nDraíocht Féin: A Druid Fellowship, Inc.''' (otherwise known simply as '''ADF''') is a non-profit religious organization dedicated to the study and further development of modern [[Neodruidism]].

In Modern Irish, Ár nDraíocht Féin ({{IPA-ga|ˈaːrn riːəxt feːn}}) means "our own magic (Druidism)". "ADF" is also used to represent the phrase A Druid Fellowship. The organization was founded in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usny&amp;c=trads&amp;id=3209 |first=Isaac |last=Bonewits |year=2001 |title=The Origins of Ár nDraíocht Féin |work=Witchvox.com |accessdate=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated in 1990 as a U.S. 501(c)3 non-profit organization by [[Isaac Bonewits]]. The organization's first public announcement and membership sign-up took place at the first WinterStar Symposium in 1984 at [[Burr Oak State Park]] in [[Glouster, OH]]. ADF was originally organized as an Association, with Articles of Association signed by all Trustees on April 18, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Isaac |last=Bonewits |year=2010 |url=http://www.adf.org/articles/identity/beginadf.html |title=The Beginning of Ar nDraiocht Fein |work=ADF.org |accessdate=July 9, 2010}} Original Articles of Association of ADF at [http://www.adf.org/articles/identity/articles-of-association-large.jpg] (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

ADF is a [[Neo-Druidism|neodruidic]] organization practicing a unique tradition of [[Neopagan]] [[Druidry]] and is mostly U.S.-based, with members and groups in most states and in several other countries as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jade |year=1991 |title=To Know: A Guide to Women's Magic and Spirituality |location=Oak Park, IL |publisher=Delphi Press |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years 2000 through 2010 to the present, ADF's membership has remained well over 1000 persons, making it the largest public form of definitively ''Neopagan'' Druidism in the USA.

Despite the Gaelic name, ADF Druidry actually encompasses all [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European religions]], which means that while most of the organization is focused on [[Celt]]ic practices, there are also [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]], [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]], [[Roman mythology|Roman]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] religious practices in ADF.  In that sense, ADF uses the term [[Druid]] as "a member of the Indo-European intelligentsia, especially of the clergy" or even more broadly as "a worshipper of Indo-European gods and goddesses".  Strictly speaking, members of ADF are not only "druids", but are also members of related Indo-European religions which may have other terms for people in such clergy roles (e.g., [[gothi]] for clergy of ancient Norse religions).

==History==
[[Isaac Bonewits]] founded ADF with the goal of "researching and expanding sound modern scholarship about the ancient Celts and other Indo-European peoples, in order to reconstruct what the Old Religions of Europe really were." Bonewits wanted to focus on scholarship as a reaction to more revisionist types of [[Neopaganism]], such as those claiming direct descent from a "Great Matriarchy" of pre-historic times (see James Frazer's [[The Golden Bough]]). The works of [[Georges Dumézil]] on Indo-European social structures and mythologies were especially influential in Bonewits's thinking.

Related to the focus on scholarship, Isaac started the ADF Study Program with the goal of producing credible, knowledgeable Neopagan [[clergy]]; actual druid priests and priestesses, who would be able to fulfill all the roles of modern clergy for other Neopagans, such as birth, marriage, and [[funeral|funerary]] rites. Similarly, ADF's official motto of "Why not excellence?" is an expression of the desire to create a ''bona fide'' religious tradition, rather than a small group that few would take seriously and which would not be around in a few years. ADF's unofficial motto, "As fast as a speeding oak," is meant to remind members that excellence takes time.

ADF was a reaction to many of the cultish pseudo-religions (Neopagan or not) with which Bonewits was familiar and (in a few cases) had experienced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neopagan.net/ABCDEF.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, one of the first "[[dogma]]s" he promulgated was the "Doctrine of Archdruidic Fallibility", which states that everyone, even the Archdruid, can make mistakes. However, ADF was also a reaction to the [[Reformed Druids of North America]], a freethinking religious group which Bonewits considered too loose and not Neopagan enough.

==Beliefs==
ADF promotes a [[neo-druidism]] in which worshipers perform rituals honoring three kinds of entities: gods and goddesses, ancestors (honored dead), and nature spirits. Examples of gods and goddesses worshipped include [[Lugh]], [[Cernunnos]], the [[Morrigan]], [[Thor]], [[Freya]], [[Apollo]], [[Athena]], [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], and many other ancient, pre-Christian, Indo-European deities. Although various pantheons or "hearth cultures" are allowed, "mixing and matching" unrelated deities within a single rite is discouraged. Ancestors usually refers to the direct blood ancestors of the worshiper, but can include other honored dead (friends, mythological heroes, etc.), too. Nature spirits includes general animal ([[totem]]) spirits as well as whatever spirits are present in the place of worship, such as a local river spirit. Most ADF rituals occur outdoors.

In ADF terms, the triad of deities, ancestors, and nature spirits is called the "Three Kindreds". There are other triads in ADF practice, such as the "three realms" of the Underworld (associated with the ancestors), the Heavens (associated with the gods), and this world (associated with the nature spirits); these are similar to the three worlds of the [[Celts]], and to the Norse realms of [[Niflheim]], [[Asgard]], and [[Midgard]]. There are also three parts to this world; the Land, the Sea (including [[Seawater|saltwater]] and [[freshwater]] bodies), and the Sky.

All of these triads are based on the common and pervasive theme of "threes" attributed to ancient Indo-European (and particularly Celtic) cultures. Similarly, ADF uses the common Indo-European themes of a sacred tree (e.g. the Norse [[Yggdrasil]]), a "gatekeeper" or opener of ways (e.g. the Norse god [[Heimdall]], the Celtic god [[Manannan mac Lir]], or the Hellenic god  [[Hermes]]), and a treaty with hostile entities (e.g. the Norse [[Jötunn|Jotuns]] or the Celtic [[Fomorians]]). In these ways, ADF practice is an attempt to reconstruct earlier Indo-European beliefs and practices by using the records we have of ancient Indo-European cultures, and looking for commonalities among them which can then be applied to current spiritual practice.

ADF practice straddles the difficult middle ground between pure [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructionism]] (attempting to recreate ancient practices as exactly as possible) and a less exclusive form of [[Neopaganism]] (an umbrella term for the loose agglomeration of pagan-based religions which arose in the early to middle 20th century, the most popular of which is [[Wicca]]). Thus, it attempts to be as authentic as possible given the realities of modern life. For example, ADF forbids any form of [[blood sacrifice]] in its official rituals, because even if it were appropriate in relation to one's ancestors (who may have lived in [[agrarian societies]] that regularly killed their own food), it is not considered appropriate in modern society.

==Organization==
Local ADF congregations are known as "groves" (like groves of trees), and while group rituals are often regarded as more powerful than rituals performed individually, ADF also has many solitary members; some by choice, and some because there are no groves within easy traveling distance. There are also ADF "protogroves", which are usually one or two people who would like to start a bigger grove. By forming a protogrove, they are able to appear on the list of ADF groves in the organization's online and printed literature, and so attract potential new members.

One of ADF's cornerstone principles is the notion that it is a ''public'' form of [[Neopaganism]]. Again, this was partly a reaction to the secretive religious groups Isaac was familiar with, such as closed [[coven]]s which were limited in size to 13 members, or Masonic-style societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neopagan.net/MesoDruids.html |first=Isaac |last=Bonewits |year=2005 |title=A Very Brief History of Mesopagan Druidism  |work=Neopagan.net |accessdate=March 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to promoting cult-ish behavior, such secretism in a larger sense was seen as unnecessarily promulgating the "underground" ([[occult]], hidden) nature of Neopaganism. By making ADF a public tradition, its founder hoped to both prevent ADF from ever becoming a cult, and to further Neopaganism's acceptance in broader society as a credible and sane family of religions.

As a result of these principles and intents, ADF groves are required to have open-to-the-public rituals on or near the eight "High Days" of the common Neopagan calendar such as [[Bealtaine]], [[Lughnasadh]], and [[Samhain]] (the holidays of the [[Wheel of the Year]]). Such rituals follow an established "core order of ritual" and are expected to focus on one particular pantheon or "hearth culture" for that high day. ADF groves are also required to perform some kind of public service on a quarterly basis (cleaning up parks and other ecological activities are popular).

An annual meeting of ADF is held at an event selected by the membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adf.org/about/org/bylaws.html#Article3 |title=ADF Bylaws: Article 3 |work=ADF.org |accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far it has been at either the [[Starwood Festival]] or the [[Wellspring Gathering]], presently held at Tredara in [[Madison, OH]] on Memorial Day Weekend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stonecreed.org/wellspring.php |title=Wellspring Gathering |accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stonecreed.org/node/185 |title=Wellspring Gathering 2017 |accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Brushwood Folklore Center in the past. This meeting originated as part of the [[Starwood Festival]] in 1987 at Bear Creek [[Kampgrounds of America|KOA]] in [[East Sparta, OH]], and was held at Starwood through 1992. Wellspring, run by Stone Creed Grove, became a separate event in 1991, and the National Members Meeting was moved to Wellspring in 1993. ADF still maintains a presence at the Starwood Festival, holding meetings and offering classes and rituals, and sometimes has more members attending there than at the Wellspring Gathering.

Anyone may join ADF, as membership is open to the public.
