      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="876">'''Akpan Okon''' was the last ''Obong'' (king) of [[Obong Okon Ita]] around 1690-1720. He was overthrown by his brother [[Kakpokpo Okon]] with the support of groups such as the [[Eze Agwu]], [[Nnachi Ipia]], and the [[Nnubi dynasty]] in the final phases of the [[Aro-Ibibio Wars]]. Akpan Okon's defeat was very significant and crucial to the alliance. The alliance between the Eze Agwu lineage and his ambitious brother Kakpokpo sealed his fate, defeated Obong Okon Ita, and laid the foundation of the [[Arochukwu]] kingdom.

'''Alice Robitaille''' (February 3, 1923 – May 28, 2011), from [[Quebec City]], "petite Alys" (little Alys), was a French Canadian singer mainly remembered for her later French interpretations of Latin American songs, who performed under the [[stage name]] '''Alys Robi'''.

==Youth==
Born in 1923 in the [[Quebec City]] neighbourhood of Saint-Sauveur, Robitaille displayed talent for singing and acting at a very young age. She first performed on-stage at the [[Capitol Theatre (Quebec)|Capitol Theatre]] at 7. At the time, she had already sung on-air with the [[CHRC (AM)|CHRC]] radio station and was a real phenomenon in the whole city.&lt;ref name="Montreal"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alice Robitaille: la grande Alys |publisher=City of Montreal |url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=2497,3090102&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |accessdate=14 April 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Radio. Tourbillon de la Gaieté. Alys Robi BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P23025.jpg|thumb|left|Robi performing for [[CKAC]] in 1943]]
At 13 she moved to the Théâtre National, on [[Montreal]]'s [[Saint Catherine Street]].&lt;ref name="Montreal"/&gt; Under the direction of [[Rose Ouellette]], she learned acting and singing during a 75-week engagement. She continued her career in the Montreal [[cabaret]]s, making radio appearances. For a time during the war, she also hosted a French radio show named ''Tambour battant'' ("Rumbling drum"). Touring Canadian military bases propelled her career across Canada.&lt;ref name="Montreal"/&gt;

During the 1940s, she started producing [[Gramophone record|78]]s and she became renowned far beyond [[Canada]]. She captured popular imagination with [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] titles like ''Besame Mucho'' and [[Tico-Tico no Fubá|''Tico tico'']], after translating herself the Spanish or Brazilian songs into French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mort d'Alys Robi : Le destin hollywoodien de la première star mondiale du Québec |publisher=Pure People |url=http://www.purepeople.com/article/mort-d-alys-robi-le-destin-hollywoodien-de-la-premiere-star-mondiale-du-quebec_a80801/1 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sang in chic [[New York City]] cabarets by the mid forties and in 1947, she travelled to [[England]] where she made an appearance on the first regular [[BBC]] television programme.

==Mental health==
In 1948, while traveling by car to [[Hollywood]], she was injured in an accident, and entered a period of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robi, Alys |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alys-robi-emc/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of unfortunate diagnoses, and a failed romance, she suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and was interned for several years in a Quebec City asylum.&lt;ref name="Montreal"/&gt; She was at some point subjected to a [[lobotomy]] against her will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bittersweet memories |last=Hayter |first=Sparkle |publisher=''SEE'' magazine |url=http://www.seemagazine.com/Issues/2005/0721/screen2.htm |accessdate=14 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430180245/http://www.seemagazine.com/Issues/2005/0721/screen2.htm |archivedate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She credited the operation with her recovery:

''"Je me réveillai guérie et j'ai compris plus tard que j'avais été un des rares cas réussis de lobotomie"'' (I woke up better and later understood that I was one of the rare lobotomy success stories).&lt;ref&gt;''Long Cri dans la nuit: Cinq Années à l'Asile'', cited in [http://lamiredegisele.com/lecture/alysrobi/indexalys.html Alys Robi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121070730/http://www.lamiredegisele.com/lecture/alysrobi/indexalys.html |date=2008-11-21 }}, lamiredegisele.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, she was released. The same year, she came back on stage at the Casa Loma and the Montmartre, but her efforts were impeded by [[taboo]]s about mental problems and she never regained the same level of popularity.

==Later years==
In the early 1990s, Alys returned into the public eye after the massive success she had with a song written for her by Alain Morisod ("Laissez-moi encore chanter"). Books, [[Thesis|theses]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[television series]] were written about her. A movie was released in December 2004: ''Alys Robi: Ma vie en cinémascope'' ("Alys Robi: My Life in Cinemascope"), titled ''Bittersweet Memories'' in English.

Robitaille has published two [[autobiography|autobiographies]]: ''Ma carrière, ma vie'' ("My Career, My Life", 1980) and ''Un long cri dans la nuit: Cinq Années à l'Asile'' ("A Long Cry in the Night: Five Years in the Asylum", 1990). The last autobiography title comes from the song ''Un long cri dans la nuit'', written and composed for Lady Alys by the songwriter [[Christine Charbonneau]] in 1989.

Several of Robi's songs have been used for commercial ads. Sico, notably, played on the similarity between its [[brand name]] and the title of "Tico Tico" to produce a very catchy campaign based on a spoof of the song.

Robitaille died in the [[Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont]], Montreal, at the age of 88, on May 28, 2011.

Aligned with the [[Tea Party movement]], he succeeded fellow Republican [[Bob Deuell]], whom he unseated by three hundred votes in the Republican  [[runoff election]] held on May 27, 2014.

==Early life and education==

Hall graduated in 1960 with honors from [[George D. Chamberlain High School]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. He is an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. In 1964, Hall received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[electrical engineering]] from [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina]]. At The Citadel, he was cited in ''Who's Who in American Colleges and Universities''.&lt;ref name=abouthall&gt;{{cite web |url=http://votebobhall.com/About-Bob.html |title=More About Bob Hall |publisher=votebobhall.com |accessdate=November 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109042151/http://votebobhall.com/About-Bob.html |archivedate=November 9, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall was a [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in the [[United States Air Force]]. From 1984 to 2013, he operated a business, Professional Proposal Management, Inc., which assisted companies in obtaining government contracts.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Political career==
Hall's run against incumbent State Senator [[Bob Deuell]] was his second run for public office. Hall had previously filed and campaigned for the same seat in 2012, but was subsequently disqualified due to failure to meet constitutional residency requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myrockwallnews.com/bob-hall/ |title=State Senate candidate Bob Hall disqualified by GOP from running against Deuell – The Rockwall News &amp;#124; The Rockwall News |publisher=Myrockwallnews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall received endorsements from various conservative individuals and organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senatorbobhall.com/endorsements/ |title=Endorsements &amp;#124; Senator Bob Hall &amp;#124; Constitutional Conservative |publisher=Senator Bob Hall |date= |accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; including former Texas Republican State Chairman [[Cathie Adams]], who praised Hall's commitment.&lt;ref name="bobhallnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://senatorbobhall.com/endorsements/|title=SenatorBobHall.com/Endorsements }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall unseated Deuell in a runoff election, 18,230 votes (50.4 percent) to 17,930 (49.6 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may27_173_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=2631&amp;id=422|title=2014 Republican Party Primary Runoff: Election Night Returns|publisher=[[Texas Secretary of State]]|accessdate=May 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052346/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may27_173_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=2631&amp;id=422|archivedate=May 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leszcynski, Ray.

Deuell had led a three-candidate field in the [[primary election|primary]] on March 4, with 23,847 votes (48.5 percent). Because he fell short of a [[majority]], he was placed in the runoff with the number-two candidate, Bob Hall, who in the primary polled 19,085 votes (38.8 percent). The remaining 6,240 votes (12.7 percent) went to a third candidate, Mark Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=8866&amp;id=965 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140305183835/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=8866&amp;id=965 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 5, 2014 |title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014 (Senate District 10) |publisher=team1.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=March 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With his [[nomination]] in hand, Hall defeated [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] nominee, Don Bates, in the November 4 [[general election]].

Hall defeated her in the March 6, 2018, primary election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Leszcynski | first1=Ray | title=Sen.

===Property tax===
Hall has voted on several pieces of property tax reform legislation. SB 1 would require cities and counties to hold an election if they plan to increase their property tax revenues by 6%, regardless of whether they are increasing the actual tax rate or just taking advantage of rising property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/08/02/house-considering-bevy-property-tax-legislation/ |title=House property tax ideas range from minor tweaks to ending school taxes |publisher=The Texas Tribune |date= |accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall also voted for the 2015 budget bill, which put billions of dollars into property tax relief funds to buy down local property taxes for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journals.house.state.tx.us/hjrnl/84r/pdf/84RDAY83FINAL.PDF#page=344 |title=Senate Journal listing|website=www.journals.senate.state.tx.us|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruce MacFarlane Hood''' is a Canadian-born British experimental [[psychology|psychologist]] who specialises in [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]]. He is currently based at the [[University of Bristol]] and his major research interests include the cognitive processes behind adult magical thinking.

==Biography==
Hood's father was a journalist and of Scottish descent while his mother was an Australian.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2996545.Bruce_M_Hood|title=Bruce M. Hood|publisher=Goodreads}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]], at aged 8, and lived in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada during his childhood.&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt; He completed undergraduate studies in psychology, then received a Master of Arts and a [[Master of Philosophy]] from the [[University of Dundee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = S. | last2 = Hood | first2 = B. | authorlink2 = Bruce Hood (psychologist)| doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1987.tb02260.x | title = The stress of the transition to university: A longitudinal study of psychological disturbance, absent-mindedness and vulnerability to homesickness | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 425 | year = 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a PhD from [[University of Cambridge]] in 1991, studying the visual development of infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://search.lib.cam.ac.uk/?itemid=%7Cmanuscrpdb%7C9627|title = Development of visual selective attention in the human infant|accessdate = 13 September 2014|website = LibrarySearch|publisher = University of Cambridge|last = Hood|first = Bruce MacFarlane}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to the US he took a place as a visiting professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and faculty professor at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hood | first1 = B.

== Work ==

=== Cognitive development in childhood ===
In his research, Hood investigates various aspects of cognitive development in children. He is most known for looking at the origins of superstitious beliefs in children. Most notably, his research showed that children inherently prefer 'their' individual objects over duplicated ones,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Children prefer certain individuals over perfect duplicates|last = Hood|first = BM|date = January 2008|journal = Cognition|doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2007.01.012|pmid = 17335793|volume=106|pages=455–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; a behaviour which persists into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Picasso Paintings, Moon Rocks, and Hand-Written Beatles Lyrics: Adults' Evaluations of Authentic Objects|last = Frazier|first = BN|date = January 2009|journal = Journal of Cognition and Culture|doi = 10.1163/156853709X414601|pmid = 20631919|volume=9|pages=1–14|pmc=2903069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, he investigates how children use the gaze to infer about the mental states of humans they are interacting with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Children's use of the temporal dimension of gaze for inferring preference|last = Einav|first = S|date = January 2006|journal = Developmental Psychology|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.42.1.142|pmid = 16420124|volume=42|pages=142–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tell-tale eyes: children's attribution of gaze aversion as a lying cue|last = Einav|first = S|date = November 2008|journal = Developmental Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0013299|pmid = 18999328|volume=44|pages=1655–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hood also studies how children form theories, for example about gravity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-7687.00013/abstract|title = Gravity does rule for falling events|last = Hood|first = Bruce M.|date = 4 January 2002|journal = Developmental Science|accessdate = 13 September 2014|doi = 10.1111/1467-7687.00013|volume=1|pages=59–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spatial representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Children's search behaviour in large-scale space: developmental components of exploration.|last = Smith|first = AD|year = 2005|journal = Perception|doi = 10.1068/p5270|pmid = 16309116|volume=34|pages=1221–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public engagement ===
Hood has been engaging in science outreach since the beginning of his career. In 2006, he appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[Material World (radio programme)|Material World]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2006/5073.html|title = Bruce Hood discusses superstition on Radio 4|date = 22 September 2006|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = Bristol University News|publisher = Bristol University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also presented his research at the [[British Science Association]] Science Festival later in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2006/5039.html|title = Born with a superstitious brain|date = 7 September 2006|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = Bristol University News|publisher = Bristol University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hood argues that humans evolved to "detect patterns in the world" and defines the supersense as the "inclination to infer that there are hidden forces that create the patterns that we think we detect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/bruce_m._hood_supersense_why_we_believe_in_the_unbelievable/|title=Bruce M. Hood – Supersense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable|author=[[D. J. Grothe]]|publisher= [[Point of Inquiry]]|date=17 April 2009|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He reappeared at the same event three years later in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2009/6520.html|title = British Science Festival talk explores supersense|date = 8 September 2009|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = Bristol University News|publisher = Bristol University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published his popular science book ''SuperSense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable'' in the same year. The book tackles how the human brain generates superstitious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/are-we-born-believers-or-cultural-receivers-a-discussion-with-author-and-psychologist-bruce-hood/|title = Are We Born Believers or Cultural Receivers? A Discussion with Author and Psychologist Bruce Hood|date = 22 May 2009|accessdate = 6 September 2014|website = Neuronarrative|publisher = WordPress.com|last = DiSalvo|first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hood appeared on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Infinite Monkey Cage]]'' show to talk about the science of superstition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2011/7713.html|title = Bruce Hood on BBC Radio 4's The Infinite Monkey Cage|date = 4 July 2011|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = Bristol University News|publisher = Bristol University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/timc/all|title = Mon 04 July 11: Science and the supernatural|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = The Infinite Monkey Cage|publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also participated in the live performance event ''Uncaged Monkeys'' in Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2010/7616.html|title = Uncaged Monkeys at the Colston Hall|date = 12 May 2011|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = Bristol University News|publisher = Bristol University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, he held the prestigious [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]] titled 'Meet Your Brain'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richannel.org/christmas-lectures/2011/meet-your-brain |title=Christmas Lectures 2011 – Meet your Brain : Ri Channel |work=Ri Channel |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2011/8127.html|title = Bristol psychologist gives 2011 Royal Institution's Christmas Lectures|date = 20 December 2011|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = Bristol University News|publisher = Bristol University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized in three parts, they explored the structure of the brain, how the brain controls behaviours and thoughts and how brains allow humans to function in a social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2011/dec/26/science-weekly-podcast-christmas-lectures|title = Science Weekly podcast: Bruce Hood has Christmas lectures on the brain|date = 26 December 2011|accessdate = 13 September 2013|website = Science Weekly|last = Jha|first = Alok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Hood published his second popular science book ''The Self Illusion: Why there is no 'you' inside your head'' (published under the alternative title ''The Self Illusion: How the social brain creates identity'' in America). In this book, he argues that the human sense of self is a construct of the brain which facilitates experiencing and interacting with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/2012/05/the-self-illusion-an-interview-with-bruce-hood/|title = The Self Illusion: An Interview With Bruce Hood|date = 25 May 2012|accessdate = 13 September 2014|work = Wired|last = Lehrer|first = Jonah|authorlink = Jonah Lehrer}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Who we are," Hood writes, "is a story of our self − a constructed narrative that our brain creates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hood|first1=Bruce|title=The Self Illusion|date=2012|publisher=Constable|location=London|isbn=978-1-78033-007-5|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce uses a "a distinction that William James drew between the self as "I" and "me." Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the "I" and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the "me" which again is a coherent account of who we think we are based on past experiences, current events and aspirations for the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/2012/05/the-self-illusion-an-interview-with-bruce-hood/|title = The Self Illusion: An Interview With Bruce Hood|date = 25 May 2012|accessdate = 3 February 2016|work = Wired|last = Lehrer|first = Jonah|authorlink = Jonah Lehrer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Hood devised the world's largest simultaneous memory experiment for the [[Society of Biology]] involving 2000 participants to demonstrate the phenomenon of false memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2012/8872.html|title = Bristol professor designs game for Guinness World Record attempt|date = 19 October 2011|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = Bristol University News|publisher = Bristol University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was officially recognised by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.societyofbiology.org/news/news-archive/14-news/477-society-of-biology-sets-new-world-record|title = Society of Biology sets new World Record|date = 11 June 2013|accessdate = 6 September 2014|website = Society of Biology|publisher = The Society of Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hood's third popular science book, ''The Domesticated Brain'', was published in 2014 and explores the neuro-cognitive origins and consequences of social behaviour in humans. The book's thesis is that "over the most recent evolution, the last 20,000 years", humans have been "selecting each other for prosocial behaviour and that has changed our brains and the way we've become more codependent".&lt;ref name=skepticuleinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticule.co.uk/2015/05/skepticule-094-20150425.html|title=''Skepticule 094: Question.Explore.Discover – QEDcon 2015, Manchester, UK – Special Episode 1 of 2 (inc. interview with Bruce Hood)''|author1=Paul Thompson|author2=Paul S.

=== Skepticism ===
[[File:Prof Bruce Hood talking at QED 2011 3.jpg|thumb|Professor Bruce Hood at the QED conference in Manchester 2011]] 
Hood played a key part in exposing the [[ADE 651]] bogus bomb detector and similar devices in January 2010. He got involved in exposing the scam upon realising that the devices were produced locally in Somerset (UK) and challenged the creator of the devices, Jim McCormick, to demonstrate their validity. Even though McCormick initially agreed to this, the demonstration was then delayed and McCormick later required Hood to sign a non-disclosure statement concerning their meeting. Hood had also contacted the [[BBC]] about McCormick and his fraudulent products, which ultimately resulted in the production of a [[BBC Newsnight]] documentary about [[ADE 651]] and a related device, the [[GT200]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8471187.stm|title = Export ban for useless 'bomb detector'|date = 22 January 2010|accessdate = 6 September 2014|publisher = BBC Newsnight|last = Hawley|first = Caroline|last2 = Jones|first2 = Meirion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8520303.stm|title = Why did UK not ban so-called 'bomb detectors' earlier?|date = 17 February 2010|accessdate = 21 September 2014|publisher = BBC Newsnight|last = Jones|first = Meirion|last2 = Hawley|first2 = Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this documentary, Hood demonstrates that the perceived effect of the devices can be explained by the [[ideomotor phenomenon]], which had fooled naive users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/interview_with_bruce_m._hood/|title = Interview with Bruce M.

Contrary to prominent skeptics such as [[Richard Dawkins]], Hood is convinced that superstitious beliefs are inevitable and even beneficial to humans. For instance, he argues that [[essentialism]] is beneficial to social interactions, since it allows humans to overcome objectification and attribute uniqueness to other humans. However, Hood clearly differentiates between secular and religious beliefs, where secular supernatural beliefs are universally applicable across cultures and religious beliefs are culturally specific. He also argues that secular superstitious beliefs do predispose humans to religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.forgoodreason.org/bruce_hood_why_we_believe_in_the_unbelievable|title = Why we believe in the unbelievable|date = 28 March 2010|accessdate = 8 September 2014|website = For Good Reason|publisher = For Good Reason|last = Grothe|first = DJ|authorlink = DJ Grothe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speakezee===

In 2015 Hood founded Speakezee,&lt;ref name=speakezeeabout&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speakezee.org/about |title=About Speakezee |publisher=Speakezee |year=2015 |accessdate=16 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an academic speaking platform which can be used by institutions and organisations to find speakers for their events and [[vice versa]].

"I got the idea after being invited to give too many talks than I could possibly accept, so this system should make it easier to find others who are just as good".&lt;ref name="speakezeeblog" /&gt;

Speakers are able to create profiles detailing their subject expertise and speaking experience. Organisers are then able to find and short list speakers and contact them directly to discuss speaking at their event.&lt;ref name=speakezeeabout/&gt; It also allows academics to advertise their specialist talks to other academics who organise departmental seminars.&lt;ref name="bathuni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/marketing/public-engagement/get-involved/opportunities/speakezee.html |title=Register to 'Speakezee', a new online speakers bureau|publisher=[[University of Bath]]|date=8 April 2015 |accessdate=16 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"At its heart is the desire to help more academics engage with the public and to make it easier for organisers to find relevant experts to talk at their event, whatever the size."&lt;ref name=speakezeeabout/&gt;

A platform that is free to use, Speakezee is currently in its first phase and primarily focused in the UK. More functionality and new features are planned for the future, making it more useful for a wider audience and with a view to ultimately expanding the site's use internationally.&lt;ref name=speakezeeabout/&gt;&lt;ref name="speakezeeblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brucemhood.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/speakezee-org/ |title=Speakezee.Org|author=Bruce Hood |date=17 February 2015 |accessdate=16 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hood hopes "it will stimulate a café culture of intellectual exchange".&lt;ref name=skepticuleinterview/&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
He was awarded a [[Sloan Fellowship]] in neuroscience in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sloan.org/fellowships/past-fellows/?L=0252F&amp;tx_sloangrants_sloanfellows%5Bpage%5D=&amp;tx_sloangrants_sloanfellows%5BlastPage%5D=0&amp;tx_sloangrants_sloanfellows%5Bsortby%5D=5&amp;tx_sloangrants_sloanfellows%5Border%5D=1&amp;tx_sloangrants_sloanfellows%5Bsearch%5D=hood&amp;tx_sloangrants_sloanfellows%5Bcontroller%5D=Fellows&amp;cHash=9bb01910a06741610f6481c71b2eba97|title = Past fellows|accessdate = 6 September 2014|website = Alfred P.

He won the 2011/12 University of Bristol individual engagement award, specifically for his local science engagement activity with the group [[At-Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2012/8533.html|title = 2011/12 Engagement Award winners announced|date = 28 May 2012|accessdate = 7 September 2014|website = Bristol University News|publisher = Bristol University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Hood received the Public Engagement and Media Awards from [[The British Psychological Society]] for his commitment to public engagement through public lectures, media appearances, pub events and science festivals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bps.org.uk/news/professor-bruce-hood-receives-bps-award|title = Professor Bruce Hood receives BPS award|date = 30 January 2014|accessdate = 4 September 2014|website = The British Psychological Society|publisher = The British Psychological Society|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006113611/http://www.bps.org.uk/news/professor-bruce-hood-receives-bps-award|archivedate = 6 October 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2771">'''Carlo Zinelli''' (July 2, 1916 – January 27, 1974) was an [[outsider art]]ist who suffered from [[schizophrenia]].

He was born in the [[Italy|Italian]] countryside near [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] but left for the city in 1934. He volunteered for the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1939, but his schizophrenia quickly revealed itself, and he was placed on medical leave after only two months. He was committed to the [[psychiatric hospital]] in Verona in 1947 and spent ten years in almost total isolation.&lt;ref name="Wojcik"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wojcik |first=Daniel |title=Outsider Art: Visionary Worlds and Trauma |publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4968-0808-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo's life took a turn ten years later, when he and twenty other patients were admitted to the painting [[studio|atelier]] created by [[sculpture|sculptors]] Michael Noble and Pino Castagna and [[psychiatrist]] Mario Marini. In this atelier, patients were encouraged to paint or sculpt freely.

Completely engrossed by his work, Carlo drew for eight hours a day with tempera paints and colored pencils. This routine seems to have calmed him considerably; clinical evaluations from this time comment on his good behavior. By 1964, his work had been exhibited, and he had attracted the attention of art historians associated with [[Jean Dubuffet]] and the [[Compagnie de l'Art Brut]].&lt;ref name= "folkart"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gomez |first=Edward M. |url= https://hyperallergic.com/367669/in-carlo-zinelli-and-eugen-gabritschevskys-art-the-life-spirit-endures/ |title=In Carlo Zinelli and Eugen Gabritschevsky’s Art, the Life Spirit Endures |work=[[Hyperallergic]] |date=March 25, 2017 |accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the hospital moved to a new location in Marzana, Italy. Disoriented by the move, Carlo painted much more infrequently until his death in 1974.

His body of work comprises about nineteen hundred paintings and a few sculptures. The paintings are created on white sheets, and are two-sided from 1962 to 1968. These two-sided works can be seen as continuous, as a single narrative from one side to the other.

He used pure colors to create narratives that tell the story of his childhood in the country, frequently repeating figures to cover the entire background in "horror vacui" style. His human figures are always solid shapes drawn in profile, often with holes to represent eyes or other features.

In 1967, he began at the [[Michelin Guide|three star]] [[Tour d'Argent]] restaurant in [[Paris]] as an assistant cellar man.

He served as an expert wine taster at the [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Paris Wine Tasting of 1976]], and also participated in [[The Judgment of Paris 30th Anniversary]].

He is best known for making numerous predictions, which have passed, regarding the end times, including that a hidden planet named [[Nibiru cataclysm|Nibiru]] (sometimes known as Planet&amp;nbsp;X) would destroy the [[Earth]].

Meade predicted that planet Nibiru would collide with Earth on September 23, 2017, destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Karangu|first1=Jessie|title=The world is ending on September 23, according to a biblical prophecy|url=http://wjla.com/news/offbeat/the-world-is-ending-on-september-23-according-to-a-biblical-prophecy|website=[[WJLA-TV]]|publisher=[[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his prediction failed, he revised the apocalypse to October, where he stated that the seven-year [[Great Tribulation|tribulation]] would possibly start followed by a [[Millennialism|millennium]] of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Gajanan|first1=Mahita|title=David Meade Said the World Was Going to End Last Weekend.

Meade is best known for using [[Bible]] passages and Bible verses regarding his predictions. His September 23 prediction was based on secret codes in the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]] in [[Egypt]] and revolved around the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]]. He used the number [[33 (number)|33]] for his September 23 prediction, stating that “[[Jesus]] lived for 33 years” and that “[[Elohim#Canaanite religion|Elohim]] is mentioned 33 times in the Bible.” His October 2017 predictions were described on his website Planet X News and his book ''Will Planet&amp;nbsp;X Signal the Rapture?''. His April 23 prediction was based on 12:1-2 in the [[Book of Revelation]] and referred to the woman as [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] and stated the alignment represents "the Lion of the tribe of Judah".

== Early life ==
Meade was raised as a [[Catholic]]&lt;ref name=glum/&gt; and attended the [[University of Louisville]], where he claims to have studied astronomy and other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Staff|title=Kentucky man says 'end of days' is near|url=http://foxlexington.com/news/local/kentucky-man-says-end-of-days-is-near|website=[[WDKY-TV]]|publisher=Sinclair Broadcast Group|date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims to have earned a master's degree in statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Poulin|first1=Stepha|title=Facing the world's fake end|quote=master's degree in statistics|url=https://www.bgfalconmedia.com/forum/facing-the-world-s-fake-end/article_94b38e2a-a192-11e7-a91d-7f8a8c0b52c6.html|website=BG Falcon Media|date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his profile page on his website, he has worked for both the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] and private industry. He additionally stated that he has written investigative reports on abnormal state administration and executives for [[Fortune 1000]] organizations. It is not known which companies he worked for.&lt;ref name=lyons&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyons|first1=Joseph|title=What Does David Meade Do?

In a September 2017 ''[[The Washington Post]]'' article, Meade said that he studied astronomy and that he attended a university in [[Kentucky]] but declined to say which campus he attended due to safety concerns.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt; He additionally refused to answer questions concerning which Fortune 1000 organizations he worked for and what he does for a living.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt;  When he was asked where he lives, he claimed that he lives in "the heart of a major disaster" zone of [[Hurricane Irma]], but did not specify the state or city.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt;

Meade appeared on ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' with [[George Noory]] in January 2017 and was interviewed by the [[United States|American]] national television and radio program ''[[Glenn Beck Program]]'' in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noory|first1=George|last2=Meade|first2=David|title=David Meade on Coast to Coast AM|url=https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/meade-david/84190|website=[[Coast to Coast AM]]|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn Beck"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beck|first1=Glenn|last2=Meade|first2=David|title=9/21/17 – Planet X and the end of the age (w/ David Meade)|work=[[Glenn Beck]]|url=http://www.glennbeck.com/content/audio/92117-planet-x-and-the-end-of-the-age-w-david-meade/|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to books about Planet&amp;nbsp;X, he has written books related to politics, such as ''The Coming Clinton Economic Collapse'' (2016) and ''The Coup D'état Against President Donald J.

=== October 2017 predictions ===
As September 23 passed, however, Meade again revised the apocalypse to October, making new predictions for that month, such as Nibiru eclipsing the sun on October 5 and that several people would [[levitate]] into the sky (including current [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Mike Pence]]) followed by a nuclear attack by [[North Korea]], [[China]], and [[Russia]] on the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meade|first1=David|title=Will Planet X Signal the Rapture?|url=https://www.ebookit.com/tools/pd/Bo/eBookIt/booktitle-Will-Planet-X-Signal-the-Rapture|quote=Meade, David: I know the day but I'd rather not mention it at this point, but it is in October and in the very latter part) that Russia, China and North Korea would use a combination of drone submarines and unmarked container ships to engage in a nuclear attack on the US coast.|publisher=Self-published|website=ebookit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetXNews/&gt; He predicted other events for that month, such as a series of magnitude 9.8 earthquakes; that the Earth's pole would shift by 30 degrees; that the United States would be split in half; and that [[Barack Obama]] would be elected as U.S. President for an [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|illegal]] third term.&lt;ref name=PlanetXNews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meade|first1=David|title=October 2017 and the 'End of Days'|url=http://planetxnews.com/2017/08/30/october-2017-end-days/|quote=Meade, David: Over one billion people will disappear.

=== Predictions for 2018 ===
In an interview with [[YouTube]] pastor Paul Begley, Meade made several predictions for 2018, such as North Korea becoming a world-class superpower in March 2018 and predicting that Nibiru would destroy the Earth in spring.&lt;ref name="International Business Times"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jha |first=Nupur |title=Nibiru will hit Earth and cause doomsday in 2018, predicts David Meade|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/nibiru-will-hit-earth-cause-doomsday-2018-predicts-david-meade-760172|website=International Business Times|quote=Meade, David:”Here's what I believe is going to start in the Spring of 2018: I believe North Korea will ascend to become a world-class superpower in March of 2018.

== Reactions ==
Meade has faced criticism from fellow Christians: [[Ed Stetzer]], writing for ''[[Christianity Today]]'', stated that "there is no such thing as a 'Christian numerologist{{' "}},&lt;ref name=Stetzer/&gt; and described Meade as "a made-up expert in a made-up field talking about a made-up event."&lt;ref name=Stetzer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stetzer|first1=Ed|title=No, the World Won't End Next Week and There's No Such Thing as a Christian Numerologist|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2017/september/end-times-fake-news.html|periodical=[[Christianity Today]]|date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher M.

[[Albert Mohler]], the President of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] stated, upon Meade's previous prediction in September 2017, that "Christians are not called to be the setters of dates and the anticipation of the calendar."

Meade told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that his September 23, 2017 prediction was based on numerical codes in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Bucher"/&gt; He also based his predictions on what he says are coded messages in the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]] of [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Sudakov|first1=Dmitry|title=Date for planet Nibiru to crash into Earth encrypted in Pyramid of Giza|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/science/mysteries/18-08-2017/138453-planet_nibiru-0/|website=[[Pravda.ru]]|date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific focus of his prediction revolved around the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] (referring to [[Revelation 12 sign prophecy|Revelation 12]]), another event that was supposed to take place on September 23 when a certain configuration of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] would happen.&lt;ref name=graney/&gt; He stated the significant number for his September 23 prediction is the number [[33 (number)|33]], on the grounds that "Jesus lived for 33 years" and "Elohim, the Canaanite god who was later adopted as the supreme god of ancient Israel, is mentioned 33 times in the Bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Matthew |title=Conspiracy nuts claim an invisible rogue planet is going to bring about the Rapture|url=https://www.salon.com/2017/09/18/this-saturday-an-invisible-rogue-planet-will-bring-about-the-rapture-maybe/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|quote=Meade, David: understanding all of this is the number 33.

Meade's April 23 prediction was based on passage 12:1-2 in the [[Book of Revelation]], which states "And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed in the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and crying out in the pain and agony of giving birth".&lt;ref name=Nzherald/&gt; He referred to the woman as Virgo and stated that the alignment represents "the Lion of the tribe of Judah".&lt;ref name=Nzherald/&gt; When discussing the 7-year tribulation and [[rapture]], he stated “The Book of Revelation states that men will approach [[Armageddon]] on horseback.

'''Eliyahu Dobkin''' ({{lang-he|אליהו דובקין}}, 31 December 1898 – 26 October 1976) was a leading figure of the [[Labor Zionism]] movement, a signatory of the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] and a founder of the [[Israel Museum]]. He was also active in the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] and the [[World Zionist Organisation]].

==Biography==
Eliyahu Dobkin was born in [[Babruysk]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (today in [[Belarus]]) to a [[Religious Zionism|religious-Zionist]] family. His father, Yosef, worked in the lumber and banking industries, and was a member of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrahi]] movement. Dobkin was schooled in a [[heder]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and later studied in [[Kharkiv]] (today in [[Ukraine]]), where he founded the Zionist student movement ''HaHaver'' in 1914. In 1917 he joined the [[HeHalutz]] movement founded in the same year by [[Joseph Trumpeldor]].

After [[World War I]] the family fled the [[Bolsheviks]] and settled in [[Białystok]] in [[Poland]]. In 1921 he was elected general secretary of the world HeHalutz movement, which was headquartered in [[Warsaw]]. There he met [[Simcha Blass]], who would later marry Dobkin's sister Yehudit.

On 6 June 1932 Dobkin [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] with his wife and daughter and settled in [[Tel Aviv]]. That year he became a member of the [[Histadrut]] trade union. Between 1933 and 1968 he was a member of the Zionist Workers' Committee. In 1936 he joined the Jewish Agency, and headed its immigration department during [[World War II]] with the responsibility for rescuing [[Jews]] from Europe and [[Aliyah Bet|illegal Jewish immigration]] to Mandate Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/IsraelAt50/Pages/The%20Signatories%20of%20the%20Declaration%20of%20the%20Establis.aspx The Signatories of the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel] Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of its executive in 1946.

When Israel declared independence on 14 May 1948, Dobkin was one of the designated signatories. However, at the time he was trapped in [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|besieged]] [[Jerusalem]], and added his signature at a later point. In the same year he became head of [[Keren Hayesod]], a post he held until 1961. In 1951 he also took over as head of the Jewish Agency's youth and HeHalutz, serving until 1968.

An art collector, Dobkin was head of the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel museum]] and later founded the [[Israel Museum]], sitting on its board until his death.

'''Eric van der Woodsen''' (spelled '''Erik''' in the novels) is a fictional character from the book series ''[[Gossip Girl (novel series)|Gossip Girl]]'' and the [[Gossip Girl (TV series)|television series of the same name]], in which he is portrayed by [[Connor Paolo]].

==Novel series==
Erik is described as similar to every van der Woodsen: tall, thin, and blonde. The younger brother of [[Serena van der Woodsen]], Erik van der Woodsen is not featured in the books very often. A junior at [[Brown University]], Serena has said he has "at least six or seven different girlfriends he sleeps with routinely." On a trip to [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]], Erik and Serena’s best friend [[Blair Waldorf]] dated briefly.

Very close to his sister, Erik threw her a giant [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteenth birthday bash]] and drove her up to Hanover on her first day of school there. Aside from his brief appearances, Erik remained a relatively quiet secondary character throughout the series, however he did have a bigger part in the ''Gossip Girl'' prequel, ''[[Gossip Girl (novel series)#Gossip Girl|Gossip Girl: It Had to Be You]]''.

==TV series==
===Characterization===
In contrast to the novels, Eric's character is more complex in the show, showing a mature understanding of family and relationships but faces the same troubles as most teenagers have. [[Alessandra Stanley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' mentions his character's deviation from the novels from "an object of female lust" to one of "...psychotherapy." But notes his strong bond with Serena, stating how he "is misunderstood by all but his caring, if troubled, sister." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/arts/television/19goss.html | archiveurl = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/arts/television/19goss.html | archivedate = 19 September 2007 | title = Reading, Writing and Raunch: Mean Girls Rule Prep School | work = [[The New York Times]] | first = Alessandra | last = Stanley| authorlink = Alessandra Stanley | date = 11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his mature persona, Eric is no stranger to the problems that most teens face as his stay at the Ostroff Center, a rehabilitation facility, is a result of his constant loneliness and his mother's many unstable marriages. Connor Paolo notes that Eric's lack of a father figure contributed to his suicide attempt.&lt;ref name="Go Postal"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/02/connor_paolo_wants_eric_van_de.html | archiveurl = http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/02/connor_paolo_wants_eric_van_de.html | archivedate = 16 February 2010 | title = Connor Paolo Wants Eric Van Der Woodsen to Go Postal | work = The New York Times | first = Alexandra | last = Martell | date = 16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 1===
At the beginning of the season, Eric has been living at the Ostroff Center, a high-class mental facility. Serena frequently visits him after coming back. As well as trying to convince the doctors and her mother Lilly to let him out. They let Eric out temporarily, during the Ivy League Mixer, where he develops a friendship with [[Jenny Humphrey]]. After [[Blair Waldorf]] humiliates his sister, telling the whole school she was attending the Ostroff Center during her absence having mistakenly seeing photos of Serena entering the center, Eric tells Blair he was the one attending the mental center and shows her the scars on his wrists from his [[suicide]] attempt.

At Blair's annual sleepover, Blair dares Jenny to break into the Ostroff Center and take Eric out for the night. Jenny and Blair succeed and they take him to a bar downtown. Lily is made aware of his disappearance and begins to panic. She quickly informs [[Rufus Humphrey|Rufus]], whose son, [[Dan Humphrey|Dan]], is on a date with Serena, after she cannot get hold of her. They contact the couple to make sure Eric is alright and to bring him home. Later, Lily realizes that Eric is ready to come out of the medical center. He is present during Thanksgiving dinner at the Humphrey's apartment when Lily and Rufus reveal they had a previous relationship years ago. Due to his mother's engagement to billionaire [[Bart Bass]], he develops a close friendship with [[Chuck Bass]], whom he soon sees as a brother.

He tries to warn Jenny about her new boyfriend Asher Hornsby ([[Jesse Swenson]]) but she mistakes this for Eric being in love with her. In the same episode, Dan and [[Georgina Sparks]] see Asher making out with someone outside of school. The news becomes public on Gossip Girl, and Jenny denies the rumor by saying she lost her [[virginity]] to Asher, which Eric knows is untrue. During a dinner with his family, Georgina [[Coming out|outs]] him to get back at Serena. Eric's [[homosexuality]] upsets Lily, who blames herself for Eric getting institutionalized. Serena comforts him, and learns that Eric already came out to Chuck before her because he knew Chuck wouldn't judge him. He also explains that he had a relationship with someone while at the Ostroff Center, but now believed that it was over. At Asher and Jenny's party, Eric helps Blair dethrone Jenny by revealing that Asher was indeed [[gay]], and that they were involved. Asher denies this, but Blair sends a Gossip Girl blast with Eric and Asher's emails. He and Lilly later reconcile.

After the school year starts, although Serena complains about Lily's new marriage and their new house rules, Eric thinks they should give the marriage a chance. Later, Eric introduces Jonathan Whitney ([[Matt Doyle (actor)|Matt Doyle]]) as his new boyfriend. They break up after Bart tells Eric that Jonathan has been cheating on him. Eric lodges Jenny secretly in the Bass-van der Woodsen penthouse and goes with her to make the paperwork to divorce her parents.

Eric then discovers that Bart hired his private detective, Andrew Tyler, to do research about his, Lily's, and Serena's past. He discovers that Lily was also institutionalized at a French sanatorium and that she didn't tell him so that she could be strong for him. Bart's actions convince Lily to celebrate Thanksgiving with the Humphreys.

He joins forces with Blair, whom Jenny also offends publicly, in making Kira Abernathy, a Constance student whom Jenny regularly ignores, a threat to Jenny's reign as Queen. Blair gives Kira a makeover and Eric blackmails Graham into becoming Kira's escort instead of Jenny. Jenny soon endures public humiliation but manages to gain their respect by taking Nate as her escort for Cotillion. These events cause Jonathan to break up with Eric as he claims Eric has changed now that he's resorted to scheming with Blair. After Cotillion, Jenny leaves with the other Upper East Side Queen Bees and leaves unaware that Eric has been responsible for her public embarrassment.

At Thanksgiving, Jenny discovers that Eric was the one behind her public embarrassment at Cotillion which sets her getting her revenge on him.

'''Francis Asbury Tarkenton''' (born February 3, 1940) is a former [[National Football League]] (NFL) quarterback, television personality, and computer software executive. He played in the NFL for 18 seasons and spent the majority of his career with the [[Minnesota Vikings]].

Tarkenton's tenure with the Vikings spanned thirteen non-consecutive seasons, playing with the team for six seasons from 1961 to 1966, then for seven seasons from 1972 to 1978. In between his years in Minnesota, Tarkenton was a member of the [[New York Giants]] for five seasons. At the time of his retirement, Tarkenton owned every major quarterback record. He was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1986 and the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1987.

In addition to his football career, Tarkenton served as a commentator on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and a co-host of ''[[That's Incredible!]]''. He also founded Tarkenton Software, a computer-program generator company, and he toured the U.S. promoting CASE ([[computer-aided software engineering]]) with [[Albert F. Case Jr.]] of Nastec Corporation. Tarkenton Software later merged with [[KnowledgeWare]] (with Tarkenton as president), until selling the company to [[Sterling Software]] in 1994.

==Early life and education==
{{moresources|section|date=December 2017}}
Fran Tarkenton was born on February 3, 1940, in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. His father, Dallas Tarkenton, was a [[Methodist]] minister.&lt;ref name=losing/&gt; Tarkenton went to [[Clarke Central High School|Athens High School]] in [[Athens, Georgia]], and later attended the [[University of Georgia]], where he was the quarterback on the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Bulldog football team]] and a member of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity. 

Under Coach [[Wally Butts]] and with Tarkenton as quarterback, Georgia won  the 1959 [[List of Southeastern Conference champions#Football|Southeastern Conference championship]]. Tarkenton was a first-team All-SEC selection in both 1959 and 1960.

==Professional football career==
The [[Minnesota Vikings]] [[NFL draft|drafted]] Tarkenton in the third round of the [[1961 NFL Draft]], and he was picked in the fifth round of the [[1961 American Football League Draft|1961 AFL draft]] by the [[Boston Patriots]]. He signed with the Vikings. Tarkenton, 21, played his first [[National Football League]] game (and the Vikings' first game) on September 17 against the [[Chicago Bears]] coming off the bench to lead the Vikings to a come-from-behind victory by passing for 250 yards and four touchdown passes and running for another&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/photos/0ap1000000145639/0ap2000000154091|title=Countdown to the 2013 NFL Draft|work=[[National Football League]]|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Vikings defeated the Bears 37&amp;ndash;13. He was the only player in NFL history to pass for four touchdowns in his first NFL game, until the feat was repeated by [[Marcus Mariota]] in the [[Tennessee Titans]]' 2015 season opener versus the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.titansonline.com/news/article-4/A-Look-at-Marcus-Mariotas-Rookie-Accomplishments/107490e1-afe4-4337-a855-170574e45aaa A Look at Marcus Mariota's Rookie Accomplishments]" by Jim Wyatt, [[Tennessee Titans|Titans]] online, December 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Tarkenton Scrambling.PNG|thumb|160px|left|Tarkenton [[Quarterback scramble|scrambling]] (1974)]]
He played for the Vikings from [[1961 NFL season|1961]] to [[1966 NFL season|1966]]. His early years with the team were plagued by the trouble expected for a newly created team, with the Vikings winning a total of 10 games combined in their first three seasons, with Tarkenton winning eight of them. He threw 18 touchdowns and 17 interceptions for 1,997 yards in his first season. He rushed for 308 yards on 56 rushes for five touchdowns. The following year, he threw 22 touchdowns and 25 interceptions for 2,595 yards. He rushed for 361 yards on 41 rushes for two touchdowns.

Tarkenton was traded to the [[New York Giants]] in [[1967 NFL season|1967]], at which time he moved to the New York City suburb of [[New Rochelle, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Kriegel, Mark. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2LttIGhZtWIC&amp;pg=PA210 Namath:A Biography]''; Penguin Books;  2005; {{ISBN|978-0143035350}}; p.210&lt;/ref&gt; In the first game of the [[1969 NFL season|1969]] season, Tarkenton's Giants played the Vikings. After trailing 23–10 in the fourth quarter, Tarkenton threw two touchdown passes to secure a 24–23 comeback victory over his former team.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/196909210nyg.htm "Minnesota Vikings at New York Giants - September 21st, 1969"], Pro-Football-Reference.com&lt;/ref&gt; The 24 points allowed by Minnesota's defense were a season-worst for the unit, one more point than the Vikings allowed in losing [[Super Bowl IV]] to the [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/1969.htm "1969 Minnesota Vikings"], Pro-Football-Reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarkenton enjoyed his best season with the Giants in [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. The club overcame an 0-3 start to win nine of 10 and move into position to win the [[NFC East]] division championship in week 14. However, New York was routed 31-3 by the [[1970 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] at Yankee Stadium, leaving the Giants 9-5, one game behind the division champion [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and the wild card [[1970 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. 1970 was the closest the Giants came to making the playoffs during a 17-year drought, spanning the [[1964 NFL season|1964]] through [[1980 NFL season|1980]] seasons.

Tarkenton was traded back to Minnesota in [[1972 NFL season|1972]], for three players ([[Norm Snead]], [[Bob Grim (American football)|Bob Grim]] and [[Vince Clements]]), plus a first and second round draft choice.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.si.com/vault/1972/02/07/565932/scramble-back-to-the-deep-purple Scramble Back To The Deep Purple]", ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', February 7, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; He led the Vikings to three [[National Football Conference]] championships, but in each instance the Vikings lost the ensuing [[Super Bowl]]. In Tarkenton's first Super Bowl appearance his team lost to the [[Miami Dolphins]] 24&amp;ndash;7 in [[Houston]]. It lost the second to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 16–6 in [[New Orleans]], and in the last Super Bowl Tarkenton played (and Minnesota's last Super Bowl to date), the Vikings lost to the [[Oakland Raiders]] 32–14 at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]].

In his 18 NFL seasons, Tarkenton completed 3,686 of 6,467 passes for 47,003 yards and 342 touchdowns, with 266 interceptions, all of which were NFL records at the time of his retirement. Tarkenton's 47,003 career passing yards rank him 8th all time, while his 342 career passing touchdowns is 6th all time in NFL history.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/football/nfl/10/11/manning.tds.ap/index.html |title=Manning Passes Tarkenton with 343rd Career TD |work=Sports Illustrated |date=2009-10-11 |accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also is 6th on the [[most wins by a starting quarterback (NFL)|all-time list of wins by a starting quarterback]] with 124 regular season victories. He also used his impressive [[Quarterback scramble|scrambling]] ability to rack up 3,674 rushing yards and 32 touchdowns on 675 carries. During his career, Tarkenton ran for a touchdown in 15 different seasons, an NFL record among quarterbacks. He ranks fifth in career rushing yards among quarterbacks, behind [[Randall Cunningham]], [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]], [[Michael Vick]] and [[Cam Newton]].  He is also one of two NFL quarterbacks ever to rush for at least 300 yards in seven different seasons; the other is [[Tobin Rote]]. When he retired, Tarkenton held NFL career records in pass attempts, completions, yardage, and touchdowns; rushing yards by a quarterback; and wins by a starting quarterback.

The Vikings finished the 1975 season with an NFC-best 12–2 record and Tarkenton won the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]] and the [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award]] while capturing [[All-Pro]] honors in the process.

Tarkenton co-wrote with [[Brock Yates]] a book in 1971 titled ''Broken Patterns: The Education of a Quarterback'', a chronicle of the 1970 [[New York Giants]] season.&lt;ref&gt;Tarkenton, Fran &amp; Brock W. Yates. ''Broken Patterns: The Education of a Quarterback''; Simon and Schuster, 1971, {{ISBN|978-0671210533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Tarkenton, with author Herb Resincow, wrote a novel titled ''Murder at the Super Bowl'', the [[whodunit]] story of a football coach killed just before his team is to participate in the championship game.&lt;ref&gt;Tarkenton, Fran &amp; Herb Resincow.

==Business ventures and investments==
[[Mark McCormack]] helped Tarkenton invest, making him wealthy enough to "retire this week if [he] wanted to", as [[New York (magazine)|''New York'']]  magazine wrote in 1971.&lt;ref name=ax&gt;Axthelm, Pete. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=A-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The Third Annual Permanent Retirement of Joe Namath]", ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, July 7, 1971,  pp.47-49&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkenton was a pioneer in computer software, and founder of Tarkenton Software, a program generator company. He toured the United States promoting CASE or "[[computer-aided software engineering]]" with [[Albert F. Case, Jr.]] of Nastec Corporation, but ultimately merged his software firm with [[James Martin (author)|James Martin]]'s [[KnowledgeWare]], of which Tarkenton was president until selling the company to [[Sterling Software]] in 1994.

In 1999, Tarkenton was fined by federal regulators as part of a securities fraud sweep. According to the ''[[LA Times]]'', "In Tarkenton's case, the Hall of Fame quarterback and 10 other former executives of his computer software and consulting firm, KnowledgeWare Inc., were accused of inflating by millions of dollars the company's earnings in reports for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1994. The former Minnesota Vikings quarterback agreed to pay a $100,000 fine and $54,187 in restitution. He did not admit any wrongdoing".&lt;ref&gt;''[[LA Times]]'', September 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Tarkenton has been promoting various products and services including [[Tony Robbins]] and [[BarNone|1-800-BAR-NONE]]. He also founded GoSmallBiz, a small-business consulting website. He also operates an [[annuity]] marketing firm called Tarkenton Financial.

The name '''Harry Maitey''' was given by Germans to a [[Native Hawaiians|native Hawaiian]] (April 23, 1807&lt;ref&gt;According to his baptismal certificate of April 1830, which is a "given" birthday.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore 1977"&gt;Moore, Anneliese. ''[http://hdl.handle.net/10524/519 Harry Maitey: From Polynesia to Prussia]''. Hawaiian Journal of History 11 (1977): 125–161&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=150}} – February 26, 1872), who was the first Hawaiian in [[Prussia]], Germany. He married Dorothea Charlotte Becker from [[Stolpe (Berlin)|Stolpe]] on August 28, 1833. Their son Heinrich Wilhelm Otto (born December 2, 1837) and his younger sister Friederike Wilhelmine (born in 1846) died as infants, while their second son Heinrich Wilhelm Eduard (born December 8, 1839, died 1906)&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=155}} survived his parents. His daughter Martha (born 1869), Maitey's only grandchild attaining adulthood, remained unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Anneliese. ''Harry Maitey: From Polynesia to Prussia''. Hawaiian Journal of History 11 (1977): 125–161, p. 151; footnote 117, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

There is little known about Maitey's life in [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawai‘i]]. The information about his Hawaiian name ''Kaparena'' seems to have no confirmation from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Anneliese. ''Harry Maitey: From Polynesia to Prussia''. Hawaiian Journal of History 11 (1977): 125–161, p. 127; footnote 12, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; When the Prussian frigate ''Mentor'' arrived in [[Honolulu]] on November 28, 1823, the French whaler ''L'Aigle'' had left the harbour the day before with the Hawaiian king [[Liholiho]] and his queen [[Kamamalu]] the day before. Chiefs from other islands gathered on [[Oʻahu]] while the king was absent, and also the death of Keoua, the governor of [[Maui]], caused an atmosphere of political uneasiness.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=127}} It is unknown, if this situation urged Maitey to plead to be taken aboard of the ''Mentor'', the first Prussian ship both to circumnavigate the globe as well as visiting Hawai‘i. Inquiries about the Hawaiian teenager confirmed, that he had no relatives,&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=127}} and he was allowed to leave Hawai‘i. The name ''Maitey'' was recorded by the Germans as Henry's (or Harry's) family name, but was obviously derived from the Hawaiian ''maika‘i'' or ''maita‘i''.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=127}}&lt;ref&gt;Good, fine, all right, well; cf. {{Hawaiian Dictionaries|maika‘i|id=D12046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journey to Prussia ===

During the voyage the ownership of the ship was transferred to the ''[[Prussian Maritime Enterprise|Seehandlungsgesellschaft]]'' (Prussian Maritime Enterprise)&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[:w:de:Seehandlungsgesellschaft|Seehandlungsgesellschaft]] ''(German)''&lt;/ref&gt; under the jurisdiction of the Prussian king [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]]. Therefore, after the arrival of the ''Mentor'' in [[Swinemünde]] on September 14, 1824, the king was informed about the ''Sandwich islander'', and decided on September 27, that the president of the ''Seehandlungsgesellschaft'', Christian Rother,&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[:w:de:Christian Rother|Christian Rother]]&lt;/ref&gt; should bring him to Berlin.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|pages=128–130}} Maitey stayed in Rother's house there until the king decided on October 15, that he had to be educated in the German language and the principles of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=130}}

=== Education ===

[[File:Berlin und Umgegend Karte Hildburghausen 1848 Ausschnitt.png|thumb|Map showing the ''Erziehungs-Anstalt'' outside the Gate to Halle (1848)]]
Maitey continued to live with the family of president Rother until 1827, when he moved to the ''Erziehungshaus vor dem Halleschen Tor'',&lt;ref&gt;Heidemann, Wilfried M. ''Der Sandwich-Insulaner Maitey von der Pfaueninsel: Die Lebensgeschichte eines hawaiischen Einwanderers in Berlin und bei Potsdam von 1824 bis 1872.'' Mitteilungen des Vereins für die Geschichte Berlins 80. Jahrgang, Nr. Heft 2 (April 1984): 153–172, p. 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt; a school institution&lt;ref&gt;''see also'' [http://kreuzberged.com/2014/05/07/today-in-kreuzberg-may-4th-the-boysborstal-school-before-the-gate-to-halle/ Today in Kreuzberg: May 4th – The Boys´ Borstal School before the gate to Halle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715194142/http://kreuzberged.com/2014/05/07/today-in-kreuzberg-may-4th-the-boysborstal-school-before-the-gate-to-halle/ |date=2015-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he had attended since 1825.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|pages=136–137}} In 1827 Maitey was invited to meet [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] for conversations about the [[Hawaiian language]], the result of which Humboldt presented first in the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1828.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|pages=138–139}} Based on these conversations the ''Sandwich-Wörterverzeichnis'' (Sandwich glossary)&lt;ref name="Reutter 2007"&gt;{{Cite paper| publisher = Universität Hamburg| last = Reutter| first = Georg| title = Wilhelm von Humboldts linguistisches System: Seine Position in der Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaft| location = Hamburg| accessdate = 2016-10-13| date = 2007-01-10| url = http://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2007/3166/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=68}} served as foundation of his research on the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] and Maitey&lt;ref&gt;cited as ''Harres Maitai'' in various publications of von Humboldt: {{Cite paper| publisher = Universität Hamburg| last = Reutter| first = Georg| title = Wilhelm von Humboldts linguistisches System: Seine Position in der Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaft| location = Hamburg| accessdate = 2016-10-13| date = 2007-01-10| url = http://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2007/3166/}}, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; was Humboldt's most important source for the Hawaiian language.&lt;ref&gt;''Die wichtigsten Quellen auf diesem letzten Weg Humboldts sind William Mariner für das Tongische (ein Schiffbrüchiger), Thomas Kendall für das Neuseeländische (ein Missionar) und Harres Maitai für das Hawaiische (ein Eingeborener).'' {{Cite paper| publisher = Universität Hamburg| last = Reutter| first = Georg| title = Wilhelm von Humboldts linguistisches System: Seine Position in der Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaft| location = Hamburg| accessdate = 2016-10-13| date = 2007-01-10| url = http://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2007/3166/}}, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

From fall in 1829 he had a Hawaiian companion in the ''Erziehungshaus'' for about eight months, Jony Kahopimeai, who had come to Germany with the Prussian ship ''Princess Louise''.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=145}} After Maitey started to serve at Peacock Island Jony occasionally visited him,&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=149}} but in February 1831 he became ill, died from pneumonia and was buried on March 2, 1831.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=146}}

=== Service at Peacock Island ===

On April 23, 1830, Maitey was baptized and confirmed. He was given the German names ''Heinrich Wilhelm'' at the christening.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|pages=143–144}} In August Maitey was taken over by the royal household and assigned as assistant to the engine master at [[Pfaueninsel|Peacock Island]] (German: ''Pfaueninsel''). He was listed as a ''ward of the king'' and ''assistant to the engine master''.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|pages=146–147}} However, it is documented that there was also a suggestion, that Maitey should become the ferryman of Peacock Island, but obviously his final assignments were a much better perspective for him.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=148}}

In summer 1834 two [[Nene (bird)|Hawaiian geese]] ''(nēnē)'', which were brought to Germany on the ship ''Princess Louise'' as well, arrived also on the island.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=147}}

The engine master Franciscus Joseph Friedrich trained Maitey as wood turner, locksmith, and cabinetmaker.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=147}}

After some difficulties Maitey got the royal marriage consent with help from Christian Rother, and married Dorothea Charlotte Becker on August 25, 1833, in the church of Stolpe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried M. Heidemann: ''[http://www.zlb.de/fileadmin/user_upload/berlin_portal/MVGB/MVGB_1983-1987.pdf Der Sandwich-Insulaner Maitey von der Pfaueninsel: Die Lebensgeschichte eines hawaiischen Einwanderers in Berlin und bei Potsdam von 1824 bis 1872.]'' Mitteilungen des Vereins für die Geschichte Berlins 80.

''Harry Maitey: From Polynesia to Prussia''. In: ''Hawaiian Journal of History'' 11 (1977): 125–161, pp. 149–150 and footnote 112 at p. 159: ''Archiv der Kirchengemeinde Wannsee [formerly called Stolpe] per Pfarrer Hauschild, 1 Berlin 39, Schuchardtweg 5''&lt;/ref&gt; After the wedding the couple moved to [[Klein-Glienicke]], therefore Maitey had to travel to Peacock Island for work. Later he was more and more absent, which created difficulties for his relationship with Friedrich. Finally it was decided, that Maitey was assigned to the royal ''Garten Inspector'' Fintelmann.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|pages=150–151}}

While working under master Friedrich, Maitey apparently helped him ''building miniature replicas of famous castles and cathedrals''&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=152}} from [[ivory]] and [[mother-of-pearl]]. The part of his carving skills seemed to be essential, because it was stated later, that Friedrich did not made the models anymore after Maitey left as his assistant.&lt;ref name="Moore 152-153"&gt;Moore, Anneliese. ''Harry Maitey: From Polynesia to Prussia''. Hawaiian Journal of History 11 (1977): 125–161, pp. 152-153; von der Ahé, Caesar: ''Heinrich Wilhelm Maitey, der Südsee-Insulaner auf der Pfaueninsel.'' In: ''Heimat und Ferne,'' Nos. 36-37 (Sept 9 and 16, 1930), no pagination&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested, that Maitey was the artist who created some yellow room dividers in the castle, which were attributed to Friedrich as well.&lt;ref name="Moore 152-153" /&gt;

[[File:Harry Maitey Grave a0008628.jpg|thumb|Grave of Harry Maitey: inscription for his in-laws]]
Living in Klein-Glienicke (Kurfürstenstraße 10) for the rest of his live Maitey died of [[smallpox]] at his home on February 26, 1872, ''"a pensioner of the king, at the age of sixty-four."''&lt;ref&gt;Church register Klein-Glienicke, letter Pfarrer Strauss August 29, 1973, cited after Moore, Anneliese. ''Harry Maitey: From Polynesia to Prussia''. Hawaiian Journal of History 11 (1977): 125–161, pp. 154, footnote 128, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; His grave still exists at a small cemetery not far from the church St. Peter and Paul at [[Nikolskoë, Berlin|Nikolskoe]] near Peacock Island and is also the final resting place of his wife and his in-laws:&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=154}}
: ''Here rest in God the Sandwich Islander Maitey, 1872, and his wife Dorothy Becker Maitey, 1889''
: ''Here rest in God the animal keeper Becker and his wife. They are the in-laws of the Sandwich Islander Maitey''
:: Inscriptions on the cross at the grave&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=154}}

Maitey's son Eduard believed, that his father was a Hawaiian prince, which was doubted by Caesar von der Ahé who published articles about Maitey in 1930 and 1933. Von der Ahé mentioned the name ''Kaparena'' as probably Maitey's Hawaiian name, but there are no such records in the Prussian documents. He also referred to files of the former Prussian court when he wrote, that Maitey's father was a soldier in Hawai‘i.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=155}}

It is unknown, if Maitey's widow or Eduard had the chance to see King [[Kalākaua]] during his visit in Berlin and [[Potsdam]] in August, 1881.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=155}} However, Eduard served as an actuary in [[Angermünde]] for some time before he returned to Potsdam for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Moore 1977" /&gt;{{rp|page=161}}

== Cultural characteristics  ==

Maitey likely understood his relationship to the President of the Seehandlung Christian Rother as the usual adoption in Hawai‘i ''(hānai)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries|hānai|id=D2868}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also explains the misunderstandings in the years 1829 and 1830, when Maitey hoped in vain to return to Rother's household.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried M. Heidemann: ''[http://www.zlb.de/fileadmin/user_upload/berlin_portal/MVGB/MVGB_1983-1987.pdf Der Sandwich-Insulaner Maitey von der Pfaueninsel: Die Lebensgeschichte eines hawaiischen Einwanderers in Berlin und bei Potsdam von 1824 bis 1872.]'' Mitteilungen des Vereins für die Geschichte Berlins 80. Jahrgang, Nr. Heft 2 (April 1984): pp. 153–172, pp. 159–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

A newspaper report from 1824 shows that Maitey performed a [[hula]] in Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;David A. Chappell: ''Double Ghosts: Oceanian Voyagers on Euroamerican Ships''. M.E. Sharpe, 1997, {{ISBN|9780765636959}}, S.

|text=When he is invited to sing, he adorns himself almost as much as our young ladies, and also has the other nasty habit that when he first started singing one has to give him good words before he stops. When singing, he sits down on a chair, and makes vigorous movements with his hands, and it seemed to me remarkable that he often struck with the right hand to the heart, while he never touched the right side with the left. His singing was limited to four or five tones, and the words seemed primarily to consist from the sounds ae, i, o, his voice is not creaky, you could call it a pleasant tenor voice, but the presentation of the song with these strange movements made quite the impression as if you saw a madman.

|text=Since the same remained among us, the visual inspection shows to everyone that in its facial features no deviations can be perceived from ours. The broad cheek-bones are also found in us, and, although his skull is narrower, this is hidden by the strong and thick hair; which reasonably distinguishes him is the darker skin color. For a finer mental cultivation he found himself not suitable.

Dunalley was the son of Henry Prittie, 3rd Baron Dunalley. He was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PRTY870HO|name=Prittie, the Hon.

However, in 1891 he was elected an [[Representative peer|Irish Representative Peer]], which he remained until his death. Lord Dunalley also served as [[Lord Lieutenant of County Tipperary]] from 1905 to 1922. He died in August 1927, aged 76, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Henry.

He was the owner of 'Countess' a 15-ton yacht on Lough Derg from 1893-1919.

'''Gerald Wayne Grote''' (born October 6, 1942) is an [[American people|American]] former [[Professional baseball|professional]] [[baseball]] player. He played the majority of his [[Major League Baseball]] career as a [[catcher]] for the [[New York Mets]], catching every inning of the franchise's first two World Series appearances, and would appear in two more World Series for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He was a two-time [[All-Star]] for the [[National League]] and is regarded as one of the best defensive catchers of his era.&lt;ref name="Jerry Grote"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/groteje01.shtml |title=Jerry Grote |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jerry Grote: He Caught Some of the Greats in his Career"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=baseball+digest+jerry+grote#v=onepage&amp;q=baseball%20digest%20jerry%20grote&amp;f=false |title=Jerry Grote: He Caught Some of the Greats in his Career |author=Winkworth, Bruce |publisher=|date=May 1992 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Grote was raised in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. When he was ten years old, he and his family were caught in an F-4 [[tornado]]. His mother, father and two sisters made it to safety, however, he lost his grandmother in the storm.&lt;ref name=Grote&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/mets/grote_survived_storm_long_before_8xp7Xfg4uA1M1b0IqIOPVP|title=Grote Survived Storm Long Before Amazin' Title Run|publisher=New York Post|date=2009-08-12 | first=Kevin | last=Kernan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grote attended [[Douglas MacArthur High School (San Antonio, Texas)|Douglas MacArthur High School]], where he played on the baseball team as a [[pitcher]], catcher and [[third baseman]].&lt;ref name=sabrbio&gt;{{sabrbio|a68fb617|Joseph Wancho|2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a high school pitcher, he threw a [[no-hitter]] and a [[One-hitter (baseball)|one hitter]].&lt;ref name=sabrbio/&gt; Grote played for [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] in 1962, and led the Tigers in batting average (.413), home runs (five), RBI (19), runs (29), and hits (31).&lt;ref name="Trinity University Athletes Inducted into Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x17336.xml |title=Trinity University Athletes Inducted into Hall of Fame |publisher=trinity.edu |accessdate=24 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major League career==

===Houston Colt .45s===
After one season at Trinity University, Grote was signed as an amateur [[free agent]] by the [[Houston Colt .45s]] in [[1962 Houston Colt .45s season|1962]], and was assigned to play for their [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] affiliate, the [[San Antonio Missions|San Antonio Bullets]].&lt;ref name=sabrbio/&gt; At the age of 20, he made his major league debut with the Colt .45s on September 21, [[1963 Houston Colt .45s season|1963]] as a late-inning defensive replacement for [[John Bateman (baseball)|John Bateman]], and hit a [[sacrifice fly]] to score [[Bob Aspromonte]] in his only at-bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU196309210.shtml|title=Philadelphia Phillies 4, Houston Colt .45s 3|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1963-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the season he appeared in three games, including on September 27, when every starter in the Colts' line-up was a rookie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU196309270.shtml|title=New York Mets 10, Houston Colt .45s 3|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1963-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1964 Houston Colt .45s season|1964]], Grote [[Platoon system|platooned]] with Bateman behind the plate; however, the Colts also experimented with young catchers [[Dave Adlesh]] and [[John Hoffman (baseball)|John Hoffman]], as neither Grote nor Bateman hit for a very high average that season (.181 and .190, respectively).&lt;ref name=sabrbio/&gt; Grote was the Colts' catcher on April 23, when [[Ken Johnson (right-handed pitcher)|Ken Johnson]] became the first pitcher in major league history to lose a [[complete game]] [[no-hitter]] in nine [[inning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU196404230.shtml|title=Cincinnati Reds 1, Houston Colt .45s 0|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1964-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1965 Houston Astros season|1965]], the newly renamed [[Houston Astros]] remained unsettled behind the plate, with former [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] [[Gus Triandos]] and prospect [[Ron Brand]] being added to the mix. Grote spent the entire season with Houston's [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Pacific Coast League]] affiliate, the [[Oklahoma City 89ers]], where he batted .265 with eleven [[home run]]s. At the end of the season, he was traded to the [[New York Mets]] for pitcher [[Tom Parsons (baseball)|Tom Parsons]].&lt;ref name="Jerry Grote Trades and Transactions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=groteje01 |title=Jerry Grote Trades and Transactions |publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=3 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Mets===
Grote became the starting catcher for the Mets immediately upon his arrival in [[New York City]]. Though he batted only .237 with three home runs in {{by|1966}}, his handling of the Mets' young pitchers and his solid defensive skills were instrumental in helping the Mets avoid 100 losses and a last place finish for the first time in franchise history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100127&amp;content_id=7976356&amp;vkey=news_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym|title=Inbox: Were Mets wise to stay frugal?|publisher=Marty Noble/MLB.com|date=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grote earned a reputation with his teammates and opponents as highly competitive, developing the trademark of rolling the ball to the far side of the [[pitcher's mound]] (closest to the Mets' dugout) while leaving the field after his pitcher ended an inning with a [[strikeout]]. This necessitated the opposing team's pitcher having to walk further to stoop and retrieve the ball.

In [[1968 New York Mets season|1968]], Grote was hitting over .300 at mid-season and was recognized as one of the top catchers in the National League when he was selected to be the starting catcher in the [[1968 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1968 All-Star Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=groteje01&amp;t=b&amp;year=1968 |title=1968 Jerry Grote Batting Log |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1968 All-Star Game"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS196807090.shtml |title=1968 All-Star Game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became only the second Met player in franchise history after [[Ron Hunt]] to earn a starting role in an All-Star game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/history/all_stars.jsp|title=Mets All-stars|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grote was hitless in two at-bats during the game.&lt;ref name="1968 All-Star Game"/&gt; He ended the year with a .282 batting average along with three [[home run]]s and 31 [[runs batted in]].&lt;ref name="Jerry Grote"/&gt;

The [[1969 New York Mets season|1969]] season would be a memorable one for Grote and the Mets. The [[1969 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] had been in first place since the beginning of the season and had a nine-game lead as late as August 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1969-schedule-scores.shtml |title=1969 Chicago Cubs Schedule, Box Scores and Splits |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Cubs began to falter while the Mets continued to play well. When the two teams met for a two-game series on September 8, the Mets won both games to move just a half game behind the Cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/1969-schedule-scores.shtml |title=1969 New York Mets Schedule, Box Scores and Splits |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from calling [[Tom Seaver]]'s five-hit pitching performance in the second game, Grote drove in the Mets' seventh and final run of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN196909090.shtml|title=New York Mets 7, Chicago Cubs 1|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1969-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the Mets swept the [[Montreal Expos]] in a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]], with Grote catching all 21 innings. Coupled with a Cubs loss, the Mets moved into first place for the first time in their history. The Mets stayed in the lead for the rest of the season, finishing with a 37-11 record in their final 48 games while the Cubs slumped to a 9-17 record in their final 26 games, and clinched the [[National League Eastern Division]] title on September 24.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1969-standings.shtml 1969 National League East standings at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pennant Races Don't Really Begin Until Month of July"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=baseball+digest+miracle+mets#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Pennant Races Don't Really Begin Until Month of July |author=Vass, George |publisher=|date=July 1996 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grote finished the season with a .252 average and produced career-highs with six home runs and 40 runs batted in, but it was his defensive skills that proved most valuable for the Mets.&lt;ref name="Jerry Grote"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KDMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=baseball+digest+jerry+grote#v=onepage&amp;q=baseball%20digest%20jerry%20grote&amp;f=false |title=Jerry Grote: Mets Most Valuable? |author=Elderkin, Phil |publisher=|date=February 1970 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grote posted a .991 [[fielding percentage]] and his 56.3% [[caught stealing]] percentage was second-best among National League catchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1969-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1969 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=3 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also given credit for guiding the Mets young pitching staff that led the league in victories and [[Shutout (baseball)|shutouts]] and finished second in team [[earned run average]].&lt;ref name=sabrbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1969.shtml#teams_standard_pitching::none |title=1969 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=3 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mets went on to sweep the [[1969 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1969 National League Championship Series]], but were heavy [[Underdog (term)|underdogs]] heading into the [[1969 World Series]] against the [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]]. Following a 4-1 loss in the series opener with [[Cy Young award]] winner Seaver on the mound, it seemed as if the Mets had little chance against the Orioles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL196910110.shtml|title=1969 World Series Game One|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1969-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Mets bounced back, winning the next four games to capture their first world championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1969_WS.shtml |title=1969 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides catching every inning in the post-season, Grote contributed offensively with a [[Single (baseball)|single]] in Game Two to keep a ninth [[inning]] rally alive and [[Al Weis]] followed with the game-winning [[Hit (baseball)|hit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL196910120.shtml|title=1969 World Series Game Two|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1969-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Game Four tied, Grote doubled to start the tenth inning, then [[pinch runner]] [[Rod Gaspar]] scored the winning run when an errant throw hit [[J.C. Martin]] on the wrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN196910150.shtml|title=1969 World Series Game Four|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1969-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Grote calling the pitches, the Mets pitching staff held the Orioles hitters to a .146 batting average during the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1969_WS.shtml#post_batting_loser::none |title=1969 World Series Baltimore Orioles Batting Statistics |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grote and the 1969 Mets became an improbable part of baseball history. In their previous seven seasons the Mets had finished in last place five times. Their sudden turn of fortune in 1969 and their subsequent upset victory in the World Series stunned the sports world and became one of the more storied events in baseball lore.&lt;ref name="When The Miracle Mets Shocked The Baseball World"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vybawTLKGmwC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=miracle+mets+baseball+digest#v=onepage&amp;q=miracle%20mets%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false |title=When The Miracle Mets Shocked The Baseball World |author=Schultz, Randy |publisher=|date=June 2009 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=3 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team became known as the ''Miracle Mets''.&lt;ref name="When The Miracle Mets Shocked The Baseball World"/&gt;

Grote continued to provide the Mets with good defense, leading National League catchers in {{By|1970}} and {{By|1971}} in [[putouts]] and in [[range factor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1970-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1970 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1971-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1971 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1972 New York Mets season|1972]], Grote played in only 64 games due to injuries and in late September he had surgery to remove bone chips from his right elbow.&lt;ref name=sabrbio/&gt;

In May [[1973 New York Mets season|1973]], Grote broke a bone in his right arm when he was hit by a pitch and went on the [[disabled list]] for two months.&lt;ref name=sabrbio/&gt; When he returned in mid-July, the Mets began winning, climbing from last place on August 30 to win the National League Eastern Division pennant.&lt;ref name="Pennant Races Don't Really Begin Until Month of July"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ui4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=pennant+races+baseball+digest#v=onepage&amp;q=pennant%20races%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false |title=Six Greatest Pennant Races of the Last 50 Years |author=Vass, George |publisher=|date=September 1991 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=3 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/1973.shtml |title=1973 New York Mets Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They then proceeded to defeat the heavily favored [[1973 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in the [[1973 National League Championship Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1973_NLCS.shtml |title=1973 National League Championship Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1973 World Series|World Series]], the Mets took the [[1973 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to the seventh and final game, before they were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1973_WS.shtml |title=1973 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had in 1969, Grote caught every [[inning]] of every post-season game for the Mets in {{by|1973}}.&lt;ref name=sabrbio/&gt; Looking back on his two pennant-winning seasons with the Mets, Grote said, "It (the 1969 season) was no miracle. Now, '73 was a miracle."&lt;ref name=Grote/&gt;

In {{by|1974}}, Grote was batting .287 with four home runs and 27 runs batted in to earn his second [[1974 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star selection]], however, injuries were beginning to take their toll and he split the catching duties with [[Duffy Dyer]].&lt;ref name=sabrbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS197407230.shtml|title=1974 All-Star Game|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1974-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grote rebounded in [[1975 New York Mets season|1975]], posting a career-high .295 batting average in 119 games and led all National League catchers with a .995 [[fielding percentage]].&lt;ref name="Jerry Grote"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1975-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1975 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Veterans Stadium]] on July 4, 1975, Grote stepped in as a [[pinch hitter]] against longtime teammate [[Tug McGraw]], who had been traded to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] during the off-season. With the Mets down 3-2, Grote connected for a game winning two run home run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI197507040.shtml|title=New York Mets 4, Philadelphia Phillies 3|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1975-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[1977 New York Mets season|1977]] season, [[John Stearns]] had taken over as the Mets' starting catcher as back injuries continued to plague Grote and in August, after twelve seasons with the Mets, he was traded to the [[1977 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] for two players to be named later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19770901&amp;id=tZAjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i6EFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4954,117747&amp;hl=en Mets swap Grote]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles Dodgers and Kansas City Royals===
Shortly after joining the Dodgers, Grote struck out in his only career at-bat against former battery-mate Tom Seaver, who was now with the Reds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN197709150.shtml|title=Cincinnati Reds 3, Los Angeles Dodgers 2|publisher=Baseball-reference.com|date=1977-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his two seasons with the Dodgers, he played part-time as a backup to [[Steve Yeager]] and appeared in two World Series against the [[New York Yankees]]. He retired from professional baseball after the {{by|1978}} season, only to be lured out of retirement in [[1981 Kansas City Royals season|1981]] by the [[Kansas City Royals]], who were experiencing a shortage of catchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Jerry_Grote_1941 |title=Jerry Grote |publisher=baseballlibrary.com |accessdate=2 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604034220/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Jerry_Grote_1941 |archivedate= 4 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, {{By|1981}}, at the age of 38, Grote went 3 for 4 with a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] home run, a double, and a [[stolen base]], driving in a team-record seven runs.&lt;ref name=sabrbio/&gt; After another short stint with the Dodgers, he retired for good after the {{by|1981}} season.

'''Jockin Arputham''' (15 August 1947 – October 13, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[https://unhabitat.org/demise-of-jockin-arputham-15-august-1947-october-13-2018/ Demise of Jockin Arputham (15 August 1947 – October 13 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; worked for more than 40 years in [[slums]] and [[shanty towns]], building representative organizations into powerful partners with governments and international agencies for the betterment of urban living. 

Arputham was the president of the [[National Slum Dwellers Federation]] which he founded in the 70s and of [[Slum Dwellers International]]&lt;ref&gt;For details of their work, see http://www.sdinet.org/&lt;/ref&gt; which networks slum and shack dweller organizations and federations from over twenty countries across the world. The National Slum Dwellers Federation works closely with [[Mahila Milan]], a collective of savings groups formed by homeless women and women living in slums across India, and with [[Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers|SPARC]], a Mumbai-based NGO, and together they have been instrumental is supporting tens of thousands of the urban poor access housing and sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;Arputham, Jockin (2008), "Developing new approaches for people-centred development", Environment and Urbanization, Vol, 20, No. 2, pages 319-337 available from http://eau.sagepub.com/content/vol20/issue2&lt;/ref&gt; He has also worked with the police to set up 'police panchayats' in many of the informal settlements in Mumbai. Here, for the first time, police are assigned to work in these settlements and are supported by a committee of ten residents from the community (three men seven women).&lt;ref&gt;Roy, A N A Jockin and Ahmad Javed (2004), "Community police stations in Mumbai’s slums", Environment and Urbanization, Vol. 16, No. 2, pages 135-138. http:// eau.sagepub.com/content/vol16/issue2/&lt;/ref&gt;

Jockin realized that slum dweller organizations had to change their strategy.  They had to make governments see them as legitimate citizens with knowledge and capacities to implement solutions.  So they sought to work in partnership with government to address their housing problems – and other problems.  He often said how can you reduce urban poverty if you do not listen to and work with the urban poor. He built more than 20,000 (toilet) seats in Mumbai alone. He insisted on new standards on redeveloped housing, an increased floor-space-index. Over the years, Arputham has built 30,000 houses in India, and 1,00,000 houses abroad. Funding for his work came from many sources. Thanks to his work, he met both Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela.

He visited many other countries to encourage and support slum or shack dwellers to organize and to encourage them to take their own initiatives to show government what they are capable of.  
He resided in [[Mumbai]]; his office was in Dharavi. He was the winner of the 2000 [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for Peace and International Understanding and an honorary Ph.D. from KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, in 2009. In 2011, the Government of India bestowed on him its fourth highest civilian honor, the [[Padma Shri]] award.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known for his charisma and excellent public speaking.

==Biography==
Arputham was born to [[Tamilian]] parents in [[Kolar Gold Fields]], [[Kolar]] district of [[Karnataka]], [[India]], in 1947. In 1963 he moved to Mumbai where he worked as a carpenter and building contractor. He has two Daughters Sujatha Rajan and Glorita Samuel who currently are married and live in Bangalore and help in their Father's Work. He became involved in community action within the settlement where he lived and worked, organising efforts to get household waste collected, setting up informal schools for children, and establishing water connections.&lt;ref&gt;HabitatJam: [http://www.habitatjam.com/webuploads/files/pressRelease/eng/Jockin_Arputham.pdf Jockin Arputham]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 70,000 people who lived in Janata colony (including him) were threatened with eviction, he helped organize protests and court cases. He was arrested many times, despite Janata colony not being an illegal settlement. He also squatted in the Parliament in Delhi until the then Prime Minister would see him. But in 1976, 70,000 people were evicted, although the community organizations that had emerged meant that they got much better terms than most evictees - land and support for housing in Cheetah Camp.

'''Jogen Chowdhury''' (born 16 February 1939) is an eminent Indian painter and considered an important painter of 21st century India. He lives and works in [[Santiniketan]]. He graduated from the [[Government College of Art &amp; Craft, Kolkata]] and subsequently at [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]], Paris in 1967. He has immense contribution in inspiring young artists of India. Jogen Chowdhury had developed his individual style after his return from Paris. His most famous paintings are in ink, water colour and pastel. He has painted in oil medium as well.

Lines and its tactile characteristic to enhance colours is an important material in Indian Art for ages. Jogen Chowdhury himself is a master of lines and he has mastered to make the curves depict the character of his figures. By careful distortion of the form he imparts the air of caricature in his figures, figures of men and women. The figure is always the most important and conveys all the artist has to express. Colour, he uses though, is to provide matter into the form. [[R. Siva Kumar]] has lucidly described Jogen's works in the following excerpt:"The pulse and rhythm of Jogen Chowdhury’s art comes from a filial affinity to nature and milieu. In Chowdhury’s more recent works the sensory experiences of cloth, bolsters, sofas and the human body are cross-projected to produce an uncanny world of tran-substantiated tumescence and flaccidness. Mnemic displacements and personal associations add to the symbolic ambivalence of his motifs, making his images come closer to inexplicable experiences than to explicit signs. In the postures of some figures we feel an animal sentience, in the ripe anatomy of others we savour a fruity succulence. The figures are wrought by a combination of decorative wilfulness and expressive distortion and are imbued with an effusive sensuality. Chowdhury’s art is rich in suggestions; it is to be apprehended without bracketing our fund of knowledge, experience or memories, but also cannot be narrativised without trivialising it, without depleting its sensory particularities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cimaartindia.com/artists.php?a=jogen-chowdhury |title=Jogen Chowdhury |work=Center of International Modern Art (CIMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37384">A total of fourteen HouseGuests entered the house to compete in the [[Big Brother 7 (U.S.)|All Stars]] edition of the American reality series ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]''. This was the first season to feature returning HouseGuests competing for the grand prize, and is one of six seasons to feature previous HouseGuests competing. At least one HouseGuest from each season is featured in the All Stars edition. ''[[Big Brother 1 (U.S.)|Big Brother 1]]'' had the lowest number of participants, with only HouseGuest George competing. ''[[Big Brother 6 (U.S.)|Big Brother 6]]'' had the highest number of HouseGuests competing this year, with Janelle, Howie, James and Kaysar all returning to compete.

==Alison==
{{Main|Alison Irwin}}
'''Alison Kemerer Irwin''' (born August 7, 1980), 37, was the Runner-Up in the [[Big Brother 4 (U.S.)|fourth edition]] of ''Big Brother''. She became well known for her manipulative gameplay, as well as the fact that she "hooked up" with numerous male HouseGuests to advance herself farther in the house. During the first week in the house, she became a part of the plan to make Jase disagree with Janelle's nominations, thus nominating the two of them. Despite this, Jase and Janelle nominated Alison and Danielle for eviction. Following the nominations, Janelle wanted Alison evicted. Despite HouseGuests Mike and Will campaigning for her to stay, Alison was evicted in an eight to two vote on Day 11. Following her eviction, she was questioned in the studio by host [[Julie Chen]], and her answers helped determine the new Head of Household. She briefly appeared later in the season during the "Ghost of Seasons past" competition.

==Danielle==
{{Main|Danielle Reyes}}
'''Danielle Reyes''' (born January 22, 1972), 46 ,was a property manager from Vacaville, California, married with two daughters. Danielle was the Runner-Up in the [[Big Brother 3 (U.S.)|third edition]] of ''Big Brother'', losing in a nine to one Jury vote. Danielle is often seen as one of the greatest players to never win the game, a title that led her to seek "redemption" for her loss. Danielle was nominated against Alison in the first week, after the two devised a plan to get rid of HouseGuest Janelle. Danielle later survived the eviction, and Alison was evicted. Despite acting as though she had friendships with the members of the "Season Six alliance", Danielle was often seen campaigning to get them out. Following Diane's eviction, Danielle formed the "Legion of Doom" alliance with Mike, Will and James, with the goal of evicting Janelle from the house. Danielle was the fifth Head of Household of the season, and nominated Janelle and James for eviction. When Janelle won the Power of Veto, Kaysar was nominated in her place. Kaysar was evicted that week. The following week, Janelle became Head of Household and nominated Danielle for eviction. The following day, however, Danielle won her first Power of Veto competition, and saved herself from eviction. Danielle was later nominated in the eighth week by Head of Household Erika. On Day 60, Danielle was evicted in a three to zero vote. She came in 6th place, and voted for Mike to win.

==Diane==
{{Main|Diane Henry}}
'''Diane Nicole Henry''' (born March 1, 1982), 36, is a cocktail waitress from [[Burlington, Kentucky]]. She came in 3rd place in the [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|fifth edition]] of the series. Diane became a fan favorite, and was voted into the house by viewers. Before entering the house, Diane formed the "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith" alliance with Jase, keeping it a secret until the finale. She also had a close friendship with Nakomis, who Diane had been aligned with throughout the fifth season. After voting against the majority during the first week, both Diane and Nakomis found themselves nominated in the second week. Nakomis was evicted that week, with Diane surviving the eviction. She was later nominated by Janelle in the fourth week as a replacement nominee for Mike. Diane was ultimately evicted on Day 32 in a seven to one vote. She came in 11th place.

==Erika==
{{Main|Erika Landin}}
'''Erika Michelle Landin''' (born December 5, 1969), 48, is a [[Pilates]] instructor from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. She was originally a contestant on ''Big Brother 4'', coming in fourth place.  Since ''Big Brother 4'', there has been a common dislike between her and fellow All-Star Alison Irwin, who was the sole Houseguest responsible for Erika's eviction in that season. In Season 7, Alison was evicted first, and Erika has faced little animosity.

As a Pilates instructor, she occasionally led Pilates lessons for the houseguests in the backyard of the house. Another contestant, Marcellas, has compared Erika's gameplay to that of [[Amber Mariano]] in ''[[Survivor: All-Stars]]'', as she is playing under the radar. Because Amber went on to win ''Survivor: All-Stars'', Marcellas claimed that Erika should be closely watched. Many houseguests consider her a strong competitor, but she is frequently nominated as a pawn instead of as a target.

Erika won Week 2's Power of Veto, but did not use it to save either Diane or Nakomis from the nomination block. On Week 4, Erika was nominated by Janelle as a pawn against Mike.  After Diane became the replacement nominee, Erika foiled Diane's plans to sway the houseguests's votes.  Erika only received an eviction vote from Will that week.  Erika later won Week 6's HoH competition.  Unfortunately, the competition was replayed due to technical glitches during the original competition, and Janelle became the new HoH instead. Janelle attacked Erika gameplay as a "floater" and nominated her. In the Diary Room, however, Erika claimed to be "a simple girl from a town called Chill."  Erika again avoided eviction, after vigorous campaigning for replacement nominee Marcellas' eviction.  Immediately afterwards, George won the Head of Household and had to nominate two people on the spot. He chose to nominate Erika and James.  James saved himself with the power of Veto and was replaced by Howie.  For the third time, Erika survived the eviction by receiving only two out of five votes.

Erika finally officially won a Head of Household competition on Week 8. She celebrated wildly upon winning, along with ally Danielle, whom she told was "so safe." Erika's original nomination choices were Janelle and Chicken George, with the intention of removing Janelle. Janelle won the Veto yet again, however, and Erika found herself in a difficult position. Her "showmance" Boogie urged her to nominate Danielle, and was strongly set against Will's elimination. Despite being confused with Mike's loyalties, Erika chose to nominate Danielle, who claimed it was a "betrayal." The controversial decision led to much animosity between the two women, and Danielle was evicted.

Immediately following that, the Houseguests learned another contestant would be gone within the next forty-five minutes. After a quick Head of Household competition, Janelle was crowned the HoH. She nominated Erika and George, with the intention of eliminating Erika, but Erika won the Power of Veto. Mike took Erika's place, but George was evicted 2-0.

After Mike won the Head of Household, and Janelle the Power of Veto it would be between Erika and Will to be evicted. Despite Will's wrap on Janelle throughout the game, Erika decided to reveal all to Janelle in hopes of saving herself. This led to the two of them finally figuring out what Chilltown was doing and they formed a final two alliance. Erika survived the eviction again and Will was out.

After Erika won part one and Mike won part two, she decided to reaffirm her alliance with him. She still liked him, although he had called her a "ho" in the Diary Room following his friend Will's eviction. Mike won the final part of the Head of Household competition and evicted Janelle. In the final two many jury members disliked Erika's gameplay and felt Mike played better. She lost the final vote 6-1, only receiving the vote of Marcellas.

==George==
'''George Allen Boswell''', also known as "Chicken George," was originally a contestant on ''Big Brother 1''. He was the only Houseguest from that season eligible to enter the All-Star house. This is likely in part to the fact that Big Brother 1 was a much different game than the seasons that followed.  As well, winner Eddie McGee and fan favorite Brittany Petros were both approached and declined the invitation to return. ''Big Brother 1'' had lower ratings and played more like the international versions of Big Brother.  Despite this, George was chosen to enter the All-Star house by the producers.  He became the eighth male to enter the house, leaving the gender division in the house at 8-6 instead of the usual even split.

In the early days of the game, George was often ridiculed and dismissed as a minor resident of the house. As time passed, however, he began gaining recognition as a potential threat due to his under-the-radar personality.  Some houseguests have compared him to Michael "Cowboy" Ellis, who many believed was taken to the final two of Season 5 because he was unlikely to win. On Week 3, James nominated George for eviction alongside Will, stating that having caught George eavesdropping on his conversations. George was unhappy about his nomination and began harbor some animosity for James. Seemingly against all odds, George won the Power of Veto.  On the downside, he won the veto by choosing to eat only "slop" for the remainder of his time in the house.  George made a very touching speech at the Veto Ceremony, claiming to feel honored to play with each and every Houseguest, and then he vetoed his own nomination.  He was allowed to eat regular food for a week when Marcellas gave him the slop pass he won during Week 5's HOH competition.  During Week 6, Head of Household Janelle was angry at Chicken George for having sworn on his kids that he wouldn't vote to evict Kaysar yet doing so anyway. However, George actually promised no such thing—he actually told Kaysar he was unsure what he was going to do.  Despite intentions to name George as a replacement nominee after Danielle Reyes won the Power of Veto, she chose instead to nominate Marcellas Reynolds, giving George safety for another week.

At the beginning of Week 7 on Day 46, George won the Head of Household competition in a tie-breaker against Danielle. As part of a surprise double-eviction week, he was forced to immediately nominate two housemate for eviction live. He nominated James and Erika. However, James won the veto and George then nominated Howie.

At the beginning of Week Eight, George was nominated alongside Janelle by Erika. Janelle won the veto and removed herself from the block, causing Head of Household Erika to nominate Danielle. Danielle Reyes was evicted the following Thursday, day 60. 
   
In addition, Day 60 included "Big Brother Overdrive", a game element where a full week's worth of play took place in an hour. George Boswell was nominated alongside Erika, but Erika won the Power of Veto. She was replaced with Mike, and George was then evicted by a 2-0 vote. Once evicted, George received a bucket of classic [[KFC]] chicken from a man dressed as [[Colonel Sanders]], and was sent to the jury house.

==Howie==
{{Main|Howie Gordon}}
'''Howie Gordon''' (born January 7, 1971), 47, is one of many All-Star contestants to originate from ''Big Brother 6''. He placed fifth that season and was the last remaining male contestant. Known for his crazy and funny antics, Howie was typically perceived as a light-hearted goofball. There were times throughout the season, however, when Howie became extremely upset and uncharacteristically serious. One such occasion is his infamous "Busto" rant, in which he claimed fellow contestant April was thoroughly useless. Despite this, his popularity rating was consistently very high throughout the season.

During the first days in the All-Stars house, Howie very enthusiastically made mention of the wonderful variety of "boobies" in the house. Howie's strategy has been very similar to his original strategy in Big Brother 6. Always joking, he has once again become known as the goofball, and is usually viewed in a favorable light. However, Howie did run into some conflict with Will, as the two constantly seemed to insult one another - sometimes in joking spirit, other times not. Julie discussed this on the first eviction night, and it hasn't been mentioned since. Howie largely considers himself a "[[Jedi]]," and he is usually seen with a [[lightsaber]]. This season, he took Chicken George under his wing as a "Jedi Apprentice." Howie sparked mild controversy during Week 6's Head of Household competition. During the competition, Howie's cubicle did not light up during one of the questions when he pressed his buzzer, leading host Julie Chen to believe that Howie had not answered the question.  Howie left in protest that he did hit the button but his box didn't flash due to technical errors.  This problem, along with other technical problems, led to a re-do competition, which was won by Howie's ally, Janelle. The following week, George named Howie as a replacement nominee when James saved himself with the Power of Veto.  During that night's eviction, Howie received three votes to Erika's two.  Howie's exit from the Big Brother house was one of the most dramatic to date, where he physically confronted Boogie on the way out the door.  He became the second member of the All-Stars jury.  Upon arrival at the sequester house, Howie told fellow evictee Marcellas, "I couldn't beat a chicken".

==James==
{{Main|James Rhine}}
'''James Allen Rhine''' (born December 6, 1975), 42, was a contestant from ''Big Brother 6'', coming in seventh place overall. During that season, he was constantly targeted but proved quite difficult to eliminate, as he won more Veto challenges than any other Houseguest in Big Brother US history. James was often targeted because he was perceived as deceptive. James was finally evicted when the two opposing alliances in the house - between whom James had meticulously played the entire game - came together to eliminate him.

Although he entered the house as part of the Season Six alliance, he did not have much trust that they wouldn't turn on him again. He decided to try protecting Diane and Danielle as well. On Week 3, James won the HoH Competition. His original nominations were Will and George, but when George vetoed his own nomination, James made the controversial decision to put Jase up as a replacement nominee for floating between the two early alliances. In Week 4, after Janelle named Diane as the replacement nominee instead of Will, James said, "As far as the BB6 alliance goes, I'm done," and also, "I'm going to do whatever it takes to make sure Janelle gets screwed." Although James openly remained a member of his originally alliance, he secretly aligned himself with Danielle as well as Will and Mike, forming the Legion of Doom alliance. During the next week's Head of Household competition, James won the power to nullify an eviction vote and Danielle became the Head of Household. She nominated James as a pawn alongside Janelle. Danielle believed James would be able to beat Janelle in the Veto competition. Janelle won instead and saved herself. Danielle chose to nominate Kaysar in her place. Before the eviction, James nullified Janelle's eviction vote, as he knew it would be against him. Kaysar was subsequently evicted 5-1.

George won the first Week 7 Head of Household competition during a double eviction week and had to make his nominations on the spot. George went after James and Erika. However, James won the veto. Howie became the replacement nominee and was evicted. Mike "Boogie" won the next HoH competition, choosing to nominate Janelle and James. This was the second time that Janelle and James were nominated together. Janelle again saved herself with the Power of Veto during a controversial competition. James claimed that Janelle stole a doll from him and thus, cheated. George was placed alongside James as a pawn. Mike "Boogie" has stated his intention is to evict James and on day 53 he was evicted by a 3 to 1 vote.

==Janelle==
{{Main|Janelle Pierzina}}
'''Janelle Marie Pierzina''' (born January 10, 1980), 38, is one of the Houseguests whose original season was ''Big Brother 6''. Janelle likes to think of herself as a buxom blonde. On Big Brother 6, she finished third, losing to Ivette Corredero and Maggie Ausburn. During her time in the Big Brother 6 house, she was quite popular in the public's eye, winning numerous America's Choice prizes and having an extremely high popularity rating of 93% on the second-to-last week of Big Brother 6, thus, establishing her as being the most popular female Big Brother Houseguest of all time and tying fellow Big Brother 6 contestant, Kaysar, who is the most popular male Big Brother Houseguest of all time.

In the first week in the ''Big Brother 7'' house, Janelle shared the Head of Household power with Jase, and the two collaborated to nominate Danielle and Alison for eviction. Janelle also won the Veto that week, but chose not to use it.

Janelle became Head of Household again on Week 4, marking the fourth consecutive week that an All-Star originating from ''Big Brother 6'' was in power. Janelle found it difficult to choose between nominating floaters and nominating Will and Mike, the components of Chill Town. Perhaps swayed by several different Houseguests, Janelle nominated Mike "Boogie" and Erika, one from each of the groups. When Mike won the Power of Veto and subsequently saved himself, she replaced him with Diane. This was to ensure that a floater would leave that week. This move was controversial among the Houseguests, as it seemed Chill Town had major input in the decision.

On Week 5, Danielle won the Head of Household competition. Having been quite frustrated with Janelle's actions the previous week, Danielle chose to nominate her alongside James, whose role was that of a pawn. Janelle proved tenacious, however, when she won the Power of Veto, allowing her to veto her nomination. Janelle used the Power of Veto and Danielle nominated Janelle's ally Kaysar in her place.

On Week 6, a live competition was shown that revealed that Erika had won the Head of Household competition. Throughout the competition, however, there were several technical errors, including Howie's buzzer malfunction. Because of this, the competition was re-run, and Janelle emerged as the winner. She nominated the two other remaining women in the house, Danielle and Erika. Danielle won the Power of Veto, and Janelle was forced to make a replacement nomination. With much persuasion by Howie, James, Will, and Mike, Janelle finally agreed to nominate her good friend Marcellas. Under the impression he would be spared and Erika would be evicted, Janelle was disappointed to see Marcellas get evicted. Immediately following Marcellas' eviction, the Houseguests learned that another of them would be leaving the following night. Chicken George won the Head of Household competition and chose to nominate Erika and James. When James won the Veto and used it, George put up another of Janelle's allies, Howie. He was evicted over Erika. Was on current season.

On Week 7, the HoH competition was won by Mike "Boogie," who chose to nominate James and Janelle. Janelle won the Veto competition yet again, saving herself from eviction for the second time this season. James was evicted on Day 53 by a 3-1 vote.

On Week 8, Erika became Head of Household for the first time this season. The following day, Erika nominated Janelle and George for eviction, stating that her intention was to get Janelle out.  Janelle went on to win her fourth Veto of the season the following day, however, and took herself off the block. She wasreplaced with Danielle. On Day 60, Danielle was evicted by a 3-0 vote. Also on day 60, Janelle won her fourth HoH of the season and nominated George and Erika. Immediately following her nominations, the Veto competition took place, and Erika won the Veto, saving herself. . Janelle replaced Erika with Mike "Boogie". On Day 60, by a vote of 2-0, Chicken George was evicted from the Big Brother: All-Stars house.

On Week 9, Mike "Boogie" won the Head of Household competition, nominating Erika and Janelle. On Day 62, Janelle won yet another Veto competition, once again saving herself from possible eviction. With only Will left to fill Janelle's spot, Mike was forced to nominate his Chill Town ally. As the sole voter, Janelle was all set up to evict Erika, as Will had done his best to influence her like usual. Some conversation with Erika, however, lead to the revelation that both women had been told they were part of Chill Town. Feeling as though she'd been played, Janelle voted to evict Will, leaving the final three as her, Mike "Boogie," and Erika.  This unlikely trio were the participants in one of the most bizarre moments in Big Brother history.

The final Head of Household competition was set up in the traditional three-round format, with the first round again being an endurance competition. Contestants stood on pegs on the side of an improvised mountain, grasping with both hands keys placed above their heads.  It promised to be an hours long ordeal, but immediately upon the start of the competition Mike, somewhat cryptically invoking the name of ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' contestant [[Richard Hatch (Survivor contestant)|Richard Hatch]], intentionally abandoned his post, stating aloud his belief that even if he were not to win Head of Household he was assured a spot in the finals as both women would rather face him than each other.

Mike's unexpected actions and bizarre words further discombobulated an already confused Janelle, who never seemed entirely certain of the rules. Straining to see and comprehend what he had done, she accidentally, barely but perceivably removed one of her hands from her key.  Julie Chen had no choice but to announce her elimination, leaving Erika as the winner of an endurance competition that lasted less than five minutes.  In the second round, titled "Fly by Night" and involving firing simulated lasers while suspended from ropes attached to harnesses, Mike defeated Janelle, advancing him to the round 3. He beat out Erika in a question and answer competition to clinch the last Head of Household competition, and he chose to evict Janelle.

Janelle set or tied a great variety of records this season. Julie Chen announced (on Janelle's eviction night) that Janelle had won the most competitions in a single and double season of any BB series. She won a total of 4 Head of Household competitions, 5 Power of Veto competitions and 2 America's choice, in this season alone, tying the record for most Head of Household wins set by [[Drew Daniel]], and setting records for most Veto wins (since tied by Daniele Donato)  and most America's Choice wins in one season. In season 6 she had won 2 Head of Households, 2 vetos and 2 America's Choice. In total (from both seasons), she had won 17 competitions, excluding the luxury prizes she had won in season six.

On finale night, Janelle was announced as the winner of the last-second America's Choice prize. She walked away with $25,000.00.

==Jase==
'''Jason "Jase" Wirey''' was originally a contestant on [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|Big Brother 5]]. It has been a common misconception that his name was Zach but On Big Brother Happy Hour with Chelsia and Missy, he revealed that his name was not actually Zach but just short for Jason. Because of his over-the-top, rambunctious nature, Jase was not well received by viewers or HouseGuests during that season. He was difficult to eliminate, however, as he was quite a competitor for Veto Challenges. This sparked Nakomis' infamous "Six-Finger Plan," a method of removing someone that leaves them defenseless. This is commonly referred to as "backdooring."

At the Veto, however, Chicken George saved himself, and, after some deliberation, James agreed to target Jase instead. Jase was not too happy about the turn of events, as he hated the idea of being "backdoored" again (though, in this case, it wasn't originally a planned backdooring). After a controversial outburst in the backyard, several HouseGuests felt much animosity toward Jase. Particularly, Marcellas and Jase had a confrontation that proceeded inside the house as well. Despite his efforts, he was indeed nominated in George's place. Though he hated the method of his elimination, Jase was evicted unanimously (9-0) in Week 3. He requested that only Diane and Danielle escort him to the door. Also he has been on an episode of the TV show [[The 5th Wheel]] which airs on [[Fox Reality]].

==Kaysar==
{{Main|Kaysar Ridha}}
'''Kaysar Ridha''' (born August 10, 1980), 37, was a Houseguest on Season 6 of ''Big Brother''. He was the first Muslim-American in the Big Brother house, as well as being of Iraqi descent. While this did possibly lead to his nomination on Week 1, he was not evicted. He went on to evict the leader of the house's majority alliance, gathering a group of under-dogs and forming "The Sovereign Six." He was evicted the following week when the opposing alliance came into power. In a twist, Kaysar was voted back into the House with 82% of America's votes. That same week, he allowed a member of the opposing alliance to become Head of Household and was evicted again. Kaysar is one of five contestants to ever re-enter the Big Brother house in one season, the others being [[Amy Crews]] from [[Big Brother 3 (U.S.)|Season 3]], Sharon Obermueller and "Crazy" James Zinkand from [[Big Brother 9 (U.S.)|Season 9]], and Brendon Villegas from [[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|Season 13]]. Kaysar became one of the most popular Houseguests in Big Brother US History, along with Janelle. At one point, he held a 93% popularity rating, thus becoming Big Brother's most popular male houseguest of all time.

Kaysar was voted into the ''Big Brother 7'' House, where he was immediately perceived as arrogant by Mike "Boogie" Malin and Will Kirby. As one of four contestants from ''[[Big Brother 6 (U.S.)|Big Brother 6]]'' to enter the All-Star house, Kaysar's alliance had an immediate target. On Week 2, Kaysar became Head of Household and he chose to nominate "floaters" Nakomis and Diane. Throughout the show he has been closely linked to Erika, though this is likely to have been through editing especially as Kaysar's Muslim beliefs prevent him from dating. (Erika has since claimed to be romantically linked to Mike "Boogie," even before the game and claimed Kaysar was her best friend in the house.) With Big Brother 6 alumni constantly becoming HoH in the first four weeks, Kaysar didn't have to worry about facing nomination early on. On Week 5, however, Kaysar was nominated during the veto ceremony after Janelle used the veto on herself and was evicted by a vote of five to one (Janelle's vote being nullified). Coincidentally, he left the house on his 26th birthday. Kaysar is the only one to have come back in both his seasons and to have been evicted 4 times in 12 months

==Marcellas==
{{Main|Marcellas Reynolds}}
'''Marcellas Reynolds''' , 47, was a houseguest from ''Big Brother 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/bigbrother3/houseguests/marcellas/index.shtml|title=Marcellas|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During week 2 Marcellas won HoH. He nominated house guests Josh Fineberg and Tonya Paoni, resulting in the eviction of Tonya. Marcellas won his 2nd HoH during week 8. He nominated house guests Amy Crews and Roddy Mancuso, resulting in the eviction of Roddy. During week 9 Marcellas was nominated for eviction by HoH Jason Guy. Subsequently Marcellas won the first ever Golden Power of Veto competition. During the Veto Ceremony Marcellas failed to use the Golden Power of Veto on himself and was evicted. Because of this move, host Julie Chen jokingly slapped him on the head during his exit interview. He was evicted on day 69.

He hosted ''[[House Calls: The Big Brother Talk Show]]'' with Gretchen Massey during ''Big Brother 5'' and ''6''. However, due to his participation in the All-Stars edition, he was unable to host the 3rd season.

A producers pick for Season 7, during Week 6, Marcellas was nominated by HoH Janelle when her original nominee, Danielle, used the Veto. Marcellas was evicted from the Big Brother house on day 46 and became the first member of the Big Brother jury. At the Big Brother 7 finale Marcellas cast the lone vote for fellow house guest Erika Landin.

==Mike==
{{Main|Mike Malin (Big Brother)}}
'''Michael Robert "Mike" "Boogie" Malin''' (born July 16, 1970), 47, was a Houseguest of Big Brother 2, one of the components of the infamous alliance "Chill Town." Having been eligible to enter the house, Mike claimed that he had plans for taking out his old ally as well as friend and business partner Will Kirby. However, this may have just been talk to improve his chances of entering the house.

Upon entering the house, however, he once again aligned himself heavily with Will, and the two re-established the "Chill Town" alliance. This seemingly created a target for the two, but they both were shocked several times not to be nominated. There has been speculation around the internet that Mike was only chosen because Will refused to participate without his buddy from Season 2. This belief was supported by an admission on the live feeds in the HOH by Will to James and Kaysar that he refused to participate unless Boogie was on the show. The producers cut the live feed soon after this statement. The topic was even discussed on CBS' [[House Calls: The Big Brother Talk Show|House Calls]], on which he is constantly referred to as "Booger." Mike Boogie was nominated on Week 4 by Head of Household Janelle, alongside Erika. He won the Power of Veto that week, however, earning him the ability to rescue himself. Mike used the Veto and Diane took his place. He and Will formed an alliance with Danielle and Season Six houseguest James- who had felt betrayed by his previous alliance. They referred to this alliance as the "Legion of Doom" but Danielle felt angry at her allies last week when they didn't try in the veto competition- letting Janelle win it. Mike and Will have also formed an alliance with remaining Sovereigns Janelle and Howie despite having declared early intention to see the two evicted. The four called this alliance "The Perfect Storm". He also has an alliance with Erika- who is he rumored to have been romantically involved with before the show began and has recently been making out with inside the house. He is working to save one of his allies Erika in favor of evicting Marcellas who he has referred to as a "cancer". At the end of Week 6, Mike was informed that he had won the new power of Coup D'État, which gives him the right to overthrow the Head of Household on the live eviction night and replace their nominees with any two people he chooses, excluding the Head of Household and the Veto holder. Week 7 was a double-eviction week.  Feeling betrayed by "Chill Town," evicted houseguest Howie confronted Mike on his way out the door, going as far as to throw the hat Mike was wearing across the room. Mike won the second HoH of the week. He chose to nominate Janelle and James, with the intention of evicting James. His wish was granted when Janelle won the Power of Veto and James was voted out 3-1.

 
At the final four, Mike won his second Head of Household of the season and nominated Janelle and Erika. Janelle won the Power of Veto again and the only remaining choice for Mike to nominate was his friend Will. Mike was shocked and saddened when Janelle decided to evict Will over Erika. He threw part one of the final HOH competition telling Julie Chen to remember Richard Hatch (this in reference to ''[[Survivor: Borneo]]'' when Richard Hatch threw the final [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] challenge as both of the other players would have to take him to have any shot at winning). He faced off against Janelle in part two of the Head of Household competition and defeated her.  He also won the final part of the HOH against Erika.  As HOH, he decided to evict Janelle, making Erika his opponent in the jury vote.  He won Big Brother All Stars by a vote of 6-1.

==Nakomis==
'''Jennifer Jeannene "Nakomis" Dedmon''' (born April 25, 1983), 35, better known as "Nakomis," made her Big Brother debut on Season 5. During Big Brother 5, Nakomis gained much recognition for a variety of things. One of the biggest twists of her season was her previously unknown connection to half-brother Michael "Cowboy" Ellis. While the two were happy to discover one another, they became parts of opposing alliances, and Cowboy went on to evict her. Nakomis was the inventor of the infamous "Six-Finger Plan," a method of easily evicting a player.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.realitytvhalloffame.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&amp;article=article1016.art&amp;page=1 Six Finger Plan]"&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was used to evict Jase, another houseguest on Big Brother 7. He derided Nakomis and her methods of eviction during the season.

Nakomis garnered enough of America's votes to participate in ''Big Brother All-Stars''. Upon entering the house, Nakomis said that she was surrounded with beautiful people and that she was not a "girly-girl." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.com/primetime/bigbrother7/show/wk01/thu01.shtml Episode 1, Page 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; During Week 2, Nakomis was nominated for eviction by Kaysar, who claimed to have nominated her because she is very intelligent, as well as claiming to have intended to nominate "floaters" in the game. On Day 18, Nakomis became the second houseguest to be evicted from the Big Brother: All Stars house. Only Janelle and Will chose not to vote against Nakomis, opting instead to vote for nominee Diane.

==Will==
'''William "Will" Terence Kirby''' (born January 2, 1973), 45, (sometimes called "Dr. Will" and Dr. Delicious and The Puppet Master) was the winner of Big Brother 2. He was the only winner to enter the All-Star house, a fact he believed to be a definite disadvantage. Will is nearly universally known for his extremely deceptive gameplay, creating a complex web of bogus alliances that helped him reach the Final Two.

With such a devious reputation preceding him, as well as his position as the only Big Brother Champ in the All-Star house, Will very much expected to be nominated on Week 1. To his great shock, he wasn't nominated, and he found this offensive. It's quite possible that this is merely Will's dry sense of humor. It should be noted, however, that Will has complained about needing to return home - as his career and relationship may suffer from sequester. Will ran into early conflicts with Howie, as the two thrived on exchanging insults. On Week 3, James nominated Will for eviction, alongside Chicken George. George won the Veto, but still gave Will the opportunity to speak. Will used this opportunity to explain to the Houseguests that he was having trouble thriving in the game because he could not find one of them he hated more than the other, as he hated them all so much. He claimed that, if he were not evicted, he would throw food challenges, Head of Household challenges, and Power of Veto challenges until he was. Ironically enough, Jase, the replacement nominee for George, was evicted instead of Will. Will had been perceived as fairly crazy in the house, having done such things as putting on a puppet show in the bathtub - his interpretation of the game thus far. Will was linked with Mike "Boogie" Malin, also an alumnus of Big Brother 2, as well as their original alliance, "Chill Town." The two managed to make several connections in the house. Despite mentioning the desire to evict Chill Town, the Season Six alliance never chose to do so despite winning the first four HOH competitions. This is largely credited to a web of bogus deals created by Chill Town and Will's claim of wanting to go home before sequester and that he would voluntarily leave the week before sequester point. The game reached beyond that point however before Will was evicted. Late in the season, Will seemed to acquire much influence over Janelle, a fortunate truth for him, as she had proven quite versatile in HoH competitions. He was largely responsible for Marcellas' eviction, as well as that of Diane in earlier weeks. Will was placed on the hotseat by Mike, having no other options after Janelle used the veto on herself. Will was evicted out of the house by Janelle on Day 65. Will was redeemed though when his friend Mike Boogie won the final Head of Household and chose to evict Janelle. Will, along with Janelle, Chicken George, Danielle, James, and Howie voted for Will's friend and Chilltown ally Mike Boogie, giving him a 6-1 victory over Erika. Dr. Will is considered as one of the greatest players of all time.

[[File:President's Guest House.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|The [[President's Guest House]], commonly known as [[Blair House]] has been the official guest house of visiting dignitaries in [[Washington D.C.]] since 1824]]

'''International trips made by the [[head of state|heads of state]] and [[head of government|heads of government]] to the [[United States]]''' have become a valuable part of American diplomacy and international relations since such trips were first made in the mid-19th century. They are complicated undertakings that require months of planning along with a great deal of coordination and communication. They also involve much ceremony and fuss.

The first international visit to the United States was made by [[King of Hawaii|King]] [[Kalakaua]] of [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]] in 1874, which was the first visit by a foreign chief of state or head of government.&lt;ref name=prestravelg2g/&gt;

The first European head of state to visit the United States was [[Prince Albert I of Monaco]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=prestravelg1g/&gt;

The first Asian head of state to visit the United States was [[King of Thailand|King]] [[Prajadhipok]] of [[Siam]] in 1931.&lt;ref name=prestravelg3g/&gt;

The first African head of state to visit the United States was [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Edwin Barclay]] of [[Liberia]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=prestravelg4g/&gt;

The first South American head of state to visit the United States was [[Emperor of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] of [[Brazilian empire|Brazil]] in 1876.&lt;ref name=prestravelg5g/&gt;

{{Angola state}}
This is a list of the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] known commonly as the [[Manikongo]]s (KiKongo: Mwenekongo). Mwene (plural: Awene) in Kikongo meant a person holding authority, particularly judicial authority, derived from the root -wene which meant, by the sixteenth century at least, territory over which jurisdiction was held.  The ruler of Kongo was the most powerful mwene in the region who the Portuguese regarded as the king (in Kikongo ''ntinu'' king upon their arrival in 1483.

==Kandas, Gerações and Houses==
The kingdom of Kongo had a formal state apparatus, in which most positions (''rendas'' in Portuguese-language documents, meaning income bearing positions) were in the hands of the king, and the king himself was elected by powerful officials.  Kings sought and held office with the assistance of a [[kanda (lineage)|kanda]]. Each kanda (plural: ''makanda'') was a faction which organized people according to a common goal, often but not always rooted in a kin-based relationship.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton, "Elite Women in the Kingdom of Kongo: Historical Perspectives on Women's Political Power", ''Journal of African History'' 47 (2006): 439.&lt;/ref&gt; Kandas generally took the name of a person (i.e. Nimi, Nlaza or Mpanzu), but could also take the name of a location or title such as Mbala (court)&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John: "Elite Women" p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;) or birthplace (Kwilu or Nsundi&lt;ref&gt;Thornton "Elite Women," p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;).  The Kikongo prefix "ki" is added onto these names to mean "people with something in common".&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, "Elite Women", p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt; These factions were recorded as ''gerações'' or ''casas'' (lineages or houses) in Kongo documents written in Portuguese.  Until the mid-seventeenth century, following the [[Battle of Mbwila]], these factions were short lived and fluctuating, but following the battle, factions were much firmer and lasted for generations, particularly the Kimpanzu and Kinlaza.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton "Elite Women ", p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quilombo dos Palmares]] a Maroom Kingdom formed in Northeast Brazil. Was founded by Princes and Nobles who were enslaved and transported to Portuguese Brazil after the Battle. There they retained their titles and their lineage survived even after the kingdom itself was destroyed.

==Dynasties==
When the Portuguese arrived in Kongo in 1483,&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Roland and Anthony Atmore: ''Medieval Africa, 1250–1800'' (Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2001 p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; the reigning king represented the Nimi kanda.&lt;ref&gt;"Elite Women", p 445.&lt;/ref&gt; This kanda was probably descended from Nimi a Nzima, father of the founder of Kongo.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton,"Elite Women", p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt; Divisions emerged within the kanda during succession disputes, for example, following the death of Afonso I in 1542, his son Pedro I and grandson Diogo I formed two opposed factions, that of Pedro was called the Kibala (court) faction, and the other, whose name is unknown that followed Diogo.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, "Elite Women", p.&lt;/ref&gt; Other elections in the sixteenth century probably also involved similar factions, though the details are unknown.	

King Álvaro I was the first king of the [[Kwilu dynasty|House of Kwilu]] (Portuguese: ''Coulo''). This kanda or lineage was named for the birthplace of Álvaro,&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton, ''The Kingdom of Kongo: Civil War and Transition, 1641–1718'' (Madison:  University of Wisconsin Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; north of the capital city. The Kwilu reigned until 1614 when Antonio da Silva, Duke of Mbamba intervened to place Bernardo I on the throne, in place of Álvaro II's minor son, who would eventually take office as Álvaro III.	

Another kanda, the House of Nsundi, later known as the [[Kinkanga a Mvika]], took control of Kongo in 1622 under Pedro II, and retained it through the reign of his son, Garcia I.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, ''Kingdom of Kongo'', p. 449-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Garcia never held power strongly, and the Kimpanzu returned to power under Ambrosio I.  Kimpanzu domination ended in 1641 when two brothers Álvaro and Garcia of the new House of Kinlaza overthrew Álvaro V and took power.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, ''Kingdom of Kongo''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The members of the Kikanga a Mvika were all killed or absorbed into the Kinlaza by 1657.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John K: "The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684–1706", page 39. Cambridge University, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinlaza dynasty would reign until Kongo's catastrophic civil war following the 1665 [[Battle of Mbwila]], when sporadic and violent alternation followed.

The capital was destroyed in 1678.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John K: "The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684–1706", page 23. Cambridge University, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Its destruction forced the claimants from both sides of the conflict to rule from mountain fortresses. The Kinlaza retreated to Mbula where they founded the capital of Lemba.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John K: "The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684–1706", page 39. Cambridge University, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier another branch of Kinlaza, under the leadership of [[Garcia III of Kongo]] founded a settlement at Kibangu. The Kimpanzu based their struggle for the throne at Mbamba Luvota in the south of Soyo.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John K: "The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684–1706", page 39. Cambridge University, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A new faction appeared in the form of the [[Água Rosada]] kanda, headquarteredd at the mountain fortress of Kibangu. This might be considered a new house formed from both the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu, its founders were the children of a Kimpanzu father and a Kinlaza mother.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John K: "The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684–1706", page 40. Cambridge University, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; All parties claimed kingship over Kongo (or what was left of it), but their power rarely spread outside their fortresses or the immediate surrounding area.

The country was finally reunited by [[Pedro IV of Kongo|Pedro IV]] of the [[Água Rosada]] kanda. Pedro IV declared a doctrine of shared power by which the throne would shift (in due time) from Kinlaza to the Kimpanzu and back.,&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John: "Elite Women in the Kingdom of Kongo: Historical Perspectives on Women's Political Power", page 455. The Journal of African History, Vol. 47, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; while the Água Rosada appear to have continued as neutral in Pedro's fortress of Kibangu.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John K: "The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684–1706", page 201. Cambridge University, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The system functioned sporadically, with considerable fighting, until 1764 when José I of the Kinlaza faction usurped the throne and thrust the country back into civil war.  The Kinlaza enjoyed a short lived second dynasty that ended in 1788.  After that, the throne moved through various royal hands until the kingship was extinguished in 1914.

==Elections==
The selection of kings of Kongo was by a variety of principles, as kings themselves evoked different methods of selection in their letters announcing their succession.  Typically the kingdom was said to pass by election,&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John: "Elite Women in the Kingdom of Kongo: Historical Perspectives on Women's Political Power", page 439. The Journal of African History, Vol. 47, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; though the electors and the process they used changed over time and according to circumstances.  Frequently election seems to have been a combination of elective and hereditary principals.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John: "Elite Women in the Kingdom of Kongo: Historical Perspectives on Women's Political Power", page 439. The Journal of African History, Vol. 47, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kings of Kongo==

==Further reading==
This list is constructed primarily from that found in Graziano Saccardo, '''Congo e Angola con la storia dell'antica missione dei cappuccini'' (3 vols, Milan, 1982–83), vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–14.  Saccardo bases his reconstruction on several kinglists produced over time, by António da Silva, Duke of Mbamba in 1617, by António de Teruel in 1664, by Pedro Mendes in 1710 and by Francisco das Necessidades in 1844.  In addition many of the kings wrote letters and signed them with both their names and their numbers, and Saccardo has found many of these to verify the kinglists.

Saccardo's king list has been modified in the following manner:  the Kikongo names of the kings have been given in a Kikongo form following norms established in Joseph de Munck, ''Kinkulu kia Nsi eto''' (Tumba, 1956, 2nd ed, Matadi, 1971). The Christian names of the kings are given in modern Portuguese spelling. In addition Saccardo's entries have been updated by a number of sources, most notably the kinglist, unknown to him found in the Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Brasileiro (Rio de Janeiro) Manuscritos, Lata 6, pasta 2. "Catallogo dos reis de Congo" MS of c. 1758.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5735">'''Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi''' was a name used by Roman men of the ''[[Calpurnia (gens)|gens Calpurnia]]'' during the [[Roman Republic]] and early [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. They were descendants of the [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi]] who was [[Roman consul|consul]] in 133 BC and who established the addition of ''Frugi'' as an ''[[agnomen]]'' that was passed down through the family.&lt;ref&gt;Anna A. Novokhatko, ''The Invectives of Sallust and Cicero'' (de Gruyter, 2009), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Calpurnii Pisones]] who distinguished themselves by the name ''Frugi'' were one of three main branches of [[Piso]]nes active from the mid-2nd century BC into the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;The other two were the [[Pisones Caesonini]] descended from the [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 148 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso]] who was consul in 148 BC, and the branch descended from [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso (consul 139 BC)|Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], the consul of 139 BC; [[Edward Champlin]], "The Life and Times of Calpurnius Piso," ''Museum Helveticum'' 46 (1989), pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were four unbroken generations who kept the name ''Frugi'', but the nomenclature of the family line is complicated by [[adoption in ancient Rome|adoption in adulthood]], a practice of elite Roman families to preserve their heritage, religious traditions ''([[sacra gentilicia]])'', influence and property. One member of this family line (who became the praetor of 112 BC)  had been adopted by a Marcus Pupius, and also used the name Marcus Pupius combined with Piso Frugi. His name was rendered [[Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus]]. The name ''Frugi'' was used for three more generations, in one case again kept by an adoptee. A fifth-generation descendant of the praetor adopted by M. Pupius went back to using the original form Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, along with ''Licinianus'' in reference to a grandfather's adopted name.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wilson, ''The Meaning of Naming: A Social and Cultural History of Personal Naming in Western Europe'' (UCL Press, 1998), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republican era==
* '''Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi''', a [[praetor]] in [[Hispania Ulterior]], a region of [[Roman Spain]], who had assumed [[Gaius Marius|Marius]]'s command in 113 or 112 BC. He was killed in battle and succeeded in 111 by [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 108 BC)|Galba, the consul of 108]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[In Verrem]]'' 2.4.56; [[Appian]], ''Iberian Wars'' 99; [[T.R.S. Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (American Philological Association, 1951, 1986), vol. 1, pp. 538 and 539 (note 4).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi''', a ''[[monetalis]]'' around 90 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; As praetor in 74, he vetoed many of the edicts issued by his colleague [[Verres]], who was famously attacked by [[Cicero]] in the speeches known as the [[In Verrem|Verrines]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''In Verrem'' 2.1.119 and 4.56; [[Asconius|Pseudo-Asconius]] 250 in the edition of [[Thomas Stangl|Stangl]]; Broughton, ''MRR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi''' was [[tribune of the plebs]] in 90 BC, or less likely 89, and may be identical with the praetor of 74.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (American Philological Association, 1986), vol. 3, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian [[Sisenna]],&lt;ref&gt;Sisenna, frgs. 17 and 120 in the edition of Peter, as cited by Broughton, ''MRR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; his legislation as tribune proposed adding two new [[Voting tribes of ancient Rome|voting tribes]] and granting [[Roman citizenship]] to soldiers who demonstrated exceptional valor.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, ''MRR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Syme]] thought him more likely to be a Caesoninus than a Frugi, and a son of the consul of 112.&lt;ref&gt;Syme as cited by Broughton, ''MRR&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The question depends in part on the identity of the Lucius Piso who was a general (''[[strategos]]'' in the Greek source) in [[Roman Asia|Asia]], whose activity has been dated variously from shortly before 90 to as late as 83.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, ''MRR&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial era==
* '''Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi Pontifex''', the consul of 15 BC also known as [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 15 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], one of the men proposed as the owner of the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref&gt;David Sider, ''The Library of the Villa Dei Papiri at Herculaneum'' (Getty Publications, 2007), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Licinianus|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi Licinianus]]''' (38–69 AD), the son of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi]]; he was [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted in adulthood]] by the emperor [[Galba]] as his successor and killed the same month.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Vagi, ''Coinage and History of the Roman Empire'' (Fitzroy Dearborn, 1990, 2000), vol. 1, p. 179; Colin Wells, ''The Roman Empire'' (Harvard University Press, 1984, 1992), pp. 68, 156; Donna W.

* '''[[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (usurper)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi]]''', named in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' as one of the [[Gallienus usurpers|usurpers]] of [[Gallienus]] during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]; his [[historicity]] is in doubt.

'''Matthew Manning''' (born August 17, 1955) is a best selling British author and healer, alleged to have [[psychic]] abilities. As a child he and his family were allegedly subjected to a range of [[poltergeist]] disturbances in their [[Cambridge]] home and later at [[Oakham School]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Roger (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 110. {{ISBN|0-7864-2770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Manning works as a [[Energy medicine|psychic healer]] and lecturer.&lt;ref name=DailyMail/&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Key bent by Matthew Manning.jpg|thumb|Key claimed to have been bent psychokinetically by Manning]]

In the 1960s, it was alleged that Manning was the focus of [[poltergeist]] activity. He started performing [[Automatic writing|automatic drawing and writings]]. Covering his bedroom walls appeared over six hundred signatures spanning six centuries.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2015"&gt;
[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2015). [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/poltergeist_scribbler_the_bizarre_case_of_matthew_manning "Poltergeist Scribbler: The Bizarre Case of Matthew Manning"]. Skeptical Inquirer. Retrieved 30 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted at the time that Manning had been researching history as part of his school work. According to [[Joe Nickell]] who made an in-depth study of Manning's writings, they contain internal inconsistencies and the "signatures" are completely inaccurate for historical individuals. Nickell concluded that Manning has "traits associated with a fantasy-prone personality" and there is no evidence he possesses genuine paranormal powers.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2015"/&gt;

Regarding his automatic drawings. He claimed to draw in the styles of many famous artists including [[Pablo Picasso]]. Manning told ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' that an art expert at [[Sotheby's]] in London had thought one of his Picasso copies so good it might be mistaken for an original. The skeptic [[James Randi]] investigated this claim by writing to the gallery. A Sotheby’s official replied that the claim was "absolutely not true" as they were forgeries of existing works.&lt;ref name="Gordon1988"&gt;[[Henry Gordon (magician)|Gordon, Henry]]. (1988). ''Extrasensory Deception: ESP, Psychics, Shirley MacLaine, Ghosts, UFOs''. Macmillan of Canada. pp. 101-102. {{ISBN|0-7715-9539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning told the ''[[Daily Mirror|London Daily Mirror]]'' his drawing of a monkey had caused "great excitement" because it was strikingly similar to an original by [[Jan Savery]] that the [[Rijksmuseum]] kept locked away from public display in a vault. This was also investigated by Randi who wrote a letter to the museum and it was discovered the claim was false as the original was on display to the public, not locked up in a vault.&lt;ref name="Gordon1988"/&gt;

Manning was also tested for [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities by parapsychologist [[William G. Braud]] of the [[Mind Science Foundation]] in the late 1970s, with results that, according to Braud and coauthors in a psychical research paper published in 1979, were better than chance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-320731647/william-g-braud-1942-2012 Questia.com Library Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Renée Haynes|Haynes, Renée]].

Rabbi Dr '''Mordechai Nurock''' ({{lang-he-n|מרדכי נורוק}}, born '''Markus Nurock''' on 7 November 1879, died 8 November 1962) was a [[Latvia]]n-born [[Israel]]i who served in both the parliaments [[Saeima|of Latvia]] and [[Knesset|Israel]]. He was also Israel's first [[Communications Minister of Israel|Minister of Postal Services]] (a post today known as the Minister of Communications), though he only held the post for just under two months.

==Biography==
Nurock was born in [[Tukums]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (today in [[Latvia]]). His father was the rabbi of Tukums and [[Jelgava]]. Nurock studied under his father and was ordained as a rabbi. After finishing high school, he attended universities in Russia, [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]], gaining a PhD in philosophy. He replaced his father as rabbi of Jelgava in 1913 before moving to Russia in 1915.

A [[Zionism|Zionist]], he was a delegate at the sixth Zionist Congress in 1903 and helped [[Jew]]ish refugees during [[World War I]]. He also joined the All-Russian Jewish Committee and established a religious Jewish group known as "Tradition and Freedom".

In 1921 he returned to Latvia, by now an independent state. The following year he was [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1922|elected]] to the [[Saeima]], and became the leader of the minorities' bloc. He retained his seat as a member of the [[Mizrachi (Latvia)|Mizrachi]] party until the parliament was dissolved in 1934.

Following Latvia's occupation by the [[Soviet Union]], he was exiled to [[Turkmenistan]] due to his Zionist activities. His wife and two children were killed in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], and Nurock made [[aliyah]] to the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] in 1947. He immediately became involved in politics, joining [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrachi]], and was elected to the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first Knesset]] in 1949 on the [[United Religious Front]] list (an alliance of Mizrachi, [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]], [[Agudat Yisrael]] and [[Poalei Agudat Yisrael]]). Re-elected in 1951, he became the first [[Communications Minister of Israel|Minister of Postal Services]] in [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s [[Third government of Israel|third government]] on 3 November 1952. In December 1952, he stood as a candidate in the [[Israeli presidential election, 1952|presidential election]], held after the death of [[Chaim Weizmann]]. However, he finished second to [[Mapai]]'s [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]]. Later in the month the government collapsed and [[fourth government of Israel|a new government]] excluding Mizrachi ministers was established on 24 December, resulting in Nurock losing his place in the cabinet.

Nurock was re-elected in 1955 (by which time Mizrachi had merged into the [[National Religious Party]]), 1959 and 1961, serving until his death on 8 November 1962. He was replaced by [[Shalom-Avraham Shaki]].

== Early life ==
Naser was born and raised in Doha, Qatar into a musical family, his paternal uncles are all professional musicians. His father is a Jordanian Arab while his mother is a Pakistani [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:gZ1j4Y2aptgJ:stevenpaugh.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/naser-mestarihi.pdf+Naser+Mestarihi+Pakistan&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=au&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj-WWnDrIWZUpe5LlbY5cCqen3Gwr8tJBzcmRal4hkBZ7kKvNuGN47XIObtcN-50UZqqf1zn5Ifx3of_f32zKvsOVgp3hlYBBroW2orQra3hDR4pIuusQaTaHVqLBLxX5XkFH3G&amp;sig=AHIEtbS4uSO2N_D_0WYdbZWtTTpIpklnKA Naser Mestahiri: Up close and personal]&lt;/ref&gt; He states that his introduction to music came through his parents who gave him his first rock albums. He also states that the album that inspired him to pursue a career in music was [[Guns N' Roses]] debut album [[Appetite for Destruction]]. Although not formally trained, his mother enrolled him in a music school, however due to his lack of interest in the material being taught, Naser quit and began teaching himself the guitar.&lt;ref name="surlaterre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="qt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstoneme"/&gt;

== Career ==
Naser began performing live at the age of 17. He had minor international exposure two years later when he was featured on a [[Danmarks Radio]] documentary in 2006 which was broadcast in [[Denmark]] and Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="surlaterre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gulfnews"&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/arts-entertainment/music/naser-mestarihi-rock-hard-play-harder-1.763159 Bagsair, Lubna. "Naser Mestarihi: Rock hard, play harder." ''Gulf News'' February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Naser began his solo career in 2007 performing a handful of shows in the [[United Arab Emirates]] as a solo artist and a sessioning for bands. Some of his first notable shows included performing at the  [[United States Military]] Base Camp As Siliyah in his hometown of Doha, where he performed on the 4 and 5 July to mark the U.S. [[Independence Day]] celebrations with several other local bands. He also made his radio debut around this time on Qatar’s QBS Radio. This was followed by the launch of his first solo single "Salvation" in September 2009 on the station.&lt;ref name="surlaterre"/&gt;

He began recording his debut EP in December 2009, although the album was set to be released between March and June 2010 it was marred by several delays due to production setbacks. The self-titled ''[[Naser Mestarihi EP]]'' was eventually released on 31 December 2010, making it the first official rock record ever to be released out of Qatar. Although the album did not yield any commercial success it received critical acclaim from magazines including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Middle East who hailed it as "A huge sounding impressive debut" and ''[[Sur la Terre]]'' magazine who gave it 4/5 pearls. The EP was released on [[iTunes]] and several online outlets.&lt;ref name="surlaterre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="review"&gt;[http://surlaterre-me.com/issues/slt13doha.html "Naser Mestarihi EP Review – A local boy makes good... by rocking our faces off!"

He is sometimes referred to as a prince, and an heir to the Hawaiian monarchy although he himself admits there is no official recognition and such titles are merely honorific.&lt;ref name="ComebackHA2006"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brannon |first= Johnny |title= Kawananakoa eager for comeback |date= September 12, 2006 |newspaper= The Honolulu Advertiser |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Sep/12/ln/FP609120386.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an heir to the [[James Campbell (industrialist)|James Campbell]] estate.

==Early years==
Kawānanakoa was born September 28, 1961. He was the second son of his father [[Edward A. Kawānanakoa]] and his mother Carolyn Willison Kawānanakoa. He was raised in [[Honolulu]] where he graduated from [[Punahou School]]. Kawānanakoa went on to study at the [[University of Southern California]]. He returned to [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] and graduated from the [[William S. Richardson School of Law]]. Upon obtaining his law degree, he served in private practice at the law firm Case, Bigelow &amp; Lombardi until 2000.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Political life==
In 1994, Kawānanakoa followed in his ancestors' footsteps and got involved in politics. Like his great-grandmother [[Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa]] and great uncle [[Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole|Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana{{okina}}ole]], Kawānanakoa joined the [[Republican Party of Hawaii]] for its pro-business stance. He ran and won an election for the Hawai`i State House of Representatives, an office he served through 1998. He rose through the ranks of party leadership becoming minority floor leader. During an attempt to mount a challenge for the Congressional seat held by [[Neil Abercrombie]], Kawānanakoa abruptly retired from active political life after being hospitalized.

In April 2006, after eight years out of the public eye, Kawānanakoa announced his run for the Congressional seat held by [[Ed Case]], who chose not to run for [[U.S. Senate]]. He declared his candidacy on April 23, 2006.&lt;ref name="ComebackHA2006"/&gt;  In the primary elections held on September 24, 2006, Kawānanakoa was defeated by State Senator [[Bob Hogue|Robert Hogue]]. The final vote total was Hogue: 8,393 votes (45.6%) vs. Kawānanakoa: 8,194 votes (44.5%). Senator Hogue went on to lose to [[Mazie Hirono]].

In 2008 Kawānanakoa unsuccessfully ran for the [[Hawaii House of Representatives|Hawaii State House of Representatives]]. His opponent in the November 4, 2008, election was Democrat Chris Kalani Lee. Lee won with 5,885 votes to Kawānanakoa's 3,374 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/elections/results/2008/general/files/histatewide.pdf | year =2008 | title = General Election Results|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=Office of Elections, State of Hawaii | format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In September 1995, Kawānanakoa married Elizabeth Broun, a native of [[Barbados]]. Their first child, Kincaid Kawānanakoa, was born on 16 June 1997 in Honolulu. In December 1999, the Kawānanakoas announced the birth of their second child, Riley Kawānanakoa, in Honolulu.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Richard Dadd''' (1 August 1817 – 7 January 1886) was an English painter of the [[Victorian era]], noted for his depictions of [[fairies]] and other supernatural subjects, [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] scenes, and enigmatic [[genre works|genre]] scenes, rendered with obsessively minuscule detail. Most of the works for which he is best known were created while he was a patient in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bethlem]] and [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]] hospitals.

==Early life==
Dadd was born at [[Chatham, Kent]], England, the son of a chemist. He was educated at [[King's School, Rochester]] where his aptitude for drawing was evident at an early age, leading to his admission to the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] at the age of 20.&lt;ref&gt;Akbar, Arifa, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/richard-dadd-masterpieces-of-the-asylum-2345818.html "Richard Dadd: Masterpieces of the Asylum"], ''The Independent'', 29 August 2011. Retrieved 16 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the medal for life drawing in 1840.&lt;ref name="Souter23"&gt;Souter 2012, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; With [[William Powell Frith]], [[Augustus Egg]], [[Henry Nelson O'Neil|Henry O'Neil]] and others, he founded [[The Clique]], of which he was generally considered the leading talent.&lt;ref&gt;Allderidge 1974, ''Richard Dadd'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also trained at William Dadson's Academy of Art.&lt;ref name="Souter23" /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Richard Dadd - Caravanserai at Mylasa in Asia Minor - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Caravanserai at [[Milas|Mylasa]] in Asia Minor'', 1845, Yale Cantre for British Art]]
Among his best-known early works are the illustrations he produced for ''The Book of British Ballads'' (1842), and a [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] he designed for ''The Kentish Coronal'' (1840).&lt;ref name="Souter23" /&gt;

In July 1842, [[Thomas Phillips (mayor)|Sir Thomas Phillips]], the former mayor of Newport, chose Dadd to accompany him as his draughtsman on an expedition through Europe to [[Greece]], Turkey, [[Southern Syria]] and finally [[Egypt]]. In November of that year they spent a gruelling two weeks in Southern Syria, passing from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jordan]] and returning across the [[Engaddi]] wilderness. Toward the end of December, while travelling up the [[Nile]] by boat, Dadd underwent a dramatic personality change, becoming delusional, increasingly violent, and believing himself to be under the influence of the Egyptian god [[Osiris]]. His condition was initially thought to be [[sunstroke]].&lt;ref name="Allderidge22"&gt;Allderidge 1974, ''Richard Dadd'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental Illness and Hospitalization===
[[Image:Image-Dadd - Fairy Feller's.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke]]'', oil on canvas, 26 inches x 21 inches (1855–64; Tate, London).]]
On his return in the spring of 1843, he was diagnosed to be of unsound mind and was taken by his family to recuperate in the countryside village of [[Cobham, Kent]]. In August of that year, having become convinced that his father was the [[Devil]] in disguise, Dadd killed him with a knife and fled to France.&lt;ref&gt;Allderidge 1974, ''Richard Dadd'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; En route to Paris, Dadd attempted to kill a fellow passenger with a razor but was overpowered and arrested by police. Dadd confessed to killing his father and was returned to England, where he was committed to the criminal department of [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bethlem]] psychiatric hospital (also known as Bedlam). Here and subsequently at the newly created [[Broadmoor Hospital]], Dadd was cared for in an enlightened manner by Drs William Wood, William Orange and Sir W. Charles Hood.&lt;ref&gt;Chaney 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Dadd probably suffered from [[paranoid schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Victorians part 4. Dreams and Nightmares'' BBC One, 8 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his siblings had the condition, while a third had "a private attendant" for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="Allderidge22" /&gt;

In hospital Dadd was encouraged to continue painting, and in 1852 he created a remarkable portrait of one of his doctors, [[Alexander Morison]], which now hangs in the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]. Dadd painted many of his masterpieces in Bethlem and Broadmoor, including ''[[The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke]]'', which he worked on between 1855 and 1864. Dadd was pictured at work on his ''Contradiction: Oberon and Titania'' by the London society photographer Henry Hering. Also dating from the 1850s are the 33 watercolour drawings titled ''Sketches to Illustrate the Passions'', which include ''Grief or Sorrow'', ''Love'', and ''Jealousy'', as well as ''Agony-Raving Madness'' and ''Murder''.&lt;ref&gt;Allderidge 1974, ''Richard Dadd'', pp. 28, 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of his works these are executed on a small scale and feature protagonists whose eyes are fixed in a peculiar, unfocused stare.&lt;ref&gt;Allderidge 1974, ''Richard Dadd'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Dadd also produced many shipping scenes and landscapes during his hospitalization, such as the ethereal 1861 watercolour ''Port Stragglin''. These are executed with a miniaturist's eye for detail which belie the fact that they are products of imagination and memory.&lt;ref&gt;Allderidge 1974, ''Richard Dadd'', pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After 20 years at Bethlem, Dadd was moved to [[Broadmoor Hospital]], a high security facility outside London. Here he remained, painting constantly and receiving infrequent visitors until 7 January 1886, when he died "from an extensive disease of the lungs".&lt;ref&gt;Greysmith 1973, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of his works remain on display at Broadmoor.&lt;ref name="GBRJ"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Winchfield to Crowthorne |series= Great British Railway Journeys |serieslink= Great British Railway Journeys |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03sgrgp |accessdate= 21 January 2014 |network= BBC |date= 21 January 2014 |seriesno= 5 |number= 12 |transcript= |transcripturl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke'' inspired a [[Queen II#The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke|song of the same name]] by the British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Also, the painting is a plot element in ''[[The Witches of Chiswick]]'' by [[Robert Rankin]]. ''[[The Wee Free Men]]'', a &lt;!--discworld--&gt;novel by [[Terry Pratchett]], published in 2003, was partly inspired by it as well. ''The Hum and the Shiver'' by [[Alex Bledsoe]] includes references to a lost version of the painting. The painting and the artist are also referenced in [[Elizabeth Hand]]'s novel ''Mortal Love''.

The British fantasy writer [[Angela Carter]] wrote ''Come unto these Yellow Sands'', a radio-play based on Dadd's life.

The full name of the eccentric character Mr Dick in ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]] is Richard Babley, which echoes the name of Dickens' contemporary Richard Dadd.&lt;ref&gt;2003 Barnes and Noble Classics edition of David Copperfield, with Notes by Radhika Jones.&lt;/ref&gt;
Canadian author [[R. J. Anderson (author)|R.J. Anderson]] acknowledges Dadd as the basis of her fictional painter Alfred Wrenfield, who figures prominently in her young adult fantasy novel ''Knife'' (''[[Faery Rebels]]: Spell Hunter'' in the USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with R.J.

In 1987 a long-lost watercolour by Dadd, ''The Artist's Halt in the Desert'', was discovered by [[Peter Nahum]] on the BBC TV programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]''. Made while the artist was incarcerated, it is based on sketches made during his tour of the Middle East, and shows his party encamped by the [[Dead Sea]], with Dadd at the far right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist's Halt in the Desert by Moonlight|url=http://www.leicestergalleries.com/art-and-antiques/detail/11795|publisher=[[Peter Nahum]] at the Leicester Galleries}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later sold for £100,000 to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Dadd, The Halt in the Desert, a watercolour|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/r/dadd,_the_halt_in_the_desert.aspx|work=Explore/Highlights|publisher=The British Museum|accessdate=February 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228210914/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/r/dadd,_the_halt_in_the_desert.aspx|archivedate=28 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Robert William Felkin''' [[FRSE]] LRCSE LRCP (13 March 1853 – 28 December 1926) was a medical [[missionary]] and explorer, a [[ceremonial magic]]ian and member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], a prolific author on [[Uganda]] and Central Africa, and early [[anthropology|anthropologist]], with an interest in ethno-medicine and [[tropical disease]]s.

He was founder in 1903 of the [[Stella Matutina]], a new Order based on the original Order of the Golden Dawn, with its Hermes Temple in Bristol, UK and, later, [[Whare Ra]] (or more correctly, the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple)&lt;ref name="Anon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Anon |year=2012 |title=The Lantern Volume I (A Wayfaring Man Part I) |publisher=Sub Rosa Press New Zealand |isbn=978-0-473-23184-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Havelock North]], [[New Zealand]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellwood |first=Robert S. |year=1993 |title=Islands of the Dawn: The Story of Alternative Spirituality in New Zealand |location=Honolulu |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=0-8248-1487-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fullest account of his life is found in ''A Wayfaring Man'', a fictionalised biography written by his second wife Harriet and published in serial form between 1936 and 1949.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;

==Early life==
Robert William Felkin was born in [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Nottinghamshire]], on 13 March 1853, the son of Robert Felkin (1828-1899), a [[Nonconformist]] [[lace]] manufacturer.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="census"&gt;[http://www.1881-census.co.uk/ 1881 Census Online]&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, William Felkin (1795-1874), son of a [[Baptist]] minister, remains one of the best known names in the Victorian lace industry and was [[mayor]] of Nottingham in 1851, when he exhibited at the [[Great Exhibition]]. But he overreached, and the business failed disastrously in 1864, when Felkin retired to write standard works on the lace and [[hosiery]] trades.&lt;ref name="Felkin"&gt;[http://www.knittingtogether.co.uk/doc.asp?doc=14050&amp;cat=665 William Felkin]&lt;/ref&gt; His son and partner Robert Felkin Sr settled in [[Wolverhampton]] to take up a position as manager of the home department of [[Mander family|Mander Brothers]], [[varnish]] manufacturers. Robert Jr was educated at [[Wolverhampton Grammar School]], where he met the explorer [[David Livingstone]], who inspired him to become a medical missionary.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DunnCaes"&gt;Dunn, Peter M. (1999) [http://fn.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/80/3/F250 "Robert Felkin MD (1853-1926) and Caesarean delivery in Central Africa (1879)"] in ''Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal'' Edn 1999; 80:F250-F251 (May). Bristol.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical missionary in Africa==
He worked for a period in [[Chemnitz]], Germany, after his schooling, where his uncle Henry Felkin lived, and became fluent in the language.&lt;ref name="Pegg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pegg |first=Patricia |year=1996 |title=A Very Private Heritage: the private papers of Samuel Theodore Mander, 1853-1900 |location=Malvern |publisher=Images Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1876 he began studying medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt; In 1878, as yet unlicensed, he joined a mission led by the [[Church Missionary Society]] to Central Africa. He travelled up the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]], where he met [[General Gordon]], and then on through what was then wild and unmapped country to the [[African Great Lakes]]. Eventually he spent two years in Africa, and became personal physician to King M’tesa, who had previously tried to kill him. In [[Zanzibar]], he actively campaigned against the slave trade.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DunnCaes"/&gt; He published several articles on [[tropical medicine]] and childbirth in [[medical journal]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Medical History'' 3, no. 1, London 1959, cited in [[Ellic Howe]], ''Magicians of the Golden Dawn'', p. 240 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and also wrote ''Uganda and the Egyptian Soudan'' (1882, with Rev.C.T. Wilson), ''Egypt Present and To Come'' (1885), ''Uganda'' (1886), and other African works.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;

In 1881, he returned to Edinburgh when his health deteriorated to complete his medical studies (LRCP, LRCS, Ed, 1884). While still a medical student he became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], a member of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and a corresponding Fellow of the Berlin Anthropological Society.&lt;ref name="DunnCaes"/&gt;

==First marriage and medical practice==
In 1882 Felkin married his first wife, Mary ("Polly"), daughter of Samuel Small [[Mander family|Mander of Wolverhampton]], his father's employer, who had been a friend since childhood, and became a collaborator in both his esoteric work and his work for child welfare. They had a son (Samuel) Denys and a daughter, Ethelwyn (1883-1962), who was to publish on the legacy of the Golden Dawn under the name "Ethel Felkin".&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pegg"/&gt;

In 1884 he studied further in [[Marburg]], acquiring his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] there in 1885. Following this he practiced as a doctor in Edinburgh for some years, returning to Africa and travelling frequently with his wife in Europe.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DunnCaes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARCO"/&gt;

==Theosophy and the Golden Dawn==
Mary and Robert seem to have been introduced to esotericism through a Bible study circle they joined in Edinburgh; other scriptures were discussed, including the ''[[Tao te ching]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', and some members of the group were Theosophists. Robert and Mary joined the [[Theosophical Society]] in Edinburgh in 1886, but found it lacking in terms of ritual, and eventually joined [[John William Brodie-Innes]]' Amen-Ra Temple of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] on 1894-03-12.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;

He continued to write and publish: he edited (with others) a collection of the letters and journals of Mehmet [[Emin Pasha]], whom he had met (translated by Mary), which appeared in 1888, and published ''Hypnotism, or Psycho-Therapeutics'' in 1890.&lt;ref name="Shamda"&gt;[http://hhs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/1/1 Shamdasani, 'Psychotherapy: the invention of a word'] in ''History of the Human Sciences'', 2005,18, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Following a breakdown from strain and overwork he transferred his practice to London in 1896.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;

In 1903 Mary died and Robert reinforced his commitment to both [[Anglican]] Christianity and occultism. He made a retreat at the monastery of the [[Mirfield]] fathers, the [[Community of the Resurrection]], and considered joining the order. Several of the Mirfield fathers had an interest in [[Rosicrucian]] and Golden Dawn [[Christian mysticism]], and regarded Felkin as an eminent figure in that tradition. One of these priests, Father Fitzgerald, would later play a key role in bring Felkin to New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;

Also in 1903, a schism occurred within the Order of the Golden Dawn, when Felkin and Brodie-Innes split from [[A.E. Waite]] to form the magically-inclined Order of the Stella Matutina. The poet [[W.B. Yeats]] joined the Stella Matutina and was a member for 20 years. Felkin’s main temple in London was called Amoun.&lt;ref name="Golden Dawn"&gt;[http://www.hermeticgoldendawn.org/Documents/Bios/GDhistory.htm History of the Golden Dawn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025084318/http://www.hermeticgoldendawn.org/Documents/Bios/GDhistory.htm |date=25 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Sun Masters==
From the time that Felkin assumed leadership of the Stella Matutina, he came increasingly under the influence of the "Sun Masters", the fabled [[Secret Chiefs]] of the Order, and other supposed adepts on the [[astral plane]]. Having these supposed contacts reinforced his position as leader in the order. Around 1908 he also claimed to have contacted an "Arab Teacher" called Ara Ben Shemesh ("Lion Son of the Sun"), one of the "Sons of Fire" inhabiting a Near Eastern "temple in the desert", who had been given special permission to contact and teach Western students.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt; His first contact with Ara Ben Shemesh seems to be recounted in ''A Wayfaring Man'', which describes how a conversation between Felkin and Waite was interrupted by the appearance of a "shadowy presence". Felkin called for Harriet, who was clairvoyant, and she saw "a tall man in Eastern dress, kuftan, galabieh, and turban. He has a smooth olive face, and large dark eyes." Apparently this figure, described in the account as "the Chaldean", was seeking someone to help in uniting Eastern and Western teaching. Upon learning that he "believed in the Lord Jesus Christ", Felkin and Waite agreed to collaborate with him.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;

Another mystical teacher was Sri Parananda, whom Felkin claimed to have first seen materialising out of steam at the [[Bad Pyrmont]] baths in [[Germany]]. This apparition, described as a dark Eastern man with a beard and large black eyes, wearing a flowing robe and a peculiar conical cap, arranged with Felkin to meet him in exactly one month in the lounge of the Carlton Hotel in London. According to Felkin their subsequent meeting in the flesh was the start of a series of conversations that lasted for several years.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;

==Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism==
Felkin was initiated [[Freemasonry]] in Mary Chapel Lodge, Edinburgh, on 8 January 1907, was passed to the [[Fellow Craft]] degree on 12 February and raised to [[Master Mason]] on 26 February. On 11 April that same year he was admitted to the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] (SRIA), Metropolitan College, to which only Master Masons are admitted. The officiating celebrant was Dr. [[William Wynn Westcott|W. Wynn Westcott]], Supreme Magus of that society and co-founder of the Golden Dawn.

According to R. Ellwood, by the time Felkin first visited New Zealand in 1912 he was already a 32° Freemason, one of the highest to visit the country thus far.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt; But according to K. Edney of the New Zealand SRIA, Felkin's interest in Freemasonry was probably slight; he was never Master of the Lodge nor joined the Holy Royal Arch, and it is unlikely that he joined any higher degrees; his motive for joining Freemasonry and the SRIA seems to have been to gain credibility with continental occultists and contact members of the original [[Rosicrucian]] society.&lt;ref name="EdneyCollege"/&gt; [[Secret Chiefs#The Golden Dawn|Anna Sprengel]], a member of this fabled German society of nearly god-like adepts, had allegedly warranted the founding of the Golden Dawn, and Felkin believed that she and her order still existed deep under cover in Germany, along with the tomb of [[Christian Rosencreutz]]. In search of this group he and Harriet travelled to Europe in 1906, 1910 and 1914, and on one of these trips he met with [[Rudolf Steiner]] and claimed to have contacted other [[Rosicrucian]] adepts. Felkin considered Steiner to be an extremely high initiate, and after their meeting incorporated elements of [[Anthroposophy]] into his practice, including [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosicruciansonline.com/history/history.htm |title=Ancient Rose Cross Order: Our History and Transmission |accessdate=2007-03-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116003836/http://www.rosicruciansonline.com/history/history.htm |archivedate=16 January 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EdneyCollege"/&gt;

During their 1914 trip the Felkins became stranded in Germany when Britain declared [[World War I|war]] on Germany on 4 August. Harriet's fictionalised account of his life suggests that he had been sent there on an urgent mission by the "Sun Master" Ara Ben Shemesh, despite all warnings of impending war. They managed to avoid arrest, and escaped the country via the neutral [[Netherlands]] with the help of German Masons.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdneyCollege"/&gt;

==New Zealand==
[[File:Dr Felkin’s Grave at Havelock North Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Felkin's grave]]
In 1912 Felkin, together with Harriet and Ethelwyn, visited [[Havelock North]], [[New Zealand]] at the invitation of the Society of the Southern Cross. This was a prayer and meditation group closely involved with the "[[Havelock Work]]", an arts and spirituality movement embraced by the whole town. Reginald and Ruth Gardiner and Harold Large, founders of both the Havelock Work and the Society of the Southern Cross, believed that eastern methods of spiritual training such as Theosophy were unsuitable for westerners, but also felt that the Church had lost the esoteric teachings of Jesus and his disciples. They were determined to undergo rigorous training and initiation to merit learning those hidden teachings. These three had started daily meditations together, and were soon joined by Miss M. M. McLean and Reginald's sister, Miss Rose Gardiner. Reginald Gardiner considered the Havelock Work to be a cultural society "built around this silent power station". The meditation group grew, and began to incorporate simple ritual, calling itself the Society of the Southern Cross.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;

In 1910 the Mirfield Fathers sent a mission of help to New Zealand, preaching and conducting retreats. Miss McLean, who had met Father Fitzgerald in Britain, arranged for him to meet members of the Havelock prayer group, and he agreed to direct their spiritual work from Britain. He instructed them in an esoteric approach to Christianity, but soon decided they had reached a stage where personal instruction was necessary for further progress, and he recommended Dr. Robert Felkin for the task. Within a week the group had cabled £300 passage, supplied by Maurice Chambers and his father, Mason, and his uncle John, for Felkin, Harriet and Ethelwyn to visit New Zealand for three months. During this visit in 1912 Dr Felkin established the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple of the Stella Matutina. The New Zealand Order became known by the Maori name of [[Whare Ra]] or "the House of the Sun". Foundations of the house at Whare Ra were laid down by the architect [[James Walter Chapman-Taylor|Chapman-Taylor]], who later became a member of both the Golden Dawn and the Order of the Table Round (Ordo Tabulae Rotundae), a neo-Arthurian mystical and chivalric order also brought to New Zealand by Felkin.&lt;ref name="Ellwood"/&gt;

Back in England in 1916 Felkin was appointed Inspector General of colonial colleges for the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]], although he seems never to have functioned in this capacity.&lt;ref name="EdneyCollege"/&gt; In that same year he also founded three more daughter-Temples of the Stella Matutina, together with a side-order, and claimed to found the Guild of St. Raphael.&lt;ref name="ColqSword"&gt;{{cite book |last=Colquhoun |first=Ithel |year=1975 |title=The Sword of Wisdom: MacGregor Mathers and the Golden Dawn |location=New York |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-85435-092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published on the theme of 'Rosicrucian medicine' &lt;ref name="Rosicruc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosicrucian Medicine|publisher=Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, London, 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the height of the German U-boat activity, emigrated permanently with his family to New Zealand, as his health broke down with recurrent malaria and other tropical diseases.&lt;ref name="DunnCaes"/&gt;

One year later, in September 1917, Felkin wrote to William Westcott, one of the two major founders of the Golden Dawn, that the Smaragdum Thallassess Temple had twenty members in the Second Order, thirty-four in the First Order, and ten people waiting to join.&lt;ref name="Anon"/&gt;

Felkin become involved in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], through his meeting with [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in London in 1911 at Lady Blomfield's. Felkin introduced Maurice Chambers to the Faith and presented him with two Bahá'í ring stones that Abdu'l-Baha had given him. Felkin may have had an article on the Bahá'í Faith published in a local newspaper,&lt;ref name="BahaiArohanui"&gt;[http://www.bahai-library.com/zamir/indexes/aroindexetc.html ''Arohanui''], Introduction by Collis Featherstone.&lt;/ref&gt; although there had been an earlier article by British Baha'i Alice Buckton published circa 1909 in the Havelock Journal "The Forerunner".

Felkin spent the rest of his life in New Zealand, where he continued to practise as a consulting physician as well as a magician between bouts of ill health. His strong personality and clinical acumen, combined with a kind and generous nature brought him patients from far afield, including Australia. On 28 December 1926, he died at Havelock North, and was buried in the Havelock North cemetery facing the Whare Ra, wearing the cloak, mantle and purple cross of a Knight of the Ordo Tabulae Rotundae.&lt;ref name="EdneyCollege"&gt;Edney, Ken.

From the website of the Felkin College of the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]], [[Napier, New Zealand]]. Retrieved 2007-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his second wife Harriet, his daughter Ethelwyn, and two sons;&lt;ref name="DunnCaes"/&gt; Harriet and Ethelwyn were later buried with him.&lt;ref name="EdneyCollege"/&gt;

'''Rodney Orpheus''' (born 8 July 1960) is a Northern Irish musician, record producer, writer, lecturer, and technologist. He is known for his work with the musical group [[The Cassandra Complex (band)|The Cassandra Complex]] and for his book on the [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]] of [[Aleister Crowley]], ''Abrahadabra''.

==Early life==
Rodney Orpheus was born William Rodney Campbell on 8 July 1960 in [[Moneymore]], [[Northern Ireland]], and attended [[Rainey Endowed School]] on a scholarship. He became interested in music during the [[punk rock]] movement of the late 70s and led one of Ireland's first experimental punk bands, The Spare Mentals. In 1980 he migrated to [[Leeds]], England where he formed The Cassandra Complex with Paul Dillon in 1984.&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, Martin C. (2003) ''The Great Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-335-0}}, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; The two, who met when Orpheus gatecrashed Dillon's 21st birthday party, originally financed the band by working at The Sorcerer's Apprentice occult store.

After the release of The Cassandra Complex's first records Orpheus spent several years touring Europe, and while living in [[Aachen]], Germany he joined Ordo Templi Orientis. Orpheus had studied the works of [[Aleister Crowley]] and other [[occult]] writers since his teenage years, and had previously founded and edited the UK occult newspaper ''Pagan News'' along with writer [[Phil Hine]].&lt;ref name="ToL"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Aachen he began work on the book ''Abrahadabra'', published by Looking Glass Press in Sweden and later republished by [[Weiser Books]]. The ''Ashe Journal'' described the book as "a significant contribution to the field of Thelemic, or Crowleyan if you will, magick,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Tree of Light'' journal said it was "one of the very few competent and readable introductory texts to [[Thelema|Thelemic]] [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]]."&lt;ref name="ToL" /&gt;

==Hamburg==
Orpheus moved to [[Hamburg]], Germany in 1990 where he formed the Makhashanah Oasis (later Lodge) of O.T.O. During this period he also formed the band Sun God,&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Santería]] [[initiation]] he had received from [[Baba Raul Canizares]] on a visit to New York and inspired by the work of Vodou artist [[Sallie Ann Glassman]]. He set up a recording studio where The Cassandra Complex recorded their next albums, as well as producing and remixing several records for other German alternative artists, including [[Rings of Steel|Die Krupps]] and [[Girls Under Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described as a "[[technopagan]]" in [[Mark Dery]]'s 1996 overview of [[cyberculture]] ''Escape Velocity'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To Rodney Orpheus the ease with which such metaphors are turned upside down underscores his belief that there's nothing oxymoronic about the term ''technopagan'' in end-of-the-century cyberculture. "People say 'pagans sit in the forest worshipping nature; what are you doing drinking diet coke in front of a Macintosh?' " says Orpheus, who in addition to being a card-carrying Crowleyite is a [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] and a [[mind machine]] aficionado. "But when you use a computer, you're using your imagination to manipulate the computer's reality. Well, that's ''exactly'' what sorcery is all about – changing the plastic quality of nature on a nuts-and-bolts level. And that's why magickal techniques dating back hundreds of years are totally valid in a [[cyberpunk]] age."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Los Angeles==
Orpheus had used [[Steinberg]]'s computer music software in the studio for some time, and soon after moving to Hamburg he joined the company to pioneer their Internet Services division. He became a well-known figure presenting the company's software at trade shows, and in 1999 relocated to Los Angeles, to design one of the first Web 2.0 community sites, Cubase.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While based in L.A., Orpheus served as a member of the US Grand Lodge O.T.O. Supreme Grand Council. He was still writing literature as well as music during this period: his horror short story "Gothic Blood Dream" and his poem "Poison Butterflies" would be published in the ''Gothic II'' anthology in 2002.

==Return to the UK==
In Los Angeles Orpheus spent time working within the film sound industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he produced the surround albums ''Planet Earth'' for [[LTJ Bukem]] and ''A Gigantic Globular Burst of Anti-Static'' for [[The Future Sound of London]].

In 2007 he reformed the original line-up of The Cassandra Complex.

Orpheus was appointed Deputy National Grand Master General for UK Grand Lodge of O.T.O.. at the [[Spring equinox]] 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

He appeared with [[Nick Margerrison]] on [[Kerrang Radio]] representing O.T.O. in May 2009:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We're chatting to a bloke, Rodney Orpheus, who is part of the religion which Crowley left behind after he died, it's called O.T.O. I'm asking him what would happen if we were to play out Crowley's magical spell ritual designed to call out demons. He tells me probably nothing, "If demons were to come out of the radio I'd be very surprised, if they're going to come out of anywhere, they'll come out of people's heads". Awesome. Great bit of radio. Hit play on the song. Two minutes in the station has a major technical glitch. The consoles in all three studios stop working. The mic won't turn on and then won't turn off. We play three songs in a row as we try to sort it out. Chaos as broadcast assistants and producers run about like headless chickens trying to sort it out. Technical response team on the phone. Finally we're back on air. Not the most impressive bit of radio ever. An example of Crowley's curse?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later work==

His most recent book on magick, ''Grimoire of Aleister Crowley'', was published by Abrahadabra Press in August 2011. It has been described as "a truly exceptional modern grimoire" by magical scholar and editor Colin Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Orpheus has always been fascinated by games, and has written supplements for the tabletop game ''[[Car Wars]]'' from [[Steve Jackson Games]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

During a long period of recuperation after an operation in 2001 he started designing modules for the computer game ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'', eventually running an online server called ''The Hidden Tradition'' and winning a Neverwinter Vault Hall of Fame award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to spend time lecturing in games design at [[South Gloucestershire and Stroud College]] from 2008–2010.

In August 2012 Rodney led Sex &amp; Magick workshop in [[Dublin, Ireland|Dublin]] covering the history of sexual magic, its influences from Eastern [[Tantra|Tantric]] teachings, and its modern day practice.&lt;ref name="Irish Independent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brangelina: Hollywood power couple enlist the help of top London media firms as divorce proceedings gather pace|url=http://m.independent.ie/style/sex-relationships/tantric-sex-comes-to-dublin-clothes-are-optional-26885572.html |quote=The first time many of us heard of Tantric sex was back in 1990 when rock star Sting boasted of seven-hour lovemaking marathons with his wife, Trudie Styler |publisher=Independent.ie|date=7 June 2017|ref=IrishIndependent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suzanne Muldowney''' (born August 13, 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muldowneyville.tripod.com/profile.htm|title=Muldowneyville: Profile.|website=muldowneyville.tripod.com|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;), nicknamed '''Underdog Lady''', is a [[performance artist]] known for her appearances in parades in various cities throughout the year in her elaborate homemade costumes. She often dresses as the cartoon character [[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]. She came to national attention through her appearances on and calls to ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' to discuss and perform her dance interpretation of Underdog. There she was given the nickname "Underdog Lady", though she personally rejects this name and prefers to be referred to as simply "Underdog" when wearing the costume.

==History==
A longtime resident of [[Delran Township, New Jersey]], Muldowney studied ballet as a child, and began performing interpretive dances of fictional characters in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courierpostonline/access/1848027741.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+17%2C+1999&amp;author=&amp;pub=Courier+Post&amp;desc=Underdog+gives+woman+new+leash+on+life&amp;pqatl=google "Underdog gives woman new leash on life"], ''[[Courier-Post]]'', April 17, 1999. Accessed February 4, 2013. "Muldowney has spent more than a quarter century interpreting the cartoon canine hero in parades and conventions, even onstage at New York University.... A native of Maple Shade, she calls herself an improvisational or interpretive dancer."&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, she was appearing at costume contests at science fiction conventions. It was during this time that Muldowney started performing as the cartoon superhero Underdog.&lt;ref name=Sokolic&gt;William H. Sokolic. "Underdog gives woman new leash on life". ''Courier Post''. April 17, 1999. 2B.&lt;/ref&gt; She has explained in an interview, "I try to do certain movements that simulate flight and heroism. I'll make like I'm flying by doing leaps and other things. I also will do some [[camel spin]]s. Basically I do movements that best portray Underdog. I try to do him more refined and sophisticated than the original character was."&lt;ref name=interview&gt;Bob Cooney. "Big fat close-up". ''Philadelphia Daily News''. October 1, 1999. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Muldowney began appearing in seasonal parades up and down the East Coast. Though her most famous dance interpretation is of Underdog, she has also portrayed [[Dracula]], [[Catwoman]] and [[Supergirl]],&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Harris. "30th Loyalty Celebration features 115-unit parade and 4-day carnival". ''Lancaster New Era''. April 24, 1998. d16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rob Laymon. "Performance artist saves day for Underdog". ''The Press of Atlantic City''. May 2, 1994. C1.&lt;/ref&gt; along with self-created characters such as Shelley the South Jersey Shore Mermaid,&lt;ref&gt;Dave Caldwell. "Is It Summer Yet? Just Ask a Hermit Crab". ''New York Times''.

Retrieved 10 Jan 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Slavic mythology|Slavic deity]] of war, fertility and abundance primarily venerated on the island of [[Rügen]] into the 12th century. He is often considered a local Rugian variant of the pan-Slavic god [[Perun]].

Sometimes referred to as Beli (or Byali) Vid (''Beli'' = white, bright, shining), Svetovid is associated with war and [[divination]] and depicted as a four-headed god with two heads looking forward and two back.  A statue portraying the god shows him with four heads, each one looking in a separate direction, a symbolical representation of the four directions of the compass, and also perhaps the four seasons of the year. Each face had a specific colour. The northern face of this totem was white (hence [[White Ruthenia]] / [[Belarus]] and the [[White Sea]]), the western, red (hence [[Red Ruthenia]]), the southern, black (hence the [[Black Sea]]) and the eastern, green (hence [[Green Ukraine|Zeleny klyn]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedic dictionary, Kyiv, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Svetovid (Montfaucon 1722).jpg|right|upright|150px|thumb|Svetovid by benedictine monk [[Bernard de Montfaucon]], 1722]]
Joined together, the four faces of Svetovid see all four sides of the world. This gave rise to a false etymology of the name of the god as "world-seer" (''svet'' = "world", ''vid'' = "sight"; ''Svetovid'' = "worldseer"). However, the forms ''Sventevith'' and ''Zvantewith'' show that the name derives from the word ''svętъ'', meaning "saint, holy". The second stem is sometimes reconstructed as ''vit'' =,"lord, ruler, winner".

The name recorded in chronicles of contemporary Christian monks is Svantevit, which, if we assume it was properly transcribed, could be an adjective meaning approx. "Dawning One" (''svantev'', ''svitanje'' = "dawning, raising of the Sun in the morning" + ''it'', adjective suffix), implying either a connection with the "Morning Star" or with the Sun itself.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Alternative names==
Beyond the names above referenced, Svetovid can also be known as '''Svitovyd''' (Ukrainian), '''Svyatovit'''  (alternative name in Ukrainian), '''Svyentovit''' (alternative name in Ukrainian), '''Svetovid''' (Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, Macedonian and Bosnian, and alternative name in Bulgarian), '''Suvid''' (alternative name in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), '''Svantevit''' ([[Wendish languages|Wendish]], alternative name in Ukrainian and possibly the original [[Proto-Slavic language|proto-Slavic]] name), '''Svantevid''' (alternative name in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), '''Svantovit''' (Czech and Slovak), '''Svantovít''' (Czech), '''Svantovid''' (alternative name in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), '''Swantovít''', '''Sventovit''', '''Zvantevith''' (Latin and alternative name in Serbian and Croatian), '''Świętowit''' (Polish),  '''Sutvid''', '''Svevid''', and '''Vid'''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Worship==
[[File:Slavnost svatovitova na rujane.jpg|right|thumb|''The Celebration of Svetovid on Rügen'', [[Alphonse Mucha]], ''[[The Slav Epic]]'']]
The original name of the island Rügen or Danish Rygen (Polish/Latin: Rugia) at the [[Baltic Sea]] was Rujan (meaning red in Old Slavic); thus the name would in translation imply 'The Red Island'. The autochthonous inhabitants of the island were the Slavic tribe, the Rujani, whose name was cognate with the island's; thus translating as people from Rujan. After the destruction and/or assimilation of the Rujani by the [[Danes]], in 1168, the original Slavic name of Rujan was corrupted as Rügen in German and Rygen in Danish.

[[File:Ryszkiewicz wrozba.jpg|left|thumb|''The prophecy before the battle'', [[Józef Ryszkiewicz]], 1890]]
According to various chronicles (i.e. [[Gesta Danorum]] by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Chronica Slavorum]] by [[Helmold]]), the temple at [[Jaromarsburg]] contained a giant wooden statue of Svantevit depicting him with four heads (or one head with four faces) and a [[horn of abundance]]. Each year the horn was filled with fresh [[mead]].

The temple was also the seat of an [[oracle]] in which the chief priest predicted the future of his tribe by observing the behaviour of a white horse identified with Svantevit and casting [[dice]] (horse oracles have a long history in this region, being already attested in the writings of [[Horse worship#Iron Age|Tacitus]]). The temple also contained the treasury of the tribe and was defended by a group of 300 mounted warriors which formed the core of the tribal armed forces.

==Origins==
[[File:Bishop Absalon topples the god Svantevit at Arkona.PNG|thumb|right|The decline of the pagan cult. Bishop [[Absalon]] topples the god Svantevit at [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]] in 1169.]]
David Leeming identifies the four heads as Rujevit, representing autumn and east, Porevit, representing summer and south, [[Jarilo|Iarovit]], representing spring and west, and [[Belobog| Bialobog]], representing winter and north{{sfn|Leeming|2005|p=359-360}}.

Some interpretations claim that Svetovit was another name for [[Radegast (god)|Radegast]], while another states that he was a fake god, a Wendish construction based on the name [[St. Vitus]]. However, the common practice of the Christian Church was to replace existing pagan deities and places of worship with analogous persons and rituals of Christian content, so it seems more likely that Saint Vitus was created to replace the original Svanto-Vit. According to a common interpretation, Svantevit was a Rugian counterpart of the pan-Slavic [[Perun]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In Croatia, on the island of Brač, the highest peak is called Vid's Mountain. In the [[Dinaric Alps]] there is a peak called "Suvid" and a Church of St. Vid.  Among the Serbs, the cult of Svetovid is partially preserved through the Feast of St. Vitus, "[[Vidovdan]]", one of the most important annual events in Serbian Orthodox Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Đorđević|first=Dimitrije |title=The role of St. Vitus Day in modern Serbian history|journal=Serbian Studies|volume=5|issue=3|date=Spring 1990|publisher=[[North American Society for Serbian Studies]]|url=http://www.serbianstudies.org/publications/pdf/Vol5_3_1990-%20DimitrijeDjordjevic-TheRoleofSt_VitusDayinModernSerbianHistory.pdf|pages=33–40|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The science fiction story "[[Delenda Est]]" by [[Poul Anderson]] depicts an [[alternate history]] world where [[Carthage]] defeated Rome, Christianity never arose and in the 20th century, Svantevit is still a main deity of a major European power called Littorn (that is, [[Lithuania]]). A devotee of this god, in the story, is called Boleslav Arkonsky – a name evidently derived from the above-mentioned temple at Arkona.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Controversies==

in 2017, while Chairwoman of the Arizona Senate Education Committee, The George Washington Academy charter school, of which she is a co-owner and co-founder, received an "F" Grade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cano|first1=Ricardo|title=Arizona charter school linked to top education lawmaker gets an 'F'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/politicalinsider/2017/10/13/arizona-charter-school-george-washington-academy-linked-top-education-lawmaker-sylvia-allen-gets-f/758477001/|website=USA Today|publisher=John Zidich|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Arizona Department of Education.

During her tenure as a county supervisor, Allen was said to have attempted to interfere with an internal investigation into the conduct of her son-in-law, a detention officer, with female inmates in the Navajo County jail, where he worked. K.C. Clark, the Navajo County [[Sheriff]], threatened to arrest her if she continued to interfere.&lt;ref name=soninlaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/laurieroberts/2015/03/19/sylvia-allen-senate-bill-1467/24990649/|title=Senator files bill after son-in-law lands in hot water|date=March 19, 2015|work=azcentral|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Allen filed a senate bill that would provide detention officers, like her son-in-law, with greater protections from disciplinary investigations.&lt;ref name=soninlaw/&gt;  Allen has indicated that she was made aware of misdeeds within the jail and that she informed the Sheriff believing he would want to know.  According to Allen, that is when her son-in-law was targeted and she discovered the Sheriff was both aware of and part of the problems in the jail.  The Sheriff (himself a Democrat) has made a number of accusations that outside groups have spread throughout Allen's district in an effort to defeat her in the 2016 General Election.  Allen has countered the Sheriff's claims by pointing out that she has the endorsement of a number of police associations.

Speaking at a June 2009 Rural Development and Retirement Committee hearing regarding a uranium mine, Allen said the world was "6,000 years old."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2009/07/11/20090711politics-allen0711.html Sen.

During a March 2015 Senate committee hearing on a bill that would relax concealed carry restrictions pertaining to public buildings, Allen, a member of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]], suggested that attending Sunday church services should be compulsory for Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpho.com/story/28620533/az-senator-church-attendance-should-be-mandatory#WNPoll146157|title=AZ Senator: Church attendance should be mandatory|first=Steve |last=Stout|date=March 26, 2015|work=kpho.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/ejmontini/2015/03/26/sylvia-allen-arizona-legislature-mandatory-church/70482802/|title=Sen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Teles of [[Megara]]''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Τέλης}}; fl. c. 235 BC), was a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher and teacher.  He wrote various discourses (''diatribes''), seven fragments of which were preserved by [[Stobaeus]]. 

==Life==
Nothing is known about Teles except for the limited information he reveals in his writings. In his discourse ''On Exile'' he refers to events in the [[Chremonidean War]] in the 260s BC, and he makes a specific reference to [[Hippomedon of Sparta|Hippomedon's]] governorship in [[Thrace]] under [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] in the years following 241 BC, thus this discourse was written shortly after this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1977|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; His native city is uncertain: he makes various indirect references to [[Megara]] which show that he was living and teaching there, but it is possible that he originally came from [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1977|pp=xii–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Megara, Teles operated a school where he taught [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophy, selecting teachings from earlier philosophers and dispensing them to his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1977|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Seven extracts of the lectures of Teles, totalling about thirty pages, are preserved by [[Stobaeus]], although Stobaeus' own selections come from an earlier epitome by an otherwise unknown Theodorus.&lt;ref name="dudley85"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus what survives is a series of extracts from extracts, and it is quite possible that in between Teles and Theodorus, or Theodorus and Stobaeus, the writings went through a further editing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1977|p=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven extracts are:
#Περὶ τοῦ δοϰεῖν ϰαὶ τοῦ εἶναι - ''On Seeming and Being''
#Περὶ αὐταρκείας - ''On Self-Sufficiency''
#Περὶ φυγῆς - ''On Exile''
#Σύγκρασις πενίας καὶ πλούτου - ''A Comparison of Poverty and Wealth''
#Περὶ τοῦ μὴ εἶναι τέλος ἡδονήν - ''On Pleasure not being the Goal of Life''
#Περὶ περιστάσεων - ''On Circumstances''
#Περὶ ἀπαθείας - ''On Freedom from Passion''

As a writer Teles has been regarded as being deficient in both literary and logical virtues,&lt;ref name="dudley86"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this may reflect the way in which his works have been edited and compressed by Theodorus, Stobaeus, and others.&lt;ref name="dudley85"/&gt; The value of his writings lies in the fact that they are the earliest Cynic discourses (''diatribes'') to survive, and they provide an insight into the [[Hellenistic]] world in which Teles lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1977|pp=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works make frequent mention of [[Socrates]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], and he preserves important fragments from the works of [[Crates of Thebes]], [[Metrocles]], [[Stilpo]] and [[Bion of Borysthenes]].&lt;ref name="dudley86"/&gt; Without him we would know little about the Cynic ''diatribe'' in the 3rd-century BC, and we would know much less about Bion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Governor''' (real name '''Philip Blake''' in the TV series, and '''Brian Blake''' in the comics and novels) is a [[fictional character]] and a primary antagonist from [[The Walking Dead (comic book)|''The Walking Dead'']] comic book and [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|television series]]. On television, he is portrayed by [[David Morrissey]]. Created by [[Robert Kirkman]] and artists [[Charlie Adlard]] and [[Cliff Rathburn]], the character made his comics debut in ''The Walking Dead'' #27 on April 2006 and his television debut in [[The Walking Dead (season 3)|season 3]]. In both series, The Governor is the ruthless, charismatic leader of the town of [[Woodbury, Georgia]] who comes into conflict with protagonist [[Rick Grimes]] and is responsible for the deaths of several primary characters. The Governor's origins are explored in the novel ''[[The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor]]'', written by Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga.

In the television series, The Governor's disturbing motives are reflected in his authoritarian ways in dealing with threats to his community, primarily by executing most large groups and only accepting lone survivors into his community. His dark nature escalates when he comes into conflict with Rick Grimes and the latter's group, who are occupying the nearby prison. The Governor vows to eliminate the prison group, and in that pursuit, he leaves several key characters dead both in Rick's group and his own. The Governor has a romantic relationship with [[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]], who unsuccessfully seeks to broker a truce between the two groups. In [[The Walking Dead (season 4)|season 4]], The Governor attempts to redeem himself upon meeting a new family, to whom he introduces himself as '''Brian Heriot'''. However, he commits several brutal acts to ensure the family's survival. This leads to more characters' deaths and forces Rick and his group to abandon the prison.

In 2009, the Governor was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 86th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-comic-book-villains/86|title=Top 100 Comic Book Villains|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=March 4, 2012|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked #28 on ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time. For his performance as the Governor, Morrissey was nominated for [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[39th Saturn Awards]].

===Fictional character biography===
====Comic book series====
Aside from simply "The Governor," the character's name appeared to be Philip Blake; however, with the release of the novel ''[[The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor]]'', it was revealed that his actual name was Brian Blake, and Philip was revealed to be his deceased brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Robert|last1=Kirkman|authorlink=Robert Kirkman|first2=Jay|last2=Bonansinga|title=[[The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor]]|publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]]|location=New York City|date=2012|ISBN=978-1250008398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the dead began to rise, Brian and Philip gathered a small group, which included Brian's niece Penny, and the group were constantly on the run when unsecured locations were breached; the [[planned community]] called the Wiltshire Estates, where Rick's group coincidentally stayed, was one of these. Eventually, Brian's group came upon [[Woodbury, Georgia]], a ravaged town being led by a group of [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] under Major Gene Gavin, who used fear to assert his authority. After becoming the last of his group, Brian rallied the townspeople against Gavin and the Guardsmen and afterward declared himself "Governor" of the four blocks making up the settlement. Initially appearing to be a fair and strong leader, he became increasingly more ruthless and power-hungry. He kept the zombified Penny tied up in his apartment, feeding her severed body parts of those who displeased him.&lt;ref&gt;*{{ Cite comic | writer=[[Robert Kirkman|Kirkman, Robert]]| penciller=[[Charlie Adlard|Adlard, Charlie]] | inker=[[Cliff Rathburn|Rathburn, Cliff]] | story=This Sorrowful Life|title=[[The Walking Dead (comic book)|The Walking Dead]] | volume=6 | issue=32 | date=November 26, 2006 | publisher=[[Image Comics]] | location=Berkeley, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Television series====
Before the outbreak, Philip and Brian Blake were raised by an abusive father. As an adult, Philip worked an office job with a boss he didn't get along with, was married, and had a daughter named Penny. Eighteen months before the outbreak, Philip lost his wife in a car accident. During the early days of the outbreak, Philip and Penny survived and found a community in Woodbury. Penny was bitten, however, and turned into a zombie. Unable to accept her death, Philip locked her up in a private room in his office. When the community was leaderless, they picked Philip to lead and began calling him "The Governor", a nickname which stuck. Determined not to lose the community, he executed any outsider groups he saw as a threat. He allowed some smaller groups to move into Woodbury if he deemed them to be an asset and not a threat to his leadership, but still took precautions and had them monitored by his lieutenants until he deemed them trustworthy. At some point during the first and second season The Governor encounters a dying [[Merle Dixon]], whom The Governor enlisted, along with [[Caesar Martinez (The Walking Dead)|Caesar Martinez]] and [[Milton Mamet]], as his lieutenant and advisers. He also tasks Milton, a scientist, with researching a means to reverse the virus in the hopes of saving Penny. The Governor was also known to have had affairs with many of the Woodbury women.

===Personality===
The Governor is charming and charismatic, but also murderous, violent, sociopathic, power-hungry, completely sadistic, and horrifically ruthless. He sees himself as the community's only hope for survival, and is thus willing to imprison, abuse and/or kill anyone he sees as a threat to his authority; for him, [[torture]] and mass murder are a [[means to an end]]. One example of this is when he and his men massacre a group of [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]], take their supplies. Later, he is proven to be completely cruel, heartless, and aggressive, willingly decapitating Hershel Greene with not even a single shred of remorse or mercy, even when Rick offers to make peace between the two factions, and ordering his men to kill Rick and his survivor group after mercilessly killing a little girl when she was bitten by a walker and dying.

===Appearances in the television series===
==== Season 3 ====
{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 3)}}
The Governor first appears in "[[Walk with Me (The Walking Dead)|Walk with Me]]", season 3, episode 3, having forcibly taken [[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]] and [[Michonne]] from the woods after Merle discovers them near a downed military helicopter. Woodbury, under The Governor's rule, is a functioning community that even bears some resemblance to the world before the virus struck. The townspeople are unaware that the Governor and his men massacred a platoon of National Guardsmen to get their supplies. In the episode "[[Killer Within]]", The Governor befriends Andrea, and he reveals some of his past to her, including his real name. In the episode "[[Say the Word (The Walking Dead)|Say the Word]]", it is shown that The Governor has a zombified daughter named Penny, whom he keeps hidden, feeds body parts to, and grooms affectionately while playing the lullaby "[[Bye, baby Bunting]]". The Governor allows Michonne to leave town, but she is unable to convince Andrea to leave with her. The Governor leads Andrea to a gathering for the townsfolk: a sparring match between Merle and [[Caesar Martinez (The Walking Dead)|Martinez]] surrounded by chained, toothless walkers. The spectacle shocks Andrea, who describes it as "barbaric", but the Governor insists it is "fun", and it teaches the residents to not be afraid. In the episode "[[Hounded (The Walking Dead)|Hounded]]", the Governor and Andrea begin a sexual relationship.

He sends Merle to find and kill Michonne, and although Merle fails to kill her, he returns with two captives, [[Glenn Rhee]] and [[Maggie Greene]]. In the episode "[[When the Dead Come Knocking]]", the Governor interrogates Maggie and eventually sexually assaults her, and leaves Glenn to be brutalized by Merle. When he threatens to shoot Glenn, Maggie gives The Governor the information about the prison and their group. In the mid-season finale "[[Made to Suffer]]", during [[Rick Grimes]]' foray into Woodbury to rescue Glenn and Maggie, Michonne kills Penny. Enraged, the Governor attacks Michonne, and in self-defense she stabs him in the hand and the right eye with a glass shard. The Governor calls a town meeting, where he claims the town has been attacked by terrorists brought by Merle, and he brings forth Merle's brother  [[Daryl Dixon]] in chains. The Governor orders them to fight to the death, and the town calls for their blood as a way to force the two brothers to fight each other.

In the mid-season premiere "[[The Suicide King (The Walking Dead)|The Suicide King]]", the fight between Merle and Daryl is broken up when the prison group attacks, allowing the brothers to escape. The Governor withdraws to his apartment, and the town is in a state of unrest after the attack. Andrea confronts him about her friends' presence in town, and then goes out to calm and inspire the townspeople. In the episode "[[Home (The Walking Dead)|Home]]", The Governor asks [[Milton Mamet]] where his loyalties lie, and asks him to keep tabs on Andrea. The Governor and his men then attack the prison; [[Rick Grimes]]' group runs for cover, and gunfire erupts on both sides. When a herd of walkers charge through town, the Governor gleefully sprays machine gun fire in the air and then drives off as the survivors struggle with the walkers.

In the episode "[[I Ain't a Judas]]", the Governor proceeds to rally Woodbury against the prison survivors, labeling them terrorists and raiders. Andrea wants to leave to negotiate peace with the prison group, but the Governor discourages her, implying that she will not be welcomed back if she leaves. When Milton tells the Governor that Andrea asked him to help her sneak out, the Governor tells him to go with her. The Governor welcomes [[Tyreese]], [[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha]], [[Allen (The Walking Dead)|Allen]], and [[Ben (The Walking Dead)|Ben]] to Woodbury, after Rick kicked them out of the prison. Andrea returns to Woodbury and warily resumes her place at the Governor's side. In the episode "[[Arrow on the Doorpost]]", encouraged by Andrea, the Governor meets with Rick in a secluded grain silo to offer him peace in exchange for turning over Michonne, giving him two days to think about it. The Governor returns to Woodbury and secretly orders Martinez to set an ambush at the barn, to kill all of Rick's group and bring Michonne to Woodbury so The Governor can torture her. In the episode "[[Prey (The Walking Dead)|Prey]]", Andrea flees for the prison, and the Governor hunts her down personally, bringing her back to Woodbury and strapping her in the dentist's chair that he meant to use on Michonne. In the episode "[[This Sorrowful Life]]", Merle kidnaps Michonne at Rick's suggestion to turn her over to the Governor, but lets her go and instead lures walkers to the Governor's meeting place to ambush the Woodbury army. Then, the Governor maims, shoots, and kills Merle, leaving his body to reanimate as a walker, which Daryl later kills, out of pure anger, remorse, and pain.

In the season finale "[[Welcome to the Tombs]]", the Governor brutally beats Milton up after learning that he burned the walkers that the Governor had been corralling; he then orders him to kill Andrea. Milton tries in vain to kill the Governor, but the Governor stabs him and locks him in with Andrea, so that Milton will reanimate and kill Andrea. The Governor then leads his army into the prison to kill Rick's entire group, but Tyreese and Sasha wants nothing to do with it, and stay behind at Woodbury. Rick and the others have set a trap at the prison, expecting the Woodbury army's arrival. Ambushed and outgunned by Maggie and Glenn, the Governor's army flees the prison in terror. The Governor stops the fast-fleeing convoy, and, in response to their protests against returning to the prison, he opens fire and slaughters them all, sparing only Martinez and [[List of The Walking Dead (TV series) characters#Woodbury survivors|Shumpert]], his two primary henchmen. Only [[Karen (The Walking Dead)|Karen]] escapes his rampage (by playing dead under a corpse). The Governor, Martinez, and Shumpert are last seen driving off as Rick and Tyreese bring everyone from Woodbury to the prison, and leave Woodbury to be overrun.

==== Season 4 ====
{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 4)}}
"[[Live Bait (The Walking Dead)|Live Bait]]" reveals that, just after massacring his own people, the Governor sets up camp with Martinez and Shumpert. Martinez and Shumpert abandon him after he does nothing to protect himself from a walker, believing him to have lost his nerve. The next day the Governor drives back to Woodbury, which is overrun with walkers, and burns down the entire town. After several months alone, intentionally trying to let the walkers kill him, he finally collapses on the street. He looks up to see a young girl, about the same age as Penny, in the window of a nearby apartment building; he pulls himself back to his feet and investigates. He finds the Chambler family residing inside, consisting of sisters [[Lilly (The Walking Dead)|Lilly]] and [[Tara Chambler|Tara]], their father David, and Lilly's daughter Meghan. Lilly and Tara initially hold the Governor at gunpoint, but they later confiscate his pistol and allow him to stay in an apartment across the hallway. After hearing about how the Governor has survived the last few months, they ask him his name. He tells them that it is "Brian Heriot", a name he saw painted on the side of a barn while staggering aimlessly through the countryside. He runs some errands for the family, and risks his life to get David two oxygen tanks from a walker-infested nursing home. When David dies and reanimates, the Governor saves the rest of the family by bashing in David's head with one of the oxygen tanks. After he buries David, he burns his photo of his wife and Penny. That night, he goes to the Chamblers to say goodbye, but Lilly insists that he stay. He and Lilly become lovers, and he saves Meghan when she falls into a pit of walkers, killing them with his bare hands. Moments later, he encounters Martinez and his group.

In the episode "[[Dead Weight (The Walking Dead)|Dead Weight]]", Martinez takes in the Governor, accepting his new facade as "Brian", and the girls and lets them join their camp. Among the camp are brothers Pete and Mitch Dolgen, who have a working tank. When it becomes clear that Martinez may not be able to keep them safe, the Governor kills him by throwing him into a pit of walkers. Pete takes command, but the Governor later kills him as well after he displays an inability to kill a group of other survivors to take their belongings. The Governor plans to rally the camp and use the tank in a second attack on the prison.

In the mid-season finale "[[Too Far Gone (The Walking Dead)|Too Far Gone]]", the Governor encounters Michonne and [[Hershel Greene]], and takes them hostage, intending to use them as leverage over  Rick. The Governor then rallies the camp to take over the prison. Upon arriving at the prison with his army and tank, the Governor tells Rick that he is going to give their group a chance to leave without anyone getting killed. Rick says that they can co-exist peacefully, but the Governor calls him a liar and beheads Hershel. During the ensuing gunfight, Lilly arrives in time to see him murder Hershel. She is carrying Meghan, who has been bitten by a walker. He dispassionately shoots Meghan to prevent her from becoming a walker before ordering his people to kill everyone in the prison. The Governor uses the tank to roll over the fences and goes into the fight himself, only to be tackled by Rick. The two of them fight, and the Governor eventually pins Rick and brutally beats him before beginning to choke him to death. At that moment, Michonne stabs the Governor and leaves him to die. Lilly then shoots him in the head, killing him. His corpse is briefly visible at the beginning of "[[After (The Walking Dead)|After]]," lying in the middle of the field with a bullet hole in his head.

==== Season 5 ====
{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 4)}}
In the mid-season premiere "[[What Happened and What's Going On]]", the Governor appears, along with [[Beth Greene]], [[Bob Stookey]], Martin, and [[Lizzie and Mika Samuels]], during Tyreese's hallucinations after Tyreese is bitten by a walker. While Beth, Bob, and the girls comfort Tyreese, the Governor taunts him about his past actions and inability to do what is "necessary". The Governor, especially, criticizes Tyreese's choices, particularly in forgiving Carol for murdering [[Karen (The Walking Dead)|Karen]]. The Governor reminds Tyreese that he promised to do what it took to earn his keep, but he failed to adapt. However, Tyreese stands up and confronts him. However The Governor "pushes" Tyreese to the ground while still pressing his point. Tyreese ultimately dies in peace, and the vision of the Governor fades away.

==Casting and development==
On television, the character is portrayed by British actor [[David Morrissey]]. [[Glen Mazzara]], when asked about the character's direction for season 3 of the show, described The Governor as a [[narcissist]], who sees himself as the future savior of civilization and is willing to resort to the most extreme of measures to achieve his ultimate goal.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Kevin (July 17, 2012). [http://screencrush.com/walking-dead-governor-sexy/ "'The Walking Dead' Season 3's Governor to be 'Sexy?'"]. Screen Crush.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite making few appearances, The Governor's daughter, Penny, plays a key role in his mentality and actions. He secretly cares for the undead Penny in his apartment, as revealed in the episode "[[Say the Word (The Walking Dead)|Say the Word]]", brushing her hair and singing to her, and tells Michonne that she does not need to suffer, implying that he believes Penny is still alive and is "under the grip of a terrible, terrible illness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amctv.com/the-walking-dead/videos/contains-spoilers-inside-episode-308-the-walking-dead-made-to-suffer Inside Episode 308 The Walking Dead: Made to Suffer] ''The Walking Dead'' (December 2, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governor's eye patch in the television series was placed on the opposite side from that of his comic book counterpart.

==Reception==
In 2009, the Governor was ranked as IGN's 86th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; and was ranked #28 on TV Guide's list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time. David Morrissey has been well received for his performance as the Governor, and was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 39th Saturn Awards.

'''Edward McDaniel''' (June 19, 1938 – April 18, 2002) was a [[Choctaw]]-[[Chickasaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] who achieved fame as a professional [[American football]] player and later as a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He is notable for having held the [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]] five times. McDaniel was a major star in prominent [[National Wrestling Alliance]] affiliated promotions such as [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling|NWA Big Time Wrestling]] (which would eventually be renamed [[World Class Championship Wrestling]]) and [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (which would ultimately become [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] after being purchased by media mogul [[Ted Turner]] in 1988).

==Early life==
Wahoo was born in the small town of [[Bernice, Louisiana]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hungermtn.org/wahoo-the-incredible-adventures-of-chief-wahoo-mcdaniel-wrestling-superstar/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008012642/http://www.hungermtn.org/wahoo-the-incredible-adventures-of-chief-wahoo-mcdaniel-wrestling-superstar/ |archivedate=2011-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked in oil and he moved to several towns before settling down in [[Midland, Texas]] while Wahoo was in middle school.  One of his [[baseball]] coaches was [[George H. W. Bush]]. The name "Wahoo" actually came from his father who was known as "Big Wahoo". He was a problematic teenager but he was accepted to the [[University of Oklahoma]]. There he became a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity and he was also a part of [[Bud Wilkinson]]'s [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Sooners football]] program.

McDaniel's college career was somewhat marred by injuries early on but by his senior year, he was one of the top players on the Oklahoma team despite being caught drinking after games and skipping classes. He played [[linebacker]] for the [[American Football League]]'s [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] and [[Denver Broncos]] but really became a star when he was traded to the [[New York Jets]] in 1964. He was a crowd favorite and made 23 tackles in a single game against his former Denver Broncos. As a gimmick, whenever McDaniel made a tackle, the PA announcer would announce, "Tackle made by...guess who?", which the crowd would respond, "WAHOO!" He was picked by the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the 1966 American Football League expansion draft, as the team's major name player. During the 1968 season, he knocked out two police officers in an altercation and was traded to the [[San Diego Chargers]]. Wahoo never played a game for San Diego and started wrestling full-time. McDaniel was unique in that he wore his nickname of "Wahoo" as the name on his jersey.

==Wrestling career==
Wahoo wrestled during the off-season, a common practice at the time due to low player salaries, for [[Dory Funk]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]] while he played for [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston]] and [[Denver Broncos|Denver]]. When he was playing for the New York Jets, [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]] brought him in for a run in the [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF). During his run, he wrestled with stars like [[Boris Malenko]], Cowboy Bill Watts, [[Dr. Jerry Graham]] and [[Waldo Von Erich]]. When he played in [[Miami]], [[Eddie Graham]] booked him and used him as a tag team wrestler with [[Jose Lothario]]. His Madison Square Garden debut was January 25, 1965, where he defeated Boris Malenko. Malenko at the time was essentially a preliminary wrestler.  Nonetheless, the match got some strong local media coverage due to McDaniel's football career.

After leaving football, Wahoo wrestled some in [[Hawaii]] but really made his mark and had his greatest success in [[Houston]]. He feuded with Boris Malenko, eventually winning his hair, and was a frequent challenger for [[Dory Funk, Jr.]]'s [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. The feud sold out the Sam Houston Coliseum on several occasions with Wahoo going time limit draws with the champ but ultimately coming up short. After Houston, he went to the [[American Wrestling Association]] and had a very successful feud with [[Superstar Billy Graham]] after Graham could not defeat Wahoo in an arm wrestling challenge and attacked him. Eventually, the feud turned into a tag feud with Wahoo teaming with [[The Crusher (wrestler)|the Crusher]] (another legitimate tough guy) against Graham and [[Ivan Koloff]].

In 1974, Wahoo came to Mid-Atlantic to wrestle for [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] and help build up the territory as a singles territory in a feud with a rival from [[Texas]], [[Johnny Valentine]]. The feud evolved into a tag feud with Wahoo and [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]] taking on Johnny Valentine and [[Ric Flair]], who Wahoo met in the AWA.

McDaniel and John Valentine went on to have a feud remembered to this day for the sheer force of their punch/chop exchanges, both men widely known for their hard-hitting style. Wahoo won the Mid-Atlantic title from Valentine on June 29, 1975, in Asheville, North Carolina.

McDaniel and Flair entered into a legendary feud over the Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship title throughout 1975 and 1976 after Johnny Valentine's career was ended in a plane crash. Flair won the title for the first time on September 20, 1975, in Hampton, Virginia. Wahoo regained the title in the Charlotte (NC) Coliseum in May of the following year.

Flair regained the title three weeks later in a match remembered as the "table leg" match. Wahoo and Flair shattered a table at ringside, and Flair picked up one of table legs to hit Wahoo in the head, not realizing a nail was sticking out of the table leg. McDaniel was legitimately injured and the match quickly ended with Flair pinning McDaniel for the title.

McDaniel and Flair would swap the title one more time before the final exchange of the Mid-Atlantic title between the two happened on December 27, 1976, when Wahoo defeated Flair for the belt in a "No Disqualification" match in the Richmond (VA) Coliseum. Flair went on to win the United States title and matches for the U.S. belt between Wahoo and Flair drew huge houses, with Flair holding on to the championship.

In 1977, Johnny Valentine's son [[Greg Valentine]] attacked Wahoo and broke his leg in an angle to establish Greg as Johnny's successor. Greg Valentine originally won the title on June 11, 1977, with Wahoo regaining it in Raleigh, NC two months later. On September 7, 1977, Greg Valentine regained the title at the WRAL-TV studio tapings, breaking Wahoo's leg in the process.  This angle is particularly remembered for a follow-up interview weeks later with Flair and Valentine throwing change at Wahoo, and Valentine asking Wahoo if he needed a custom-made wheelchair for his fat body. Valentine then infuriated fans (thus building up the demand for a rematch) by parading around in T-shirts which read "I Broke Wahoo's Leg" and "No More Wahoo."

Wahoo won the Mid-Atlantic title for the final time in a match against Valentine in Greensboro, NC on April 2, 1978. Unusually enough for that decade, the title reign lasted only a week, with Wahoo dropping the title to Olympic weightlifter [[Ken Patera]] in Charlotte, NC.

Other than his work in Mid-Atlantic, he wrestled in [[Florida]], usually against then NWA World champion [[Harley Race]]. He also split his time wrestling in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the AWA. He went to Japan several times but never really caught on although he did wrestle major names like [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]], [[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Jumbo Tsuruta]]. By 1980, he was wrestling in [[San Antonio]] in a feud with [[Tully Blanchard]] and his regular tag partner, "Georgous" [[Gino Hernandez]]. When the promoter in Houston broke away from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) and recognized the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World champion]] [[Nick Bockwinkel]], Wahoo was the regular challenger.

He returned to Mid-Atlantic in 1981 and feuded with [[Roddy Piper]] over the [[WWE United States Championship|United States title]] which ended when Piper brought in [[Abdullah the Butcher]] and Abby put Wahoo out on injury. Wahoo returned and had another bloody feud with [[Sgt. Slaughter]] for the U.S. title when Slaughter won the title while Wahoo was injured. In 1984, he [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on [[Ricky Steamboat]], taking the U.S. title for the fourth time when Tully Blanchard came to Wahoo's assistance with a steel chair. He was stripped of the title but regained it in a tournament later that year. Wahoo successfully defended it at [[Starrcade (1984)|Starrcade]] of that year against Billy Graham but lost it to [[Magnum T.A.]] in early 1985 in a steel cage match. Wahoo feuded again with the now [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight title at various times before Flair turned heel again. After losing the U.S. title, he booked and wrestled mostly for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]]. While there. he assaulted a fan that called his headdress "chicken feathers" during a TV taping at the Sportatorium. He made a tag team with [[Billy Jack Haynes]] which won the promotion's version of the NWA United States Tag Team title from [[Rick Rude]] and [[Ferrin Barr, Jr.|Jesse Barr]] (aka Jimmy Jack Funk). Wahoo wrestled some high-profile matches in Florida like an unsuccessful world title bid against Ric Flair and a draw against [[Bruiser Brody]] at the Florida promotion's nationally syndicated big show, ''Battle of the Belts''.

In 1986, he returned as a face to Mid-Atlantic wrestling in some of his famous Indian Strap Matches with [[Jimmy Garvin]] and Rick Rude. He won the [[NWA National Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Tully Blanchard]] in front of a packed house of 11,000 fans in [[Los Angeles]] at [[The Forum (Inglewood)|The Forum (Inglewood, California)]] on August 28, 1986 during a wild and bloody match, but lost a unification match against NWA U.S. champion [[Nikita Koloff]].

For the rest of the 1980s, he wrestled mainly for the AWA and for WWC in [[Puerto Rico]]. He was a perennial top contender for the AWA World Title from 1987–1989, challenging [[Curt Hennig]], [[Jerry Lawler]], and [[Larry Zbyszko]] during that time. McDaniel initially retired following a match against [[Mike Enos]] [[Beverly Brothers|and]] [[Wayne Bloom]], where he suffered a detached retina.

But his retirement was brief and he returned to wrestling the following year. He continued to wrestle into the 1990s mostly for independent promotions throughout the south. In 1993, he teamed with [[Jim Brunzell]] and [[Blackjack Mulligan]] against [[Don Muraco]], [[Jimmy Snuka]], and [[Dick Murdoch]] in a legends match at the inaugural [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree: A Legend's Reunion]]. The following year, he participated in an angle where he and [[Chief Jay Strongbow]] supposedly passed the torch to WWF's [[Tatanka (wrestler)|Tatanka]]. Had a notable feud on the indie circuit with [[Ivan Koloff]] and a series of matches with an unknown wrestler named Mean Marc Ash, which signaled to many long time observers that Wahoo's career was nearly over. He wrestled until 1996 when he officially retired.

[[File:Wahoo McDaniel-FSES.JPG|right|thumb|McDaniel poses with fans at a charity event in [[Pelzer, South Carolina]], March 10, 2001.]]
Wahoo is often compared to Chief Jay Strongbow, who played a Native American wrestler at the time. Wahoo was respected by other wrestlers and football players for his toughness, physical style and his crazy antics outside of the ring. The respect as a legitimate athlete made it easy for him to go to different territories and be successful when many babyfaces had trouble doing so. Although his playing ability in football is often overshadowed by his wild lifestyle. [[Joe Namath]] and [[Larry Csonka]], who played with him early in their careers, both printed stories about him in their autobiographies. Along that same line, [[Len Dawson]] has been quoted as saying "The hardest hit I ever received on a football field was by Wahoo McDaniel." &lt;ref&gt;"Where Are They Now", [[Inside the NFL]], Home Box Office, November, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he was also inducted into the [[WCW Hall of Fame]].

==Personal life==
After his retirement from wrestling he became an avid fisherman. He enjoyed fishing Lake Amistad in Del Rio, Texas, which was one of his favorite fishing spots.

McDaniel was married five times to four different women. With his first wife, Monta Rae, he had two daughters, Nikki, born in June 1963 and living in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and Cindi, born in October 1965 and living in Rowlett, Texas. He has four grandchildren, Dustin and Brittany through Nikki and twins, Morgan and Taylor, through Cindi.

McDaniel's health started to deteriorate in the mid-1990s, which led to his retirement in 1996, and he eventually lost both kidneys. He was awaiting a kidney transplant when he died of complications from diabetes and renal failure on April 18, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/25/sports/wahoo-mcdaniel-63-a-wrestler-and-a-folk-hero-for-fans-of-the-early-jets.html|title=Wahoo McDaniel, 63, a Wrestler and a Folk Hero for Fans of the Early Jets|first=Gerald|last=Eskenazi|date=25 April 2002|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wharton Jackson Green''' (February 28, 1831 &amp;ndash; August 6, 1910) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] from [[North Carolina]] and an officer in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Biography==
Born in [[St. Marks, Florida]], Green was instructed by private tutors. He attended [[Georgetown College (Georgetown University)|Georgetown College]], Lovejoy's Academy in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and the [[United States Military Academy]], [[West Point, New York]] but dropped out. He then studied law at the [[University of Virginia at Charlottesville]] and at [[Cumberland University]], [[Lebanon, Tennessee]]. He was admitted to the bar in 1854 and commenced practice in [[Washington, D.C.]] before engaging in agricultural pursuits in [[Warren County, North Carolina]], in 1859.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000419|title=Green, Wharton Jackson|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:North-to-South POW Cover 1864.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Letter to Mrs Wharton J Green postmarked Richmond, Virginia, September 27, 1864.]]
During the Civil War, Green enlisted in the Confederate service in 1861 and rose through the ranks to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of the Second North Carolina Battalion. Afterward, he served on Brigadier General [[Junius Daniel]]'s staff. Green was wounded and taken prisoner at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863. He spent the rest of the war in the [[Johnson's Island]] prisoner-of-war camp.

After the war, he settled at "Tokay Vineyard," near [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], and became interested in [[viticulture]]. He was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]]s in 1868, 1872, 1876, and 1888. Green was the first president of the Society of Confederate Soldiers and Sailors in North Carolina.

Entering politics, he was elected as a [[Democratic Party (U.S.)|Democrat]] to the [[Forty-eighth Congress|Forty-eighth]] and [[Forty-ninth Congress|Forty-ninth]] Congresses (March 4, 1883 – March 3, 1887). He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1886 and retired from public service. He then devoted his time to the cultivation of his vineyard and to literary pursuits. He wrote his autobiography, ''Recollections and Reflections: An auto of Half a Century and More,'' in 1906.

Wharton Green died at "Tokay," near Fayetteville on August 6, 1910. He was buried in the town's [[Cross Creek Cemetery]].

He was the son of [[Texas Revolution]] general [[Thomas Jefferson Green]], the grandson of U.S. Senator [[Jesse Wharton]], and the cousin of Confederate general [[Matt Whitaker Ransom]].

One of Green's daughters, Sarah, married wealthy industrialist Pembroke Jones of Wilmington, NC, in 1884. With the help of their close friend, art collector and railroad president [[Henry Walters]], they created a lifestyle some claim made them models for the saying, "Keeping up with the Joneses." They maintained luxurious residences in Newport and New York City. The garden estate Sarah Green Jones created in Wilmington still exists and is known as [[Airlie Gardens]].&lt;ref name="airlie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airliegardens.org/plan-your-visit/history/minnie-evans-the-artist-of-airlie/|title=Minnie Evans: The Artist of Airlie|publisher=Airlie Gardens|accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Jensen''' "'''Billy'''" '''Cottrell''' (born 1980) is a former [[Ph.D. candidate]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] who was convicted in April 2005 of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] associated with the destruction of eight [[sport utility vehicle]]s and a Hummer dealership in the name of the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF). He was sentenced to eight years in [[federal prison]] on conspiracy charges and ordered to pay $3.5 million in restitution.  His lawyers, however, have appealed the verdict and sentence.
He was released August 16, 2011.

==Early life==

Cottrell graduated from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EF4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq= ''Los Angeles Magazine'', Vol. 50, No. 5, May 2005], Emmis Communications, p. 198: "During [[Peter Freund|Freund's]] career heading the Ph.D. program at the University of Chicago, Cottrell's paper on [[p-adic strings]] was the only undregraduate thesis he supervised."&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he was accepted to the graduate physics program at [[Caltech]], where he would meet Tyler Johnson, who was also studying physics and finishing up his undergraduate work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vincebeiser.com/hummer.html|title=Burned|date=April 10, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107024035/http://www.vincebeiser.com/hummer.html|archivedate=January 7, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer 2003 and SUV arsons==

In August 2003, Cottrell and Tyler Johnson developed a plan to place bumper stickers on [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]] reading "SUV = TERRORISM."&lt;ref name="laweekly" /&gt;  In a series of emails that were later recovered by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], Cottrell attempted to recruit friends to help him purchase the bumper stickers, and organised arson attacks on a series of Hummer dealers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Trial==
He was arrested in March 2004 after law enforcement tracked him sending emails to the ''Los Angeles Times.'' The e-mails signed by "Tony Marsden" speak about what the ELF cell had done, vandalizing more than 130 SUVs parked at dealerships or residential homes, claiming they were damaging the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cdfe.org/suv_suspect_arrested.htm|title = Earth Liberation Front suspect charged in California SUV arson, vandalism raids|last = |first = |date = March 18, 2004|work = |access-date = |via = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040402024314/http://www.cdfe.org/suv_suspect_arrested.htm|archive-date = April 2, 2004|dead-url = yes|publisher = Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with conspiracy to commit arson, arson, and one count of using a destructive device during a crime of violence, in an October 24, 2004 Federal grand jury indictment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Cottrell's lawyers stated that he was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Judge Gary Klausner would not allow a defense based upon the claim that Cottrell was suffering from Asperger syndrome.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspires-relationships.com/articles_billy_cottrell_innocent_guilty_or_duped.htm |title=Billy Cottrell - Innocent, Guilty or Duped? |publisher=Aspires-relationships.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his trial, Cottrell admitted being present, but denied involvement in throwing Molotov cocktails, saying Johnson was the mastermind.

An informal network of Cottrell supporters formed, led by the [[Earth Liberation Front]] Prisoner's Network and the Free Billy Cottrell organization. These supporters claimed that Cottrell was the innocent victim of government persecution. However, when Cottrell named Johnson as the mastermind, it prompted his Free Billy Cottrell supporters to brand him as a [[treason|traitor]], issue an apology to those who supported Cottrell,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoshop.org/inews/comment.php?mode=view&amp;cid=84436&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdfe.org/cottrell_convicted.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and end all support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brianoconnor.typepad.com/animal_crackers/2005/04/william_cottrel.html |title=Animal Crackers: William Cottrell: An Unremorseful Soul on the Eve of Sentencing |publisher=Brianoconnor.typepad.com |date=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
An article in the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' reports that Billy was being mistreated by prison guards who have labeled him a "terrorist".  According to the article, he is not permitted to study physics or Mandarin Chinese, is not permitted to teach the other prisoners calculus, and had had his books and papers removed without being given a reason.&lt;ref name="laweekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/general/features/a-terrible-thing-to-waste/15782/?page=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304065152/http://www.laweekly.com/general/features/a-terrible-thing-to-waste/15782/?page=1 |archivedate=March 4, 2007 |title=A terrible thing to waste |date=February 28, 2007 |last=Lewis |first=Judith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter in Cottrell's defense, signed by [[Stephen Hawking]] and other prominent scientists, was distributed to prison authorities and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals at Cottrell's October 18, 2006 hearing.&lt;ref name="laweekly" /&gt; He was then transferred into another federal prison with less violent prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/the-us-addiction-to-oil-the-battered-hummer-that-symbolises-a-divided-nation-457975.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cottrell was then able to study subjects that he was denied at the last prison and no longer had a roommate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/-physicists-campaign-free-jailed-ecoterrorists-mind-/2007/07/15/2784176.htm |title=Physicists campaign to free a jailed ecoterrorist's mind |publisher=Tmcnet.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary film==

A documentary film on Cottrell, titled ''Standard Deviation'', was written and directed by David Randag and Chris Brannan in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standarddeviation-themovie.com |title=Standard Deviation |publisher=Standarddeviation-themovie.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it won the Emmy for best student documentary at the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Foundation's 30th College Television Awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.emmys.tv/media/releases/2009/rel-ctafin.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit==
On 8 September 2009, Cottrell's convictions and sentences for arson were overturned  by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2009/09/08/05-50307am.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes2009"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/09/suv-bombers-arson-convictions-overturned-sentence-vacated.html |title=Caltech student's arson convictions are overturned in SUV bombings; sentence is vacated by appeals court |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the conspiracy conviction and sentence were affirmed. According to the ''Times'', the omission of Cottrell's diagnosis of [[Asperger syndrome]] during his 2004 trial played a key role in the decision. Cottrell was released on August 16, 2011.

'''William Ellery''' (December 22, 1727 – February 15, 1820)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dsdi1776.com/signers-by-state/william-ellery/&lt;/ref&gt; was a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] as a representative of [[Rhode Island]].  In 1764, the Baptists consulted with Ellery and Congregationalist Reverend [[Ezra Stiles]] on writing a charter for the college that became [[Brown University]]. Ellery and Stiles attempted to give control of the college to the Congregationalists, but the Baptists withdrew the petition until it was rewritten to assure Baptist control. Neither Ellery nor Stiles accepted appointment to the reserved Congregationalist seats on the board of trustees.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Catelogue of Brown University,Providence: Brown University, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
William Ellery was born in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] on December 22, 1727, the second son of [[William Ellery, Sr.]] and Elizabeth Almy, a descendant of [[Thomas Cornell (settler)|Thomas Cornell]].  He received his early education from his father, a merchant and Harvard College graduate. He graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1747, where he excelled in Greek and Latin. He then returned to Newport where he worked first as a merchant, next as a [[customs]] collector, and then as Clerk  of the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]]. He started practicing law in 1770 at the age of 43 and became active in the Rhode Island [[Sons of Liberty]].

Statesman [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] died in 1776, and Ellery replaced him in the [[Continental Congress]]. He became a signer of the [[Articles of Confederation]] and one of the 56 signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776. The size of his signature on the Declaration is second only to John Hancock's famous signature.

Ellery also served as a judge on the [[Supreme Court of Rhode Island]], and he had become an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] by 1785.  He was the first customs collector of the port of Newport under the Constitution, serving there until his death, and he worshipped at the [[Second Congregational Church of Newport]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Francis Adams, The works of John Adams, Volume 8 (Little, Brown, 1853), pg. 61 quoting "William Ellery and others to John Adams,"Newport RI 26 May 1783  https://books.google.com/books?id=0JYsAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adherents.com/gov/Founding_Fathers_Religion.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellery died on February 15, 1820 at age 92 and was buried in [[Common Burial Ground]] in Newport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=szYEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=%22William+Ellery,+the+son%22&amp;as_brr=1 Charles Augustus Goodrich "Lives of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence," (T. Mather, New York: 1840) p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rhode Island Society of the [[Sons of the Revolution]] and the William Ellery Chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] make an annual commemoration at his grave on July 4.
