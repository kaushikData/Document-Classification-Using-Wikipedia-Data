'''''A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia''''' is a book by [[George Fletcher Moore]].  First published in 1842, it represents one of the earliest attempts to record the languages used by the [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal peoples]] of [[Western Australia]].  The book is a compilation by Moore based on the works of [[Robert Lyon (Australian settler)|Robert Lyon]], [[Francis Armstrong]], [[Charles Symmons]], the [[Bussell family]] and [[George Grey]], as well as his own observations.  It was published in 1842 at the expense of Moore and [[Governor of Western Australia]] [[John Hutt]].  In 1884 it was republished as part of Moore's ''[[Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia|Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia and also A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A descriptive vocabulary of the language in common use amongst the aborigines of Western Australia; with copious meanings, embodying much interesting information regarding the habits, manners, and customs of the natives, and the natural history of the country.  By George Fletcher Moore, B.L., Advocate-General Of Western Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is a key source in records of the nomenclature of Australia's Southwest flora and fauna. The compilation of regional variants in the [[Nyungar language]] is cited in Serventy and Whittell ''[[Birds of Western Australia]]'' and subsequent ornithological literature, although his own observations of bird-life remained unpublished until the 1884 edition of Moore's diary.&lt;ref name="Serventy"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Serventy |first1=D.

'''Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier''' (August 6, 1840{{snd}}March 18, 1914) was a Swiss-born American [[archaeologist]] who particularly explored the indigenous cultures of the [[American Southwest]], Mexico and South America. He immigrated to the United States with his family as a youth and made his life there, abandoning the family business to study in the new fields of archeology and ethnology.

[[Bandelier National Monument]] in [[New Mexico]], was named for him, as his studies established the significance of this area in the [[Jemez Mountains]] for archeological and historic preservation of sites of [[Ancestral Puebloans]], dating to two eras from 1150 to 1600 [[Common era|CE]].

==Life==
Bandelier was born in [[Bern, Switzerland]]. As a youth, he emigrated to the [[United States]] with his family, which settled in [[Highland, Illinois]], a community established by other Swiss immigrants. He labored unhappily in the family business as a young man. He became acquainted with the pioneering anthropologist [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis Henry Morgan]] of New York, who served as his mentor as Bandelier turned to scholarship. In particular, he undertook [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[ethnology|ethnological]] work among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of the southwestern United States, [[Mexico]] and [[South America]].

Beginning his studies in [[Sonora]] (Mexico), [[Arizona]] and New Mexico, Bandelier developed as the leading authority on the history of this region. With [[Frank Hamilton Cushing|F. H. Cushing]] and his successors, he became one of the leading authorities on its [[prehistoric]] civilization, at a time when archeology and ethnology were new fields of study.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bandelier, Adolph Francis Alphonse|volume=3|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Bandelier left the Southwest to travel and conduct research in [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], where he continued ethnological, archaeological and historical investigations. In the first field he was in a part of his work connected with the Hemenway Archaeological Expedition. In the second he worked for [[Henry Villard]] of [[New York City]] and for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] of the same city. Bandelier had shown the falsity of various historical [[mythology|myth]]s, notably in his conclusions respecting the [[Inca]] civilization of Peru.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

While working at the pueblo of [[Isleta]] in New Mexico, Bandelier made some long-term friends. They included French-born missionary Father [[Anton Docher]], who had served the Tiwa people since 1891 and was known as the Padre of Isleta.&lt;ref&gt;Keleher and Chant. ''The Padre of Isleta''. Sunstone Press, 2009, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Another was American journalist and writer [[Charles Fletcher Lummis]], who also wrote on ethnology. Lummis traveled with Bandelier for a time in South America, before returning to his base in Los Angeles. The three men continued as friends.

==Legacy and honors==
*[[Bandelier National Monument]] in New Mexico was named for him, as his studies established the significance of this area for understanding ancient indigenous cultures of the Tuyongi canyon.
*Bandelier Elementary School in Albuquerque, New Mexico was named after him.
*Bandelier was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleks Buda''' (7 September 1910 – 7 July 1993) was an [[Albania]]n historian. After completion of his education in Italy and Austria, he returned to Albania. Although his education was in literature, he made a career as a historian during the socialist period in Albania. He was a member and president of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]].

== Early life ==
Buda was born on 7 September 1910 in Elbasan, Ottoman Empire (modern day Albania). He went to elementary school at [[Lecce]] in [[Italy]] and completed secondary school in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], in 1930.&lt;ref name="Elsie2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elsie|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA58|date=19 March 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7380-3|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that he enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]] where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[literature]], but he returned to Albania without graduating.&lt;ref name="Myftaraj"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.kastriotmyftaraj.com/?p=335 |author=Kastriot Myftaraj |language=Albanian |year=2012 |title=Biografia e fshehur e delegatëve të Kongresit të Drejtshkrimit të vitit 1972 |trans-title=The hidden biography of the delegates of the Congress of Orthography of 1972 |quote=Aleks Buda, ndonëse kishte nisur studimet universitare në Vienë për filozofi dhe letërsi, ai nuk mundi që të diplomohet dhe u kthye në Shqipëri pa diplomë universitare...&lt;br&gt;Aleks Buda ishte i vetmi historian që mori pjesë në Kongresin e Drejtshkrimit... |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712020918/http://www.kastriotmyftaraj.com/?p=335 |archivedate=2013-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career ==
Although his specialty was in literature, he made a career as a [[historian]].&lt;ref name="Elsie2010"/&gt; He was also referred to as the founder of the Albanian post WWII historiography.&lt;ref name="Keber2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hysa|first1=Armanda|last2=Keber|first2=Katarina|title=Historièni seminar 8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFKZ_D8_Y6AC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2010|publisher=Založba ZRC|isbn=978-961-254-216-0|pages=111, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Buda belonged to a group of most notable [[Albanian historiography|Albanian politician historians]] during the socialist period in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jürgen Fischer|1999|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buda was a member and a president of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Socialist Thought and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PRVAAAAYAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Jugoslavija|page=62|quote=... Aleks Buda, scientist and President of the Academy of Sciences of Albania, ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sources he was referred to as personal confidant of [[Enver Hoxha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio Free Europe Research: Communist area. Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syxNAAAAYAAJ|date=January 1971|publisher=Radio Free Europe|page=9|quote= Aleks Buda, the country's leading historian and a personal confidant of Enver Hoxha.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buda was the only historian to participate in the [[Albanian Orthography Congress]] held in [[Tirana]] in 20–25 November 1972.&lt;ref name="Myftaraj"/&gt;

He participated at the National Conference of Ethnographic Studies held in 1976 to commemorate 35th anniversary of the establishment of [[Party of Labour of Albania]]. Buda belonged to a group of historians and Marxist philosophers who attacked contemporary theories and trends outside Albania as capitalist and revisionist.&lt;ref name="BoskovicHann2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hysa|first1=Armanda Kodra -|last2=Hann|first2=Chris|last3=Boskovic|first3=Aleksandar|title=The Anthropological Field on the Margins of Europe, 1945-1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPTYAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140|date=31 December 2013|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90507-9|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary historians point to Buda's work as a source for the Albanian position of the origin of Albanians.&lt;ref name="Kola2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kola|first=Paulin|title=The Search for Greater Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nAANq88bBH8C&amp;pg=PA2|date=January 2003|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-664-7|page=2|quote= On the Albanian position on the origins of the Albanian nation see Aleks Buda, ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered as the leading Albanian scholar of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] history who belonged to group of historians who also pointed out that there is no trace of Illyrians between the 6th century (when they were mentioned in historical documents for the last time) and the 11th century (when [[Albanians]] were recorded in historical documents for the first time).&lt;ref name="MusliuBanjac2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Musliu|first1=Fahri|last2=Banjac|first2=Dragan|title=Untying the Kosovo Knot: A Two-sided View|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYxpAAAAMAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia|isbn=978-86-7208-111-4|page=68|quote= - do not support the continuity assumption of the Illyrian ethnogenesis theory: as between the sixth and eleventh centuries there is no trace of the Illyrians (as Aleks Buda, the greatest of Albanian scholars of Illyrian history, ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the hypothesis of Illyrian origin of Albanians, Buda emphasized that Albanians belong to the oldest inhabitants of [[Balkans]] and even [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encounter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfsmAQAAIAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Martin Secker &amp; Warburg.|page=65|quote=The Albanians are among the oldest inhabitants of the Balkans and even Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buda belonged to a small group of intellectuals allowed by the Albanian communist regime to have access to foreign literature in order to use them to prepare new ideological and theoretical directives for the rest of their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Keber2010"/&gt;

She is the translator of ''Seder haTefillot'', the first [[Liberal Judaism|liberal Jewish]] prayerbook after the [[Shoah]] in Germany, and the translator and editor of the German edition of the [[W. Gunther Plaut]]'s [[Torah]] commentary.

She studied Protestant Theology, Bible, and Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Tübingen, Bern, Bonn and Cologne and concluded her studies in 1993 with the first ecclesiastical exam, after which she was admitted as vicar in training on the churches' preparatory employment scheme. In March 1995 she passed the second ecclesiastical exam of the [[Evangelical Church in the Rhineland]]. In 1996 she was admitted to the church's auxiliary service as pastor. On 2 February 1997 she was ordained as a priest of the Evangelical Church of the Rhineland in the community of Unterbarmen-Mitte ([[Wuppertal]], Germany). Until September 1998 she worked primarily at the Kirchliche Hochschule Wuppertal. On 1 October 1998 she was discharged from ecclesiastical service (last position "pastor on probational service"). In February 2000 she did a doctorate in the field of [[Old Testament]] on "God as father" (Guetersloh, 2nd edition, 2002). Shortly after that she converted to Judaism.

From 2000 until 2002 she headed the Berlin branch of the Juedische Verlagsanstalt Berlin, from 2003 until 2004 she was a member of the teaching staff at the [[Abraham-Geiger-Kolleg]] rabbinical seminary in [[Potsdam]]. In 2004 she took up a post as research associate for Bible and Jewish exegesis at the Hochschule für Jüdische Studien in [[Heidelberg]] which she held until 2007. Her fields of research are literary analysis of Bible texts and the reception of the Bible in Jewish liturgy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14302">The '''Association of Canadian Archivists''' ('''ACA'''), established in 1975, is a national not-for-profit organization representing over 600 [[archivist]]s (and those interested in [[archives]] and archivists) in [[Canada]]. With headquarters in [[Ottawa]], the ACA's mandate is to provide leadership to the archival profession and to increase an understanding and appreciation of Canada's archival heritage.

The ACA evolved from the Archives Section of the [[Canadian Historical Association]].&lt;ref name="archivists1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivists.ca/content/about-us |title=About Us &amp;#124; The Association of Canadian Archivists |publisher=Archivists.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years it held its annual conference together with other scholarly groups as part of the Congress of the [[Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences]] (formerly the "Learneds").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fedcan.ca/content/en/514/archives.html |title=CFHSS - FCSH - Archives |publisher=Fedcan.ca |date=2011-11-02 |accessdate=2011-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217152956/http://www.fedcan.ca/content/en/514/Archives.html |archivedate=2012-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivists.ca/content/past-conferences |title=Past Conferences &amp;#124; The Association of Canadian Archivists |publisher=Archivists.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The mission of the ACA is to provide strong and diversified professional leadership and support to the Canadian archival community in the following areas: advocacy; communications; governance; public awareness; and education, research, professional standards and best practices. It does so by: 
* Providing leadership for everyone engaged in the preservation of Canada's Documentary Heritage 
* Encouraging awareness of archival activities and developments and the importance of archives to modern society 
* Advocating the interests and needs of professional archivists before government and other regulatory agencies 
* Communicating to further the understanding and cooperation amongst members of the Canadian archival system, and other information and culture based professions.
* Developing, supporting and delivering initiatives and tools to increase public awareness of archives.&lt;ref name="archivists1"/&gt;

==Activities==
Historically, the ACA produced "Guidelines Toward a Curriculum for a Master's Degree in Archival Science" prepared by Hugh Taylor and Edwin Welch in 1976. These were followed by "Guidelines for the Development of a two-year Curriculum for a Master of Archival Studies" in 1990. In the same year, the ACA collaborated with the Canadian archival community in the development and publication of Canadian archival standards for description, the [[Rules for Archival Description]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivists.ca/content/history |title=History &amp;#124; The Association of Canadian Archivists |publisher=Archivists.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing ACA activities include: the production of a quarterly newsletter (''ACA Bulletin'') and a bi-annual scholarly journal (''[http://archivists.ca/content/archivaria-english Archivaria]''); a publications program for monographs and occasional papers; an archival professional development program; a mentorship program; awards for excellence in writing and research and for contributions to the Canadian archival community; and an annual conference, with meetings and workshops. The ACA has a formal constitution and a Code of Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivists.ca/content/code-ethics |title=Code of Ethics &amp;#124; The Association of Canadian Archivists |publisher=Archivists.ca |date=1999-06-04 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the ACA posted the entire collection of ''Archivaria'' and its predecessor, ''The Canadian Archivist'', to the web, much of which is freely publicly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivists.ca/content/archivaria-english |title=Archivaria - English &amp;#124; The Association of Canadian Archivists |publisher=Archivists.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archivists.ca/content/canadian-archivist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various committees provide support and direction on a variety of archival issues such as Outreach and Professional Learning. In addition, members are appointed to represent the association to address specific issues such as the release of Canadian censuses and the English Commission on the former National Archives of Canada. There also Special Interest Sections (SIS) that allow members interested in particular types of records or who work in a particular kind of archives to get together with others with a similar interest. These SISes include: Aboriginal Archives (SISAA); Access and Privacy (APSIS); Climate Records and Information (CRISIS); Government Records (GRSIS); Municipal Archives (MASIS); Personal Archives (SISPA); Religious Archives (RASIS); Social Justice (SJSIS); Technology and Archives (TaASIS); and University and College Archives (UCASIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivists.ca/content/special-interest-sections |title=Special Interest Sections &amp;#124; The Association of Canadian Archivists |publisher=Archivists.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; TaASIS runs the popular Archives and Technology Unconference (TAATU) in conjunction with the ACA's annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivists.ca/content/technology-and-archives-special-interest-section |title=Technology and Archives Special Interest Section &amp;#124; The Association of Canadian Archivists |publisher=Archivists.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACA also has several student chapters located at Canadian universities that offer graduate programs with an archival studies component. Student chapters are located at Dalhousie University, McGill University, the University of British Columbia Student Chapter and the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivists.ca/content/student-chapters |title=Student Chapters &amp;#124; The Association of Canadian Archivists |publisher=Archivists.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A companion organization, the Association of Canadian Archivists Foundation, raises and grants funds to support the educational and research needs of the Canadian archival profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivists.ca/content/aca-foundation |title=ACA Foundation &amp;#124; The Association of Canadian Archivists |publisher=Archivists.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Lào Cai''' was fought between Chinese and Vietnamese forces during the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]]. Though the Chinese sustained heavy losses in fighting, they were successful in capturing and occupying the city of Lào Cai and the vicinal towns.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning and order of battle==
The Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) [[Kunming Military Region]] took responsibility for Chinese operations in [[Lào Cai]] direction, which involved the 11th and [[13th Group Army|13th Armies]] from the Kunming Military Region itself, and the 14th Army from the [[Chengdu Military Region]], totaling about 125,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dowd, p. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; The three armies was followed by the reserve [[149th Division (People's Republic of China)|149th Division]] of the [[50th Army (People's Republic of China)|50th Army]], as well as many support units.&lt;ref name="Zhang100"/&gt; The invasion comprised three prongs of advances: while the 11th Army was assigned to attack [[Phong Thổ]] before hooking up to [[Sa Pa|Sapa]] and Lào Cai from the west, the 14th Army was ordered to take [[Mường Khương]] and move against Lào Cai from the east; the central thrust was undertaken by the 13th Army, targeting Lào Cai itself, as well as the township of Cam Đường to the south.&lt;ref name="ODowd62"/&gt;

For the Vietnamese side, historians believe that the defense of the Hoàng Liên Sơn Province (modern-day [[Lào Cai Province|Lào Cai]] and [[Yên Bái Province]]s) was conducted by several regiments of the [[Vietnam People's Army]] (VPA), some of which consisted of the regular 345th and [[316th Division (Vietnam)|316th]] Divisions.&lt;ref name="ODowd62"&gt;O'Dowd, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Man Kin, p. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt; The 345th, which had originally been an economic construction unit transformed into a combat division, took responsibility for defending [[Bảo Thắng]], while the elite 316th was garrisoned in the Bình Lư area. The two regular divisions were backed up by some 20,000 troops from regional and militia units.&lt;ref name="Zhang100"/&gt;

==Battle==
The battle began before the dawn of 17 February by a Chinese artillery barrage against Vietnamese positions.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dowd, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The first objectives for the PLA were the towns of [[Bát Xát]], Mường Khương, and Pha Long.&lt;ref name="ODowd62"/&gt; 20,000 troops from the PLA 13th Army crossed the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] into Bát Xát using pontoon bridges, quickly overrunning the Vietnamese defense held by the VPA 192nd Regiment, as well as the independent 2nd and Lao Cai Battalions.&lt;ref name="Zhang100"&gt;Zhang, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; No attack was staged against Phong Thổ on the first day.&lt;ref name="ODowd62"/&gt;

The brunt of Chinese assaults fell on the VPA 345th Division, which resisted toughly.&lt;ref name="ODowd62"/&gt; Two Chinese regiments were held off at Mống Xến and in the area south of Chu Dang and west of Nhạc Sơn, which forced the PLA to change their plan into a mop-up operation against the Vietnamese strongholds. By the dusk of 18 February, the Vietnamese defenders in Bảo Thắng and Cốc Lếu had been completely encircled.&lt;ref name="Zhang100"/&gt; At 14:00 on 19 February, the PLA captured Lào Cai City.&lt;ref name="ODowd62"/&gt; In response to the lost of the provincial capital, the VPA 345th Division command sent one battalion from its 118th Regiment to reinforce its 121th Regiment's positions at Coc Tha, Dien Na, Dung Ha and Chan Uy, while the VPA 316th Division was mobilized eastward to Sapa.&lt;ref name="Zhang101"/&gt;

Having Lào Cai taken, the PLA then sent troops, presumably from the 13th Army, to Cam Đường to the south, and another group (probably from the 14th Army) advancing along Highway 4D to Sapa, which was 38&amp;nbsp;km to the southwest.&lt;ref name="ODowd62"/&gt; The Kunming Military Region Command used fresh elements from the 149th Division and the 11th Army to reinforce the 13th Army in the efforts against Cam Đường. A blocking position was established by four companies from the PLA 39th Division of the 13th Army on Highway 10 at Thay Nai to cut the VPA 345th Division from supply.&lt;ref name="Zhang101"/&gt; The VPA 316th Division was then dispatched from Sapa to meet the approaching Chinese forces, and ran into contact on the secondary road between Lào Cai and Sapa on 22 February.&lt;ref name="ODowd62"/&gt; From 22 to 25 February, its 148th Regiment launched repetitive attacks against the Chinese block at Thay Nai, yet failing to secure its way to Cam Đường.&lt;ref name="Zhang101"&gt;Zhang, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Two PLA divisions from the 13th Army, the 37th and 38th, were deployed against the VPA 345th Division, which was defending a narrow area north of Cam Đường.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; By 25 February, the Chinese had seized Cam Đường, yet were still struggling to exterminate pockets of Vietnamese resistance in Lào Cai and other towns under their control, a situation which had not ended until 27 February.&lt;ref name="ODowd62"/&gt;

On 24 February, the PLA decided to supplement their reserves, the 149th Division, to the fight against the VPA 316th Division.&lt;ref name="Zhang103"&gt;Zhang, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese efforts now concentrating on cutting off the retreat of the VPA 316th Division, as the PLA 447th Regiment skirted around [[Fansipan|Mount Phan Xi Pang]] through the Hoang Lien Son Pass and maneuvered toward the direction of Bình Lư, which was 44&amp;nbsp;km west of Sapa.&lt;ref name="ODowd63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang103"/&gt; In meantime, the rest of the 149th Division pushed toward Sapa along two roads parallel to Highway 10. Despite showing excellent combat performance, the VPA 316th Division was finally forced to retreat due to the lack of manpower.&lt;ref name="Zhang103"/&gt; At 14:45 on 1 March, Sapa fell to the PLA. On the eastern wing of the offensive, Khoc Tiam succumbed to a night assault raging from 20:00 on 2 March to 14:45 on 3 March. At 19:00 on 3 March, all roads that connected Phong Thổ with Bình Lư and [[Pa Tần]] had been under Chinese control. On 4 March, Chinese forces eventually captured the town, thus successfully blocking the supply route to the VPA 316th Division from [[Lai Châu]]; the blocking position was at least 40&amp;nbsp;km from the Sino-Vietnamese border, becoming the deepest Chinese penetration in the war. The 316th Division finally ceased fighting on 5 March.&lt;ref name="ODowd63"&gt;O'Dowd, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Chinese government announced the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the end, the Chinese claimed to have inflicted 13,500 Vietnamese casualties, while suffering 2,812 killed out of 7,886 casualties of their own.&lt;ref name="Zhang104"&gt;Zhang, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Vietnamese accounts put the number of Chinese casualties at 11,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Link language|vi}}&lt;!--Vietnamese--&gt; Trường Sơn, [http://infonet.vn/bien-gioi-phia-bac-1979-30-ngay-khong-the-nao-quen-2-post158488.info "Biên giới phía Bắc 1979: 30 ngày không thể nào quên (2)"], ''Infonet'', 17 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the fighting in other fronts, during the Lao Cai campaign, the "[[Human wave attack|human wave]]" tactic was thoroughly applied by the PLA for every smallest objective, as portrayed by a Vietnamese soldier in an interview by French journalist Jean-Pierre Gallois: "The Chinese infantry advance shoulder to shoulder to make sure the minefields are cleared... When they moved out of Lao Cai they were as numerous and close together as rice in the paddy fields."&lt;ref name="ODowd63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Foreign Broadcast Information Service|FBIS]], ''Southeast Asia'', 26 February 1979, p. K-13.&lt;/ref&gt; As Sapa was a town possessing almost no strategic value, the Chinese campaign in the western front did not end with a notable victory. The PLA did, however, succeed in one of their key goals – engaging a considerable Vietnamese regular force and inflicting heavy losses on it – even at a high price for themselves as well.&lt;ref name="Zhang104"/&gt;

The '''British School at Rome''' (BSR) is an interdisciplinary research centre supporting the arts, humanities and architecture.

==History==
The British School at Rome (BSR) was established in 1901 and granted a UK [[Royal Charter]] in 1912. Its mission is "to promote knowledge of and deep engagement with all aspects of the art, history and culture of Italy by scholars and fine artists from Britain and the Commonwealth, and to foster international and interdisciplinary exchange."&lt;ref name="Wallace-Hadrill, A. 2001"&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, A., 2001. ''The British School at Rome: One Hundred Years'', London: British School at Rome&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[International Exhibition of Art (1911)|International Exhibition of Art]] in Rome in 1911, the site of the [[Edwin Lutyens]]-designed British Pavilion in the [[Valle Giulia]] was granted to the UK on condition that it be used exclusively as a British research centre for archaeology, history and the fine arts. In 1916, after significant adaptation by Lutyens, the BSR moved into what is still its home.&lt;ref name="Wallace-Hadrill, A. 2001" /&gt; In 2002, a purpose-built lecture theatre and gallery spaces, designed by [[Hugh Petter]] and sponsored by the [[Sainsbury family]], were opened by HRH [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]].&lt;ref&gt;John, Richard, 2010. ''Robert Adam: The Search for a Modern Classicism'', Images Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The BSR is immediately adjacent to the [[Villa Borghese gardens]] and the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]].

==Awards and fellowships==
The BSR awards residential scholarships and fellowships to artists and scholars from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] for periods of three to twelve months. The awardees live in the BSR building and have access to its specialist reference library.&lt;ref name=Library&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a-n.co.uk/artists_talking/artists_stories/single/442341 |publisher=a-n | title=Walter, John, 2008.

Awards, based on an open access application system, are made in the following fields: Archaeology of Italy and the Mediterranean; [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] and [[Middle Ages|Medieval History]]; [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment studies]]; Modern Italian Studies; [[History of Architecture|Architectural History]]; [[Architecture]] including [[Landscape architecture|Landscape Architecture]]; contemporary [[visual arts]] practice.&lt;ref name=Award&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abbey.org.uk/about_the_awards.php | title=Abbey Awards scholarships in painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance and leadership ==
The British School at Rome is one of the sponsored institutes of the [[British Academy]], whilst maintaining itself as an autonomous body.&lt;ref name=Institute&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/intl/index-basis.cfm | title=Academy-Sponsored Institutes | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313045132/http://www.britac.ac.uk/intl/index-basis.cfm | archivedate=2016-03-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It receives financial support from the British Academy, award sponsors, private donors and its membership,&lt;ref name=Funding&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bsr.ac.uk/about | title=Financial Support}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|314176|THE BRITISH SCHOOL AT ROME}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSR is led by a Director, who has traditionally been a senior scholar in the fields of Classical history, art history, or archaeology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14365">'''Charles Hutchins Hapgood''' (May 17, 1904 – December 21, 1982)&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt; was an [[United States|American]] college professor and author who became one of the best known advocates of the claim of a rapid and recent [[Cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis|pole shift]] with catastrophic results.

==Biography==
Hapgood received a [[master's degree]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1929 in medieval and modern [[History]].  His Ph.D. work on the [[French Revolution]] was interrupted by the [[Great Depression]].  He taught for a year in [[Vermont]] and directed a community center in [[Provincetown]], also serving as the executive secretary of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s Crafts Commission.

During [[World War II]], Hapgood was employed by the Center of Information (which later became the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and then the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) and the [[Red Cross]], and also served as a liaison officer between the [[White House]] and the Office of the Secretary of the War. After the war, Hapgood taught at [[Keystone College]] (1945–1947), [[Springfield College]] (1947–1952), [[Keene State College]] (1956–1966), and [[New England College]] (1966–1967), lecturing in world and American history, anthropology, economics, and the history of science.

Hapgood married Tamsin Hughes in 1941 but divorced in 1955. He was struck by a car in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts]], and died on December 21, 1982.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;

While at Springfield College, a student's question about the [[Mu (lost continent)|Lost Continent of Mu]] prompted a class project to investigate the lost continent of [[Atlantis]], leading Hapgood to investigate possible ways that massive earth changes could occur and exposing him to the literature of [[Hugh Auchincloss Brown]].

In 1958, Hapgood published ''The Earth's Shifting Crust'' which denied the existence of [[continental drift]] and included a foreword by [[Albert Einstein]]. In ''Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings'' (1966) and ''The Path of the Pole'' (1970), Hapgood proposed the hypothesis that the Earth's axis has shifted numerous times during geological history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/eathsshiftingcru033562mbp/eathsshiftingcru033562mbp_djvu.txt Full text of ''Earths Shifting Crust''], [https://archive.org/ archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Path of the Pole'' was meant as a replacement for ''The Earth's Shifting Crust'' after corrections were suggested to him. Hapgood writes in ''Voices of Spirit'' (1975): "In later discussions we discussed the theories of my book ‘Earth’s Shifting Crust’, and he [Einstein] suggested that one of them was wrong; as a result of this I revised my book, which subsequently was republished as ‘The Path of the Pole’. My own further research confirmed the truth of his observation, which involved technicalities of geophysics.”

In ''Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings'' he supported the suggestion made by Arlington Mallery that a part of the [[Piri Reis Map]] was a depiction of the area of [[Antarctica]] known as [[Queen Maud Land]]. He used this to propose that a 15 degree pole shift occurred around 9,600 BCE (approx. 11,600 years ago) and that a part of the Antarctic was ice-free at that time, and that an [[ice-age]] civilization could have mapped the coast. 
He concludes that "Antarctica was mapped when these parts were free of ice", taking that view that an Antarctic warm period coincided with the last ice age in the Northern hemisphere, and that the Piri Reis and other maps were based on "ancient" maps derived from ice-age originals.&lt;ref name="Hapggod Sea Kings" /&gt; Later research concerning the [[paleoclimatology]] and [[ice sheets]] of Antarctica have completely discredited the interpretations by Hapgood that an Antarctic warm period coincided with the last glacial period in the Northern hemisphere and any part of it had been ice-free at and prior to 9,600 BCE (approx. 11,600 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;Ingolfsson, O., C. Hjort, and O. Humlum (2003) "Glacial and Climate History of the Antarctic Peninsula since the Last Glacial Maximum." ''Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research''. v. 35, no. 2, pp. 175–186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. B., S. S. Shipp, A. L. Lowe, J. S. Wellner, J. S., and A. B. Mosola (2002) "The Antarctic Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum and its subsequent retreat history: a review". ''Quaternary Science Reviews''. v. 21, pp. 49–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingolfsson, O. (2004) [http://www.hi.is/~oi/AG-326%202006%20readings/Antarctica/Ingolfsson_SUMMARY.pdf ''Quaternary glacial and climate history of Antarctica.''] in: J. Ehlers and P. L. Gibbard, eds., pp. 3–43, ''Quaternary Glaciations: Extent and Chronology 3: Part III: South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica''. [[Elsevier]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hapgood also examined a 1531 map by French mathematician and cartographer [[Oronce Finé]] (aka ''Oronteus Finaeus''). In ''Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings'', he reproduces letters that he states he received from the chief of a U.S. Air Force cartography section stationed at [[Westover AFB]] in 1961. These letters say that at Hapgood's request, they had studied both Piri Reis and Oronce Finé maps during their off-duty hours, concluding that both were compiled from original source maps of Antarctica at a time when it was relatively free of ice, supporting Hapgood's findings.&lt;ref name="Hapggod Sea Kings"&gt;{{cite book|last=Charles H. |first=Hapgood|title=Maps of the ancient sea kings: evidence of advanced civilization in the ice age |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iLG2D5eBswC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=charles+hapgood+u.s.+air+force#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20hapgood%20u.s.%20air%20force&amp;f=false|year=1966|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|isbn=978-0-932813-42-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hapgood concluded that advanced cartographic knowledge appears on the Piri Reis map and the Oronteus Finaeus map, and must be the result of some unknown ancient civilization that developed advanced scientific knowledge before other civilizations such as Greece.&lt;ref name="Aramco" /&gt;

According to historians Paul Hoye and Paul Lunde, while Hapgood's work garnered some enthusiasm and praise for its thoroughness, his revolutionary hypotheses largely met with skepticism and were ignored by most scholars.&lt;ref name="Aramco"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198001/piri.reis.and.the.hapgood.hypotheses.htm|title=Piri Reis and the Hapgood Hypotheses|last=Hoye|first=Paul F|author2=Paul Lunde|year=1980|journal=[[Saudi Aramco World]]|volume=31|issue= 1 |pages=18–31|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''The Piri Reis Map of 1513'' Gregory C. McIntosh examines Hapgood's claims for both maps and states that "they fall short of proving or even strongly suggesting that the Piri Reis map and the Fine map depict the actual outline of Antarctica."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Gregory C.|title=The Piri Reis Map of 1513|year=2000|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|isbn=978-0-8203-2157-8|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McIntosh|first=Gregory C.|title=The Tale of Two Admirals: Columbus and the Piri Reis Map of 1513|url=http://www.diegocuoghi.it/Piri_Reis/McIntosh/McIntosh_PiriReis.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716074653/http://www.diegocuoghi.it/Piri_Reis/McIntosh/McIntosh_PiriReis.htm|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hapgood's unorthodox interpretations such as “[[Pole shift hypothesis|Earth Crustal Displacement]]” were never accepted as valid competing scientific hypotheses, yet his ideas have found popularity in alternative circles. Librarians Rose and [[Rand Flem-Ath]] as well as author and former journalist [[Graham Hancock]] base portions of their works on Hapgood's evidence for catastrophe at the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/tracing_graham_hancockrsquos_shifting_cataclysm/|title=Tracing Graham Hancock’s Shifting Cataclysm|last=Brass|first=Michael|year=2002|publisher=[[The Skeptical Inquirer]]|accessdate=4 November 2010|location=Volume 26.4, July / August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hapgood's ideas also figure prominently in the 2009 sci-fi/disaster movie ''[[2012 (film)|2012]].''

==Acambaro figurines==
Hapgood and [[Erle Stanley Gardner]] thought the collection of clay artifacts known as the [[Acambaro figurines]] were created thousands of years ago. The date estimate as well as the notion the artifacts were made by some undiscovered culture was rejected by [[archeologist]]s and [[paleontologist]]s.&lt;ref name="Mayor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayor|first=Adrienne| authorlink = Adrienne Mayor|title=Fossil legends of the first Americans  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMsgQQkmFqQC&amp;pg=PA336&amp;dq=Ac%C3%A1mbaro+figures+hapgood#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-11345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figurines, which most archaeologists dismiss as an elaborate hoax, depict oddities such as dinosaurs coexisting with men and horned humans. In the introduction to later editions of Hapgood's 1973 book, ''Mystery in Acambaro'', [[David Hatcher Childress]] wrote that Hapgood and Gardner thought the figurines were genuine and were evidence that orthodox understandings of [[dinosaur extinction]] were wrong.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acambaro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hapgood|first=Charles H. |title=Mystery in Acambaro  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gx5aVytf69MC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Ac%C3%A1mbaro+figures+hapgood#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1999|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|isbn=978-0-932813-76-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elwood Babbitt==
Hapgood spent ten years working with [[New England]] [[mediumship|medium]] [[Elwood Babbitt]] (b. 1922), attempting to make contact with notable figures from the past. Babbitt, a retired carpenter and World War II veteran, had studied trance mediumship at [[Edgar Cayce]]'s [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]. Hapgood audiotaped and transcribed a number of Babbitt's "trance lectures" which purported to come from [[Jesus]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mark Twain]], and the Hindu god [[Vishnu]],&lt;ref name="UMass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umass.edu/spcoll/umarmot/?s=Babbitt%2C+Elwood%2C+1922-|title=Elwood Babbitt Papers|work=Special Collections &amp; University Archives|publisher=[[University of Massachusetts]]|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the material to publish his final three books:''Voices of Spirit, Through the Psychic Experience of Elwood Babbitt'' (1975), ''Talks with Christ and His Teachers Through the Psychic Gift of Elwood Babbitt'' (1981), and ''The God Within: a Testament of Vishnu, a Handbook for the Spiritual Renaissance'' (1982).

Hapgood Papers|publisher=[[Yale University Library]]|accessdate=5 November 2010|location=[[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Babbitt and Hapgood's cousin, Beth Hapgood worked closely with the nearby [[Renaissance Community|Brotherhood of the Spirit]] New Age commune. After Charles Hapgood's death, Beth Hapgood, assembled a final volume of Babbitt's trance lectures, ''Dare the Vision and Endure'' (1997).

The '''Chinese Civil War''' was a war fought between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT)-led [[Nationalist Government|government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC). Although particular attention is paid to the four years of [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] from 1945 to 1949, the war actually started in August 1927, with the [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]] at the end of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Northern Expedition]], and essentially ended when major hostilities between the two sides ceased in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Lew | editor1-first = Christopher R. | editor2-first =  Pak-Wah | editor2-last = Leung  | year = 2013 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Chinese Civil War | publisher = Maryland : The Scarecrow Press, Inc. | location = Lanham |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8WYSAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v= | isbn = 9780810878730 | ref = harv}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict took place in two stages: the first between 1927 and 1937, and the second from 1946 to 1950, with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937–1945 separating them. The war marked a major turning point in modern Chinese history, with the Communists gaining control of mainland China and establishing the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in 1949, forcing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) to retreat to Taiwan. It resulted in a lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]], with the ROC in [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and the PRC on [[mainland China]] with both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all China.

The war represented an [[Ideology|ideological]] split between the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and the [[Nationalist Party of China]] (or Kuomintang). Conflict continued intermittently until late 1937, when the two parties came together to form the [[Second United Front]] to counter the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] threat and to prevent the country from crumbling. Full-scale civil war in China resumed in 1946, a year after the end of hostilities with the [[Empire of Japan]] in September 1945. Four years later came the cessation of major military activity, with the newly founded People's Republic of China controlling mainland China (including the island of [[Hainan]]), and the Republic of China's jurisdiction restricted to Taiwan, [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen|Quemoy]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and [[list of islands of the Republic of China|several outlying islands]].

As of November 2018 no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, and the debate continues as to whether the civil war has legally ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Contemporary Law of Armed Conflict | author = Leslie C. Green | page = 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between both sides, officially called the [[Cross-Strait relations]], have been hindered by [[military threat]]s and political and economic pressure, particularly over [[political status of Taiwan|Taiwan's political status]], with both governments officially adhering to the [[One-China policy]]. The PRC still actively claims Taiwan as part of its territory and continues to threaten the ROC with a military invasion if the ROC officially declares [[Taiwan Independence|independence]] by changing its name to and gaining [[diplomatic recognition|international recognition]] as the "Republic of Taiwan". The ROC, for its part, claims mainland China, and both parties continue the fight over diplomatic recognition. {{As of | 2018}} the war as such occurs on the political and economic fronts without actual military action. However, the two separate governments in China have close economic ties.&lt;ref name="so"&gt;

== Background ==
{{History of the Republic of China}}

Following the collapse of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the aftermath of the [[Xinhai Revolution]], China fell into a brief period of civil war before [[Yuan Shikai]] assumed the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]] of the newly formed Republic of China.&lt;ref name="so" /&gt; The administration became known as the [[Beiyang Government]], with its capital in Peking. After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, the following years were characterized by the [[Warlord Era|power struggle]]  between different cliques in the former [[Beiyang Army]]. In the meantime, the [[Kuomintang]], led by [[Sun Yat-sen]], created a new government in [[Guangzhou]] to resist the rule of Beiyang Government through [[Constitutional Protection Movement|a series of movements]].

Sun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western countries were ignored, thus he turned to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921. For political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established [[Communist Party of China]], which would eventually found the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Thus the struggle for power in China began between the KMT and the CPC.

In 1923, a joint statement by Sun and Soviet representative [[Adolph Joffe]] in [[Shanghai]] pledged Soviet assistance to China's unification.&lt;ref name="March"&gt;March, G. Patrick. Eastern Destiny: Russia in Asia and the North Pacific. [1996] (1996). Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|0-275-95566-4}}. pg 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sun-Joffe Manifesto]] was a declaration of cooperation among the [[Comintern]], KMT and CPC.&lt;ref name="March" /&gt; Comintern agent [[Mikhail Borodin]] arrived in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. The CPC joined the KMT to form the [[First United Front]].&lt;ref name="Hsiung" /&gt;

In 1923, Sun sent [[Chiang Kai-shek]], one of his lieutenants from his [[Tongmenghui]] days, for several months of military and political study in the Soviet capital [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="ChangH"&gt;Chang, H.H. Chang. [2007] (2007). Chiang Kai Shek – Asia's Man of Destiny. {{ISBN|1-4067-5818-3}}. pg 126&lt;/ref&gt; By 1924, Chiang became the head of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], and rose to prominence as Sun's successor as head of the KMT.&lt;ref name="ChangH" /&gt;

The Soviets provided the academy with much educational material, organization and equipment, including munitions.&lt;ref name="ChangH" /&gt; They also provided education in many of the techniques for mass mobilization. With this aid, Sun was able to raise a dedicated "army of the party," with which he hoped to defeat the warlords militarily. CPC members were also present in the academy, and many of them became instructors, including [[Zhou Enlai]], who was made a political instructor.&lt;ref name="HoA"&gt;Ho, Alfred K. Ho, Alfred Kuo-liang. [2004] (2004). China's Reforms and Reformers. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|0-275-96080-3}}. pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist members were allowed to join the KMT on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="March" /&gt; The CPC itself was still small at the time, having a membership of 300 in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925.&lt;ref name="Fairbank"&gt;Fairbank, John King. [1994] (1994). China: A New History. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-11673-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1923, the KMT had 50,000 members.&lt;ref name="Fairbank" /&gt;

However, after Sun died in 1925, the KMT split into left- and right-wing movements. KMT members worried that the Soviets were trying to destroy the KMT from inside using the CPC. The CPC then began movements in opposition of the [[Northern Expedition]], passing a resolution against it at a party meeting.

Then, in March 1927, the KMT held its second party meeting where the Soviets helped pass resolutions against the Expedition and curbing Chiang's power. Soon, the KMT would be clearly divided.

Throughout this time the Soviet Union had a large impact on the Communist Party of China. They sent money and spies to support the Chinese Communist Party. Without their support the communist party would have failed. There are documents showing of other communist parties in China at the time, one with as many as 10,000 members, but they all failed without support from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The man who changed China: the life and legacy of Jiang Zemin|last=Kuhn|first=Robert|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Expedition and KMT-CPC split ===

In early 1927, the KMT-CPC rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CPC and the left wing of the KMT had decided to move the seat of the KMT government from [[Guangzhou]] to [[Wuhan]], where communist influence was strong.&lt;ref name="Fairbank" /&gt; However, Chiang and [[Li Zongren]], whose armies defeated warlord [[Sun Chuanfang]], moved eastward toward [[Jiangxi]]. The leftists rejected Chiang's demand to eliminate Communist influence within KMT and Chiang denounced them for betraying Sun Yat-sen's [[Three Principles of the People]] by taking orders from the Soviet Union. According to [[Mao Zedong]], Chiang's tolerance of the CPC in the KMT camp decreased as his power increased.&lt;ref&gt;Zedong, Mao. Thompson, Roger R. [1990] (1990). Report from Xunwu. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-2182-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, Chiang and several other KMT leaders held a meeting, during which they proposed that Communist activities were socially and economically disruptive and had to be undone for the Nationalist revolution to proceed. On April 12, in Shanghai, many Communist members in the KMT were purged through hundreds of arrests and executions&lt;ref name="Brune"&gt;Brune, Lester H. Dean Burns, Richard Dean Burns. [2003] (2003). Chronological History of U.S. Foreign Relations. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-93914-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on the orders of General [[Bai Chongxi]]. The CPC referred to this as the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|April 12 Incident]] or [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|Shanghai Massacre]].&lt;ref name="Zhaos"&gt;Zhao, Suisheng. [2004] (2004). A Nation-state by Construction: Dynamics of Modern Chinese Nationalism. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-5001-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This incident widened the rift between Chiang and [[Wang Jingwei]], another warlord who controlled the city of Wuhan.

Eventually, the left wing of the KMT also expelled CPC members from the Wuhan government, which in turn was toppled by Chiang Kai-shek. The KMT resumed its campaign against [[Warlord era|warlords]] and captured Beijing in June 1928.&lt;ref name="Guo"&gt;Guo, Xuezhi. [2002] (2002). The Ideal Chinese Political Leader: A Historical and Cultural Perspective. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|0-275-97259-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, most of [[East China|eastern China]] was under the control of the Nanjing central government, which received prompt international recognition as the sole legitimate government of China. The KMT government announced, in conformity with Sun Yat-sen, the formula for the three stages of revolution: military unification, political tutelage, and constitutional democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore De Bary, William.

On 1 August 1927, the Communist Party launched an [[Nanchang uprising|uprising]] in [[Nanchang]] against the Nationalist government in [[Wuhan]]. This conflict led to the creation of the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army|Red Army]].&lt;ref name=Nanchang/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Lai to. Trade Unions in China: 1949 To the Present.

Nationalist forces quickly reoccupied Nanchang while the remaining members of the CPC in Nanchang went into hiding.&lt;ref name=Nanchang/&gt; A CPC meeting on August 7 confirmed the objective of the party is to seize the political power by force, but the CPC was quickly suppressed the next day on August 8 by the Nationalist government in Wuhan led by Wang Jingwei. On August 14, Chiang Kai-shek announced his temporary retirement, as the Wuhan faction and Nanjing faction of the Kuomintang were allied once again with common goal of suppressing the Communist Party after the earlier split.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Chiang1926.jpg|thumb|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Commander-in-Chief of the [[National Revolutionary Army]], emerged from the [[Northern Expedition]] as the leader of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].]]

Attempts were later made by the CPC to take the cities of [[Changsha]], [[Shantou]] and Guangzhou. The Red Army consisting of mutinous former National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers as well as armed [[peasant]]s established control over several areas in [[southern China]].&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;  KMT forces continued to attempt to suppress the rebellions.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; Then, in September, Wang Jingwei was forced out of Wuhan. September also saw an unsuccessful armed rural insurrection, known as the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]], led by [[Mao Zedong]].&lt;ref name="Blasko"&gt;Blasko, Dennis J. [2006] (2006).

In November, Chiang Kai-shek went to Shanghai and invited Wang to join him. On December 11, the CPC started the [[Guangzhou Uprising]], establishing a soviet there the next day, but lost the city by December 13 to a counter-attack under the orders of General [[Zhang Fakui]]. On December 16, Wang Jingwei fled to France. There were now three capitals in China: the internationally recognized republic capital in [[Beijing]], the CPC and [[left-wing]] KMT at [[Wuhan]] and the right-wing KMT regime at [[Nanjing]], which would remain the KMT capital for the next decade.&lt;ref name="Esherick"&gt;Esherick, Joseph.

This marked the beginning of a ten-year armed struggle, known in mainland China as the "Ten-Year Civil War" (十年内战) which ended with the [[Xi'an Incident]] when Chiang Kai-shek was forced to form the [[Second United Front (China)|Second United Front]] against invading forces from [[Japan]]. In 1930 the [[Central Plains War]] broke out as an internal conflict of the KMT. It was launched by [[Feng Yuxiang]], [[Yan Xishan]] and [[Wang Jingwei]]. The attention was turned to root out remaining pockets of Communist activity in a series of five [[Encirclement Campaigns|encirclement campaigns]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Lynch, Michael Lynch.

Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-21577-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[first Encirclement Campaign against Hubei-Henan-Anhui Soviet|first]] and [[second Encirclement Campaign against Honghu Soviet|second]] campaigns failed and the [[third Encirclement Campaign against Honghu Soviet|third]] was aborted due to the [[Mukden Incident]]. The [[fourth Encirclement Campaign against Hubei-Henan-Anhui Soviet|fourth campaign]] (1932–1933) achieved some early successes, but Chiang's armies were badly mauled when they tried to penetrate into the heart of Mao's [[Soviet Chinese Republic]]. During these campaigns, KMT columns struck swiftly into Communist areas, but were easily engulfed by the vast countryside and were not able to consolidate their foothold.

Finally, in late 1934, Chiang launched a [[fifth Encirclement Campaign against Hubei-Henan-Anhui Soviet|fifth campaign]] that involved the systematic encirclement of the [[Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet|Jiangxi Soviet]] region with fortified [[blockhouse]]s.&lt;ref name="Manwaring"&gt;Manwaring, Max G.

Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|0-275-96768-9}}. pg 58&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous campaigns in which they penetrated deeply in a single strike, this time the KMT troops patiently built blockhouses, each separated by about five miles, to surround the Communist areas and cut off their supplies and food sources.&lt;ref name="Manwaring" /&gt;

[[File:National Revolutionary Army troops.png|thumb|NRA soldiers marching]]
[[File:National Revolutionary Army artillery.png|thumb|NRA troops firing artillery at Communist forces]]

In October 1934 the CPC took advantage of gaps in the ring of blockhouses (manned by the forces of a warlord ally of Chiang Kai-shek's, rather than regular KMT troops) and broke out of the encirclement. The warlord armies were reluctant to challenge Communist forces for fear of losing their own men and did not pursue the CPC with much fervor. In addition, the main KMT forces were preoccupied with annihilating [[Zhang Guotao]]'s army, which was much larger than Mao's. The massive military retreat of Communist forces lasted a year and covered what Mao estimated as 12,500&amp;nbsp;km (25,000 [[Li (unit)|Li]]); it became known as the [[Long March]].&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;Zhang, Chunhou. Vaughan, C. Edwin. [2002] (2002). Mao Zedong as Poet and Revolutionary Leader: Social and Historical Perspectives. Lexington books. {{ISBN|0-7391-0406-3}}. p 65, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; The Long March was a military retreat taken on by the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong to evade the pursuit or attack of the Kuomintang army. It consisted of a series of marches, during which numerous Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. Over the course of the march from Jiangxi the First Front Army, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of annihilation by Chiang Kai Shek's troops as their stronghold was in Jiangxi. The Communists, under the command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, "escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed over 9,000 kilometers over 370 days". The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, and then northwards towards Shaanxi. "In November 1935, shortly after settling in northern Shaanxi, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the Red Army. Following a major reshuffling of official roles, Mao became the chairman of the Military Commission, with Zhou and Deng Xiaoping as vice-chairmen." This marked Mao's position as the pre-eminent leader of the Party, with Zhou in second position to him.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The march ended when the CPC reached the interior of [[Shaanxi]]. [[Zhang Guotao]]'s army, which took a different route through northwest China, was largely destroyed by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] allies, the [[Ma clique]]. Along the way, the Communist army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor, solidifying its appeal to the masses. Of the 90,000–100,000 people who began the Long March from the Soviet Chinese Republic, only around 7,000–8,000 made it to Shaanxi.&lt;ref name="Bianco"&gt;[[Lucien Bianco|Bianco, Lucien]].

Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0827-4}}. pg 68&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of Zhang's forces eventually joined Mao in Shaanxi, but with his army destroyed, Zhang, even as a founding member of the CPC, was never able to challenge Mao's authority. Essentially, the great retreat made Mao the undisputed leader of the Communist Party of China.

The Kuomintang used [[Kham]]pa troops—who were former bandits—to battle the Communist Red Army as it advanced and to undermine local warlords who often refused to fight Communist forces to conserve their own strength. The KMT enlisted 300 "Khampa bandits" into its Consolatory Commission military in Sichuan, where they were part of the effort of the central government to penetrate and destabilize local Han warlords such as [[Liu Wenhui]]. The government was seeking to exert full control over frontier areas against the warlords. Liu had refused to battle the Communists in order to conserve his army. The Consolatory Commission forces were used to battle the Red Army, but they were defeated when their religious leader was captured by the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=2011-12-27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=force+of+about+300+soldiers+was+organized+and+augmented+by+recruiting+local+Khampa+bandits+into+the+army&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5vcDT6LcBeTV0QG_6rUB&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=force%20of%20about%20300%20soldiers%20was%20organized%20and%20augmented%20by%20recruiting%20local%20Khampa%20bandits%20into%20the%20army&amp;f=false|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Kourney to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|editor=|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|edition=illustrated|location=|volume=Volume 67 of Routledge studies in the modern history of Asia |page=52 |quote=A force of about 300 soldiers was organized and augmented by recruiting local Khampa bandits into the army.

In 1936, Zhou Enlai and Zhang Xueliang grew closer, with Zhang even suggesting that he join the CPC. However, this was turned down by the Comintern in the USSR. Later on, Zhou persuaded Zhang and [[Yang Hucheng]], another warlord, to instigate the Xi'an Incident. Chiang was placed under house arrest and forced to stop his attacks on the Red Army, instead focusing on the Japanese threat.

{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist bases (striped)]]

During Japan's invasion and [[Manchukuo|occupation of Manchuria]] Chiang Kai-shek, who saw the CPC as a greater threat, refused to ally with them to fight against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Chiang preferred to unite China by eliminating the warlords and CPC forces first. He believed that he was still too weak to launch an offensive to chase out Japan and that China needed time for a military build-up. Only after unification would it be possible for the KMT to mobilize a war against Japan. So he would rather ignore the discontent and anger among Chinese people at his policy of compromise with the Japanese, and ordered KMT generals [[Zhang Xueliang]] and [[Yang Hucheng]] to carry out suppression of the CPC; however, their provincial forces suffered significant casualties in battles with the Red Army.[https://web.archive.org/web/20121207115613/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34H7514H12570.html ref]

On 12 December 1936, the disgruntled Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng conspired to kidnap Chiang and force him into a truce with the CPC. The incident became known as the [[Xi'an Incident]].&lt;ref name="Ye"&gt;Ye, Zhaoyan Ye, Berry, Michael. [2003] (2003). Nanjing 1937: A Love Story. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-12754-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties suspended fighting to form a [[Second United Front (China)|Second United Front]] to focus their energies and fighting against the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Ye" /&gt; In 1937 Japan launched its full-scale invasion of China and its well-equipped troops overran KMT defenders in northern and coastal China.

The alliance of CPC and KMT was in name only.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;Buss, Claude Albert. [1972] (1972). Stanford Alumni Association. The People's Republic of China and Richard Nixon. United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the KMT troops, CPC shunned [[conventional warfare]] and instead engaged in [[guerrilla warfare]] against the Japanese. The level of actual cooperation and coordination between the CPC and KMT during [[World War II]] was at best minimal.&lt;ref name="Buss" /&gt; In the midst of the Second United Front, the CPC and the KMT were still vying for territorial advantage in "[[Free China (Second Sino-Japanese War)|Free China]]" (i.e., areas not occupied by the Japanese or ruled by Japanese [[puppet state|puppet governments]] such as [[Manchukuo]] and the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]).&lt;ref name="Buss" /&gt;

The situation came to a head in late 1940 and early 1941 when clashes between Communist and KMT forces intensified. In December 1940 Chiang demanded that the CPC's [[New Fourth Army]] evacuate [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]] Provinces due to its provocation and harassment of KMT forces in this area. Under intense pressure, the New Fourth Army commanders complied. In 1941 they were [[New Fourth Army incident|ambushed]] by KMT forces during their evacuation, which led to several thousand deaths.&lt;ref name="schok"&gt;Schoppa, R. Keith. [2000] (2000). The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-11276-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also ended the Second United Front, which had been formed earlier to fight the Japanese.&lt;ref name="schok" /&gt;

Despite the intensified clashes between the CPC and KMT, countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union attempted to prevent a disastrous civil war. After the [[New Fourth Army incident]], US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent [[special envoy]] [[Lauchlin Currie]] to talk with Chiang Kai-shek and KMT party leaders to express their concern regarding the hostility between the two parties, with Currie stating that the only ones to benefit from a civil war would be the Japanese. In 1941 the Soviet Union, with its closer alliance to the CPC, also sent an imperative telegram to Mao warning that the civil war would also make the situation easier for the Japanese military. Due to the international community's efforts, there was a temporary and superficial peace. In 1943 Chiang attacked the CPC with the propaganda piece ''China's Destiny'', which questioned the CPC's power after the war, while the CPC strongly opposed Chiang's leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image. Both leaders knew that a deadly battle had begun between themselves.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;Chen, Jian. [2001] (2001). Mao's China and the Cold War. The University of North Carolina Press. {{ISBN|0-807-84932-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, developments in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] were to the advantage of the CPC, as its guerrilla war tactics had won them popular support within the Japanese-occupied areas. However, the KMT had to defend the country against the main Japanese campaigns, since it was the legal Chinese government, and this proved costly to Chiang Kai-shek and his troops. In 1944 Japan launched its last major offensive against the KMT, [[Operation Ichi-Go]], which resulted in the severe weakening of Chiang's forces.&lt;ref name="Lary"&gt;Lary, Diana. [2007] (2007). China's Republic. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-84256-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The CPC also suffered fewer losses through their guerrilla tactics. By the end of the war, the Red Army had grown to more than 1.3 million members, with a separate militia of over 2.6 million members. About one hundred million people lived in CPC-controlled zones.

Under the terms of the Japanese [[unconditional surrender]] dictated by the United States, Japanese troops were ordered to surrender to KMT troops and not to the CPC, which was present in some of the occupied areas.&lt;ref name="Zarrow"&gt;Zarrow, Peter Gue.

The first post-war peace negotiation was attended by both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in [[Chongqing]] from 28 August 1945 and concluded on 10 October 1945 with the signing of [[Double Tenth Agreement]].&lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;Xu, Guangqiu.

However, large campaigns and full-scale confrontations between the CPC and Chiang's troops were temporarily avoided.

In the last month of World War II in East Asia, Soviet forces launched the huge [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]] to attack the Japanese 2 million strong [[Kwantung Army]] in Manchuria and along the Chinese-Mongolian border.&lt;ref name="Bright"&gt;Bright, Richard Carl. [2007] (2007). Pain and Purpose in the Pacific: True Reports of War. Trafford Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4251-2544-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This operation destroyed the fighting capability of Japan's Kwantung Army in just 3 weeks and left the USSR occupying all of Manchuria by the end of the war in a total power vacuum of local Chinese forces. Consequently, the 700,000 Japanese troops stationed in the region surrendered. Later in the year Chiang Kai-shek realized that he lacked the resources to prevent a CPC takeover of Manchuria following the scheduled Soviet departure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lilley, James. '' China hands : nine decades of adventure, espionage, and diplomacy in Asia '', PublicAffairs, New York, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore made a deal with the Russians to delay their withdrawal until he had moved enough of his best-trained men and modern material into the region; however, the Russians refused permission for the Nationalist troops to traverse its territory. KMT troops were then airlifted by the US to occupy key cities in North China, while the countryside was already dominated by the CPC. On 15 November 1945, an offensive began with the intent of preventing the CPC from strengthening its already strong base.&lt;ref name=Jessup&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jessup |first1=John E. |title=A Chronology of Conflict and Resolution, 1945–1985  |year=1989  |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York  |isbn=0-313-24308-5  |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets spent the extra time systematically dismantling the extensive Manchurian industrial base (worth up to $2 billion) and shipping it back to their war-ravaged country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Yang Kuisong, a Chinese historian, said that in 1945–46, during the Soviet Red Army Manchurian campaign, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] commanded Marshal [[Rodion Malinovsky]] to give Mao Zedong most [[Imperial Japanese Army]] weapons that were captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://book.sina.com.cn/excerpt/sz/rw/2011-11-24/0951293044_2.shtml |script-title=zh:杨奎松《读史求实》：苏联给了林彪东北野战军多少现代武器 |website=[[Sina Corp|Sina]] Books |date=2011-11-24}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926184147/http://book.sina.com.cn/excerpt/sz/rw/2011-11-24/0951293044_2.shtml |date=September 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Kai-shek's forces pushed as far as [[Jinzhou|Chinchow (Jinzhou)]] by 26 November 1945, meeting with little resistance. This was followed by a Communist offensive on the [[Shandong Peninsula|Shantung (Shandong) Peninsula]] that was largely successful, as all of the peninsula, except what was controlled by the US, fell to the Communists.&lt;ref name=Jessup/&gt; The truce fell apart in June 1946 when full-scale war between CPC and KMT forces broke out on June 26.

By the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the power of the Communist Party grew considerably. Their main force grew to 1.2 million troops, backed with additional militia of 2 million, totalling 3.2 million troops. Their "Liberated Zone" in 1945 contained 19 base areas, including one-quarter of the country's territory and one-third of its population; this included many important towns and cities. Moreover, the Soviet Union turned over all of its captured Japanese weapons and a substantial amount of their own supplies to the Communists, who received Northeastern China from the Soviets as well.&lt;ref name = "nat"&gt;{{cite book |title = Lịch sử thế giới hiện đại |last= Nguyễn Anh Thái (chief author) |first = |authorlink = |author2 = Nguyễn Quốc Hùng |author3=Vũ Ngọc Oanh |author4 = Trần Thị Vinh |author5 = Đặng Thanh Toán |author6 = Đỗ Thanh Bình  |year = 2002 |publisher = Giáo Dục Publisher |location= Ho Chi Minh City |id = 8934980082317 |pages = 320–322 |url = |accessdate = |language = Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1946, despite repeated requests from Chiang, the [[Soviet Red Army]] under the command of Marshal [[Rodion Malinovsky|Malinovsky]] continued to delay pulling out of Manchuria, while Malinovsky secretly told the CPC forces to move in behind them, which led to full-scale war for the control of the Northeast. These favorable conditions also facilitated many changes inside the Communist leadership: the more radical hard-line faction who wanted full military bloodshed and warfare to take-over China finally gained the upper hand and defeated the careful opportunists.&lt;ref&gt;Michael M Sheng, ''Battling Western Imperialism'', Princeton University Press, 1997, p.132 – 135&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to giving control to Communist leaders, on March 27 Soviet diplomats requested a joint venture of industrial development with the Nationalist Party in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liu |first = Shiao Tang |title=Min Kuo Ta Shih Jih Chih |volume = 2 |year = 1978 |publisher = Zhuan Chi Wen Shuan |location = Taipei |page = 735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three Campaigns of Chinese Civil War.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Map showing Three Campaigns during Chinese civil war]]

Although [[George Marshall|General Marshall]] stated that he knew of no evidence that the CPC was being supplied by the Soviet Union, the CPC was able to utilize a large number of weapons abandoned by the Japanese, including some tanks, but it was not until large numbers of well-trained KMT troops began surrendering and joining the Communist forces that the CPC was finally able to master the hardware.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, 12 January 1947, p44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeng Kelin, ''Zeng Kelin jianjun zishu'' (General Zeng Kelin Tells his story), Liaoning renmin chubanshe, Shenyang, 1997. p. 112-3&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the disadvantage in military hardware, the CPC's ultimate trump card was its land reform policy. The CPC continued to make the irresistible promise in the countryside to the massive number of landless and starving peasants that by fighting for the CPC they would be given their own land to grow crops once the victory was won.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Huang]], ''cong dalishi jiaodu du Jiang Jieshi riji'' (Reading Chiang Kai-shek's diary from a macro-history perspective), China Times Publishing Press, Taipei, 1994, p. 441-3&lt;/ref&gt;

This strategy enabled the CPC to access an almost unlimited supply of manpower for both combat and logistical purposes; despite suffering heavy casualties throughout many of the war's campaigns, man power continued to pour in massively. For example, during the [[Huaihai Campaign]] alone the CPC was able to mobilize 5,430,000 peasants to fight against the KMT forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lung Ying-tai]], ''dajiang dahai 1949'', Commonwealth Publishing Press, Taipei, 2009, p.184&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:National Revolutionary Army planes.png|thumb|Nationalist warplanes being prepared for an air raid on Communist bases]]

After the war with the Japanese ended, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly moved KMT troops to newly liberated areas to prevent Communist forces from receiving the Japanese surrender.&lt;ref name = "nat"/&gt; The US airlifted many KMT troops from central China to the [[Northeast China|Northeast]] ([[Manchuria]]). President [[Harry Truman]] was very clear about what he described as "using the Japanese to hold off the Communists". In his memoirs he writes:

{{quote|It was perfectly clear to us that if we told the Japanese to lay down their arms immediately and march to the seaboard, the entire country would be taken over by the Communists. We therefore had to take the unusual step of using the enemy as a garrison until we could airlift Chinese National troops to South China and send [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to guard the seaports. |sign = President Truman&lt;ref&gt;Harry S.Truman, Memoirs, Vol. Two: Years of Trial and Hope, 1946–1953 (Great Britain 1956), p.66&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Using the pretext of "receiving the Japanese surrender", business interests within the KMT government occupied most of the banks, factories and commercial properties, which had previously been seized by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt; They also conscripted troops at an accelerated pace from the civilian population and hoarded supplies, preparing for a resumption of war with the Communists. These hasty and harsh preparations caused great hardship for the residents of cities such as Shanghai, where the unemployment rate rose dramatically to 37.5%.&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt;

The US strongly supported the Kuomintang forces. About 50,000 US soldiers were sent to guard strategic sites in Hupeh and Shandong. The US equipped and trained KMT troops, and transported Japanese and Koreans back to help KMT forces to occupy liberated zones as well as to contain Communist-controlled areas.&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt; American aid included substantial amounts of mostly surplus military supplies, and loans were made to the KMT.&lt;ref&gt;p23, U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II, William Blum, Zed Books 2004 London.&lt;/ref&gt; Within less than two years after the Sino-Japanese War, the KMT had received $4.43 billion from the US—most of which was military aid.&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt;

As postwar negotiations between the Nationalist government in Nanjing and the Communist Party failed, the civil war between these two parties resumed. This stage of war is referred to in [[mainland China]] and Communist historiography as the "War of Liberation" ({{zh |s = 解放战争 |p = Jiěfàng Zhànzhēng |links = no }}). On 20 July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale assault on Communist territory in [[North China]] with 113 brigades (a total of 1.6 million troops).&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt; This marked the first stage of the final phase in the Chinese Civil War.

Knowing their disadvantages in manpower and equipment, the CPC executed a "passive defense" strategy. It avoided the strong points of the KMT army and was prepared to abandon territory in order to preserve its forces. In most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. The CPC also attempted to wear out the KMT forces as much as possible. This tactic seemed to be successful; after a year, the power balance became more favorable to the CPC. They wiped out 1.12 million KMT troops, while their strength grew to about two million men.&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt;

[[File:PLA Enters Peking.jpg|thumb|left|The PLA enters Beijing in the [[Pingjin Campaign]]]]

In March 1947 the KMT achieved a symbolic victory by seizing the CPC capital of [[Yan'an]].&lt;ref&gt;Lilley, James R. China Hands: Nine Decades of Adventure, Espionage, and Diplomacy in Asia. {{ISBN|1-58648-136-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Communists counterattacked soon afterwards; on 30 June 1947 CPC troops crossed the Yellow River and moved to the [[Dabie Mountains]] area, restored and developed the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]]. At the same time, Communist forces also began to counterattack in Northeastern China, [[North China]] and [[East China]].&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt;

By late 1948, the CPC eventually captured the northern cities of [[Shenyang]] and [[Changchun]] and seized control of the Northeast after suffering numerous setbacks while trying to take the cities, with the decisive [[Liaoshen Campaign]].&lt;ref name="Westad"&gt;Westad, Odd Arne.

The capture of large KMT units provided the CPC with the tanks, heavy artillery and other combined-arms assets needed to execute offensive operations south of the Great Wall. By April 1948 the city of Luoyang fell, cutting the KMT army off from Xi'an.&lt;ref name="Elleman"&gt;Elleman, Bruce A. Modern Chinese Warfare, 1795–1989. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-21473-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a fierce battle, the CPC captured [[Jinan]] and Shandong province on 24 September 1948. The [[Huaihai Campaign]] of late 1948 and early 1949 secured east-central China for the CPC.&lt;ref name="Westad" /&gt; The outcome of these encounters were decisive for the military outcome of the civil war.&lt;ref name="Westad" /&gt;

The [[Pingjin Campaign]] resulted in the Communist conquest of northern China. It lasted 64 days, from 21 November 1948, to 31 January 1949.&lt;ref name="Finkld"&gt;Finkelstein, David Michael.

After achieving decisive victory at Liaoshen, Huaihai and Pingjin campaigns, the CPC wiped out 144 regular and 29 non-regular KMT divisions, including 1.54 million veteran KMT troops, which significantly reduced the strength of Nationalist forces.&lt;ref name="nat"/&gt; Stalin initially favored a coalition government in postwar China, and tried to persuade Mao to stop the CPC from crossing the Yangtze and attacking the KMT positions south of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Donggil Kim, "Stalin and the Chinese Civil War."

In addition, the [[Ili Rebellion]] was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed revolt by the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] against the KMT from 1944–49, as the Mongolians in the People's Republic were in a border dispute with the Republic of China. A Chinese Muslim [[Hui people|Hui]] cavalry regiment, the 14th Tungan Cavalry, was sent by the Chinese government to attack Mongol and Soviet positions along the border during the [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=warlords+and+muslims&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KzhMb-imkP&amp;sig=LLAxJ3twoEaTpwSYwCNGE4lVXVE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZAoXTPG8NMGqlAfk-rCmCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=14th&amp;f=false |title = Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911–1949 |author = Andrew D.

The Kuomintang made several last-ditch attempts to use Khampa troops against the Communists in southwest China.

On 1 October 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] with its capital at Beiping, which was returned to the former name Beijing. Chiang Kai-shek and approximately two million Nationalist soldiers retreated from mainland China to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] in December after the PLA advanced into the Sichuan province. Isolated Nationalist pockets of resistance remained in the area, but the majority of the resistance collapsed after the fall of Chengdu on 10 December 1949, with some resistance continuing in the far south.&lt;ref name="Cookc"&gt;Cook, Chris Cook.

Most observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall to the imminent invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, and the US was initially reluctant in offering full support for Chiang in their final stand. US President [[Harry S.

This led to changing political climate in the US, and President Truman ordered the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] to sail to the [[Taiwan Strait]] as part of the [[containment]] policy against potential Communist advance.&lt;ref name="BushR"&gt;Bush, Richard C.

In June 1949 the ROC declared a "closure" of all mainland China ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure was from a point north of the mouth of [[Min River (Fujian)|Min River]] in [[Fujian]] to the mouth of the [[Liao River]] in [[Liaoning]].&lt;ref name="Tsang"&gt;Tsang, Steve Yui-Sang Tsang.

Tauris. {{ISBN|1-85043-842-0}}. p 155, p 115-120, p 139-145&lt;/ref&gt; Since mainland China's railroad network was underdeveloped, north-south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland China fishermen.

After losing mainland China, a group of approximately 3,000 KMT Central soldiers retreated to [[Burma]] and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China during the [[Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China (1950–1958)|Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950–1958)]] and [[Campaign at the China–Burma Border]]. Their leader, Gen. [[Li Mi (ROC general)|Li Mi]], was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of [[Yunnan]]. Initially, the US supported these remnants and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] provided them with military aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the [[United Nations]] in 1953, the US began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954 nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and General Li declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times to maintain a base close to China.

After the ROC complained to the [[United Nations]] against the [[Soviet Union]] for violating the [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance]] to support the CPC, the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 505]] was adopted on 1 February 1952, condemning the Soviet Union.

Though viewed as a military liability by the US, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]] as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake mainland China. On 3 September 1954, the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis]] began when the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] started shelling [[Kinmen|Quemoy]] and threatened to take the [[Dachen Islands]] in [[Zhejiang]].&lt;ref name="Tsang" /&gt; On 20 January 1955, the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] [[Battle of Yijiangshan Islands|took]] nearby [[Yijiangshan Island]], with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On January 24 of the same year, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Formosa Resolution of 1955|Formosa Resolution]] authorizing the President to defend the ROC's offshore islands.&lt;ref name="Tsang" /&gt; The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the [[Asian–African Conference|Bandung conference]].&lt;ref name="Tsang" /&gt;

The [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] began on 23 August 1958 with air and naval engagements between PRC and ROC forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of [[Kinmen|Quemoy]] (by the PRC) and [[Xiamen|Amoy]] (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year.&lt;ref name="Tsang" /&gt; PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the US rejected Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to bomb mainland China artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] ships to land supplies, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On September 7 the US escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing.

The [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in 1995–96 escalated tensions between both sides when the PRC tested a series of missiles not far from Taiwan, although, arguably, Beijing ran the test to shift the [[Republic of China presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]] vote in favor of the KMT, already facing a challenge from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party which did not agree with the "One China Policy" shared by the CPC and KMT.&lt;ref name="Behnke2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alison Behnke |title = Taiwan in Pictures |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Qt7nmCdy4iIC |date = 1 January 2007 |publisher = Twenty-First Century Books |ISBN = 978-0-8225-7148-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political fallout===
{{main|China and the United Nations|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758}}
On 25 October 1971, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] admitted the PRC and [[China and the United Nations|expelled the ROC]], which had been a founding member of the [[United Nations]] and was one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Representatives of Chiang Kai-shek refused to recognise their accreditations as representatives of China and left the assembly. Recognition for the People's Republic of China soon followed from most other member nations, including the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/oct-25-1971-peoples-republic-of-china-in-taiwan-out-at-un/|title=Oct. 25, 1971 {{!}} People's Republic of China In, Taiwan Out, at U.N.|last=Network|first=The Learning|date=2011-10-25|website=The Learning Network|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1984 PRC and ROC began to de-escalate their diplomatic relations with each other, and cross-straits trade and investment has been growing ever since. The state of war was officially declared over by the ROC in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taiwan flashpoint|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/asia_pac/04/taiwan_flashpoint/html/chinas_stance.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war. According to Mao Zedong, there were three ways of "staving off imperialist intervention in the short term" during the continuation of the Chinese Revolution. The first was through a rapid completion of the military takeover of the country, and through showing determination and strength against "foreign attempts at challenging the new regime along its borders". The second was by "formalising a comprehensive military alliance with the Soviet Union", which would dedicate Soviet power to directly defending China against its enemies; this aspect became extensively significant given the backdrop of the start of the Cold War. And finally the regime had to "root out its domestic opponents : the heads of secret societies, religious sects, independent unions, or tribal and ethic organisations." By destroying the basis of domestic reaction, Mao believed a safer world for the Chinese revolution to spread in would come into existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jbcoecrg5nec&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=pr11&amp;dq=chinese%2bcivil%2bwar&amp;ots=keixlpcfax&amp;sig=dcoktn9bpl7lnyjx4ibf_y-0uxg#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20civil%20war&amp;f=false.

Under the new ROC president [[Lee Teng-hui]], the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]] was renounced in May 1991, thus ending the chances of the Kuomintang's conquest to retake the mainland.

With the election in 2000 of [[Democratic Progressive Party]] candidate [[Chen Shui-bian]], a party other than the KMT gained the presidency for the first time in Taiwan. The new president did not share the Chinese nationalist ideology of the KMT and CPC.  This led to tension between the two sides, although trade and other ties such as the [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|2005 Pan-Blue visit]] continued to increase.

With the election of President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] (KMT) in 2008, significant warming of relations resumed between Taipei and Beijing, with high-level exchanges between the semi-official diplomatic organizations of both states such as the [[Chen-Chiang summit]] series. Although the [[Taiwan strait]]s remain a potential flash point, regular direct air links were established in 2009.&lt;ref name="so" /&gt;

== Reasons for the Communist victory ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Historian [[Odd Arne Westad]] says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and also because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China.  Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Communists targeted different groups, such as peasants, and brought them to its corner.&lt;ref&gt;Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang wrote in his diary in June 1948 that the KMT had failed not because of external enemies but because of rot from within.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/6731746.html Hoover Institution&amp;nbsp;– Hoover Digest&amp;nbsp;– Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730081935/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/6731746.html |date=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USSR generally supported Chiang's forces. Stalin distrusted Mao, tried to block him from leadership as late as 1942, and worried that Mao would become an independent rival force in world communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Rappaport|title=Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsKClpnX8qwC&amp;pg=PA36|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong American support for the Nationalists was hedged with the failure of the [[Marshall Mission]], and then stopped completely mainly because of KMT corruption&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ea.sinica.edu.tw/eu_file/12010586724.pdf|title=Some Recent American Interpretations of Sino-American Relations of the Late 1940's: An Assessment|last=Sun|first=Tung-hsun|date=1982|website=Institute of European and American Studies, Academia Sinica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as the notorious Yangtze Development Corporation controlled by [[H.H.

Communist [[Land reform in China|land reform]] policy promised poor peasants farmland from their landlords, ensuring popular support for the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]].

The main advantage of the Chinese Communist Party was the "extraordinary cohesion" within the top level of its leadership. These skills were not only secured from defections that came about during difficult times but also coupled with "communications and top level debates over tactics". A big addition to this was the [[Charismatic authority|charismatic style of leadership]] of Mao Zedong which created a "unity of purpose" and a "unity of command" which the KMT lacked majorly. Apart from that the CPC had mastered the manipulation of local politics to their benefit; this was also derived from their [[Propaganda in China|propaganda]] skills that had also been decentralised successfully. By "portraying their opponents as enemies of all groups of Chinese" and itself as "defenders of the nation" and people (given the backdrop of the war with Japan).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jbcoecrg5nec&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=pr11&amp;dq=chinese%2bcivil%2bwar&amp;ots=keixlpcfax&amp;sig=dcoktn9bpl7lnyjx4ibf_y-0uxg#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20civil%20war&amp;f=false.

In the Chinese Civil War after 1945, the economy in the ROC areas collapsed because of [[hyperinflation]] and the failure of [[price controls]] by the ROC government and financial reforms; the Gold Yuan devaluated sharply in late 1948&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mof.gov.tw/museum/ct.asp?xItem=3682&amp;ctNode=34&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the ROC government losing the support of the cities' [[middle classes]]. In the meantime, the Communists continued their relentless land reform ([[land redistribution]]) programs to win the support of the population in the countryside.

'''Dacology''' is a branch of '''[[Thracology]]''' which focuses on the scientific study of [[Dacia]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] antiquities and is a regional and thematic branch of the larger disciplines of [[ancient history]] and [[archaeology]]. A practitioner of the discipline is a Dacologist. Dacology investigates the range of ancient Dacian culture ([[language]], [[literature]], [[history]], [[religion]], [[art]], [[economics]], and [[ethics]]) from c. 1000 BC up to the end of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule in the 4th-7th centuries. It is directly subordinated to [[Thracology]], since Dacians are considered a branch of the [[Thracian]]s by most mainstream research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149413/Dacia#ref=ref24738&amp;tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Dacia%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia Encyclopædia Britannica online, Dacia.]&lt;/ref&gt; and historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo VII.3.2&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories sustain that the Daco-Thracian relation is not as strong as originally thought{{sfn|Olteanu}}&lt;ref&gt;Georgiev (1960) 39-58&lt;/ref&gt; and as such Dacology has the potential to evolve as an independent discipline from Thracology.

== History ==
One of the first mentions of the term Dacology was made by the historian Radu Vulpe at the 2nd ''International Congress of Thracology'' in September 1976 in connection with the Romanian historians [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] and [[Ion I. Russu]].{{sfn|Vulpe|1980|p=95}}{{failed verification|date=January 2011}} The ''Romanian Thracology Institute I.G Bibicescu'', part of [[Romanian Academy]], was founded in [[Bucharest]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Archäologien Europas: Geschichte, Methoden und Theorien By Peter F. Biehl, Alexander Gramsch, Arkadiusz Marciniak&lt;/ref&gt; One of his first directors was the thracologist [[Dumitru Berciu]] (1907–1998).

The related term '''Thraco-Dacology''' also exists, alluding to [[Thraco-Dacian]], and one of the first uses is also from around 1980, in the Romanian government archive.{{sfn|RA42|1980|p=181}}{{dubious|date=January 2011}}

The term ''Dacologist'' has been negatively affected by the association with [[Protochronism]]. Some researchers prefer to call themselves [[Thracologists]] instead of Dacologists.{{sfn|Olteanu}} This choice of title is made in the context of their research being focused on the Dacians and without necessarily promoting a strong connection between the Thracians and Dacians.{{sfn|Olteanu}}

== Dacologists ==
Researchers who have been noted in the field of Dacology include:
* [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]]
* [[Ion I. Russu]]{{sfn|SCL|1983|p=267}}
* Radu Vulpe
* Andrei Vartic

== International Congress of Dacology ==
There have been 11 editions of the ''International Congress of Dacology''{{sfn|DaciaRevue|2005|p=101}} organized so far. However, they have been organized by the controversial Dacomanic group around [[Napoleon Săvescu]], thus making the term Dacology synonymous with Protochronism in this ambiance.

Following her studies in [[history]],  [[history of art|art history]], [[philology]] and [[philosophy]], as well as in [[literature]] and [[theology]], Dominique de Courcelles completed several initial research projects, including: ''Les ex-voto marins du Roussillon'' (The Marine "Ex-Votos" of Roussillon) (Master in History), directed by Michel Mollat du Jourdin; a study of the enlightened manuscripts of the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'' in European libraries (Master of Advanced Studies in Art History), directed by [[Jacques Thirion]] and [[Marie-Madeleine Gauthier]]; ''La parole risquée de Raymond Lulle entre le christianisme, le judaïsme et l’islam'' (Ramon Llull's Audacious Word: between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) (Master in Theology), directed by [[Jean Greisch]]; ''Les goigs de Catalogne : entre le corps, l’image et la voix'' (Catalan ''goigs'':  between Body, Image, and Voice) (doctoral dissertation), directed by [[Louis Marin (philosopher)|Louis Marin]].

[[File:EgonFriedell.Gentzgasse7.Vienna.08.01.2008.PICT0002.JPG|thumb|300px|Friedell's home 1900-1938 in [[Gentzgasse]] 7, [[Währing]], Vienna]]
'''Egon Friedell''' (born ''Egon Friedmann''; 21 January 1878, in [[Vienna]]; died 16 March 1938, in Vienna) was a prominent [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]], [[historian]], [[journalist]], [[actor]], [[cabaret]] performer ''([[Kabarettist]])'' and [[theatre critic]].  Friedell has been described as a [[polymath]].

== Early life ==
Friedell was the third child of a [[Jewish]] [[silk manufacturer]], '''Moriz Friedmann''', and his wife, '''Karoline (née Eisenberger)'''. After his parents divorced in 1887, Friedell lived with his father. After his father's death in 1891, Friedell lived with his aunt in [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he would attend school, until he was expelled for unruly behaviour two years later. Even at this young age, Friedell was considered a trouble maker and free thinker. He attended several schools in Austria and [[Germany]], until he finally passed his [[Abitur]] (exit examination) after four attempts, in [[Bad Hersfeld]] in 1899.

In 1898, prior to his graduation, Friedell had enrolled as a guest student at [[Berlin University]], studying [[German literature]], [[natural sciences]] and [[philosophy]]. It was during this time, that Friedell renounced Judaism and converted to the [[Lutheran]] faith. After graduation, he enrolled in [[Heidelberg University]] to study under the philosophy historian and follower of [[Hegel]], [[Kuno Fischer]]. In 1899, he accepted his inheritance enabling him to live financially independently in Vienna.

From 1900 to 1904, Egon Friedell studied German literature and philosophy in Vienna, at the University of Heidelberg. In 1904, he received his [[PhD]] for his dissertation; ''[[Novalis]] als Philosoph''. In 1905, he published the article ''Prejudices'' in [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]]'s journal ''[[Fackel]]'', which included the following statement:

:: The worst prejudice we acquire during our youth is the idea that life is serious. Children have the right instincts: they know that life is not serious, and treat it as a game...

== An actor, critic, philosopher, and biographer ==
From 1905 to 1910 Friedell worked as the artistic director of the Vienna cabaret "Fledermaus", named after the Johann Strauss operetta. During this time, Friedell continued to publish essays and one-act plays. His first literary effort was ''The Paraffin King''. The [[sketch comedy]] ''[[Goethe]]'' (written in collaboration with [[Alfred Polgar]]) in which he also played the leading role, made him famous in German speaking countries.

In 1910, Friedell was commissioned by publisher [[Samuel Fischer]] to write a biography of poet [[Peter Altenberg]]. Fischer, who had expected something light, was unsatisfied with Friedell's analysis and critique of culture titled ''Ecce poeta'', and the book was not promoted in any way. Hence, the book was a commercial failure, but served to mark the beginning of Friedell's interest in  [[cultural history]].

In 1912, Friedell was performing in cabarets in [[Berlin]], and in 1913 worked as an actor for director [[Max Reinhardt]]. In Vienna, Friedell worked as the codirector of Intimes Theater. Friedell also continued writing, and developed friendships with nearly all of the major German authors of the period. In 1914, suffering from alcoholism and obesity, Friedell was forced to undergo treatment at a [[sanatorium]] near [[Munich]]. Friedell was enthusiastic about the beginning of [[World War I]], as were many of his contemporaries, and volunteered for military service but was rejected for physical reasons.

In 1916, he officially changed his name to ''Friedell''. (He had used ''Friedländer'' as a pen name for several of his publications, but had not used his family name ''Friedmann'' since his student days.) Friedell published the ''Judas Tragedy'' in 1916, and in 1922 published ''Quarry &amp;mdash; Miscellaneous Opinions and Quotations''. In 1924, while working as a critic for the journal ''Stunde'', Friedell was fired as a "traitor", for making satirical remarks.

Between 1919 and 1924, Friedell worked as a journalist and theatre critic for various publishers including the ''Neues Wiener Journal''. He also worked as a [[dramatic advisor]], [[theatre director]] and actor for director Max Reinhardt at the [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in Berlin and the [[Burgtheater]] in Vienna.

In addition Friedell's film and literary criticism continued to be published in magazines and newspapers, such as Schaubühne, Fackel, and Neuen Wiener Journal. After 1927, health problems prevented any permanent commissions, and he worked as an independent essayist, editor and [[translation|translator]] in Vienna. Among the authors Friedell translated were Emerson, Hebbel, Lichtenberg, Carlyle, Hans Christian Andersen, Johann Nestroy, and Macaulay.

== The actor as historian ==
Also during the early 1920s, Friedell wrote the three volumes of his ''Cultural History of the Modern Age'', which describes events from the [[Renaissance]] to the age of [[imperialism]] in an [[anecdote|anecdotal]] format. For instance, Friedell writes; "All the classifications man has ever devised are arbitrary, artificial, and false, but simple reflection also shows that such classifications are useful, indispensable, and above all unavoidable since they accord with an innate aspect of our thinking." In 1925, publisher [[Hermann Ullstein]] received the first volume, but was suspicious of the historiography of an actor. Five other publishers subsequently rejected the book. It was finally published by [[Heinrich Beck (publisher)|Heinrich Beck]] in Munich in 1927. The book proved very successful and allowed Friedell to continue his work as an author and has been translated into seven languages{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

In 1933, when the [[Nazis]] came to power in Germany, Friedell described the regime as: 
:: "(in) the realm of the Antichrist. Every trace of nobility, piety, education, reason is persecuted in the most hateful and base manner by a bunch of debased menials".

Friedell summed up the [[Congress of Vienna]] as:
:: "the Tsar of Russia falls in love for everyone; the King of Prussia thinks for everyone, the King of Denmark speaks for everyone; the King of Bavaria drinks for everyone; the King of Württemberg eats for everyone … and the Emperor of Austria pays for everyone."&lt;ref name="GovUK"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-foreign-office-one-of-the-great-offices-of-state British Government. Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, 18 December 2012. Speech - The Foreign Office, one of the great offices of state. by William Hague, Foreign Secretary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Censorship, persecution, and suicide ==
In 1937, Friedell's works were banned by the National Socialist regime as they did not conform to the theory of history promoted by the [[NSDAP]], and all German and Austrian publishers refused to publish his works. The first volume of Friedell's ''A Cultural History of Antiquity'', which he failed to complete, was published by Helikon in [[Zurich]].

On the occasion of the [[Anschluss]] of Austria, anti-semitism was rampant: Jewish men and women were being beaten in the streets and their businesses and [[synagogues]] ransacked or destroyed. Friedell, knowing that he could be arrested by the [[Gestapo]], began to contemplate ending his own life. Friedell told his close friend, [[Ödön von Horváth]], in a letter written on 11 March: "I am always ready to leave, in every sense."

On 16 March 1938, at about 22:00, two [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] men arrived at Friedell's house to arrest him. While they were still arguing with his housekeeper, Friedell committed suicide by jumping out of the window. Before leaping, he warned pedestrians walking on the sideway where he hit by shouting "Watch out! Get out of the way!"

Friedell, of whom Hilde Spiel said "in him, the exhilarating fiction of the [[polymath|homo universalis]] rose once again", was interred in the [[Zentralfriedhof]] cemetery in Vienna.

{{linguistics}}
'''Etymology''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|t|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i|}})&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;[[The New Oxford Dictionary of English]] (1998) {{ISBN|0-19-861263-X}} – p. 633 "'''Etymology''' /ˌɛtɪˈmɒlədʒi/ the study of the class in words and the way their meanings have changed throughout time".&lt;/ref&gt; is the study of the [[history]] of [[word]]s, their origins, and how their form and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] have changed over time.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; By extension, the term "the etymology (of a word)" means the origin of the particular word.  When talking about place names, there is a specific term, [[toponymy]].

For a language—such as [[Greek language|Greek]]—with a long [[recorded history|written history]], etymologists make use of texts in these languages and texts about the languages to gather knowledge about how words were used during earlier periods of their history and when they entered the languages in question. Etymologists also apply the methods of [[comparative linguistics]] to reconstruct information about languages that are too old for any direct information to be available.

By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the [[comparative method]], linguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In this way, [[root (linguistics)|word roots]] have been found that can be traced all the way back to the origin of, for instance, the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]].

Even though etymological research originally grew from the [[philology|philological]] tradition, much current etymological research is done on [[language family|language families]] where little or no early documentation is available, such as [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]].

The word ''etymology'' derives from the Greek word {{wikt-lang|grc|ἐτυμολογία}} ({{grc-transl|ἐτυμολογία}}), itself from {{wikt-lang|grc|ἔτυμον}} ({{grc-transl|ἔτυμον}}), meaning "true sense", and the suffix ''-logia'', denoting "the study of".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e)tumologi/a|ἐτυμολογία}}, {{LSJ|e)/tumos|ἔτυμον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In linguistics, the term ''etymon'' refers to a word or morpheme (e.g., stem&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the ultimate etymon of the English word ''machine'' is the Proto-Indo-European '''stem''' ''*māgh'' "be able to", see p. 174, {{cite book |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-1403917232}}&lt;/ref&gt; or root&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the co-etymon of the Israeli word ''glida'' "ice cream" is the Hebrew '''root''' ''gld'' "clot", see p. 132, {{cite book |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-1403917232}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from which a later word derives. For example, the Latin word ''candidus'', which means "white", is the etymon of English ''candid''.

[[File:Etymological Relationships Tree.png | thumb | Diagram showing relationships between etymologically-related words]]

==Methods==

Etymologists apply a number of methods to study the origins of words, some of which are:

* [[Philology|Philological]] research. Changes in the form and meaning of the word can be traced with the aid of older texts, if such are available.
* Making use of [[dialectology|dialectological]] data. The form or meaning of the word might show variations between dialects, which may yield clues about its earlier history.
* The [[comparative method]]. By a systematic comparison of related languages, etymologists may often be able to detect which words derive from their common ancestor language and which were instead later borrowed from another language.
* The study of [[semantic change]]. Etymologists must often make hypotheses about changes in the meaning of particular words. Such hypotheses are tested against the general knowledge of semantic shifts. For example, the assumption of a particular change of meaning may be substantiated by showing that the same type of change has occurred in other languages as well.

== Types of word origins ==

Etymological theory recognizes that words originate through a limited number of basic mechanisms, the most important of which are [[language change]], borrowing (i.e., the adoption of "[[loanwords]]" from other languages); [[word formation]] such as [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] and [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]]; and [[onomatopoeia]] and [[sound symbolism]], (i.e., the creation of imitative words such as "click" or "grunt").

While the origin of newly emerged words is often more or less transparent, it tends to become obscured through time due to sound change or semantic change. Due to [[sound change]], it is not readily obvious that the English word ''set'' is related to the word ''sit'' (the former is originally a [[causative]] formation of the latter). It is even less obvious that ''bless'' is related to ''blood'' (the former was originally a derivative with the meaning "to mark with blood").

[[Semantic change]] may also occur. For example, the English word ''bead'' originally meant "prayer". It acquired its modern meaning through the practice of counting the recitation of prayers by using beads.

== English language ==
{{Main|History of the English language}}

English derives from [[Old English]] (sometimes referred to as Anglo-Saxon), a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] variety, although its current vocabulary includes words from many languages.&lt;ref&gt;The American educator: a library of universal knowledge ..., Volume 3
 By Charles Smith Morris, Amos Emerson Dolbear&lt;/ref&gt; The Old English roots may be seen in the similarity of numbers in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], particularly ''seven/sieben,'' ''eight/acht,'' ''nine/neun,'' and ''ten/zehn.''  [[Pronoun]]s are also cognate: ''I/mine/me and ich/mein/mich''; ''thou/thine/thee and du/dein/dich''; ''we/wir and us/uns''; ''she/sie; your/ihr.
''
However, [[historical linguistics|language change]] has eroded many grammatical elements, such as the [[noun case]] system, which is greatly simplified in modern English, and certain elements of vocabulary, some of which are borrowed from [[French language|French]]. Although many of the words in the English lexicon come from Romance languages, most of the common words used in English are of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin.

When the [[Normans]] conquered England in 1066 (see [[Norman Conquest]]), they brought their [[Norman language]] with them. During the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] period, which united insular and continental territories, the ruling class spoke [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], while the peasants spoke the vernacular English of the time. Anglo-Norman was the conduit for the introduction of French into England, aided by the circulation of [[Langue d'oïl]] literature from France.

This led to many paired words of French and English origin. For example, ''[[beef]]'' is related, through borrowing, to modern French ''bœuf,'' ''[[veal]]'' to ''{{lang|fr|veau}},'' ''[[pork]]'' to ''{{lang|fr|porc}},'' and ''[[poultry]]'' to ''{{lang|fr|poulet}}.''  All these words, French and English, refer to the meat rather than to the animal. Words that refer to farm animals, on the other hand, tend to be cognates of words in other Germanic languages.  For example, ''swine/Schwein,'' ''cow/Kuh,'' ''calf/Kalb,'' and ''sheep/Schaf.''  The variant usage has been explained by the proposition that it was the Norman rulers who mostly ate meat (an expensive commodity) and the Anglo-Saxons who farmed the animals.  This explanation has passed into common [[folklore]] but has been disputed.

=== Assimilation of foreign words ===
{{Further|Loanword|Lists of English words by country or language of origin}}

English has proved accommodating to words from many languages.  Scientific terminology, for example, relies heavily on words of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, but there are a great many non-scientific examples. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] has contributed many words, particularly in the southwestern United States.

== History ==
The search for meaningful origins for familiar or strange words is far older than the modern understanding of linguistic evolution and the relationships of languages, which began no earlier than the 18th century. From [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] through the 17th century, from {{IAST | [[Pāṇini]]}} to [[Pindar]] to Sir [[Thomas Browne]], etymology had been a form of witty wordplay, in which the supposed origins of words were creatively imagined to satisfy contemporary requirements; for example, the [[Ancient Greek poetry | Greek poet]] [[Pindar]] (born in approximately 522 BCE) employed inventive etymologies to flatter his patrons. [[Plutarch]] employed etymologies insecurely based on fancied resemblances in [[sounds]]. [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'' was an encyclopedic tracing of "first things" that remained uncritically in use in Europe until the sixteenth century. ''[[Etymologicum genuinum]]'' is a [[grammatical]] [[encyclopedia]] edited at [[Constantinople]] in the ninth century, one of several similar [[Byzantine]] works. The thirteenth-century ''[[Legenda Aurea]],'' as written by [[Jacobus da Varagine|Jacobus de Vorgagine]], begins each ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'' of a saint with a fanciful [[excursus]] in the form of an etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ek1skuzIZH0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=legenda+aurea+etymology+beginning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gh71mjgh98&amp;sig=HKMa7iWIeemgitLEB39GTosb0f4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbu8m4nLTWAhXrjlQKHfpwC_gQ6AEISTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=legenda%20aurea%20etymology%20beginning&amp;f=false|title=Women of the Gilte Legende: A Selection of Middle English Saints Lives|last=Jacobus|last2=Tracy|first2=Larissa|date=2003|publisher=DS Brewer|isbn=9780859917711|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Sanskrit===
{{Main|Nirukta}}
The [[Sanskrit]] linguists and grammarians of [[History of India|ancient India]] were the first to make a comprehensive analysis of linguistics and etymology. The study of Sanskrit etymology has provided Western scholars with the basis of [[historical linguistics]] and modern etymology. Four of the most famous Sanskrit linguists are:

* [[Yaska]] (c. 6th–5th centuries BCE)
* {{IAST | [[Pāṇini]]}} (c. 520–460 BCE)
* [[Katyayana|{{IAST | Kātyāyana}}]] (2nd century BCE)
* [[Patanjali|{{IAST | Patañjali}}]] (2nd century BCE)

These linguists were not the earliest Sanskrit grammarians, however. They followed a line of ancient grammarians of Sanskrit who lived several centuries earlier like [[Sakatayana]] of whom very little is known. The earliest of attested etymologies can be found in [[Vedas|Vedic literature]] in the philosophical explanations of the ''[[Brahmana]]s'', ''[[Aranyaka]]s,'' and ''[[Upanishad]]s''.

The analyses of [[Vyakarana|Sanskrit grammar]] done by the previously mentioned linguists involved extensive studies on the etymology (called ''[[Nirukta]]'' or ''Vyutpatti'' in Sanskrit) of Sanskrit words, because the ancient [[Indo-Aryans]] considered sound and speech itself to be sacred and, for them, the words of the sacred ''[[Vedas]]'' contained deep encoding of the mysteries of the soul and God.

===Ancient Greco-Roman===
One of the earliest philosophical texts of the Classical Greek period to address etymology was the [[Socratic dialogue]] ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (c. 360 BCE) by [[Plato]]. During much of the dialogue, [[Socrates]] makes guesses as to the origins of many words, including the names of the gods. In his [[Ode]]s [[Pindar]] spins complimentary etymologies to flatter his patrons. [[Plutarch]] (''Life of [[Numa Pompilius]]'') spins an etymology for ''[[Pontifex Maximus|pontifex]]'',  while explicitly dismissing the obvious, and actual "bridge-builder":
&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;!-- Should this begin with a capitalized T or an elipsis? Question posed May 2015, since there is no reference to answer it. --&gt;the priests, called Pontifices.... have the name of Pontifices from ''potens'', powerful, because they attend the service of the gods, who have power and command over all. Others make the word refer to exceptions of impossible cases; the priests were to perform all the duties possible to them; if anything lay beyond their power, the exception was not to be cavilled at. The most common opinion is the most absurd, which derives this word from pons, and assigns the priests the title of bridge-makers. The sacrifices performed on the bridge were amongst the most sacred and ancient, and the keeping and repairing of the bridge attached, like any other public sacred office, to the priesthood. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Medieval===
{{Main|Medieval etymology}}
[[Isidore of Seville]] compiled a volume of etymologies to illuminate the triumph of religion. Each saint's legend in [[Jacob de Voragine]]'s ''[[Legenda Aurea]]'' begins with an etymological discourse on the saint's name:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Lucy is said of light, and light is beauty in beholding, after that S. Ambrose saith: The nature of light is such, she is gracious in beholding, she spreadeth over all without lying down, she passeth in going right without crooking by right long line; and it is without dilation of tarrying, and therefore it is showed the blessed Lucy hath beauty of virginity without any corruption; essence of charity without disordinate love; rightful going and devotion to God, without squaring out of the way; right long line by continual work without negligence of slothful tarrying. In Lucy is said, the way of light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend/GoldenLegend-Volume2.htm#Lucy Medieval Sourcebook: The Golden Legend:  Volume 2 (full text)]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Modern era===
{{Further|Comparative method}}

Etymology in the modern sense emerged in the late 18th-century European academia, within the context of the wider "[[Age of Enlightenment]]," although preceded by 17th century pioneers such as [[Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn]], [[Gerardus Vossius]], [[Stephen Skinner (lexicographer)|Stephen Skinner]], [[Elisha Coles]], and [[William Wotton]].  The first known systematic attempt to prove the relationship between two languages on the basis of similarity of [[grammar]] and [[lexicon]] was made in 1770 by the Hungarian, [[János Sajnovics]], when he attempted to demonstrate the relationship between [[Sami languages|Sami]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (work that was later extended to the whole [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric language family]] in 1799 by his fellow countryman, [[Samuel Gyarmathi]]).&lt;ref name="ssix"&gt;Szemerényi 1996:6&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of modern [[historical linguistics]] is often traced to [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], a Welsh [[Philology|philologist]] living in [[India]], who in 1782 observed the genetic relationship between [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. Jones published his ''The Sanscrit Language'' in 1786, laying the foundation for the field of [[Indo-European linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/226197/view |title=
Sir William Jones, British philologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of etymology in [[Germanic philology]] was introduced by [[Rasmus Christian Rask]] in the early 19th century and elevated to a high standard with the ''[[German Dictionary]]'' of the [[Brothers Grimm]]. The successes of the comparative approach culminated in the [[Neogrammarian]] school of the late 19th century. Still in the 19th century, German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] used etymological strategies (principally and most famously in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]],'' but also elsewhere) to argue that moral values have definite historical (specifically, cultural) origins where modulations in meaning regarding certain concepts (such as "good" and "evil") show how these ideas had changed over time—according to which value-system appropriated them. This strategy gained popularity in the 20th century, and philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], have used etymologies to indicate former meanings of words to de-center the "violent hierarchies" of Western [[philosophy]].

:''[[Forces' Sweetheart (film)|Forces' Sweetheart]] was also a 1953 film''.

'''Forces Sweetheart''' (or '''Forces' Sweetheart''') is a title given to some entertainers in the [[British Armed Forces]], mainly through the [[Entertainments National Service Association]], although the term was also later used in the [[United States]] and other countries including [[Australia]]
==Origins==
The role had its origins in [[World War I]]. [[Lady Angela Forbes]],  (1876-1950), was the Forces Sweetheart at camp and a wartime catering organiser for the British army from November 1914.&lt;ref name="Forces"&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/271622/Sweetheart-we-love-you "Sweetheart we love you!"].

Hutchinson, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Following her, [[Elsie Janis]] was called The Sweetheart of the [[American Expeditionary Forces|AEF]].

Sweethearts during [[World War II]] included [[Vera Lynn]] (now Dame Vera Lynn), whose singing ("[[(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover]]" and "[[We'll Meet Again]]") brought great happiness to many in Britain; [[Gracie Fields]]; and [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]].&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt;

[[Frances Langford]], whose husband was assistant secretary of the [[United States Air Force]] under president [[Harry Truman]], was "Singing Sweetheart of the Fighting Fronts" from World War II to the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Present-day sweethearts for the British forces include [[Nell McAndrew]], [[Katherine Jenkins]] and [[Cheryl Cole]].&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cole becomes Forces' sweetheart|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/cole-becomes-forces-sweetheart-28658514.html|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, London drag queen Richard Rhodes became the first man to be awarded the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/meet-cookie-monstar-forces-sweetheart-and-drag-artist-6553712.html|title=Meet Cookie Monstar, forces sweetheart... and drag artist|last=|first=|date=2011-01-10|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2017-11-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frans Blom 1922.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Frans Blom in 1922.]]'''Frans Blom''' (Frants Ferdinand Blom; August 9, 1893, [[Copenhagen]] &amp;ndash; June 23, 1963, [[San Cristóbal de Las Casas]], [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[explorer]] and [[archaeologist]].

Frans Blom was born in 1893 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark to a middle-class family of antique merchants. He was restless and started travelling, eventually reaching Mexico in 1919, where he found work in the oil industry as a paymaster. Travelling to remote locations in the Mexican jungle, he became interested in the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins which he encountered where he was working. He started drawing and documenting these ruins. After he showed his work to the Mexican National Museum of Anthropology, it financed some of his expeditions. He met [[Sylvanus G. Morley]], who brought him to [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Here he took a master's degree in [[Archeology]].

He taught at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]] and during his tenure, he undertook several expeditions to [[Mesoamerica]]. In 1923 his studies at [[Palenque]] documented a number of features neglected by earlier researchers. In 1924 Blom excavated the Maya [[archaeological site]] of [[Uaxactun]] in [[Guatemala]]. From his explorations around the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], he wrote some of the first scholarly reports of a number of sites of the [[Olmec]] civilization. In 1926 he was made head of Tulane's newly established Department of Middle American Research.

In 1932 he was married to the American Mary Thomas, but six years later they were divorced. Blom acquired an alcohol habit which later forced him to retire from the university. Blom moved to Mexico, where he met the Swiss photographer [[Gertrude Duby Blom|Gertrude “Trudi” Duby]] (1901–1993), whom he married.

In 1950, the Bloms bought a large house in San Cristóbal de las Casas.  This house was dubbed ''[[Casa Na Bolom]]'' - ''na'' meaning "house" in the [[Lacandon language|Lacandon]] Maya language, and ''bolom'' (or ''b'alum'' in some [[Mayan languages]]) means "[[jaguar]]", and is also a pun on Blom's name (since "Bolom" or similar variations was still a fairly common Maya family name, some of the Maya assumed it to be Blom's name.)  The Bloms turned the house into a cultural and scientific center with rooms for visitors, with Gertrude continuing the enterprise for decades after Frans’ death. The house today functions as a museum.

The Bloms continued undertaking expeditions for the Mexican government. Blom died in 1963, at age 70.

'''Gian (Giovanni) Domenico Mansi''' (16 February 1692 – 27 September 1769) was an Italian [[prelate]], theologian, scholar and historian, known for his massive works on the [[Ecumenical council|Church councils]].{{sfn|Boudinhon|1910}}{{efn|His name is Anglicized in some source to '''John (Domenico) Mansi'''}}

He was born at [[Lucca]], of a patrician family, and died archbishop of that city. At the age of sixteen he entered the [[Clerics Regular of the Mother of God of Lucca|Congregation of Clerics Regular of the Mother of God]] and made his profession in 1710. Except for some journeys made for purposes of study, his whole life, until his appointment as [[Archbishop of Lucca]] (1765), was spent in his religious home.

In 1758, after a sojourn at Rome, where he had been received by [[Cardinal Passionei]], there was question of elevating him to the [[Sacred College]], but his collaboration in an annotated edition of the famous ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' displeased [[Clement XIII]]. It should be remarked that the notes in this edition were intended to correct the text. Three years after his elevation to the episcopate he was smitten with an attack of [[apoplexy]] which left him suffering, deprived of the power of motion, until his death.

His long career was filled chiefly with the re-editing of erudite ecclesiastical works with notes and complementary matter. His name appears on the title-pages of ninety folio volumes and numerous quartos. An indefatigable worker, widely read and thoroughly trained, his output was chiefly of a mechanical order, and unoriginal because hurried. His task was most often limited to inserting notes and documents in the work to be reproduced and sending the whole result to the printer, a process which resulted in numberless shortcomings.

The only work worth mentioning that is all Mansi's own is his ''Tractatus de casibus et censuris reservatis'', published in 1724, which brought him into difficulties with the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''. The rest are all annotated editions. In 1726 there was ''Jo. Burch. Menckenii De Charlataneria eruditorum declamationes duae cum notis variorum''; from 1725 to 1738, an annotated Latin translation of the three works of [[Dom Calmet]]—the ''Dictionnaire de la Bible'', ''Prolégomènes et Dissertations'', and ''Commentaire littéral''.

The best-known publication of Mansi is his vast edition of the Councils, ''Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio'' (31 vols., folio, Florence and Venice, 1758–98), which was stopped by lack of resources in the middle of the [[Council of Florence]] of 1438. The absence of an index renders it inconvenient, and in a critical point of view it leaves an immensity to be desired. Mansi saw only fourteen volumes of it published, the others were finished from his notes.

In 1748 he began to publish the first volume of a collection which was presented as a supplement to that of [[Coleti]]; the sixth and last volume of it appeared in 1752. The collection has been reprinted: in Paris by H. Welter, (1901-1927); and in Graz by the Akademische Druck- und Verlagsanstalt in 1960.  The 1901 edition has been digitized by the University of Michigan Law Library.

'''Gregory White Smith''' (October 4, 1951 – April 10, 2014) was an American [[biographer]] of both [[Jackson Pollock]]&lt;ref name="Smith 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Gregory White|title=Jackson Pollock: An American Saga|date=1989|publisher=Clarkson Potter|isbn=0517560844}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Gregory White|title=Van Gogh: The Life|date=2011|publisher=Random House|location=United States|isbn=0375507485}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to writing 18 books with [[Steven Naifeh]], Smith was an accomplished musician, historic preservationist, art collector, philanthropist, attorney, and businessman who founded several companies including Best Lawyers,&lt;ref name="Best Lawyers Website"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Gregory White|title=Best Lawyers in America|url=http://www.bestlawyers.com/About/TheFounders.aspx|work=The Best Lawyers in America|publisher=Woodward/White, Inc.|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spawned an entire industry of professional [[rankings]].

His brain tumor, which was diagnosed in 1975, led to 13 brain surgeries as well as radiation and nuclear medicine treatments and experimental chemotherapeutic regimens.  His search for cutting-edge medical care was profiled on CBS's ''[[60 Minutes]]''&lt;ref name="Baltic Review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gregory White Smith, Pulitzer Prize-Winning Author of Jackson Pollock and Van Gogh: The Life, Dies at 62|work=[[Baltic Review]]|url=http://baltic-review.com/gregory-white-smith-pulitzer-prize-winning-author-of-jackson-pollock-and-van-gogh-the-life-dies-at-62/|accessdate=October 12, 2017| date= April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recounted in his book ''Making Miracles Happen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Gregory White|title=Making Miracles Happen|date=1997|publisher=Little Brown &amp; Co.|isbn=0316597880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jackson Pollock: An American Saga]]'' was published in 1990, winning the 1991 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]].&lt;ref name="Smith 1989"/&gt; ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' called the book "Brilliant and definitive … so absorbing in its narrative drive and so exhaustively detailed that it makes everything that came before seem like trial balloons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Gregory White|title=Jackson Pollock: An American Saga|date=1989|publisher=Clarkston Potter|location=Back Cover|isbn=978-0517560846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"As a tale of ambition, hard-fought fleeting triumphs and dark despair," said the ''[[San Francisco Gate]]'', "it has the dramatic pull of a gripping nineteenth-century novel.  … [The] biography enriches the eye.  Its insight and vast information vault readers into the work of Van Gogh and the artists of his time.  It deepens the experience of looking at art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D'Arcy|first=David|title=Van Gogh: The Life by Naifeh and Smith|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Van-Gogh-The-Life-by-Naifeh-and-Smith-2393951.php|work=San Francisco Gate|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "A tour de force," said the ''Los Angeles Times'', a "sweepingly authoritative, astonishingly textured book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muchnic|first=Suzanne|title=Book Review: 'Van Gogh: The Life'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/20/entertainment/la-ca-book-van-gogh-20111120|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Smith was born in [[Ithaca, New York]] on October 4, 1951, and was raised in [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he attended the [[Columbus Academy]]. "Walking to school beginning at an early age," Naifeh said, "he would think of a sentence. Then, talking out loud, as he did for the rest of his life, he would try different ways to articulate the same thought, clarifying the idea and giving the words more character and force.  It was the beginning of a lifelong love of and gift for words."&lt;ref name="Interview with Steven Naifeh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Stephanie|title=Juilliard in Aiken co-founder, author Smith dies at 62|url=http://www.aikenstandard.com/article/20140411/AIK0101/140419908|work=[[The Aiken Standard]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Also at age eight, Smith began dictating short novels into a [[Dictaphone]] his father used in business, which his mother transcribed.   'They were only 25 or 30 pages long,' Smith said, 'and the work of a child.  But I was so thrilled that my mother typed them.  There was my name at the top of the first page, 'By Gregory White Smith.'"&lt;ref name="Baltic Review"/&gt;

"As editor of his high school newspaper, he once wrote an editorial about the [[French experience in Vietnam]] and its lessons for the United States.  When the headmaster burned all of the copies of the paper, Smith called on the headmaster to resign.  'Greg was already showing his fiercely combative spirit,' Naifeh said, 'the same spirit that would get him through a lifelong battle against a terrible disease and unending pain.'" &lt;ref name="Baltic Review"/&gt;

He graduated from [[Colby College]] in 1973, spent a year studying music in Europe on a [[Watson Fellowship]], and then enrolled at the [[Harvard Law School]]. He graduated from the Law School in 1977, and received a master's degree in education, also from Harvard, in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;http://bangordailynews.com/2014/04/13/obituaries/colby-college-graduate-gregory-white-smith-pulitzer-winning-biographer-of-artists-dies-at-62/&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was a singer and choral conductor.  He founded the Colby Eight in 1972 and served as assistant conductor of the [[Harvard Glee Club]], where he helped prepare choruses for such conductors as [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Seiji Ozawa]], and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], from 1974 to 1979.&lt;ref name="Baltic Review"/&gt;

Smith received honorary doctorates from the [[University of South Carolina Aiken]] in 1998, the [[Juilliard School]] in 2012, and Colby College in 2013.&lt;ref name="Baltic Review"/&gt;

In 1989, along with his partner Naifeh, he purchased the [[Joye Cottage]] in [[Aiken, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aikenstandard.com/article/20140418/AIK0401/140419367/1031/smith-naifeh-a-look-at-two-men-s-accomplishments&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they restored the historic Whitney-Vanderbilt house, a creation of both Stanford White and Carrère and Hastings.  The story of that renovation is told in their book, ''On a Street Called Easy, In a Cottage Called Joye'', which ''The New York Times'' called "wry and gentle … house-and-garden renovations gone delectably awry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Gregory White|title=On a Street Called Easy, In a Cottage Called Joye|date=1996|publisher=Little Brown &amp; Co|isbn=0316597058|page=Back Cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They are leaving the house to be a residence for artists in music, drama, and dance.

In 2009, with Sandra Field, Smith co-founded the Juilliard in Aiken Festival, a performing arts festival that brings dozens of artists to Aiken each year for performances and has provided educational outreach to more than 16,000 students in an area covering parts of Georgia and South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juilliard in Aiken Festival Website|url=http://juilliardinaiken.com/about.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The year Smith died, the Festival culminated in an early-music performance of [[Bach]]'s [[St. Matthew Passion]] that was presented not only in Aiken but in [[Spivey Hall]] in Atlanta and [[Alice Tully Hall]] at [[Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Stephanie|title=Juilliard in Aiken returns with 'Passion'|url=http://www.aikenstandard.com/article/20140108/AIK0401/140109492|work=The Aiken Standard|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   James R. Oestreich wrote in ''The New York Times'' that the performance contained "flashes of brilliance, all right.  But what made the event so deeply satisfying was mainly the consistent excellence of all its parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oestreich|first=James R.|title=In a Show of Early-Music Vigor, a Lofty Commitment Is Confirmed|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/arts/music/bachs-st-matthew-passion-presented-by-juilliard.html?referrer|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, a few months after beginning Harvard Law School, Smith began experiencing unexplained skeletal pain.  After six months of clinical investigation, he was diagnosed with a [[hemangiopericytoma]], a tumor so rare it landed him on the cover of the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.  Uncertain that he could survive the disease – in 1987, he was given three months to live – Smith, together with Naifeh, spent the rest of his life finding doctors around the world who could perform operations or improvise treatments to keep him alive long enough for the next lifesaving treatment to emerge.&lt;ref name="Baltic Review"/&gt;

Smith's survival was featured on a segment of CBS's ''60 Minutes'' in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McManus|first=Tracey|title=Pulitzer Prize winner Gregory White Smith dead at 62|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/metro/2014-04-10/pulitzer-prize-winner-gregory-white-smith-dead-62|work=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He was asked by [[Morley Safer]], "Everyone must ask the question when given what appears to be a death sentence, 'Why me?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Safer|first=Morley|title=The Best Doctors in America|work=60 Minutes|publisher=Paul &amp; Holly Fine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Smith answered, "I've been very, very lucky in my life.  I had a great family – have a great family.  I have Steve.  I've been endowed with some talents.  I've had a chance to write a book that I'm very proud of.  I have great friends.  And never once in all those things, I never once said, 'Why?'  So how can I demand from the universe some sort of rationale for the bad that I've never demanded for the good?"

Smith married [[Steven Naifeh]], his co-author and partner of 40 years, in 2011.&lt;ref name="Baltic Review"/&gt;

"It took enormous grit and determination to stage this heroic ongoing battle against his brain tumor," Naifeh said to the ''[[Aiken Standard]]''.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Stephanie|title=Juilliard in Aiken co-founder, author Smith dies at 62|url=http://www.aikenstandard.com/article/20140411/AIK0101/140419908|work=The Aiken Standard|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Yet, it never robbed him of his passion for life. Or his sweetness.  He was so unassuming about his intellectual gifts, so guileless, that he had an extraordinary capacity to help people understand how special they were in their own ways."&lt;ref name="Turner"/&gt;

==Career==
Smith worked as an associate attorney at the law firm of [[Morrison &amp; Foerster]] and as an editor at the ''[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]'', where he published the ''Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice'' in 1983.&lt;ref name="Baltic Review"/&gt;

He was the author, all with Naifeh, of many books including five ''New York Times'' bestsellers.&lt;ref name="Baltic Review"/&gt;

He published ''Jackson Pollock: An American Saga'' in 1990, which won the 1991 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|first=Writer|title=SC Pulitzer Prize-winning Pollock biographer dies|url=http://www.thestate.com/2014/04/10/3380010/prize-winning-pollock-biographer.html|work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|accessdate=15 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514190446/http://www.thestate.com/2014/04/10/3380010/prize-winning-pollock-biographer.html|archivedate=14 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also a finalist for the National Book Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Book Awards - 1990|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1990#.U3Tf5cLjiUl|publisher=National Book Foundation|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Interview Magazine]]'' said of the book, "For once, with this intense, engrossing, and indeed brilliant work, we have a biography that justifies its length. Seldom have the history of an artist, the development of his imagination, and the fevers of his soul been more grandly yet intimately described."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cockburn|first=Alexander| authorlink = Alexander Cockburn|title=Jackson Pollock - 9780913391198 - By Smith, Gregory White; Naifeh, Steven|url=http://product.51eng.com/9780913391198/Jackson-Pollock.html|work=Interview Magazine|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film by [[Ed Harris]] in 2000, [[Pollock (film)]].  Harris said the biography was "the bible for the project and remained so until filming was completed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Ed|title=On "Pollock"|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/opinion/ed-harris-on-pollock.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The biography also served as an inspiration for [[John Updike]]'s ''Seek My Face''.   "It would be in vain," Updike wrote, "to deny that a large number of details come from the admirable, exhaustive 'Jackson Pollock: An American Saga.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charles|first=Ron|title=A splattering of art history|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1205/p15s01-bogn.html|website=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith also wrote ''Van Gogh: The Life'', which was called "the definitive work for decades to come" by [[Leo Jansen]] of the Van Gogh Museum, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jansen|first=Leo|title=Review|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/highschool/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781588360472&amp;view=print|publisher=Random House|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time Magazine'' wrote: "Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, whose 1989 biography of Jackson Pollock won the Pulitzer Prize, have written this generation's definitive portrait of the great Dutch post-Impressionist. … Their most important achievement is to produce a reckoning with van Gogh's occasional 'madness' that doesn't lose sight of the lucidity and intelligence – the profound sanity – of his art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lacayo|first=Richard|title=The Stranger|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2097401,00.html|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Boston Globe'' wrote: "Now, at last, with 'Van Gogh: The Life' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, we have what could very well be the definitive biography … And how pleased we should be that Naifeh and Smith have rendered so exquisitely and respectfully van Gogh's short, intense, and wholly interesting life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silman|first=Roberta|title=Review|url=http://www.profilebooks.com/isbn/page/9781846680106/|publisher=Profile Books|accessdate=15 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514183414/http://www.profilebooks.com/isbn/page/9781846680106/|archivedate=14 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to English, ''Van Gogh: The Life'' has been published in Dutch, German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese and is being translated into Italian, Polish, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Gregory White|title=Editions|url=http://vangoghbiography.com/Editions|publisher=Woodward/White, Inc.|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith also wrote several how-to books to fund the writing of Pollock, including (with Michael Morgenstern), the best-seller ''How to Make Love to a Woman'', which sold several million copies in 29 languages.
He wrote several true crime books, including the bestseller ''The Mormon Murders'' in 1988 and ''Final Justice'' in 1993.  The latter was nominated for the [[Edgar Allan Poe Award]] for Fact Crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naifeh|first=Steven|title=Obituary|url=http://www.bestlawyers.com/Downloads/Gregory_White_Smith.pdf|publisher=Woodward/White, Inc.|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's one book of humor, detailing the renovation of Joye Cottage, was well-received: "Page after belly-ticking page," wrote ''The Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|first=Writer|title=Review|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-813628.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Numerous adventures bordering on slapstick. … A delightful read."&lt;ref name="Staff"/&gt;

Smith also wrote two television series, one for [[PBS]] on the [[History of the Supreme Court of the United States|history of the Supreme Court]] with [[Archibald Cox]] and one for [[NBC]] on human behavior with [[Phil Donahue]].&lt;ref name="Baltic Review"/&gt;

Together with Naifeh, Smith founded the legal publishing company '''Best Lawyers''' in 1981, which published ''The Best Lawyers in America'', a peer-review list, in 1983.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Gregory White|title=The Founders|url=http://www.bestlawyers.com/About/TheFounders.aspx|publisher=Woodward/White, Inc.|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That list went on to become Best Lawyers®, a global network linking lawyers and clients.  In 2013, Best Lawyers ranked 74,965 lawyers representing 18,034 law firms in 75 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Gregory White|title=History|url=http://www.bestlawyers.com/About/History.aspx|publisher=Woodward/White, Inc.|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the company partnered with U.S. News to produce rankings of law firms and in 2014 it gave out 61,138 rankings to 11,681 law firms in 120 practice areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Ruby|title=U.S. News - Best Lawyers releases 2014 "Best Law Firms" list|url=http://bestlawfirms.usnews.com/downloads/2014_BLF_Press_Release_national.pdf|publisher=Woodward/White, Inc.|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Best Lawyers list is widely respected in the legal profession.  Kevin Maroney, Associate General Counsel of [[United Healthcare]], has said, "I always review Best Lawyers and rely on its recommendations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maroney|first=Kevin|title=Client Testimonials|url=http://www.bestlawyers.com/About/Testimonials.aspx?type=client|publisher=Woodward/White, Inc.|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Bernd-Peter Bier, Senior Vice President of the Tax Division at [[Bayer AG]], has said, "I have used Best Lawyers to locate lawyers in an area of law that I do not have retained counsel.  I find it to be a great resource."  Kevin R. Hackett, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of [[Rockefeller Group International]], has said, "Best Lawyers is the gold standard in selecting a lawyer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hackett|first=Kevin|title=Client Testimonials|url=http://www.bestlawyers.com/About/Testimonials.aspx?type=client|publisher=Woodward/White, Inc.|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Smith told his story, as well as those of other patients conquering critical illnesses, in the book ''Making Miracles Happen'', which Phil Donahue called "an inspiring gift to all of us who remain one cell away from the pathologies that would kill us … Greg Smith's relentless and successful effort to save his own life is a medical story for the twenty-first century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donahue|first=Phil|title=Review|url=https://www.amazon.com/Making-Miracles-Happen-Gregory-White/dp/product-description/0440508371|work=Making Miracles Happen|publisher=Little Brown &amp; Co.|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Naifeh, he also founded '''Best Doctors''', a company dedicated to helping others with undiagnosed or seemingly untreatable medical illnesses find the best medicine anywhere in the world.  Although they sold the company in 2000, it continues to serve more than 30 million members worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

'''The heroic theory of invention and scientific development''' is the [[hypothesis]] that the principal authors of [[invention]]s and [[scientific discoveries]] are unique [[hero]]ic individuals{{spaced ndash}} "great scientists" or "geniuses."  A competing hypothesis ("[[multiple discovery]]") is that most inventions and scientific discoveries are made independently and simultaneously by multiple inventors and scientists.

The multiple discovery hypothesis might be especially relevant in the development of mathematics since mathematical knowledge is highly unified and any advances that happen need to be built from previously established results through a process of deduction, as a general rule.  For instance, the development of [[infinitesimal calculus]] into a systematic discipline did not occur until the development of [[analytic geometry]], the former being credited to both [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and the latter to both [[René Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34059">'''[[Assassination]]''', the [[murder]] of an opponent or well-known public figure, is one of the oldest tools of power struggles, as well as the expression of certain psychopathic disorders. It dates back to the earliest governments and tribal structures of the [[world]].

== Ancient history ==
[[Chanakya]] (c. 350–283 BC), an Indian teacher, philosopher and royal advisor, wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise ''[[Arthashastra]]''. His student [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]] of India, later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies, including two of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s generals [[Nicanor (son of Parmenion)|Nicanor]] and [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Roger Boesche |first=Roger |last=Boesche |date=January 2003 |title=Kautilya's ''Arthaśāstra'' on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India |journal=The Journal of Military History |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=9–37 |issn=0899-3718 |doi=10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/journal_of_military_history/v067/67.1boesche.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the [[Warring States period]] (3rd century BC) in China, the state [[Qin (state)|Qin]] rose to hegemony over other states. The Prince of the state Yan felt the threat and sought to remove the Qin king (later [[Qin Shi Huang]]) and sent [[Jing Ke]] for the mission. The assassination attempt was foiled and Jing Ke was killed on the spot.

The Old Testament story of Judith illustrates how a woman frees the Israelites by tricking and assassinating [[Holofernes]], the war-leader of the enemy Assyrians with whom the Israelites were at war.

[[Philip II of Macedon]], the father of [[Alexander the Great]], can be viewed as a victim of assassination. It is a fact, however, that by the fall of the [[Roman Republic]] assassination had become a commonly-accepted tool towards the end not only of improving one's own position, but to influence policy—the killing of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] being a notable example, though many [[Emperors of Rome|Emperors]] met such an end. In whatever case, there seems to have not been a good deal of moral indignation at the practice amongst the political circles of the time, save, naturally, by the affected.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Roman history ===
Some of the most famous assassinations in history have taken place in the Roman Empire. Many of these assassinations were for political gain, like that of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]].

Julius Caesar was one of the three leaders of the [[First Triumvirate]] of the Roman Republic. After the other two members of the Triumvirate died, Julius Caesar became so popular he was proclaimed '[[Dictator for Life]]', but the senate of the Roman Republic saw this as the end of the Republic, so, on the [[Ides of March]] (March 15) of 44 BC, the [[Roman Senate]], including [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger]] who was a friend of Caesar went to the Senate, and when Caesar arrived, they stabbed him to death. When he was dying, Caesar is said to (in a play by Shakesphere) have looked at Brutus and say "[[Et tu, Brute?]]", or "And you, Brutus?". However, there is no record as to whether or not Caesar actually said these things. Soon after this, the [[Second Triumvirate]] was formed, ending in the collapse of the Roman Republic and the creation of the [[Roman Empire]] by [[Augustus Caesar]].

Another Roman assassination was that of [[Caligula]], the great-grandson of Augustus Caesar. He was overthrown by the military, had his head cut off, and was soon replaced by [[Claudius]]. There were many other, less important assassinations, and many more attempted assassinations, but none that had much meaning in the formation and history of the Roman Empire.

One of the earliest accounts of a historical assassination society were the Jewish [[sicarii]] in 6 A.D. during the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Roman occupation of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Ross, Jeffrey Ian, ''Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present'', Routledge (January 15, 2011), Chapter: Sicarii. 978-0765620484&lt;/ref&gt; This group performed high-risk assassinations of Roman military individuals and other Jewish countrymen who have sided with them, with the use of daggers hidden in cloaks, sometimes performed in broad daylight before disappearing in the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Christian [http://ldsmag.com/article-1-4364/ Who were the Sicarii?], ''Meridian Magazine'', June 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; One of their most infamous assassination was that of Jonathan the High Priest.

== The Middle Ages ==
As the [[Middle Ages]] came about from the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the moral and ethical dimensions of what was before a simple political tool began to take shape.

Although in that period intentional [[regicide]] was an extremely rare occurrence, the situation changed dramatically with the [[Renaissance]] when the ideas of ''tyrannomachy'' (i.e. killing of a King when his rule becomes tyrannical) re-emerged and gained recognition. Several European monarchs and other leading figures were assassinated during religious wars or by religious opponents, for example [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France]], and the Protestant Dutch leader, [[William the Silent]]. There were also many unsuccessful assassination plots against rulers such as [[Elizabeth I]] of England by religious opponents. There were notable detractors, however; [[Abdülmecid I|Abdülmecid]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] refused to put to death plotters against his life during his reign.

Assassinations also became part of the religious arena as well. For example, [[Thomas Becket]] was promoted to the position of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] by King [[Henry II of England]] because Becket was part of the King's personal counsel and was also a major supporter of the King's claims on French land. Unfortunately, Becket did not like his new position and found support with the [[Pope Alexander III]], so when Henry sought Becket's support for a lessened Papal grip on [[England]], Becket refused and supported the Church and the Pope. Henry II didn't outright call for Thomas Becket's assassination after this point, but he is reported to have said, "[[Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?]]" As a result, Becket was assassinated by four knights: [[Reginald Fitzurse]], [[Hugh de Morville, Lord of Westmorland]], [[William de Tracy]], and [[Richard le Breton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Neil|title=Lake District, a Megalithic Journey|date=2011|publisher=Megalithic Publishing|isbn=1446754243|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TLVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hashshashin]], a [[Muslim]] group in the Middle Ages-[[Middle East]], was well known for performing assassinations in the style of close combat. The word ''assassin'' was derived from the name of their group. In [[Feudal Japan]], [[ninja]]s or shinobis were hired from both the aristocracy and the peasantry to spy on enemy factions, perform [[arsonism]] and disruptions, as well as infiltrating and assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;Ratti, Oscar; Westbrook, Adele (1991), ''Secrets of the Samurai: A Survey of the Martial Arts of Feudal Japan'', p.325, Tuttle Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8048-1684-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern history ==
[[File:Lincoln assassination slide c1900.png|thumb|left|alt=Image of Lincoln being shot by Booth while sitting in a theater box.|Shown in the presidential box of Ford's Theatre, from left to right, are assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]], Abraham Lincoln, [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], [[Clara Harris]], and [[Henry Rathbone]]]]

=== Pre-World War I ===
As the world moved into the present day and the stakes in political clashes of will continued to grow to a global scale, the number of assassinations concurrently multiplied.{{synthesis inline|date=March 2011}} In [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] alone, five emperors were assassinated within less than 200 years – [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] (along with his family: his wife, Alexandra; daughters Olga, Tatiana, Maria and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anastasia]], and son Alexei). In the [[United Kingdom]], only one [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] has ever been assassinated—[[Spencer Perceval]] on May 11, 1812.&lt;ref name="Gillen"&gt;M. Gillen 1972 ''Assassination of the Prime Minister: The Shocking Death of Spencer Perceval''. London: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson {{ISBN|0-283-97881-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable assassination victim within early [[American history|U.S. history]] was President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Three other U.S. Presidents have been killed by assassination: [[James Garfield]], [[William McKinley]], and [[John F. Kennedy]].  Presidents [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Gerald Ford]], and [[Ronald Reagan]] survived significant assassination attempts (FDR while President-elect, the others while in office). Former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was shot and wounded during the 1912 presidential campaign. During the Lincoln Assassination, there were also attacks planned against current Vice-president [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Secretary]] [[William H. Seward]], but Johnson's did not go through, and Seward survived the attack. An assassination plot against [[Jefferson Davis]], known as the [[Dahlgren Affair]], may have been initiated during the [[American Civil War]].

In [[Europe]] the assassination of [[Archduke]] [[Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]], one of several Serb nationalist insurgents, triggered [[World War I]]. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina, since it was newly annexed to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He had a route through the city streets of [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], but was redirected to a back alley. He changed his course and as he was led around the corner out of the back alley and back onto the main street, Gavrilo Princip shot Franz Ferdinand and his wife ([[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]]). This assassination brought the Austro-Hungarian Empire into a state of outrage and therefore, World War I was triggered.

=== Post-World War I ===
However, the 20th century probably marks the first time [[nation-state]]s began training assassins to be specifically used against so-called enemies of the state. During [[World War II]], for example, [[MI6]] trained a group of [[Czechoslovakia]]n operatives to kill the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[general]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] (who did later perish by their efforts – see [[Operation Anthropoid]]), and repeated attempts were made by both the British MI6, the American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (later the [[CIA|Central Intelligence Agency]]) and the Soviet [[SMERSH]] to kill [[Adolf Hitler]], who was in fact nearly killed in a bomb plot by a group of his own officers.

[[India]]'s "Father of the Nation", [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], was shot and killed on January 30, 1948 by [[Nathuram Godse]], for what Godse perceived as his betrayal of the [[Hindu]] cause in attempting to seek peace between Hindus and [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/50664.stm BBC World: The life and death of Mahatma Gandhi] Retrieved on 2008-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cold War and beyond ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
The [[Cold War]] saw a dramatic increase in the number of political assassinations, likely due to the [[ideology|ideological]] polarization of most of the [[first world|First]] and [[Second world]]s, whose adherents were more than willing to both justify and finance such killings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} During the Kennedy era, [[Fidel Castro]] narrowly escaped death on several occasions at the hands of the CIA (a function of the agency's "[[executive action]]" program) and CIA-backed rebels (there are accounts that exploding shoes and poisoned clams were employed); some allege that [[Salvador Allende]] of [[Chile]] was another example, though specific proof is lacking. The assassination of the [[FBI]] agent [[Dan Mitrione]], a well-known teacher of torture techniques, in the hands of the [[Uruguay]]an guerrilla movement [[Tupamaros]] is a perfect proof of United States intervention in Latin American governments during the Cold War. At the same time, the [[KGB]] made creative use of assassination to deal with high-profile defectors such as [[Georgi Markov]], and [[Israel]]'s [[Mossad]] made use of such tactics to eliminate [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], politicians and revolutionaries, though some Israelis argue that the targeted often crossed the line between one or another or were even all three.

Most major powers were not long in repudiating such tactics, for example during the presidency of [[Gerald Ford]] in the United States in 1976 ([[Executive Order 12333]], which proscription was relaxed however by the [[George W. Bush administration]]). Many allege, however, that this is merely a smoke screen for political and moral benefit and that the covert and illegal training of assassins by major intelligence agencies continue, such as at the [[School of the Americas]] run by the United States. In fact, the debate over the use of such tactics is not closed by any means; many accuse [[Russia]] of continuing to practice it in [[Chechnya]] and against Chechens abroad, as well as Israel in Palestine and against Palestinians abroad (as well as those Mossad deems a threat to Israeli national security, as in the aftermath of the [[Munich Massacre]] during "Operation Wrath of God"). Besides [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] members assassinated abroad, [[Tsahal]] has also often targeted [[Hamas]] in the [[Gaza strip]].

[[Terrorism|Terrorist]] organizations will frequently target other combatants as well as non-combatants in their efforts, a prime example was the assassination of [[Irish people|Irish]] [[solicitor]] [[Pat Finucane (solicitor)|Patrick Finucane]] who was murdered by the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[Ulster Defence Association]] in 1989 in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.

New technology has made targeted killing easier to accomplish remotely, including high precision [[cruise missile]]s and [[combat drone]]s.

== Country-specific ==

=== In the Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===

In the course of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) employed what they call "focused foiling" ({{lang-he|סיכול ממוקד }} ''[[:he:סיכול ממוקד|sikul memukad]]''), or [[targeted killing]], against those suspected by Israel of intending to perform a specific act of violence in the very near future, or to be linked indirectly with several acts of violence (organizing, planning, researching means of destruction, etc.), thus raising the likelihood that his or her killing would foil similar activities in the future. Usually, such strikes have been carried out by [[Israeli Air Force]] attack helicopters that fire [[guided missile]]s at the target, after the [[Shin Bet]] supplies [[military intelligence|intelligence]] for the target.

==== Related controversies ====
The exact nature of said proof in focused foiling is controversial and classified, as it involves clandestine [[military intelligence]] oriented means and operational decisions made by intelligence officers and commanders rather than being a part of a published justice system executed by lawyers and judges.

The IDF says that [[targeted killings]] are only pursued to prevent future [[terrorism]] acts, not as revenge for past activities. It also says that this practice is only used when there is absolutely no practical way of foiling the future acts by other means (''e.g.'', arrest), with minimal risk to the soldiers or civilians. It also says that the practice is only used when there is a certainty in the identification of the target, in order to minimize harm to innocent bystanders. The IDF deliberations about the killings remain secret. Moreover, actual injury and death of innocent bystanders remains a claim by opponents of these targeted killings.

Defenders of this practice point out that it is in accordance with the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] ([[s:Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 28|Part 3, Article 1, Section 28]]), which reads: "The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations," and so they argue that international law explicitly gives Israel the right to conduct military operations against military targets under these circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Podhoretz, John |url=http://www.aijac.org.au/updates/Jul-02/260702.html |title=Hamas kills its own |series=Opinion |work=[[New York Post]] |page=29 |date=July 24, 2002 |accessdate=2006-08-05 |quote=The Fourth Geneva Convention goes into great and elaborate detail about how to assign fault when military activities take place in civilian areas. Those who are actually fighting the war are not considered "protected persons." Only civilians are granted the status of "protected persons" whose rights cannot be violated with impunity. The Fourth Geneva Convention convicts Hamas and Salah Shehada in one sentence. That sentence makes up the entirety of Part 3, Article 1, Section 28. It reads: "The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations." This sentence appears in the Fourth Geneva Convention precisely to deal with situations like the ones the Israelis faced. |authorlink=John Podhoretz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822054635/http://www.aijac.org.au/updates/Jul-02/260702.html |archivedate=August 22, 2006 |df= }}'''Note:''' The ''New York Post'' link to the article may be found here [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/141316401.html?dids=141316401:141316401&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jul+24%2C+2002&amp;author=John+Podhoretz&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=029&amp;desc=HAMAS+KILLS+ITS+OWN], but it requires a subscription.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles2003/20031128.asp |title=What the Geneva Protocols Really Say |accessdate=2007-07-06 |last=Schneider |first=Scott |date=November 28, 2003 |publisher=StrategyWorld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israeli public support ====
Targeted killings are largely supported by Israeli society to various extents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steven R. David |date=September 2002 |url=http://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/besa/david.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fatal Choices: Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing |publisher=Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, Bar-Ilan University |accessdate=2006-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luft |first=Gal |date=Winter 2003 |title=The Logic of Israel's Targeted Killing |journal=The Middle East Quarterly |volume=X |issue=1 |url=http://www.meforum.org/article/515 |accessdate=2006-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are exceptions: In 2003, 27 [[Israeli Air Force|IAF]] Air Force pilots sent a letter of protest to Air Force commander [[Dan Halutz]], refusing to attack targets within Palestinian population centers, and saying that the mistreatment of the Palestinians "morally corrupts the fabric of Israeli society". The letter, the first of its kind emanating from the Air Force, evoked a storm of political protest in Israel, with most circles condemning it as dereliction of duty. IDF ethics forbid soldiers from making public political affiliations, and subsequently the IDF chief of staff announced that all the signatories would be suspended from flight duty, after which some of the pilots recanted and removed their signature.

==== Well-known Israeli operations ====
Some of the best-known targeted killings by Israeli military were [[Hamas]] leaders [[Salah Shahade]] (July 2002), [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] (March 2004), [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] (April 2004), and [[Adnan al-Ghoul]] (October 2004). While the term "targeted killing" is mostly used within the context of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] by airborne attacks, [[Israeli security forces]] have reportedly killed top [[Palestinians]] in the past, although this was never confirmed officially.

Some of the best-known operations include:
* [[Operation Wrath of God]] against [[Black September (group)|Black September]], perpetrators of the 1972 [[Munich massacre]]
* [[Operation Spring of Youth]] against top PLO leaders in [[Beirut, Lebanon]], 1973
* [[Abu Jihad]] ([[Fatah]]) in [[Tunis]], 1988
* [[Fathi Shaqaqi]] ([[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]]) in [[Malta]], 1995
* [[Yahya Ayyash]] (Hamas bombmaker, "the engineer") in [[Gaza City|Gaza]], 1996
* [[Khaled Mashal]] (Hamas, foiled) in [[Jordan]], 1997
While most killings throughout the course of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were carried out by the IDF against [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] leaders of what Israel says are terror factions, Israeli minister [[Rehavam Zeevi]] was assassinated by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP), a militant group listed as a terror organization by the [[United States|U.S.]] and the [[European Union|EU]].

==== Palestinian attacks and Israeli response ====
Palestinian attacks against Israel have been costly for Israel. IDF reports show that from the start of the [[Second Intifada]] (in 2000) to 2005, Palestinians killed 1,074 Israelis and wounded 7,520. These are serious figures for such a small country, roughly equivalent to 50,000 dead and 300,000 wounded in the United States over five years.  Such losses generated immense public pressure from the Israeli public for a forceful response, and ramped-up targeted killings were one such outcome.&lt;ref&gt;"Do targeted killings work?", Daniel Byman, ''Foreign Affairs'', March/April 2006, Volume 85, Number 2, pp. 95–112&lt;/ref&gt;

While Palestinian operations caused substantial damage, there is also evidence that the IDF reprisal targeted killing policy has been salutary in reducing the ''effectiveness'' of such attacks. As regarding Hamas, for example, although Hamas attacks ''increased'' between 2001 and 2005, Israeli deaths dropped as the people targeted for killing were killed, reduced from a high of 75 in 2001, to 21 in 2005. So even as the total number of Hamas operations climbed, deaths resulting from such attacks plunged, suggesting that the ''effectiveness'' of such attacks was being continually weakened.&lt;ref name="Byman, op. cit"&gt;Byman, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several practical reasons why calculated hits may weaken the effectiveness of terrorist activities. Targeted killings eliminate skilled terrorists, bomb makers, forgers, recruiters and other operatives who need time to develop expertise. The targeted killings also disrupt the opponent's infrastructure, organization, and morale, and cause immense stress on the targets, who must constantly move, switch locations, and hide. This reduces the flow of information in the terrorist organization and reduces its effectiveness. Targeted killings may also serve as a demoralizing agent. Targeted individuals cannot visit their wives, children, relatives, or families without severe risk, and may even avoid their names being made public for fear of being killed. Israeli killings of Hamas leaders Yassin and Rantisi for example, caused Hamas to not publicly identify their replacement, a step necessary to ensure his survival.

Continual diplomatic pressure against the Israeli policy, and the announcement of temporary cease-fires at various times by Hamas are seen by some as further proof of the policy's efficacy. Some observers, however, argue that other factors are at play, including improved intelligence-gathering leading to more arrests, and the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] which has made it more difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.&lt;ref name="Byman, op. cit" /&gt;

=== United States ===
In 1943, the [[United States]] military used knowledge from decoded transmissions to carry out a targeted killing of the Japanese Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]].&lt;ref&gt;Manchester, William. ''[[American Caesar]]: Douglas MacArthur 1880–1964'', p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the U.S. attempted several times to assassinate Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/ops/castro.htm Cuba: Assassination Attempts] Global security.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, President [[Ronald Reagan]] issued [[Executive Order 12333]], which codified a policy first laid down in 1976 by the [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] administration. It stated, "No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RS21037.pdf|title=Assassination Ban and E.O. 12333:A Brief Summary|last=Bazan|first=Elizabeth B. |date=January 4, 2002|publisher=Congressional Research Service|pages=CRS–1|accessdate=2009-07-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211095407/https://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RS21037.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--FIXME [http://cfrterrorism.org/policy/assassination_print.html]--&gt;

In 1986, the American air strikes against [[Libya]] included an attack on the barracks where [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] was known to be sleeping. It was claimed that the attack resulted in the death of Gaddafi's infant daughter but reporter Barbara Slavin of USA Today who was in Libya at the time, set the record straight. "His adopted daughter was not killed," she said. "An infant girl was killed. I actually saw her body. She was adopted posthumously by Gadhafi. She was not related to Gadhafi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex For Gadhafi Interviews?|author=Cliff Kincaid|url=http://www.aim.org/aim-column/sex-for-gadhafi-interviews/|date=April 16, 2004|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]], the U.S. struck many of Iraq's most important command bunkers with [[bunker buster|bunker-busting bombs]] in hopes of killing Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Since the rise of [[al-Qaeda]], both the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administrations have backed "targeted killings." In 1998, in retaliation for the al-Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in [[East Africa]], the Clinton administration launched [[cruise missile]]s against a training camp in [[Afghanistan]] where [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] had been hours before. Reportedly, the U.S. nearly killed the leader of [[Taliban]], [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], with a Predator-launched Hellfire missile on the first night of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. In May 2002, the CIA launched a Hellfire missile from a Predator drone in an effort to kill the Afghan warlord [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

On November 3, 2002, a US [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-operated [[MQ-1 Predator]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) fired a [[Hellfire missile]] that destroyed a car carrying six suspected al-Qaeda operatives in [[Yemen]]. The target of the attack was [[Abu Ali al-Harithi|Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi]], the top al-Qaeda operative in Yemen. Among those killed in the attack was a US citizen, Yemeni-American [[Kamal Derwish|Ahmed Hijazi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dana |last=Priest |title=CIA Killed U.S. Citizen In Yemen Missile Strike |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A25630-2002Nov7&amp;notFound=true |work=Washington Post |date=2002-11-08 |accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;!-- THE ARTICLE SAYS Kamal Derwish --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

According to Bush administration, the killing of an American in this fashion was legal. "I can assure you that no constitutional questions are raised here. There are authorities that the president can give to officials. He's well within the balance of accepted practice and the letter of his constitutional authority," said [[Condoleezza Rice]], the US [[National Security Advisor (United States)|national security adviser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://timeenoughforlove.org/saved/YahooNewsU_S_CanTargetAmericanal-QaidaAgents.htm U.S. Can Target American al-Qaida Agents] By John J.

During the press-conference, the [[US State Department]] spokesman [[Richard Boucher]] said that Washington's reasons for opposing the targeted killings of Palestinians might not apply in other circumstances and denied allegation that by staging the Yemen operation the US may be using [[double standard]]s towards Israeli policy: "We all understand the situation with regard to Israeli–Palestinian issues and the prospects of peace and the prospects of negotiation ... and of the need to create an atmosphere for progress. ... A lot of different things come into play there. ... Our policy on targeted killings in the Israeli-Palestinian context has not changed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1106-06.htm US 'Still Opposes' Targeted Killings] (BBC) November 6, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2005, the US was blamed for another incident, in which alleged al-Qaeda #3 man (operations chief [[Abu Hamza Rabia]]) was reportedly killed in [[Pakistan]] by an airborne missile, together with four associates. However, Pakistani officials claim the group was killed while preparing explosives, not from any targeted military operation.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/12/03/pakistan.rabia/index.html  Al Qaeda No. 3 dead, but how?] (CNN) December 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4494428.stm Blast 'kills al-Qaeda commander'] (BBC) December 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The US has made no official comment about the incident.

On January 13, 2006 US [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-operated [[unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned]] [[RQ-1 Predator|Predator]] drones launched four [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire missiles]] into the [[Pakistan]]i village of [[Damadola]], about {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] border, killing at least 18 people. The attack targeted [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] who was thought to be in the village. Pakistani officials later said that al-Zawahiri was not there and that the U.S. had acted on faulty intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pakistantimes.net/Top15010601.htm |title=18 civilians killed by air-strikes in Bajaur area of NW Pakistan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117035915/http://pakistantimes.net/Top15010601.htm |archivedate=2006-01-17 |work=Pakistan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2006, US Forces dropped one [[laser-guided bomb]] and one GPS-guided bomb on a [[safehouse]] north of [[Baqubah]], [[Iraq]], where [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]] leader [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] was believed to be meeting with several aides.  His death was confirmed the next day.

On May 2, 2011, [[Osama bin Laden]], the founder of the militant Islamist organization [[al-Qaeda]], was killed by gunshot wounds in a raid by United States special operations forces on his safe house in Bilal Town, [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan.

=== Modern India ===
India saw assassination of her father of nation – [[Mahatma Gandhi]] on 30 January 1948 by one [[Nathuram Godse]], Gandhi supporting India's partition into India and Pakistan and his soft corner for Muslim hardliners being a prime cause of Godse's action.

[[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], India's second Prime Minister died in Tashkent, USSR. His cause of death remains a mystery but his body turned blue indicating poisoning. He had gone to Tashkent for a Multi-nation meet in general and to meet Pakistani premier in particular.

India's third Prime minister – [[Indira Gandhi]] was assassinated in 1984 by Sikh Extremists in retaliation at her decision to storm the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] in Amritsar.

Her son [[Rajiv Gandhi]] too met his end when he was assassinated by the [[LTTE]] in 1991.

=== Russia (post-communism) ===
[[Russia]] employed a similar strategy in the course of its [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s, targeting the leaders of the Chechen separatist movement. Chechen President [[Dzhokhar Dudaev]] was killed by an air strike of the [[Russian Air Force]] on April 21, 1996, and [[Aslan Maskhadov]] was killed on March 8, 2005.  On July 10, 2006, [[Shamil Basayev]], the Chechen rebel, was killed in an explosion, though it is unclear if this was an accident in the handling of explosives, or a targeted Russian attack.

In the [[poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko]] of 2006, a former [[KGB]] officer was murdered in Great Britain by means of the radioactive element [[Polonium|polonium-210]]. Litvinenko had obtained [[political asylum]] in Great Britain, and was an outspoken critic of [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Russian security services. It was reported that the source of the polonium had been traced to a Russian nuclear power plant, and Russia subsequently refused Britain's request to [[extradition|extradite]] ex-KGB bodyguard [[Andrey Lugovoy]] to face murder charges; Lugovoy was later elected to the Russian [[State Duma]]. Litvinenko himself blamed his murder on Putin.&lt;ref name="litvinenkoarticle"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why I believe Putin wanted me dead |url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=418652&amp;in_page_id=1770 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hyōbanki''''' (評判記) were compilations of rankings and critiques of [[kabuki]] actors and [[oiran|courtesans]] published in [[Edo period]] [[Japan]]. They were generally published at the [[new year]] in [[Edo]] and [[Kamigata]], reviewing and ranking the courtesans and actors of the previous year. Along with ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' woodblock prints and other publications, ''hyōbanki'' were important elements in the urban popular culture of the period.

==Actor ''hyōbanki''==
A book called ''yarō hyōbanki'' was published in 1656, though many scholars consider the 1687 ''yakusha hyōbanki'' to be the first in the form. These were published regularly until 1890.

Actors were ranked according to a fairly simple scale:
*''Jō-jō-kichi'' (上々吉)　Upper-upper-excellent
*''Jō-jō'' (上々)	Upper-upper
*''Jō'' (上) Upper
*''Naka no jō-jō'' (中の上々) Upper-upper of the Middle
*''Naka no jō'' (中の上) Upper of the Middle
*''Naka'' (中) Middle

In print, variations were used to represent intermediate ranks between ''Jō-jō'' and ''Jō-jō-kichi''. Sometimes only parts of the ''[[kanji]]'' (character) for "''kichi''" (吉) would be written in, each stroke towards completing the character representing an intermediate rank. Other times, strokes would be written in outline instead of ink-filled, to represent intermediate rankings not yet achieved.

At times, ranks above ''jō-jō-kichi'' were added, to describe and rank the greatest kabuki actors.
*''Dai-shigoku-jō-jō-kichi'' (大至極上々吉) Great exceedingly upper-upper-excellent
*''Kō-goku-jō-jō-kichi'' (高極上々吉) Higher very upper-upper-excellent
*''Shigoku-jō-jō-kichi'' (至極上々吉) Exceedingly upper-upper-excellent
*''Goku-jō-jō-kichi'' (極上々吉) Very upper-upper-excellent
*''Kō-jō-jō-kichi'' (高上々吉) Higher upper-upper-excellent
*''Dai-jō-jō-kichi'' (大上々吉) Great upper-upper-excellent
*''Shi-jō-jō-kichi'' (至上々吉) Climax of upper-upper-excellent

'''Inuit''' describes the various groups of [[indigenous peoples]] who live throughout ''Inuit Nunangat'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/ref/dict/pop149-eng.cfm Area of residence - Inuit Nunangat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014250/1100100014254 Map of Inuit Nunangat]&lt;/ref&gt; that is the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]] of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] of [[Northern Canada]], [[Nunavik]] in [[Quebec]] and [[Nunatsiavut]] in [[Labrador]], as well as in [[Greenland]]. The term '''culture of the Inuit''', therefore, refers primarily to these areas; however, parallels to other [[Eskimo]] groups can also be drawn.

The traditional lifestyle of the [[Inuit]] is adapted to extreme climatic conditions; their essential skills for survival are hunting and [[Animal trapping|trapping]]. [[Agriculture]] was never possible in the millions of square kilometres of [[tundra]] and icy coasts from [[Siberia]] to Northern America and Greenland. Therefore, hunting became the core of the culture and cultural history of the Inuit. Thus, the everyday life in modern Inuit settlements, established only some decades ago, still reflects the 5,000-year-long history of a typical hunting culture which allowed the Inuit peoples and their ancestors to achieve one of the most remarkable human accomplishments, the population of the [[Arctic]].

==Overview of cultural history==
[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] are certain that the predecessors of today's Inuit originated in the area of the [[Bering Strait]], which separates Asia and North America. The first Inuit group, known as [[Paleo-Eskimo]]s, crossed the Strait in 3000 BCE presumably on winter ice, which was long after earlier migrations by the ancestors to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American Indians]]. Archaeological finds have revealed that the Paleo-Eskimos moved to the northern Canadian Arctic in 2300 BCE, apparently because of a change in climate. From there they gradually followed the herds of game across the Arctic to Greenland, and dispersed into more distinct nomadic tribes.

[[File:Thule tent ring Meliadine 1995-06-22.jpg|thumb|Tent ring from the Thule culture on the [[Iqalugaarjuup Nunanga Territorial Park|Meliadine River]], near [[Rankin Inlet]]]]
[[Pre-Dorset]] culture is said to begin when the Paleo-Eskimos settled on the islands of the Canadian archipelago and northern Greenland. The descriptions "Dorset" and "Pre-Dorset" come from [[Cape Dorset]] on [[Baffin Island]], the source of an [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] which in 1925 anthropologist [[Diamond Jenness]] identified as originating from a hitherto unknown "[[Dorset culture]]." The Paleo-Eskimos weathered the winter of the high Arctic with much more difficulty than their later descendants because they lacked technologies such as boats, harpoon-tips, dog sleds, dwellings other than skin tents, and sources of warmth other than small fire pits and wood fuels. In the central Canadian Arctic, they mainly hunted [[muskox]]en and [[caribou]] with bow and arrow, and fished with barbed devices. Groups living near the coastline hunted [[pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]]es and smaller [[whale]]s by throwing harpoons from the shore or from sea ice.

*[[Independence I culture]] 2300 BCE-1500 BCE

This Paleo-Eskimo culture was named after [[Independence Fjord]], where traces of a large settlement were found. Their lodgings were erected on elliptical foundations centred upon box-shaped hearths made of flat stones set on end. These they filled with driftwood, musk ox dung, and bones. They might have started fires with the help of a [[bow drill]] operated by sinews, which was in general use some centuries later.

*[[Saqqaq culture]] 2400-900 BCE

[[File:Midnight sun in Disko Bay.jpg|thumb|Hunting place of the Saqqaq culture on [[Disko Bay]], photo by Jan Kronsell]]
In the western and southern parts of the eastern coast of Greenland, the Saqqaq culture developed around 2300 BCE and lasted 1500 years. The centre of their settlements was [[Disko Bay]] near the place [[Saqqaq]], which lent its name to the culture. The people extended their culture along the fjords and coastlines in the area. The culture of the Saqqaq people shows marked similarity to the culture that in the Canadian Arctic is described as "Pre-Dorset", and the two cultures developed around the same time. Scholars believe that the people of the Saqqaq split off from the Pre-Dorset culture, migrated into Greenland from [[Ellesmere Island]] in the north, and later migrated to the southern coast.

*[[Independence II culture]] 800/600-1 BC

Presumably for climatic reasons, northern Greenland was not populated for about 500 years afterward. Archaeological evidence has shown that before the disappearance of the Saqqaq culture from southern Greenland, a new culture arrived from the Canadian archipelago. The newer people showed a more developed culture from an archaeological standpoint. That culture is called Independence II culture, and it seems to have developed from the Canadian Pre-Dorset cultures. Possibly, they came in close contact with the Saqqaq culture.

The range of distribution of the Independence II people approximately corresponds to that of the Independence I people. The oldest finds have been dated to 1400 BCE, and the most recent to 400 BCE. Researchers have not confirmed whether the farthest northern regions of Greenland were constantly settled during this 1000-year period, because only about 10 dwellings are extant. The climate of that time steadily worsened; the warmest temperature of the Independence II period approximately matches the coldest temperature of the Independence I period.

Archaeological research has focused its fieldwork on areas of Greenland below 83 degrees latitude north for traces of the Independence II culture. In 1987 the remains of a larger Independence II settlement was discovered on the [[Île-de-France (Greenland)|Île-de-France]] (at about 78 degrees north). The Independence II people hunted the same animals as earlier cultures (seals and muskoxen), but for the first time also walruses. The houses of the Independence II period were similar to those of the Independence I period, only more complex. So far no connection between the two cultures has been proven. Independence II tools are more reminiscent of the Pre-Dorset and the later Dorset culture. The fate of the Independence II culture is unknown; it is possible that they migrated south along the east coast of Greenland and merged into the Dorset Culture.

*Dorset Culture (500 BC-1000 AD)

[[File:Mallikjuaq Thule site 1 1995-06-19.jpg|thumb|Thule artefacts on [[Mallikjuaq Island]], near [[Cape Dorset]]]]
Archaeological evidence shows that between 500 BCE and 500 CE, remarkable technological and cultural advances took place in the area of northern Canada and Greenland known as the Dorset region. Today this period is known as Dorset I. The Dorset people are probably identical to the ''Tuniit'' (singular Tuniq, also Tornit or Tunirjuat), who are described in Inuit mythology as powerful giants who dwelt in stone houses. They were believed to have been capable of enormous feats of strength, such as carrying walruses or moving enormous boulders.

Their hunting methods were greatly improved over previous Arctic cultures. They probably invented the [[igloo]],&lt;ref&gt;''Igloo'' (originally ''iglu'') can refer to any kind of house, although it is usually used to refer to domed snow dwellings. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/igloo Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; which is difficult to determine because such ephemeral structures leave no archaeological evidence. They spent the winters in relatively permanent dwellings constructed of stone and pieces of grass; these were the precursors of the later [[qarmaq]]s. They were also the first culture to carve seal-oil lamps (''qulliq'', also spelled ''[[kudlik]]'') from [[soapstone]].

In the next 500 years, known as the Dorset II period, the Dorset culture expanded to occupy the region between [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]] in the west to Greenland in the east to Newfoundland in the south. A shift in climate, which enabled them to settle high-Arctic regions, probably contributed to this. It is remarkable that the Dorset II culture uniformly maintained the stylistic attributes of the Dorset I culture despite this rapid territorial expansion.

[[File:Iglu 1 1999-04-02.jpg|thumb|Igloo]]
Ivory carvings date to as early as the Dorset I period, but artistic activity appears to have greatly increased in the Dorset II period. The presence of tiny human [[Masks among Eskimo peoples|masks]] that subtly suggest animal features, carvings of bears with incised spirit lines indicating skeletal structures, and enigmatic tubes that may have been used to suck spirits out of the possessed; indicate the [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanistic]], ritual character of this art. This cultural trend probably results from socio-economic pressures exerted upon the Dorset by the presence of new ethnic groups in the region.

This period's climate was responsible for the [[Vikings]]' naming of [[Iceland]] and Greenland, labels that in our times sound paradoxical.

*** "Western Thule" of North Alaska

*Thule culture (1000-1800 CE)

[[File:Thule site 1995-06-23.jpg|thumb|An Inuk explains Thule settlement artefacts at [[Chesterfield Inlet]]]]
The relatively temperate climate of the Alaska had allowed much greater cultural advances among the peoples there during the 3,000 years since the Pre-Dorset had left the region.

====Cultural and technological advancements====
The various peoples of the Alaskan coasts had in that period developed entirely new techniques for hunting and fishing; these technologies also fundamentally changed their lifestyle and culture. Developments included boats constructed of watertight seal skin stretched over wooden frames such as the [[kayak]] (Inuktitut: ''qajag''), used by hunters, and the ''[[umiak]]'', a large boat used by groups of up to 20 women; new styles of spears, and harpoons equipped with weights and floats. These technologies enabled the [[whaling|hunting of whales]], which provided a valuable source of food (especially whale skin, rich in [[vitamin C]]) and expanded the range of available materials to be processed for construction (bones and skin) and heating ([[whale oil]]). The development of [[dog sled]]s and of igloos that could be entered by a tunnel provided easier travel for the people and warmer dwellings during the winter. All of these advances promoted the formation of new social, religious, and artistic values.

====The wave of Thule migrations====
The warmer climate of North America in 1000 CE increased the amount of habitable territory in the Arctic and contributed to population growth. Presumably, this development, along with the constant pursuit of quarry into higher latitudes and the search for meteorite iron, was a major impetus for the migration of the Alaskan Thule into northern Canada and Greenland. In the so-called "second migration", some of the displaced groups migrated south, settling in the [[Hudson Bay]] area. As Inuit myths explain, the Dorset-culture residents were assimilated by the technologically superior Thule in most areas but were massacred in others. The Dorset culture subsequently died out throughout the Arctic in a short period around 1000 CE. They held out for a few centuries longer in northern Labrador and in the [[District of Ungava|Ungava region]] (until about 1300 CE); the isolated [[Sadlermiut]] survived until the early 20th century on the southern coasts of [[Southampton Island]] and two islands nearby, [[Walrus Island (Hudson Bay, Nunavut)|Walrus Island]] and [[Coats Island]].

[[File:Qarmaq 2 1999-07-12.jpg|thumb|Remains of a Thule dwelling ([[Ukkusiksalik National Park]])]]
The new arrivals were the direct ancestors of today's Inuit. They originated from the area around the Bering Strait, but are named the Thule after the location of the first traces of their settlements to be excavated: [[Qaanaaq|Thule, Greenland]].

====Thule dwellings====
[[File:Qarmaq 1 1997-08-02.jpg|thumb|Whalebone house (with reconstructed whalebone dome), near [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]]]]
The typical Thule house was constructed from a framework of whale jawbones and ribs anchored in the tundra soil with rocks. Animal hides were stretched over the frame, which was covered with [[sod]]. As accommodations for long hunting trips, the Thule used hide-tents in the summer.

====Artistic activities====
[[File:Inuksuk 1 2002-07-26.jpg|thumb|Inunnguaq, "like a human form" ([[Inuksuk]])]]
While the artistic productions of the Dorset were almost exclusively shaped by shamanistic ritual and myths, such influences are barely detectable in Thule art. The utensils discovered in excavations of well-preserved Thule dwellings show only decorative incisions. These utensils were almost entirely functional, with no ritual purpose. Small figurative carvings in ivory of female figures, water birds, and whales have also been found in Thule sites, but in relatively small numbers. Occasionally water birds would be depicted with the heads of women and vice versa, but such shamanistic carvings are few among the already small proportions of figurative carvings in Thule art.

Among the art of the Thule, the depictions of bears especially contrasts with the art of the Dorset. In Dorset art, bears are realistically depicted within stylistic conventions; today, these objects are interpreted as spirit-helpers or amulets against dangers encountered in the hunt. In Thule art, images of bears are limited to carved bear heads that attached to harpoon shafts. Whether they served a decorative or functional purpose is uncertain (probably both). The Thule used bear teeth as jewellery, or hunting trophies. The artefacts left by the Thule generally suggests that they led a more comfortable lifestyle and had leisure time to artistically decorate their personal effects- their art was not the result of social or economic anxieties.

They constructed diverse and numerous [[Inuksuk|Inuksuit]] (like a man), piled-stone landmarks that survive. Some are examples of an impressive art form.

====Transitional phase (1300–19th century)====
From the beginning of the 14th century, a gradual cooling occurred throughout the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Archipelago]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]] coast of the mainland. The period between 1550 and 1880, the so-called "[[Little Ice Age]]", caused temperatures significantly lower than today's in North America and Europe (with a brief period of higher heat around 1800). The effect of the drop in temperature upon the hunting-dependent lifestyle of the Thule was significant. Entire regions of the high Arctic were [[Population decline|depopulated]], partly by mass migrations but also by the starvation of entire communities. The traditional way of life was maintained only by communities in the relatively hospitable regions of the Arctic: the southern end of Baffin Island, Labrador, and the southernmost tip of Greenland. In Greenland, the Thule developed a different social structure and new dwelling types, and became what is known as the [[Inugsuk culture]].

In Greenland, the beginning of the 17th century brought the first European [[Whaler|whaling ships]] and sudden change. In the following 150 years, up to [[History of whaling|10,000 whalers]] would annually pass the coast of Greenland and substantially influence the culture of the Thule living there. The emerging trade relationships made intermarriage with European-Canadians and European-Americans common; there were few genetically pure Inugsuk after several generations.

====Historical period of the Inuit (from 1800)====
The 19th century is regarded as the beginning of "Inuit culture." Although the Thule traditions endured in a limited way, the living conditions of Inuit in the historical period were considerably worse than those of their ancestors 1000 years before. The technical standards and spirit of their artwork likewise began to decline. Carving and decorative engraving, for example, became rarer and less differentiated. The colder climate of the period and the resulting decline in animals as game meant that the Inuit were forced to abandon their winter settlements in search of quarry. In their newly nomadic way of life, the Inuit built more temporary winter dwellings. These were tent-like huts constructed of stone, grass, and snow. The Inuit called them ''qarmaqs''. The technique of constructing igloos was further developed and became more widespread.

====Contact with Europeans====
Contact with Europeans was another important impetus for change in the culture of the Inuit. The earliest contacts with the Vikings, later with explorers, fishermen and whalers, affected Canadian Inuit (as opposed to Greenland's) less profoundly and more locally. Those early European arrivals did not intend to settle Canada. Such contacts proved fatal for many Inuit due to the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, [[smallpox]] and other infectious diseases.

In contrast, tradesmen, missionaries and representatives of the Canadian administration established themselves in the region and directly influenced the life of the natives. The Canadians erected the first administrative and police stations in 1903, near the important whaling base of [[Cape Fullerton|Fullerton Harbour]] on Hudson Bay and on [[Herschel Island]] northwest of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]]. In that same year, the Norwegian [[Roald Amundsen]] started to transit the famous [[Northwest Passage]] with his ship ''[[Gjøa]]'' on a more southerly course than that of his predecessors, alongside the Canadian mainland.

Starting at the beginning of the 20th century, radical changes occurred for the Arctic people. Greenland was visited with increasing frequency: [[Alfred Wegener]] led an expedition in 1912–13, and the Thule expeditions by [[Knud Rasmussen]] took place in 1915-1924. In 1933, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] attested Denmark's authority in Greenland, with cultural, political and structural impacts for the Inuit.

In Canada, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] tapped the previously unexplored "Barren Lands" of the [[Kivalliq Region]] to the west of Hudson Bay for trade. The Inuit no longer hunted animals for food and clothing, but mainly to acquire goods for barter with the emissaries of markets in the south and in Europe. The fur of the [[Arctic fox]] was especially in demand, but other kinds of fur and the ivory of walruses and [[narwhal]]s were also desirable. The insistence on fox fur alone caused disruption as the trapping of foxes was traditionally done by the women. However, the numbers required by the traders meant travelling long distances over the trap line and it became men's work (see [[#Menstruation|Menstruation]] and [[#Family life|Family life]] below). Due to trade, the Inuit could acquire goods of the European-Canadian civilization, such as weapons and ammunition, tobacco, coffee, tea, sugar and flour. To keep the hunters associated with the [[trading post]]s, the traders lent them traps and extended credit to the Inuit. Becoming more dependent on another people meant that the native society had lost its former self-sufficiency. Therefore changing their cultural development.

====19th century social structure and way of life====
[[File:Iglulik Clothing 1999-07-18.jpg|thumb|Traditional Inuit clothes; [[Amauti]]]]
The basic social structure of the Inuit in the 19th century consisted of an estimated 50 groups of 200 to 800 members apiece. The membership was based upon the voluntary association of large and loosely composed clans. The clans in turn were made up of extended families- the grandparents, parents, and children. Such a loose social structure, which allowed families self-sufficiency and self-governance, increased the chances of social survival in times of scarcity.

Hunting provided the Inuit with a balanced [[Inuit diet|diet]] and the raw materials for [[Inuit clothing|clothing]], housing, household implements and heating, boat and sled-building, hunting weapons, toys, and art-objects. Stones, carefully chosen and carved, were used for select but important objects: arrow, spear, and harpoon heads, hide-scrapers, and knives. Soapstone, a relatively soft and easily carved material, was used for the production of oil lamps (qulliqs) and cooking vessels.
[[File:Maktaaq 2 2002-08-10.jpg|thumb|Women eating [[maktaaq]], a traditional Inuit delicacy (the skin of a [[Greenland whale]])]]

Plant-materials played a small role in Inuit culture, as they were so rare. Wood is scarce in the Arctic, except in the form of occasional [[driftwood]]. The bones, tusks, and antlers of hunted animals were used in its place. Berries were collected in large numbers during the late summer, but while they provided a source of some vitamins, they were far from sufficient. The people met their vitamin requirements by eating raw animal products, such as [[muktuk]] (whale skin and [[blubber]]), meat and fish.

The Inuit tradition of living in tents during summer and in igloos and qarmait (singular: [[qarmaq]], warm half-subterranean houses made from boulders, whale bones and sod) in winter still followed the Thule practices. The most important principle of all building constructions was the lowered entrance tunnel, which served as a windscreen and cold trap. The inner living area was constructed at a higher level so that the heavier cold air could not easily enter it. Girl children played with [[string figure]]s within the igloos, as preparation for learning to sew and partly as a ritual act. The girls of the [[Chugach]] people mainly played this in autumn because it was believed this weaving captured the sunrays and thus delayed the beginning of winter. Often the creation of string figures was accompanied by rhymes and songs describing tales, legends and myths.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic V. Grunfeld (Ed.), Oker: ''Spiele der Welt II.'' (in German) Fischer, Frankfurt/M 1984. {{ISBN|3-596-23075-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inuit had developed winter clothing that ensured an effective use of the body heat, avoiding holes that would allow air to leak out. Apart from seal, mostly caribou skin was used, and in Greenland polar bear fur. In order to create a cushion of warm air, the clothing was loosely tailored and worn in two layers, the outer one with the hair inside, the inner one with the hair outside. In summer, only the inner layer was worn. The hood fixed on the inside of the coat avoided the leaking of warm air at the neck. Mothers used an additional part of their hoods for carrying the toddlers in their parka (''[[amauti]]'').

===Nomadic life in the first half of the 20th century===
[[File:Ikirasaq 1 1997-04-27.jpg|thumb|Camp Ikirasaq (Southern Baffin Island), abandoned in the late 1940s]]
Many elders still remember the time, more than 60 years ago, when the Inuit lived a nomadic lifestyle. Depending on the seasons (up to sixteen according to old traditions), they followed the animals they hunted for clothing and nourishment. They had to relocate and reconstruct their camps frequently and followed the same traditions for generations.

At the turn to the 20th century, most Inuit still lived in hide tents during the summer. Sometimes, they already owned canvas tents obtained from the Hudson's Bay Company. The interior was divided into a back part used for sleeping, usually raised by coat underlays, and a front part for cooking and living; a tradition still in practice today. The woman's sleeping place was always beside the kudlik, an oil lamp usually carved from soapstone used for lighting, heating and cooking, because it was her duty to operate it. The man's sleeping place was near the weapons and hunting equipment; the children were nestled between their parents for warmth. Today the kudlik is replaced by a product of modern industry, the [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] [[portable stove|stove]], which is easy to transport and operated by [[gasoline]] and [[naphtha]].

[[File:Ringed seal 1 2000-08-13.jpg|thumb|Dressing a [[ringed seal]]]]
[[File:Satturituq Bay 5 2000-08-22.jpg|thumb|Fishing for [[Arctic char]]]]
In the few months of summer, the people moved camp to the estuaries, because there it was easier to catch the favoured [[Arctic char]], e.g. by using artificial [[Fishing weir|weirs]], and the eggs of seabirds. For the inland Inuit, the caribou was the most important resource; it provided meat, a hide for clothing, and sinew for rope. The coastal Inuit hunted mostly seals and walruses and, depending on the region, narwhals and [[Beluga whale|belugas]]; of course also the occasional caribou. The seals were used for food for men and dogs. Their oil was used for the kudliks, and their skin and sinews for seal boots (''[[Mukluk|kamik]]''), kayak coverings, ropes (also drag ropes for dog sleds) and dog whips.

During the winter, the Inuit lived in igloos, which were erected separately or connected by tunnels. Snow of a specific consistency was necessary to build them. They had the same general interior arrangement as the tents. The most important element was a lowered entrance tunnel, repelling the heavier cold air and the wind from entering inside. As additional prevention against cold, the sleeping area was elevated by a layer of snow as compared to the living area.

Some of the families that wanted to live in permanent camps, built themselves a partially subsurface home of rocks, whale bones, coat and sod, the so-called qarmaq. The construction of such camps is certainly based on the Thule tradition. During the winter, they used qarmaqs, but in summer preferred the more airy tents.

[[File:Qamutik 1 1999-04-01.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[dog sled]] (''qamutik''), today almost entirely replaced by the [[snowmobile]], except for festive occasions.]]
Due to the hard weather conditions in winter, in this season the families joined closer together. Mutual visits at hunting places of different groups were for the exchange of news and experiences, but mostly for the exchange of food from different sources. In winter, travelling was done by dog sleds, partly presumably also by foot.

During the warmer seasons, mainly the people used the kayak, or, mostly as "women boat" for families, the large umiak, and travelled by foot. Traditional land routes were, e.g., from [[Wager Bay]] to [[Repulse Bay, Nunavut|Repulse Bay]] in north, to [[Chesterfield Inlet]] with the adjacent [[Baker Lake, Nunavut|Baker Lake]] in the southwest and to [[Chantrey Inlet]] at the Arctic Ocean in the northwest.

== Transition into the 21st century ==

=== Fundamental change of living conditions ===
Between 1800 and 1950, the culture and way of living of the Canadian Inuit, who had not known any monetary system before, changed fundamentally. Complete self-sufficiency and independence were to a large extent replaced by dependence on goods of western industrialized countries, such as clothing, many kinds of foodstuffs, weapons, tools and technical equipment. This development was largely due to the fact that as hunters and trappers, they could develop only a low level of productivity that could not financially cover the Western way of living. Moreover, the products of the kill depended too much on market and fashion fluctuations, not to speak of concerns related to protection of species and of the environment.

Post-World War II, the northern regions were increasingly incorporated into a [[Cold War]] strategic defense concept, and military and radar stations of the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] (DEW Line) were established. Although this developed the infrastructure and created jobs, it also led to a sudden urbanization that not every community could adapt to. Traditional ways of living were increasingly constrained and eliminated, with no provision made for the transition to the new way of living. The transitional difficulties were further enhanced, for example, by the fact that at the end of the 1940s, the Kivalliq Region had to be placed under [[quarantine]] because of the appearance of serious infectious diseases such as [[poliomyelitis|polio]] (for which there was as yet no [[vaccine]]). At the same time, the caribou population west of Hudson Bay nearly perished. As a consequence, the Inuit of that area lost their food supply. Those Inuit still mostly living in camps faced an increasing threat from [[tuberculosis]]; many who contracted the disease had to be treated in sanatoriums in the south. Many Inuit tried to continue their traditional way of living in their ancestral regions while adapting to the new conditions. But, they became more dependent on governmental welfare.

The Canadian state had primarily scientific interest in its northern regions during the first half of the century. Beginning in the 1950s, it became concerned about three issues: military security requirements, discovery of economically important natural resources, and an increasing sensibility for the special concerns of the Inuit. The government felt the need to exercise governmental control and sovereignty over the territory. The Canadian government created a ''Department of Indian Affairs and Natural Resources'' in 1953 (now [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]]). This department established social benefits such as unemployment aid, social welfare, care of the sick and of the elderly, child allowance, comprehensive educational and welfare programs of the industrial areas of Canada. At the same time, the Canadian government [[High Arctic relocation|forcibly moved]] many Inuit families from their traditional hunting grounds into new and empty areas, to reinforce claims of Canadian sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED388479&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED388479 ERIC - Tammarniit (Mistakes): Inuit Relocation in the Eastern Arctic, 1939-63]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2004/09/08/sep08relocate08092004.html | work=CBC News | title=No events to mark Inuit relocation program | date=2004-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1950s, dramatic changes had occurred for the Canadian Inuit, which lasted well into the 1960s. There were differences among the regions of Nunavut, such as the [[Qikiqtaaluk Region|Qikiqtaaluk]] (Baffin), Kivalliq or [[Kitikmeot Region|Kitikmeot]]. The common characteristic was the extensive change from the nomadic to the sedentary way of living. Inuit left their camps and moved into settlements with permanent buildings. The wooden building replaced the igloo, qarmaq and tents originally made from hide. Since then, the Inuit have lived in residential buildings prefabricated in the south of Canada and—because of [[permafrost]]—built on stilts. These buildings are heated with oil stoves (every building has a holding tank for heating oil). Fresh water is delivered by tankers, and sewage is brought away the same way. The buildings contain kitchens with electric range, sink, and freezer; a bathroom with shower and/or bathtub, and flushing toilet; washers and dryers have become common. Like other westerners, many households keep their TV sets on almost 24 hours a day. The people use fax machines and e-mail for correspondence.

== Traditional customs ==

=== Menstruation ===

Traditionally, young Inuit women received little information about puberty, fertility, and pregnancy. Consequently, elders describe that it was not uncommon for young women to remain in bed when they reached [[menarche]], believing that they were sick or physiologically different.&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak"&gt;Qinuajuak, L. (1996). Inuit birth traditions. Midwifery Today and Childbirth Education, (40), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Once informed, the young woman's mother would instruct her on [[menstruation]] practices and often, the camp (or community) would become apprised of her situation. During menstruation, women were expected to follow certain practices including, 1) not sitting where men sat, 2) using rabbit skin, foxes&lt;ref&gt;[http://iain-cameron.blogspot.ca/2007/09/new-diseases-article-from-edmonton.html Skipper recalls bringing TB infected Indian back to Coppermine]&lt;/ref&gt; or mosses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/201/300/cdn_medical_association/cmaj/vol-155/issue-11/1613.htm Health care in North must acknowledge Inuit values, traditional medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; and other garments, with the exception of men's garments, for [[Sanitary napkin|sanitary pads]], and 3) laying rabbit skin on the bed at night to soak up blood. According to elders, women had to abide by more rules than men because of their menstruation and some rules were not only considered tradition, but also taboo if not followed. For example, using a man's garment for a sanitary pad could prevent the young woman from finding a husband for marriage.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk"&gt;Nakasuk S, Paniaq H, Ootoova E, Angmaalik P. (1999) Pregnancy. Interviewing Inuit elders Introduction (1): 141-143. Nunavut Arctic College.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===

Marriage commonly occurred when the female reached 14–15 years of age and the man reached adulthood, considered around 20 years of age. The marriage was traditionally arranged by the parents of the couple, possibly as early as infanthood, and often reflected a desire to strengthen the bond between families. In some parts of the Arctic, men also practised the tradition of "stealing" their wife from a camp, symbolically showing that the family did not want the daughter to leave their camp. In these cases, the family would later celebrate together and the woman would then join the husband's territory.&lt;ref name="Boult"&gt;Boult D. (2006) The Inuit Way: A Guide to Inuit Culture. Pauktuutit Inuit Women's Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Childhood of the Inuit was still very brief the first half of the 20th century. Especially girls entered [[child marriage|marriage at an early age]]. Before the arrival of [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]], it was mostly the families who decided which children should marry whom, i.e. [[arranged marriage]]s. Marriages often served to strengthen family ties, and girls had no say in choosing their partners. Sometimes a young man who had not yet been pledged, sent to the parents of the girl, without being personally present in those negotiations. The wedding was completely unceremonial (the same was true for birthdays). After Christianization, the only change was that now the couples also received Christian marriage ceremonies whenever a priest travelled their areas (often months after the actual marriage). When finally government administration had been established, marriages were also registered by the administration, initially by police officers, later by the local administrations. Since moving from the camps to the settlements, more couples live together without marriage. This way, they feel less tied but also less responsible. But still, in the 1970s, it was in no way unusual to make agreements regarding newborns about eventual marriages. However, when these promises of marriage became due, fifteen or twenty years later, they were taken less and less seriously.

Before Christianizing (referred to as [[Siqqitiq]] by the Inuit), [[polygamy]], more often [[polygyny]], less so [[polyandry]], were not unusual among the Inuit. Extramarital relationships were accepted especially during extensive hunting trips, and there were so-called "lamp extinction games" with ritual partner exchanges. According to a popular theory, these traditions reduced the danger of [[inbreeding]] and resulting [[population bottleneck]] in small and isolated settlements. With colonization, these customs led to great conflicts: On one hand such traditions were thought by missionaries as [[sin]]ful, on the other, they were interpreted as sexual arbitrariness and taken advantage of, often leading to prostitution and sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Barüske, Heinz.

=== Family life ===
[[File:Camp Iqalurajuk (Cabin) 1997-04-28.jpg|thumb|Inuit cabin built for use while on the land hunting and fishing]]

Until the middle of the 20th century, i.e. until the move from disperse camps to settlements, the [[sexual division of labour]] between men and women within the families and family groups in northern Canada was traditionally arranged fairly well, and rather different: The men were responsible for the acquisition of food, especially for hunting and fishing, and for technical work (including the construction of igloos, qarmaqs, and tents). The [[Inuit women]] were predominantly in charge of intra-family concerns, such as caring for little children, taking care of the kill (conservation of meat, cleaning of furs, and the like), the sewing of clothing, fire keeping in the qulliq, etc. (their participation in hunting and fishing was limited). Whenever a family lost its breadwinner (for example in an accident), it was usually dependent on support by other families, and the widow was sometimes adopted as an additional wife by a close relative of the deceased (see [[widow inheritance]]).

However, due to men being required to sometimes travel large distances to obtain food the division was not absolute. Men, for example, would need to know how to sew in case repairs were needed to their clothing. At the same, time women were required to know how to hunt and be able to help with igloo building.

The move from the camps to the settlements, which essentially took place during the 1950s, brought about significant changes in this respect: The Inuit now were immediate subjects of governmental administration and care (also social welfare). By occupations that were completely new to them, like in health care and local administration, but also in Inuit arts, the women with their earned money were able to contribute like the men to the livelihood of their families. Nowadays, the division of tasks and responsibilities between male and female Inuit are, following Canadian legislation, not very different from western industrialized nations, of which the Inuit are considered a part. In the Northwest Territories the first female premier was [[Nellie Cournoyea]], an Inuk. In Nunavut, female representatives and ministers are as common as their male counterparts. There are Inuit municipalities with female mayors, for example.

== Health disparities ==

== The context of birth ==

The Second World War and subsequent Cold War initiated a newfound interest in the Arctic by the Canadian government.&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;Douglas, V. (2006). Childbirth among the Canadian Inuit: A review of the clinical and cultural literature. International Journal of Circumpolar Health, 65(2), 117-132.&lt;/ref&gt; Its vast mineral resources and strategic proximity to the USSR brought rapid development to the region.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; The study of the Inuit people's health outcomes also began, finding vast health disparities between northern and southern Canadians.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; This prompted the opening of several nursing outposts in the Northwest Territories, including what is now Nunavut to provide primary and some secondary care to the Inuit population. These proved successful, and several studies found that Inuit had better access to primary care than many southern Canadians.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; To aid in maternity care, the government in Ottawa began recruiting [[Midwife|midwives]] from England and New Zealand to work in the Arctic regions, which preserved the woman-centred midwifery model of care practiced by the traditional Inuit midwives. However, this was short-lived due to more stringent immigration laws passed in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; The physicians recruited to replace these midwives advocated for a medicalized, tertiary-care level birth, and a de facto policy of flying women to southern hospitals for labour and delivery was adopted. In the 1970s and 1980s, nearly 100% of pregnant women were flown out of their homeland to give birth.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; The most popular routes—from north to [[Yellowknife]], Ottawa, Ontario; Churchill, Manitoba; or Winnipeg, Manitoba could be more than 1,000 miles.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt;

So common was the fly out to give birth that Inuit culture began to adapt to this almost inevitable fact. To announce a newborn member of their community, many Inuit proclaim "the newborn has arrived" instead of "the baby is born".&lt;ref name="video"&gt;Qanuuqturniq- finding the balance- chapter 1: Birth, a joyous community event.

== Pregnancy behaviors and beliefs ==

=== Pregnancy ===

In regards to conception and pregnancy, young Inuit woman were discouraged from engaging in sexual intercourse during puberty, ages 11 to 13 years, until they reached "prime maternity age", after marriage, about 15. Similar to menarche, many young Inuit women were unaware about the indications of their first pregnancy. Elders recount that young women often thought that they had been cured of their menses when they experienced [[amenorrhoea]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt; It was not uncommon for the young woman to learn about her first pregnancy from her mother or grandmother when she began to show (or carry weight).&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt; According to elders, pregnancy was also determined by, "looking into the face" of the young woman and/or feeling her stomach for a fetus.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; Once aware, it was important that the woman immediately divulge her pregnancy status to her mother, husband, and close community, as the Inuit believed that her status demanded special considerations and/or treatment to ensure the health of mother, baby, and camp.

To prevent miscarriage, the husband and camp were to assure that the woman did not become mentally stressed or exhausted during the pregnancy. This taboo extended to include not allowing the husband to get angry with his wife at any time during the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; If miscarriage did occur, the woman was expected to inform her mother and the camp right away. According to traditional Inuit beliefs, hiding such a secret would bring bad luck for the camp such as, hunger, lack of food, or illness.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;

=== Taboos (pittailiniq) in pregnancy ===

In pregnancy, women's care was traditionally guided by the taboos, known as ''pittailiniq'', from the elders in the community. These taboos, which were passed down through generations and varied somewhat across geographic regions or camps, informed the woman's behaviors and activities in order to prevent complications, promote a healthy birth, and ensure desired characteristics of the infant. For example, in regards to activity, the Inuit had many pittailiniq about maintaining physical activity throughout pregnancy and resisting idleness or laziness, which was believed to adversely affect labour and birth. The Inuit words ''sailliq'' and ''sailliqtuq'', distinguished between the women who relaxed (sailliq) as appropriate, and those who relaxed too much, sailliqtuq.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt; Another common pittailiniq instructed the woman to massage her stomach until she felt the fetus move, so that the baby wouldn't "stick" to the uterus.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;

In interviews with Inuit elders, numerous pittailiniq about the woman's activity and behavior in pregnancy are discussed. Some of these are listed below.

==== Pittailiniq on activity in pregnancy ====

*In the morning when you wake, go outside as fast as possible, to ensure a short labour and fast delivery&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;
*Don't relax too much or the placenta might stick to the womb&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;
*Don't lie around or take naps or the labour will be long&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;
*When you stretch sealskin on a frame, don't wind the rope around your hands because this would cause the umbilical cord to be wrapped around the baby's neck.&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;
*Don't put anything bowl-shaped on your head so the placenta won't get stuck on the baby's head.&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;
*Don't walk backward or the baby will be breech&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;
*Don't put your head or arm part way through a doorway or into a hole because during birth the baby will present and retreat back and forth, or the baby will come out arm first&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;

==== Pittailiniq on behavior in pregnancy ====

*When called outside or asked to perform a task, do so immediately to ensure a speedy delivery&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;
*If you begin a project such as sewing, finish it or the labour will be longer&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;
*Don't scratch your stomach so that stretch marks will be less noticeable&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;
*Don't speak about or stare at other peoples' physical oddities such as a big nose, or your baby will have even more serious oddities&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;
*Untie everything that is tied up so that you will be more dilated when the baby is ready&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;
*Don't wear tight pants while pregnant so that you will have an easier delivery&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;
*Don't clean your hands with an [[ulu]] or knife in order to prevent a dry, painful birth and risk of [[Perineal tear classification|perineal tears]]&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;
*Don't make bubbles with gum or blow up a balloon or your membranes won't rupture&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;
*Face your bed toward a doorway. If it is sideways toward the door the baby will be transverse&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;
*Don't allow your legs to get cold during pregnancy, because this will cause hemorrhaging after birth&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;

=== Diet in pregnancy ===

The Inuit also followed many taboos (pittailiniq) about diet and consumption in pregnancy. Consistently, elders report that pregnant women were to abstain from raw meat, eating only boiled or cooked meat, during pregnancy. Men were also expected to observe this rule, but only when in the presence of their wives.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt; The preferential treatment of pregnant women also extended to food, and the best pieces of meat and food were always reserved for the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;

The pittailiniq regarding the diet of pregnant women demonstrate the strong emphasis on maternal diet affecting infant beauty and/or appearance. Some of these pittailiniq are listed below.

==== Pittailiniq on diet in pregnancy ====

*When eating, be sure to finish the meal and lick the plate. This ensures that your baby will be beautiful.&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;
*Eat caribou kidneys to ensure that you have beautiful babies&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;
*When eating seal, swallow a seal cap to have a nice round baby&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;
*Do not drink directly from a soup bowl or the baby will have dark skin&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;
*Do not chew candle wax during pregnancy or the baby will be covered with a white coating at birth&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;
*Eat seaweed if you want to have a boy&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;

=== Preparation for birth ===

According to elders, the women were not taught how to prepare for birth. Women expected and trusted that they would receive instruction and advice from their midwife and other birth attendants (i.e. mother and/or mother-in-law) during the event. When labour and birth were perceived imminent, the woman and/or her attendants would set up a soft bed of caribou skins or heathers nearby. A thick layer of caribou fur on top of the heathers was desired in order to soak up the blood lost during birth.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;

=== Birth attendant(s) ===

According to elders, birth ideally occurred with both an assistant and midwife, but due to hunting-based economy/survival, many births occurred in transit or at a hunting camp. In these cases, the elders report that either the men would assist or the woman would endure birth alone.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; Due to the uncertainty of their location at the time of birth, the woman was often unaware of who her midwife was until birth.

In the community, a midwife (''Kisuliuq'', ''Sanariak'') or "maker" was a highly revered female member of the community, who had acquired experience and skills in birth by attending births with their mother, an elder, or other midwife of the community; often beginning at young age.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk"/&gt; The responsibilities of the midwife varied somewhat by geographic region and camp, but often included, 1) comforting the woman, 2) knowing a woman's body, including 'what was inside', 3) instructing the woman during labour on what to expect, 4) repositioning the woman to promote quick deliveries, and 4) dealing with complications.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;

In most communities, a man only became intentionally involved in a birth if he was a ''[[angakkuq]]''. In cases when the midwife or elder suspected a "spiritual or supernatural interference", the angakkuq would intervene to remove the spiritual interference of a spirit or another malicious angakkuq, to restore the spiritual balance and normal birth conditions.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;

=== Labour ===

Labour and birth were times of great celebration in the Inuit community.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; Traditionally, when a woman began having contractions, her midwife would gather other women of the community to help the labouring woman through the birthing process.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; Additional signs of labour noted by the Inuit midwife included, a brown strip of discharge, broken water, stomachache, or the urge to pass a bowel movement.&lt;ref name="Gafvels"&gt;Gafvels, K. (2010). Bringing birth back: Midwifery implementation in nunavut. Unpublished manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was cause for great celebration, labour is traditionally a time of quiet and calm in the Inuit community, and the midwife would commonly whisper her counsel to the mother-to-be.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; If the woman had followed the superstitions throughout her pregnancy, she could expect her labour to be quick and easy.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; Many of these also extended to the actions of the woman's midwife, who was also commanded to be swift in all aspects of her life so that her client would enjoy a quick delivery.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; Very often, women were expected to continue their daily chores up until the late stages of labour and endure labour pains without the aid of pain management.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gafvels" /&gt;

The midwife's goals during labour typically included keeping the woman from becoming irritable or screaming, preventing her legs from opening, preventing her from having peeing or having a bowel movement, and encouraging activity and position changes. (Inuit Midiwfiery ppt). The positions in which an Inuk woman laboured varied according to the midwife's preferences and her own comfort. These include, lithotomy, side lying, [[quatting position|squatting]], and standing positions have all been described in the literature.&lt;ref name="video" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gafvels" /&gt; Often, a caribou pelt was placed under the woman and she was allowed to choose a bed or the floor.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; Some communities' midwives employed the use of equipment such as ropes to pull on or a box to lean over to help ease the pains of labour, but little evidence of either [[Pharmacology|pharmacologic]] or [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] pain relief is described.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; Traditionally, the woman was required to have her spine completely straight for the entirety of her labour and delivery.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; To facilitate this, the midwife would often place a wooden board behind the woman to keep her back aligned.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; Additionally, a rolled towel or block of wood was used to keep the woman's legs and feet apart during labour, which, in the midwives' view, helped to speed the labour along.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;

=== Birth ===

In traditional Inuit birth culture, the birth event was handled almost exclusively by the midwife.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; However, the woman played an active role in her own birth experience and was encouraged to follow her body's own physiologic cues regarding pushing and rest.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; When she was ready to push, the midwife would tell the woman to pull on her hair with both hands and bear down.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; While most Inuit women gave birth at home,&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; in some communities of western Nunangat women gave birth in separate birthing huts (''aanigutyak'') built exclusively for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, T. (2014) . Retrieved April 13, 2014, from [http://www.hawaii.hawaii.edu/nursing/RNAlaskan10.html Childbearing practices of Native Alaskans]&lt;/ref&gt; If this was not done, the place where the woman gave birth must be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;

Once the baby had crowned and was born, the midwife would cut the still-pulsating umbilical cord with a special knife and tie it with caribou sinew.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; The midwives knew that the sinew carried a much lower risk of infection than other materials available to them.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; The cord was cut with enough length to pull out the placenta by hand if necessary.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; After the child was born and the placenta was ready for delivery, many Inuit midwives would instruct the woman to get on all fours and push in this position.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James, S., O'Brien, B., Bourret, K., Kango, N., Gafvels, K., Gafvels, K., &amp; Paradis, J. (2009). Meeting the needs of nunavut families: A community-based midwifery education program. Rural and Remote Health, 10(2), 1355.&lt;/ref&gt; Midwives were also versed in providing fundal massage to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt;&lt;ref name="James" /&gt; Some Inuit communities wrapped the placenta in cloth and buried it among the rocks of the tundra.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;

=== Postpartum ===

Sources on traditional Inuit birth practices provide little reference to the postpartum period. One elder midwife in Nunavut described that after birth her mother-in-law very briefly cared for the house and chores until she felt better. She also described however, that she was feeling better soon after birth and eagerly performing chores behind her mother-in-law's back.&lt;ref name="Nakasuk" /&gt;

In regards to physical care after birth, the information is also minimal. Women, who are able to breastfeed, do so immediately after birth, often continuing for two years or longer. Breastfeeding served as their only method of contraception and birth spacing. While breastfeeding, the elders describe the importance of keeping the breasts warm to prevent cracking and drinking broth for nutrition.&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt; If perineal tears have occurred during the delivery, they are left to heal on their own; the Inuit do not traditionally perform [[Episiotomy|episiotomies]] or suture tears.&lt;ref name="Qinuajuak" /&gt;

== The newborn ==

The birth of a newborn into the camp is cause for widespread celebration in the community and everyone, including children, would shake hands at its arrival.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; And it was believed that if the mother followed the pittailiniq in pregnancy, the child would be healthy and follow a good life in the community.

Immediately after birth, the infant was assessed for breathing. If the infant was not breathing, then the midwife would hang the infant upside by his feet and slap his buttocks.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; The midwife also removed mucus from the infant's mouth, using either a wipe or her own mouth, to ensure that the baby was able to "fatten" in the coming days.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; The exposed cord stump was then covered with burnt [[Calliergon giganteum|arctic moss]] and the infant was placed in a rabbit fur or cloth pouch, sewn by the sinaji. The pouch served not only to keep the infant warm but also as a diaper and protection for the healing umbilical cord stump. It was believed that the cord stump should fall off on its own and not be looked for by the parents. If the mother found the cord stump, it indicated that the child would become hyperactive around age four.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; The infant was not routinely washed after birth.

Traditional Inuit midwives describe that the first stool ([[meconium]]) should be observed outside the womb, as it could cause clotting and complications if left in the mother. The treatment for which was to massage the woman's stomach, promoting blood flow.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; They midwives also expected the infant to urinate almost immediately after birth, indicating that there was no obstruction or genital abnormality. Infants, as well as the rabbit or cloth pouch, were always dried promptly after urinating or having a bowel movement. And by a year of age, elders claim that children were potty trained.

Also occurring immediately after birth, a designated person, often the midwife, felt the infant's genitalia to determine its gender. This person then became the infant's ''sanaji'' (for an infant boy) or ''arnaliaq'' (for an infant girl) and assumed a lifelong role in the child's life. If the infant was a boy, he would later call this person his ''arnaquti'' and give her his first catch as a child. The sanaji was also responsible for cutting the umbilical cord, providing the infant's first clothes, naming the child (''tuqurausiq''), blessing the child (''kipliituajuq'') and conferring the desired characteristics onto the child. It was believed that the child's direction was shaped from the earliest days of life and consequently, these practices were held in high esteem as they determined the child's future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tradition-orale.ca/english/pdf/Childrearing-Practices-E.pdf Interviewing Inuit Elders Childrearing Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once assessed by the midwife and/or sanaji, the infant was promptly given to the mother for initiation of breastfeeding.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; According to elders, the infant remained in nearly constant physical contact with her mother from the day of birth; sleeping on the family platform, riding in the amauti (baby carrier on the mother), or nestled in her parka for feeding.&lt;ref name="Boult" /&gt;

=== Naming the newborn ===

Performed by the sanaji or midwife, the tuqurausiq was the highly valued naming practice that linked the child to a relative or deceased family friend. The Inuit believed that when the infant was born, he/her took on the soul or spirit of a recently deceased relative or community member. Through the name, the child literally assumed the relationship of his/her namesake. For example, if a child were named for someone's mother, family members would then call that child "mother" and give the child the same respect given to that mother.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; The infant's name also represented an important factor in his/her behavior. In particular, the Inuit believed that crying was an indication that the infant wanted to have a particular name. And that often once named, the infant would stop crying. In addition, as the infant or child is a representative of their namesake, they are considered to generally know what they want or need. For example, when they are hungry or tired. Given this belief, it was also considered inappropriate to tell an infant or child what to do, as it was similar to commanding an elder or another adult, which violated social rule in Inuit culture.&lt;ref name="Boult" /&gt; When an infant or child exhibited the same behavior as their namesake it was called ''atiqsuqtuq''.&lt;ref name= "Ekho" /&gt; Children in the 21st century are still named for other family members but the name may be an English one rather than a traditional Inuit name.

=== Newborn outcomes ===

Compared with non-Inuit Canadians, Inuit have higher fertility rates, higher prevalence of births to mothers age 15–19 years, and worse birth outcomes.&lt;ref name="Government" /&gt; According to 2012 government statistics, the Inuit population has an infant mortality rate of 26.3 deaths per 1,000 live births, as compared to 4.1 deaths per 1,000 live births in the larger Canadian population.&lt;ref name="Government" /&gt; In addition, the Inuit experience a neonatal death rate of 9 deaths per 1,000 live births, versus 4 deaths per 1,000 live births in the Canadian population.&lt;ref name="Government" /&gt;

== Push for a return to community birth ==

Beginning in the late 1970s and 1980s, women in Nunavut and the other areas of Nunangat began a push to end the practice of being flown to the south of Canada (Douglas- Rankin Inlet). This was based on a widely held belief in the region that birth of Inuit children within the Inuit homeland would strengthen the family unit and increase social cohesion.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="video" /&gt; A large anthropological study confirmed strong correlations between the social dissonance caused by birth evacuation and a spectrum of social ills facing Inuit society.&lt;ref name="video" /&gt; Furthermore, Inuit women wanted to return to their traditional practice of woman-centred midwifery, using knowledge passed down through the generations to complement a community-centred birthing experience.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; In 2008, the government of Nunavut passed the Midwifery Professions Act.&lt;ref name="Nunavut Dept Health"&gt;Nunavut Department of Health and Social Services. (2008). Nunavut maternal and newborn health care strategy 2009-2014. (). Iqaluit, NU: Government of Nunavut.&lt;/ref&gt; This far-reaching provision extended a full scope of practice regarding prenatal, birth, postpartum, and primary care to registered midwives.&lt;ref name="Government" /&gt; The act also permitted Nunavut Arctic College to open a midwifery-training program, the curriculum of which is required to include traditional Inuit midwifery knowledge.&lt;ref name="Nunavut Dept Health" /&gt;

=== Birth centres in Nunavut ===

In 1993, the first birth centre in Nunavut opened its doors in [[Rankin Inlet]]. Heralded as a first step in returning birth to the North, the Rankin Inlet Birth Centre was a fledgling operation for most of its first decade.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; Today, more than half of Nunavummiut women give birth in southern hospitals- mostly in Yellowknife, Churchill or Ottawa.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; Only about 20% of the women in the surrounding Kivalliq region of central Nunavut give birth in the centre and less than half (47%) of the births of Rankin Inlet itself take place there.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; Its marginal success has been linked to its relatively low capacity, having only two maternity care workers employed there at any one time- both of whom are almost always southern Canadian midwives there on short-term assignments.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; The birth centre has handled approximately 600 births since its opening.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; A [[University of Manitoba]] audit in 2008 found that the centre has provided consistently safe maternity care since its opening, with not one case of maternal mortality.&lt;ref name="Canadian Nurse"&gt;Canadian Nurse. (2009). Nursing in Nunavut. Retrieved April 14, 2014, from http://www.canadian-nurse.com/en/articles/issues/2009/june-2009/nursing-in-nunavut&lt;/ref&gt;

A second birth centre is housed within the Qikiqtani Hospital in [[Iqaluit]]. The Qikiqtani birth centre handles the majority of births, which occur in Nunavut, about 400 per year.&lt;ref name="Canadian Nurse" /&gt; The centre, opened in 2007, houses four birthing suites and a full surgical backup should the woman need it.&lt;ref name="Canadian Nurse" /&gt; The centre is equipped to handle breech, VBAC, and other complicated vaginal births using a physician-led team as well as midwives.&lt;ref name="Canadian Nurse" /&gt; At eight percent, the centre's cesarean rate is the lowest of any hospital in country.&lt;ref name="Canadian Nurse" /&gt; The Qikitqtani birth centre has reduced the evacuation rate on Baffin Island considerably, and there is little need for low-risk women to leave the territory to give birth. The centre's intervention rate is lower than the national average and is considered a model for the rest of the territory.&lt;ref name="Canadian Nurse" /&gt;

=== Death ===
[[File:Bathurst Inlet + 1998-07-11.jpg|thumb|Human remains on a beach near [[Bathurst Inlet]]]]
[[File:Resolute Cemetery + 1997-08-02.jpg|thumb|Cemetery of [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]] on the Barrow Strait (Parry Channel)]]
When the Inuit still lived in camps or as [[nomad]]s, they had no special tomb sites, much less cemeteries. Before burial, the women of the camp washed the body of the deceased and adjusted the hair; on dead women they braided the hair starting at the forehead. Then they wrapped the body in a large blanket of caribou hide or wool and laid it down far out in the tundra, face up. They stacked cairns on top, to protect the body from being eaten by animals. Nevertheless, scattered human bones can be found throughout the tundra, testifying to the work of carnivores.

Similar burial customs have been found through the centuries. For example, [[Qilakitsoq]] [[mummy|mummies]] dating from 500 years ago show that the Thule people, ancestors of the present Inuit, wrapped and protected their dead the same way.

The Inuit believed the [[Aurora|aurora borealis]] to be visible signals from the dead or the spirits of the dead. Some believed that whistling would bring the lights to earth where they would remove the whistlers head for use as a [[Association football|football]]. In some areas Inuit children feared the ghosts of those deceased long ago and often whistled or blew air against their hands, in order to "blow away" those supernatural beings. In other areas, such as eastern Greenland, the aurora were the spirts of dead children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyenglishtoday.net/aurora_borealis.html Aurora Borealis - The Northern Lights]&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-missionary times it was usual to give a newborn child the name of a close relative who had died shortly before. This way, ancestors could experience a kind of return to a new life in the child. This custom has survived to this day, although the traditional [[animism]] religion has largely given way to Christianity.

Since the move to the settlements, the dead are buried in cemeteries. All members of the community participate in requiems that last for hours, during which the towns appear deserted. Due to the frozen permafrost, burial sites are not deep, and are covered with rocks. Sometimes a blue plastic layer can be detected between the rocks. Here and there, a wooden box with a vitrified cover a few fading artificial flowers and other decorations can be seen. Crosses stand askew on the shifting permafrost. The inscriptions show that many of the dead are children, victims of accidents or natural disasters, and also suicides. Infrequently, there is a wooden hut outside of the town, where those that died during the winter are preserved in natural cold, until the warmer season permits their burial.

=== Challenges created by a changed way of life ===
Given such changes in their way of life, keeping their own identity and recollection of history and ancestors proved to be an extraordinary challenge many Inuit could not meet. These changes led to alcohol and drug problems. The suicide rate of the Inuit rose four times as high as the one of the remaining population of Canada.

In the early 21st century the [[infant mortality]] rate is still high, about four times higher than the rest of Canada, and the lifespan relatively short, about 13 years less than the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/2008001/article/10463-eng.pdf Life expectancy in the Inuit-inhabited areas of Canada,1989 to 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Inuit population has grown considerably since the 1960s when there were about 12,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://carc.org/pubs/v17no1/2.htm Lords of the Arctic: Wards of the State]&lt;/ref&gt; and, as of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Canadian census]], increasing to just over 65,025, distributed among some 70 settlements, some of which have a population of a few hundred only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025a-eng.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; They account for about 0.142% of the total population of Canada, and about 4% of the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|indigenous population]], as of 2011. From 2006 to 2016, the Inuit population grew by 29.1% and the total Aboriginal population has grown by 42.5%—more than four times the growth rate of the
non-Aboriginal population over the same period. [http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025a-eng.pdf (2016 census)]

Within a very short time, modern technology replaced methods and technologies that had been passed on for centuries. Firearms replaced lances and harpoons, [[snowmobile]]s, mainly [[Polaris Industries|Polaris]], [[Ski-Doo]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] took the place of dog sled teams (the name Ski-Doo is often used for the whole category, since [[Joseph-Armand Bombardier]] 1922 built the first snowmobile, Ski-Dog, which mutated to Ski-Doo by a typographical error). ATVs ([[all-terrain vehicle]]s, quad-bikes) became widely accepted as a general means of transportation.

The Inuit have become consumers who make their living by fishing, hunting, trapping and production of artwork. They also perform wage labour, and often must be supported by additional social welfare. Government support is often the only source of income. The number of recipients is much higher than the average of Canada. Also, the share of employees in public service is 20 to 30 percent, compared to 7 percent for Canada. This is extremely high, and has been rising even higher since the creation of Nunavut. Nowadays only a few areas are left where traditional methods of hunting and fishing have been preserved in their original form.

=== Adjustment to conditions of living in a modern industrial nation ===
[[File:Square Dance 2 1999-04-01.jpg|thumb|[[Square Dance]] from the time of Scottish whalers, which today the Inuit dance in many variations]]
The capitalist way of thinking in the south of Canada has been a large challenge for the Inuit. It was a drastic experience for the population of a homogeneous, that in an earning-focused, achievement-oriented society authority, power and wealth were defined in a very different way. Before, they were independent in their way of living, but now they saw themselves tied to the chains of a monetary system. Consequently, new patterns of behavior arose, which put enormous strain on family ties. The adjustment to totally different conditions of living, even more so in new administrative centres that were organized by Canadian public employees by the rules of an industrialized country, was understandably difficult for the Inuit. Many have not come to terms with the changes to this day; they do not feel part of either the modern culture nor of that of their ancestors.

The proselytizing by the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] in the first half of the 20th century, which must be critically viewed in some respect, was also of fundamental significance for the cultural change of the Inuit. Although the Arctic nowadays is considered largely Christian, elements of [[Shamanism]] appear to persist fairly well at the subliminal level, side by side with Christian thought, despite its condemnation by the missionaries.&lt;!-- Far too much bias in this first statement. --&gt;

[[File:Day Care Building 1999-04-03.jpg|thumb|Day Care Centre, ([[Cape Dorset]])]]
The adjustment to life in a modern industrialized country is easier for the young people who find new types of opportunities, but also all the problems that can be paraphrased by the keyword "TV culture". Compulsory education was introduced in the 1950s, replacing the traditional master-apprentice relationship between parents and children that did without reading and writing skills. Some Inuit were trained to be teachers and clergymen, but their numbers still were much too low. Basic education nowadays takes place in nearly all settlements. In Nunavut during the first three school years, the [[Inuit languages|Inuit language]], either [[Inuinnaqtun]] or [[Inuktitut]], is the relevant language of instruction. In many schools of the Arctic, "elders", older residents who are recognized for their experience, are teaching the [[traditional knowledge]], known as ''[[Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit]]'', about culture, customs and way of living from the pre-settlement time, during planned lectures. Despite all efforts, the number of dropout is generally rather high, because of lack of motivation, among other reasons.

[[File:Walrus meat 1 1999-04-01.jpg|thumb|Distribution of frozen, fermented [[walrus]] meat]]
As part if the Government of Canada's assimilation policy many Inuit children, along with [[First Nations]], were sent to [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]]. Children were taken from their home communities in the summer and sent to a [[List of Indian residential schools in Canada|school in a centralized area]] where they would remain for an entire school year. These included Sir Alexander Mackenzie Day School in [[Inuvik]] which included the two residences, Stringer Hall for Anglicans and Grollier Hall for Catholics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican.ca/relationships/histories/stringer-hall-inuvik Stringer Hall — Inuvik, NWT]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chesterfield Inlet]] Indian Residential School which included the Turquetil residence. The year away from their homes caused multiple problems upon return. Children were not permitted to speak their native language while at school and thus had problems communicating to community members who spoke little or no English. At the same time the loss of traditional skills meant they were less able to occupy the roles that they would have normally taken up.

Later in the 1970s schools were built in the communities but most did not go beyond grade 7/8. Therefore, this meant leaving the home town during the school year, which was very difficult for many, to attend high school. However, this was at the parents and childs choice rather than forced schooling. Because of this, there were only a few Inuit with higher education, since they would have to leave during the years of study. In the 21st century all Inuit communities in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut offer schooling up to grade 12. This has increased the graduation rate but it still below that of the rest of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/81-595-m/2011095/tbl/tbla.11-eng.htm Graduation rate, Canada, provinces and territories, 2005/2006 to 2009/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the NWT [[Aurora College]] and Arctic College in Nunavut offer education programs throughout the territories. These include the [[Nunavut Teacher Education Program]] which graduates primary, junior and high school teachers with a [[Bachelor of Education]] degree and the [[Akitsiraq Law School]] program. Some programs, such as general upgrading, are offered in the home community while others are only available in certain places.

There has been no lack of intensive effort to find ways for the Inuit into a largely self-designed future, and to help them with a recollection of their own values and of their personal identity. It was important in this context to convey a new role of men and women. In the past, the man was responsible for family life and survival, while the women in the camp were charged with the young. Now often both of them have to master new tasks, thereby skipping several stages of development, with this process taking a course different from what happened in the European cultural area. It is not seldom that the woman assumes the sole role of the breadwinner, while the man is unemployed.

=== Cooperatives, a formula for success ===
Big hopes were put into the establishment of [[cooperative]]s, today the [[Arctic Co-operatives Limited]], that were to help convey to the Inuit the skills of creating added value, so they would take care of themselves again and at the same time preserve their traditional culture. These cooperatives, mostly managed by ''Qallunaat'' (non-Inuit), did in fact prove very successful, because they succeeded in connecting economic thinking with traditional activities and values not only theoretically.

The cooperatives developed activities in disparate areas. They were active in the provisioning of goods and services, such as trading with oil, gas, gasoline and construction materials, the organization of supermarkets with foodstuffs, clothing and technical goods, of hotels and restaurants, the construction of recreational and tourism facilities. On the regional level, the cooperatives ran commercial fur trade and fishing, as well as the production of downs and feathers.

[[File:Carver 2000-08-23.jpg|thumb|Stone carver in front of his house]]
In the area of culture, the cooperatives and similar associations were intensely devoted to fostering artistic skills, which were, and still are unusually pronounced among the Inuit. The production and trade of [[Inuit art]], i.e. of artistic and crafted objects, mainly [[sculpture]]s made from [[serpentinite|serpentine]], soapstone and [[marble]], and soon afterwards also of [[graphics]] (drawings, lithotomies, lithographs, erasures) and [[tapestry]] (for example hangings), yielded excellent economic and cultural successes.

In the course of the past 50 years this branch of the cooperatives reached an extraordinary importance for [[added value|value added]] in the Inuit regions, and clearly ranks first, far ahead of trading hunting products: antlers, fur, or [[ivory]], but overproduction is a growing problem. There is a similar problem with this type of art in Greenland, like the ''[[tupilaq]]s'' from [[Tunu|East Greenland]] made from walrus ivory.

In 1965, the turnover of Inuit cooperatives with trade of artistic objects and true arts was still below 100,000 Canadian dollars, but two or three decades later it has risen to $5 million, at gross prices, respectively (turnover not registered is estimated at a few additional million dollars). Despite manifold attempts in expanding the areas of activity, real added value still occurs mainly in the consumer goods sector, and scarcely in the real branch of production.

== Current developments ==
During a period of five thousand years, the Inuit groups have grown apart ethnically. However, the increasing integration into nations foreign to them that were extending into the Arctic made them realize after World War II that they could maintain their [[cultural identity]] only if they appeared united at the international level. Therefore, the Eskimo groups of Canada united with their relatives in Alaska and Greenland (after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] also with the Siberian [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]]) to the "Pan-Eskimo Movement". This movement is supported by the [[Inuit Circumpolar Council]], that was founded in 1977 as the Inuit Circumpolar Conference after a lead time of four years and to which its protagonist Eben Hopson ([[North Slope Borough, Alaska]]) was invited with his vision of constituting a unified, independent Eskimo nation.

During the 1980s and 1990s a nationalistic trend could indeed be felt, and there was no lack of wishful thinking to achieve the dream of circumpolar unity. But in the reality of daily life, rational and last but not least fiscal thinking prevailed.

=== Nunavut ===
[[File:Leg Building Iqaluit 2000-08-27.jpg|thumb|[[Nunavut]] Parliament building in [[Iqaluit]]]]
[[File:Kinngait Govt-Building 2000-08-25.jpg|thumb|Government building in [[Cape Dorset]] (Kinngait)]]
With all efforts to preserve and cultivate cultural values of the past, the Inuit also want the progress of the modern industrial society. They show concern about the endangering of the environment by technical processes associated with the exploitation of resources, but are also interested in a future of western standards. They have also recognized that they are much better able to influence their conditions of living to their own ideas, when they agree within regional bounds on the goals to be pursued.

The Canadian Inuit, just like the other indigenous peoples (First Nations and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis people]]) of Canada, grew the demand for collective ethnic rights and a territory of their own, with a government composed of their kind, and Inuktitut as one of the official languages. On the federal level, the Inuit got the right to vote in 1962. The first Inuk to be elected Member of Parliament was [[Peter Ittinuar]] in 1979. In 1976, the organization ''Inuit Tapirisat'' ("Inuit Brotherhood"), now the ''[[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]]'' ("Inuit United with Canada"), for the first time demanded the creation of a separate territory in the northeast of Canada. After more than 15 years of negotiation between Inuit and the Federal and Territorial Governments, finally an agreement was reached, the [[Nunavut Land Claims Agreement]], which determined that from April 1, 1999, the north of Canada should be composed of three territories: [[Yukon]], Nunavut and the remaining Northwest Territories. Like the two other territories, Nunavut was placed under direct control of the Canadian federal government and received increasing administrative autonomy. The Inuit have substantial local rights of control. They participate in the execution of important administrative positions, including police, legal and social welfare offices. Inuktitut is official government language, besides English and French.

=== Accord of Nunavik ===
An accord, the [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]], between the Canadian federal government, the Province of Quebec and Inuit representatives resulted in the establishment of the [[Kativik Regional Government]] and gave a bigger political autonomy to the Nunavik region. As a result, all residents of the 14 Nunavik settlements elect their own representative in regional elections.

=== Settlement of land claims and titles ===
An important chapter of [[Arctic policy of Canada|Canadian Arctic policy]] regarding development of the Inuit culture is reflected in the agreements settling Inuit [[Aboriginal title|land claims]] opposed to the Canadian state. The advancing exploitation of the Canadian Arctic and if its mineral resources led to ever more conflicts about land ownership and title between Inuit representatives and Federal Government. Land that is not under private ownership is considered as Federal land, but the Inuit claim large areas that they have inhabited and utilized for many centuries. The agreement reached in 1984 regarding land claims of the [[Inuvialuit]] (Inuit in the western Arctic) provided means to improve the situation of the indigenous residents of this region, by assuring {{convert|91,000|km2|abbr=on}} of land to 2,500 Inuvialuit, as well as monetary compensation, funds for improving the social structure, hunting right, and more influence on dealing with the fauna, on natural and environmental protection.

The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement signed in 1993 with the [[Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated|Tunngavik Federation of Nunavut]] is the most comprehensive agreement ever reached in Canada. As a result, about 17,500 Inuit receive {{Convert|350,000|km2|abbr=on}} of land, monetary compensation, a share of the profits from exploiting the mineral resources, hunting rights and a larger voice in questions regarding land and environment.

Also in the north of the province of Quebec, land claims of Inuit groups were settled successfully. In addition, there are ongoing negotiations with the Association of Labrador Inuit, which represents about 3,800 Inuit living in the interior and on the eastern coast of Labrador, a part of the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].

== Traditional Inuit culture and self-determined life ==
[[File:Stone playing 1995-06-13.jpg|thumb|Traditional game with stones (1995)]]
[[File:Billiard 1 2004-04-02.jpg|thumb|Inuit artist [[Kenojuak Ashevak]] playing pool billiards in a hotel in Berlin (2004)]]
The Inuit place a high value upon self-determination. The governments of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and Nunatsiavut [[Non-partisan democracy|do not have political parties]], but operate as [[Consensus government in Canada|consensus governments]]. Difficult questions are common in judicature, where traditional Inuit concepts are opposed to the legal system of the Canadian state.

=== Preservation of tradition and culture ===
In general, the government of Nunavut sees one of its most important tasks to be the preservation and care of Inuit tradition and culture. Currently, it puts great effort into recording and archiving the oral accounts of "elders" about the time before the move of the Inuit into the settlements. It is high time for this, because the number of elders with this knowledge are dwindling.

=== Contemporary literature ===
A special part of the centuries-old cultural heritage of the Inuit are [[Inuit mythology|their myths and legends]], which had been passed exclusively by word of mouth, because the Inuit had no written language and consequently had no literary tradition. In the Inuit culture story telling had the function that in other cultures literature has. The oral recital of passed-on knowledge gave the Inuit families particularly a feeling of immediate togetherness. At the same time, narrating made a connection between past and present, because the essential statements had been passed from generation to generation and accepted as the truth, without reservations. Among the Inuit, there are even nowadays no authors in the strict sense: writers mainly produce reports, summaries and essays about traditional contexts, or their own experiences ("[[non-fiction]]"), in seldom cases poems (mostly anthems) or songs.

Among the best-known Inuit authors are the former [[Commissioners of Nunavut|Commissioner of Nunavut]] (the highest governmental representative of the territory), [[Peter Irniq]] (born 1947 on the [[Lyon Inlet]], Kivalliq Region), the writer, poet, cartoonist and photographer [[Alootook Ipellie]] (born 1951 in a camp near Iqaluit, died 2007 in Ottawa), [[Michael Kusugak]] the children's author, and the former president of the [[Makivik Corporation]] and active author [[Zebedee Nungak]] (born 1951 in the south of [[Puvirnituq]], Quebec).

=== Contemporary music ===
{{main article|Inuit music}}
The Inuit did not have a very distinct tradition of music. There were "[[Aya-Yait]]", songs used for passing experiences from generation to generation, and so called because of their refrain "aya-ya". In a musical sense, they were simply-structured compositions. The traditional "[[Inuit throat singing|throat singing]]" as well as the ritual drum dance by no means claim to be artistic compositions, but they were used for entertainment and for mythological-religious customs. The Inuit first heard European melodies by listening to the whalers. With those, they saw European instruments for the first time, the [[fiddle]] and the [[accordion]], both of which have remained popular among the Inuit to this day. They also learned the [[square dance]] from the whalers. For the past twenty years, a kind of pop music is catching on in the Arctic, which the Inuit adopted from the south and then modified their own way. Today [[Susan Aglukark]] (born in 1967 in [[Churchill, Manitoba]], and grew up in [[Arviat]]) is perhaps the most popular Inuit singer. Other singers include [[Tagaq]], [[Charlie Panigoniak]] and [[Lucie Idlout]].

=== Contemporary fine arts ===
Contemporary [[Inuit art]] and handicrafts did not come about before the late 1950s as important resources for added value. soapstone sculptures, artistic drawings, hangings and tapestries (the latter mainly in [[Arviat]], Baker Lake and [[Pangnirtung]]), attire, ceramics and dolls are providing a basic livelihood to a large number of Inuit artists of all ages today, just like hunting and fishing.

== Added value in Nunavut ==

It is extremely important for the territorial government of Nunavut to look at ways to clearly rise the national product, which also means to conciliate the Inuit's deeply rooted tradition with the challenges of modern life. Hunting, trapping and fishing essentially serve their subsistence and by far do not contribute enough added value, as would be needed. In addition, the trade with more significant products gained from these activities, like seal furs, or ivory from [[narwhal]] or walrus, is subject to international restrictions. The revenue from artistic or handicraft work, although a significant contribution to added value, provides a sufficient livelihood to only a few, particularly because of the large family sizes that must be supported. This branch of economic activity by its nature can secure the future of only a limited number. The growth of tourism is also limited. It is difficult to secure sufficient enrollment for group tours to the Arctic, and customized tours do not bring much money to the area. Cruises contribute more to added value than other types of tours.

Given all of the above, the central task of the territorial leadership is the conciliation of tradition and modern life. Whether the exemplary Nunavut model of self-determination will be successful, finally depends on the question if there will be trained Inuit in sufficient numbers in the foreseeable future who will be able to provide leadership.

The backlog of education and training is still immense. Big opportunities will open for the Inuit to maintain their traditional culture and still live up to the claim of being members of a nation that embraces diverse cultures within a modern industrial country, but only if those responsible for Nunavut succeed in training executives in sufficient numbers for the immense tasks that are the consequence of creating a self-governed territory.

'''John Rensselaer Chamberlain''' (October 28, 1903 – April 9, 1995) was an American [[journalist]], business and economic [[historian]], syndicated columnist and literary critic. He was dubbed "one of America’s most trusted book reviewers" by the [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] magazine ''[[The Freeman]]''.&lt;ref name= "Opitz"&gt;Opitz, Edmund A., "A Reviewer Remembered: John Chamberlain 1903–1995," ''[[The Freeman]]'', June, 1995, vol. 45, iss. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1903, John Chamberlain graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1925,&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; where he was chairman of the campus humor magazine ''[[The Yale Record]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnes, Marc C., ed. (2005) ''American National Biography: Supplement 2''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his career in journalism at the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 1926, serving there as both an [[editor]] and book reviewer during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Later, he worked on the staff at ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's]]'' and ''[[Harper's magazine|Harper's]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name= "Opitz"/&gt;  Serving on the editorial staffs of ''[[Fortune magazine|Fortune]]'' (1936–1941) and ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'' (1941–1950),&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; for a time he wrote the [[editorial]]s for ''Life'' under the direction of [[Henry Luce]], the founder of [[Time, Inc.]]

Chamberlain was a member of the [[Dewey Commission]] and a contributor to ''Not Guilty: the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made Against [[Leon Trotsky]] in the [[Moscow Show Trials|Moscow Trials]]'' (1938) by [[John Dewey]]. For most of this period, Chamberlain was, in his own words, "a New York literary liberal" involved in political causes of the Left.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, ''A Life With the Printed Word'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also taught [[journalism]] at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], where his students included the noted journalists [[Marguerite Higgins]], [[Elie Abel]] and [[Edith Efron]].&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote  =There is nothing like a fact to kill a theory.|source =John Chamberlain}}

In 1939, Chamberlain was among the "editorial sponsors" of the Writer's Anti-War Bureau that was formed by an informal group of journalists and publicists under the leadership of [[America First Committee]] publicity director Sidney Hertzberg. The Bureau publicized a weekly newssheet entitled ''Uncensored'', which worked to analyze the news, expose the propaganda and hidden biases of those who advocated for [[foreign intervention]]. The newssheet appeared weekly from October 7, 1939 until its final issue in December 7, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/uncensored.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s, Chamberlain moved to the intellectual Right, along with friends such as former [[communism|communists]] [[Whittaker Chambers]] and [[John Dos Passos]], although Chamberlain was never himself a [[communism|communist]].&lt;ref&gt;Diggins, ''Up From Communism''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Influenced by [[Albert Jay Nock]], he credits the writers [[Ayn Rand]], [[Isabel Paterson]] and [[Rose Wilder Lane]] with his final "conversion" to what he called "an older American philosophy" of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[conservative]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his friends [[Henry Hazlitt]] and [[Max Eastman]], he helped to promote the work of the Austrian economist [[F. A. Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', writing the "Foreword" to the first American edition of the book in 1944.

In 1946, [[Leonard Read]] of the [[Foundation for Economic Education]] established a free market magazine named ''[[The Freeman]]'', reviving the name of a publication which had been edited by [[Albert J. Nock]] (1920–1924). Its first editors included Chamberlain, Hazlitt and [[Suzanne La Follette]], and its contributors during Chamberlain's tenure there included [[James Burnham]], John Dos Passos, Max Eastman, [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], [[Raymond Moley]], [[Morrie Ryskind]], and the [[Austrian economics|Austrian School]] economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and F. A. Hayek.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, p. 138; Hamilton, Charles H., "''The Freeman'': the Early Years," ''The Freeman'', Dec. 1984, vol. 34, issue 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[Mont Pelerin Society]] during this period. After stepping down as editor of ''The Freeman'', Chamberlain continued his regular column for the periodical, "A Reviewer’s Notebook."

From 1950 to 1960, he was an editorial writer for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, pp. 136–139, and pp. 72–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], credited Chamberlain with "changing the course of his life" by writing the "Introduction" to Buckley's first book, ''[[God and Man at Yale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Chamberlain became a lifelong contributing editor for Buckley's magazine, ''[[National Review]]'', from its founding until his death.  He still occasionally differed from Buckley; for example, he praised ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' by [[Ayn Rand]].&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

For twenty-five years, he wrote a syndicated column for [[King Features]] which appeared in newspapers across the US.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=John Chamberlain, Columnist, Dies at 91|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/13/obituaries/john-chamberlain-columnist-dies-at-91.html|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=1995-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his first wife died in 1954, he married Ernestine Stodelle, who had previously been married to the Russian theatrical director [[Theodore Komisarjevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beach|first1=Randall|title=Komisarjevsky's Father Testifies During Penalty Phase|url=http://www.countytimes.com/articles/2011/10/31/news/doc4ea854db434ae365431505.txt|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=Litchfield County Times|date=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Dermot Spence''' (born 11 August 1936) is a British-born American historian and [[public intellectual]] specialising in [[History of China|Chinese history]]. He was [[Sterling Professor]] of History at [[Yale University]] from 1993 to 2008. His most widely read book is ''The Search for Modern China'', a survey of the last several hundred years of Chinese history based on his popular course at Yale. A prolific author, reviewer, and essayist, he has published more than a dozen books on China. He retired from Yale in 2008.

Spence's major interest is modern China, especially the [[Qing Dynasty]], and relations between China and the West.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Roberts, Priscilla "Spence, Jonathan D." pages 1136–1137 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London:Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999 page 1136.&lt;/ref&gt; Spence frequently uses biographies to examine cultural and political history. Another common theme is the efforts of both Westerners and Chinese "to change China,"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence ''To Change China; Western Advisers in China, 1620–1960''. Boston: Little Brown,  1969&lt;/ref&gt; and how such efforts were frustrated.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

== Education ==
Spence was educated at [[Winchester College]] and at [[Clare College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. He received his BA in history from Cambridge in 1959. He went to Yale on a Clare-[[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon]] Fellowship to study the history and culture of China, receiving an [[Master of Arts|MA]] and then a PhD in 1965, when he won the [[John Addison Porter]] Prize. As part of his graduate training, he spent a year in Australia to study under Fang Chao-ying and Tu Lien-che, pre-eminent scholars of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref name="AHABio"&gt;Frederic E. Wakeman Jr., [http://www.historians.org/info/AHA_History/spencebio.cfm Jonathan D. Spence] at [[American Historical Association]] website (retrieved 10 March 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Widely recognised as a leading scholar of Chinese history, Spence was president of the [[American Historical Association]] for the 2004–2005 term.&lt;ref name="AHABio"/&gt; While his primary focus has been on [[Qing dynasty|Qing dynasty China]], he has also written a biography of [[Mao Zedong]] and ''[[The Gate of Heavenly Peace (book)|The Gate of Heavenly Peace]]'', a study of twentieth-century intellectuals and their relation to revolution. Spence taught a popular undergraduate class at Yale on the history of modern China, which formed the basis for his text ''The Search for Modern China'', whose dedication is "For My Students."

His name in Chinese was chosen to reflect his love of history and admiration for the historian [[Sima Qian]]. His name in Chinese is 史景遷/Shǐ Jǐngqiān. He chose the family name 史/Shǐ (literally "history") and personal name 景遷/Jǐngqiān where 景/Jǐng means admire (景仰) and 遷/Qiān was taken from the personal name of Sima Qian (司馬遷).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Johnathan D.|title=天安门：知识分子与中国革命|year=1998|publisher=中央编译出版社|location=Beijing|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Spence has received eight honorary degrees in the United States as well as from the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], and (in 2003) from [[Oxford University]]. He was invited to become a visiting professor at [[Peking University]] and an honorary professor at [[Nanjing University]]. He was named Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]],&lt;ref name="AHABio"/&gt; and, in 2006, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge.

He received the William C. DeVane Medal of the Yale Chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] (1952); a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] (1979); the [[Los Angeles Times]] History Prize (1982), and the Vursel Prize of the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]] (1983). He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1985), named a [[MacArthur Fellow]] (1988), appointed to the Council of Scholars of the [[Library of Congress]] (1988), elected a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] (1993), and named a corresponding fellow of the [[British Academy]] (1997).&lt;ref name="AHABio"/&gt;

In May and June 2008, he gave the 60th anniversary [[Reith Lectures]], which were broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Earnshaw  |first = Graham|authorlink = |title = Reith Lecture: English Lessons|journal =The China Beat |volume= |issue = |pages= |publisher = |location = |date =2008 |language = |url = http://www.thechinabeat.org/?p=146|jstor = |issn = |doi = |accessdate = |ref= none}};

In 2010, Spence was appointed to deliver the annual [[Jefferson Lecture]] at the [[Library of Congress]], the US federal government's highest honour for achievement in the [[humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;Jill Laster, [http://chronicle.com/article/Eminent-China-Scholar-Will/64554/?sid=at "Eminent China Scholar Will Deliver 2010 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities"], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Born in [[Surrey]], England, Spence became an American citizen in 2000.&lt;ref name="NEH"/&gt; He lives in [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] with his wife, [[Annping Chin]] (a senior lecturer in history at Yale who got her PhD in classical Chinese philosophy at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]). He has two sons from a previous marriage (1962–1993) to Helen Alexander, Colin and Ian Spence, and two stepchildren, Yar Woo and [[Mei Chin]].

'''Josef Pekař''' (April 12, 1870 Malý Rohozec at [[Turnov]] – January 23, 1937 [[Prague]]) was a prominent [[Czechs|Czech]] historian of the turn of 19th and 20th century, professor and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Charles University]] in Prague.

== Life and work ==

After graduating at high school in [[Mladá Boleslav]], which now bears his name, Pekař studied history in Prague. He started the career of historian already during studies, when his article, published in 1890 in [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]]'s magazine ''Athenaeum'', proved by historical findings, that so called "Manuscript of Králův Dvůr" ([[Rukopis královédvorský]]), allegedly from the 13th century, whose authenticity has long led disputes in the Czech society, is a counterfeit. Pekař graduated in 1893 by the work ''Nominantions of the King Ottokar II for the German throne'' about personal struggle of [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Přemysl Ottokar II]] for the imperial throne in the years 1272–1273.

After studies, Pekař spent one year at universities in [[Erlangen]] and [[Berlin]], then, he taught for shorter time at the secondary school in Mladá Boleslav and Prague. In 1895, he became the founder of ''Czech historical magazine'', which lead after for thirty years. In 1897, he wrote ''The History of the Wallenstein conspiracy (1630–1634)'' and the same year, he declined sharply an anti-Czech article of German historian [[Theodor Mommsen]], proving the importance of Czech culture for Europe; his answer was published again several times and translated into many languages. From that time, Pekař has become well recognized authority among central European historians. In 1901, Pekař was appointed professor of Charles university in Prague.

In 1903, in the work ''The Oldest Czech Chronicle'', Pekař proved, that so called ''Kristián's legend'' (Latin writings about the origins of Christianity in the Czech lands and the first Czech saints, [[Ludmila of Bohemia|Saint Ludmila]] and [[Saint Wenceslas]]), which origin was placed in the 13th century by [[Josef Dobrovský]] comes really already from the 10th century (written probably before 994).

In the years 1909 and 1911, he published ''The Book about Kost (Kniha o Kosti)'', a precise description of the life of aristocracy during [[30 years war]] and about the situation of tributaries in 17th and 18th century. His emphasis of the details of common life and economic circumstances was completely new and outrun that time. The following work was ''Czech cadasters 1654–1789'' from 1915, in which Pekař demonstrated gradual of centralization in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] empire.

In 1912, Pekař wrote and published a brochure ''Masaryk's Czech philosophy''. In this book, he defended himself and the [[positivism|pozitivistic]] school of [[Jaroslav Goll]] against the attacks of pro-Masaryk Czech writer, historian and politician [[Jan Herben]] and criticised [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|Masaryk's]] historiographic methods, rejecting above all the claim, that the meaning of Czech history consisted of the religious idea of [[humanism|humanity]]. Thus, the long-term dispute among historians over this topic began.

After the end od World War I and the formation of [[Czechoslovakia]], Pekař wrote "Czechoslovak history" (published 1921), a textbook, which was used in high schools for many years. He also wrote about the causes of the conflict in the book "World War", published in the same year. In response to post-war anti-Catholic tendencies in the society, he started to apologize the Czech [[baroque]] period and the role of aristocracy at that time, which was usually considered a dark period of the Czech nation and the [[germanization]] of the Czechs. These themes were discussed in his works ''Three chapters from the fight for [[Saint John of Nepomuk]]'' (Tři kapitoly o sv. Janu Nepomuckém) and ''White Mountain'' (Bílá Hora) from 1921, and ''Fallacies and dangers of the holding reform'' (Omyly a nebezpečí pozemkové reformy) published in 1923.

In his four-volume work ''Žižka and his times'' (1928–1934), Pekař rated Hussite's chieftain [[Jan Žižka|John Žižka from Trocnov]] rather as a warrior and a religious fanatic, contesting transnational significance of [[hussitism]] and presented it as a movement of genuinely medieval character with tragic consequences in Czech history. The book provoked sharp reactions, because that movement was usually hailed as the struggle for national and religious freedom. Pekař answered them with a series of articles, which were later published together as his best known book ''About the meaning of the Czech history''.

In 1931–1932, he was elected Rector of Charles University. In inaugural speech, he emphasized his national-conservative views and the need the periodization of Czech history should be based on general historical epochs, similarly to art history.&lt;ref name="muni"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phil.muni.cz/fil/scf/komplet/pekar.html|title=Josef Pekař (in Czech) |publisher=phil.muni.cz|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contribution to the scientific discipline of history has been awarded by the membership in the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts. He was a member of the Czech Royal society of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Members of Czech academy of science and art 1890–1952, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

== The conception of historiography ==

The basic principle of Pekař's conception was the necessity to understand historical epoch from itself, thus, to cognize and feel its spirit. According to him, [[historiography]] should have scientific foundations, but the contribution of historian should consist of understanding and faithful description of ancient times. "Historiography is not an exact science, a sober [[autopsy]] of a matter, but the science exploring life of individual people in its complexity". That's why a historian cannot coolly stay to be a disinterested observer - he has to take his own position to the past. This Pekař's conception is no longer to be considered "positivism", exceeding it by going beyond historical facts, which were obtained from historical sources. Therefore, historical events are interpreted consistently in the contemporary context. He - as a conscientious historian - emphasized the [[heterogeneity]] of ideas of different eras ("The events must always be viewed through the eyes of then people")

Pekař was a conservative patriot, rejecting almost [[mythological]] [[deification]] of some historical events, which in his opinion had rather negative consequencies ([[Hussite wars]], etc.). He was convinced about substantial negative impact of religious conflicts on Czech history and many times urged Czech patriotism to get rid of them. He was a strong opponent of historical [[philosophy]] of [[František Palacký]] and T.G.Masaryk. As a historian, he reproached Masaryk for putting too much emphasis on the religious reformist significance of Czech history, while he himself stressed the aspect of nationality. In the beginning, he considered national element as fundamental and motive, later, he spoke about complex concept of Czech history, putting it inside wider European context, being aware of complicacy and relativity of historical events. He respected the rights of the German population living within Czech territory, but he strongly opposed an historical interpretation of Czech-German relations from a "Greater German" perspective. He also appreciated the role of foreign, western [[Europea]]n factors in Czech history. In his view, the history of a nation cannot emerge from a single foundation, as Masaryk claimed, but is formed out of the countless layers produced by cultural, economic and political changes.&lt;ref name="dokument-festival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dokument-festival.com/database/movie/9387%7CHistorik-Josef-Pekar|title=Historian Josef Pekař &amp;#124; Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival |publisher=dokument-festival.com|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lev Nussimbaum''' ([[Kiev]], October 17, 1905 – [[Positano]], August 27, 1942), who wrote under the pen names '''Essad Bey''' and [[Kurban Said]], was a writer and journalist, born in [[Kiev]] to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Abbas Abdulla, "Research" Nussimbaum is a Jew from Kyiv" in Adabiyyat Qazetti (Literature Qazette), No. 48:3643 (Baku: December 19, 2008), p.6 as quoted in [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_articles/English/152_faq_list.html "Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of Ali and Nino,"] FAQ No. 54: But was Lev Nussimbaum (Essad Bey) actually born in Baku?" in [http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4] (2011), p. 65 and Endnote 119 on page 109.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived with them during his childhood in [[Baku]] before fleeing the [[Bolshevik]]s in 1920 at the age of 14. In 1922, while living in Germany, he obtained a certificate claiming that he had converted to [[Islam]] in the presence of the [[imam]] of the Turkish embassy in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, Tom. ''The Orientalist''. Random House, 2005, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; He created a niche for himself in the competitive European literary world by writing about topics that Westerners, in general, knew little about - the Caucasus,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Blood and Oil in the Orient]]'' (1929), ''Twelve Secrets of the Caucasus'' (1930), and ''Der Kaukasus'' (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Empire,&lt;ref&gt;''OGPU'' (1932), ''Nicholas II'' (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; Bolshevik Revolution&lt;ref&gt;''Stalin'' (1931), OGPU (1932), ''Russia at the Crossroads'' (1933), ''Lenin'' (1935), ''End of Bolshevism'' (1936)&lt;/ref&gt; newly discovered oil,&lt;ref&gt;Blood and Oil in the Orient (1929), ''Liquid Oil'' (1933), ''Love and Oil'' (1934), ''God is Great'' (about [[Ibn Saud]], 1936)&lt;/ref&gt; and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Mohammed'' (1932), God is Great (aboutthe resurgence of Islam and Ibn Saud, 1936)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote under the name of Essad Bey in [[German language|German]].

Historians and literary critics, who knew these subjects well, discredited Essad Bey as a reliable source.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact or Fiction? &lt;/big&gt; What Essad Bey's Contemporaries Said," in ''Azerbaijan International'', Vol. 15:2-4, pp. 166-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, historians disregard books published under his name and rarely quote him, though the topics Essad Bey chose to write about are still critically relevant. The fact that Essad Bey was so prolific calls into question the authorship of these books&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_pdf/152_pdf_english/152_essad_bey_too_prolific.pdf "Did he really write 16 books in 8 years?"] ''Azerbaijan International'', Vol. 15:2-4, pp. 162-163.&lt;/ref&gt; and whether Essad Bey was primarily operating as a broker and doctoring manuscripts and marketing them under his name, which by then had become famous. In 1934, his agent [[:de:Schendell|Werner Schendell]] warned him to slow down and take a year off between books so that he would not appear to be so prolific.&lt;ref&gt;Literary agent Werner Schendell (1891-1961) cautioned Essad Bey to slow down, not to appear too prolific in correspondence, dated May 8, 1934. Dr. Gerhard Hopp, "Mohammed Essad Bey: Nur Orient Für Europäer?" in ''Asien Afrika Lateinamerika'', Vol. 25:1 (1997), p. 86, Endnote 120.&lt;/ref&gt; That year no books were published in German - only two novellas in Polish.&lt;ref&gt;"Love and Oil" and "Manuela"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Lev Nussimbaum was born in October 1905. He claimed he was born in a train&lt;ref&gt;Essad Bey claimed he was born on a train in an autobiographical essay published in ''Die literarische Welt'' (Berlin, 5/1929, No. 48, page 5) after German police traced his birth to Kiev. At that time he had already written two books (''Blood and Oil in the Orient,'' and ''Twelve Secrets of the Caucasus'') promoted by his publishers as written by a native-born Bakui. Thus, saying that he was born "on a train" in ''"Die literarische Welt"'' provides a slick cover for claims he had made earlier. Being "born in Baku" would have lent more credibility to his writing and, thus, made his books more profitable. This was a typical practice of Nussimbaum (Essad Bey). He was always trying to lay claim to the national identity of the topics and personalities about which he wrote. When he wrote about Stalin, he was Georgian. When he wrote about Nicolas II, he was Russian. When he wrote about Persian matters of divorce, he was Persian. When he wrote about Mohammed, he was Muslim. All were calculated efforts to convince readers that what he wrote was credible though it was often nonsense. See Betty Blair, No. 4 "Too Many Identities, Essad Bey as Core Author of Ali and Nino: Seven Reasons Why It Just Aint' So," in ''Azerbaijan International'', Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), pp. 186-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Documents in the [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine|Kiev State Archives]] and the [[Great Choral Synagogue|Kiev Synagogue]] state that Lev Nussimbaum was born in Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;Kyiv Central Historical Archives: Fund 1164, List 1, Case 473, Page 635, according to an official letter sent to Azerbaijani philologist Abdulla Ajaloghlu, dated November 4, 2008, signed by L.Y.

Vacca's Sensational Biographical Account of Essad Bey," in ''Azerbaijan International'', Vol. 15:2-4 (2011), pp. 146-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Nussimbaum's birth was originally registered in the Kyiv Synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Kyiv Central Historical Archives signed by Director L.Y. Demchenko and head of Information Department E.V. Polozova. Letter No. 02-1132, dated November 4, 2008 addressed to Azerbaijan philologist Badulla Ajaloghlu in Baku.

His father, Abraam Leybusovich Nussimbaum, was a Jew from [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]], in present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], born in 1875. He later migrated to Baku and invested in oil.&lt;ref&gt;The A.L. Nussimbaum &amp; Binagadi Petroleum Pipeline Co. was sold to the Nobel Brothers Petroleum Company in 1914 for 131,500 rubles. Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives, Fund 392, List 1, Case 199, Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Berta Basya Davidovna Slutzkin Nussimbaum, according to her marriage certificate,&lt;ref&gt;Marriage Certificate (October 26, 1904), Georgian Central State Historical Archives, No. 675, p. 10. The marriage of Lev Nussimbaum's parents was originally registered in the Tiflis (Tbilisi) Synagogue.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Jew from Belarus. She committed suicide on February 16, 1911 in Baku when Nussimbaum was five years old.&lt;ref&gt;Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives, Fund 1044, List 1, Case 571, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, she had embraced [[left-wing politics]]&lt;ref name="lazare" /&gt; and was possibly involved in the underground Communist movement. Nussimbaum's father hired Alice Schulte, a woman of German ethnicity, to be his son's governess.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Schulte: ''Biographie Essad-Bey,'' unpublished biography, Rascher Archives at the Central Library, Zurich, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lev Nussimbaum berlin.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial table on Berlin's house of Lev Nussimbaum]]
In 1918, Lev and his father fled Baku because of the massacres that were taking place in the streets between different political forces. According to Essad Bey's first book, ''Blood and Oil in the Orient,'' which historians do not consider to be very reliable, the two travelled through Turkestan and [[Persia]]. But researchers have found no record of this adventurous journey except in Nussimbaum's own writings.&lt;ref&gt;Essad Bey, "Əsəd Bəy, "Şərqdə neft və qan" (1929).&lt;/ref&gt; Nussimbaum and his father returned to Baku but when the Bolsheviks took Baku in the spring of 1920, they fled to Georgia. They stayed there until the Bolsheviks took Tiflis and Batumi.

Lev Nussimbaum, as Essad Bey, wrote his first book ''Oel und Blut im Orient'' (''Blood and Oil in the Orient'') in German in 1929. Although he claims that his account was autobiographical, historians in Azerbaijan and Georgia refute the possibility, as there are many major factual errors in the historical description.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Zaza Aleksidze (Georgia): "I am sure that 'Blood and Oil in the Orient' is not an autobiography as Essad Bey claims. It is a fiction, full of tales and mistakes and no one should rely upon it as a source for reconstructing the biography of Essad Bey." Also Dr. Farid Alakbarli (Azerbaijan), "Correcting all of Essad Bey's errors in this book would be an endless job." Both in "Critics: Fact or Fiction? What Essad Bey's Contemporaries Said," in [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html ''Azerbaijan International'', Vol. 15:2-4 (2011)], p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Essad Bey describes his delight when, aged 14, he and his father left Azerbaijan. In the final passage of the book, he writes: "At that moment, Europe began for me. The Old East was dead."&lt;ref&gt;Essad Bey, "Oil and Blood in the Orient" (San Francisco: Aran Press, 1997), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

They purportedly boarded a ship to [[Istanbul]], to where thousands of refugees had fled. Later, Nussimbaum eventually settled in Berlin (1921–1933),&lt;ref name="lazare" /&gt; where he enrolled simultaneously in high school and in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]]. He did not graduate from either, but told people that he had a Cand. Phil.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Höpp, "Mohammed Essad Bey: Nur Orient Fur Europaäer?" (Orient for the Europeans), in ''Asien Afrika Lateinamerika'' 25:1 (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1997), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, he began writing under the pen name of Essad Bey for the literary journal ''Die literarische Welt'' (The Literary World). At least 120 articles were published under his name.&lt;ref&gt;Index for "Die literarische Welt 1925-1933, Vol. 1" (Nendeln: Kraus-Thomason Organization Ltd, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1930s, Essad Bey had become a popular author throughout [[Western Europe]], writing mainly about contemporary historical and political issues.&lt;ref name="lazare"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050328/lazare |author= Lazare, Daniel |title= Jews Without Borders |accessdate= March 28, 2005 |work=[[The Nation]]}} Lazare and Reiss are secondary sources for Lev Nussimbaum's biography, not primary sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Bey was a [[monarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;Essad Bey boasted that he was a monarchist in "The Story of My Life" (Die Gelchichte Meines Lebens) in ''Die literarische Welt'', Berlin, Vol. 7:5 (January 30, 1931, pp. 3-4). Essad Bey also wrote a sympathetic "biography" about Nicholas II (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, he joined the ''German-Russian League Against Bolshevism'', the members of which, Daniel Lazare remarks, "for the most part either were [[Nazism|Nazis]] or soon would be". He also joined the Social Monarchist Party, which advocated restoration of Germany's [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty. He also had connections to the pre-[[fascism|fascistic]] [[Mladorossi|Young Russian]] movement, headed by [[Alexander Lvovich Kazembek|Alexander Kazembek]].&lt;ref name="lazare" /&gt;

In 1932, Essad Bey married Erika Loewendahl, daughter of shoe magnate Walter Loewendahl. The marriage failed, ending in scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Essad Bey had Erika arrested when she arrived by ship in New York. He notified authorities that she planned an assassination in the United States. It was a totally false allegation - totally imaginary, but gave Erika serious legal problems. "Gerichtssaal: Scheidungsprozess Gegen Den Schriftsteller Essad Bey / Courtroom: Divorce Proceedings Against the Writer Essad Bey." ''Neues Wiener Journal'' 15, (1937), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Erika ran off in 1935 with Nussimbaum's colleague [[René Fülöp-Miller]]. Erika's parents, who were wealthy, succeeded in getting the marriage to Lev Nussimbaum/ Essad Bey annulled in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times,'' November 19, 1937, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, when the Nazi Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]], Nussimbaum fled to Italy and settled in the seacoast town of Positano. He died there of a rare blood disorder which causes [[gangrene]] of the extremities. This was most likely [[Buerger's disease]], which is known to afflict [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi male Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Lives of Two Writers - Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli and Lev Nussimbaum (See the section on ''Cause of death'')|journal= Azerbaijan International|volume=15|issue=2-4|year=2011|page = 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than [[Raynaud's Disease]],&lt;ref name=Reiss/&gt; which is more prevalent in women. It is highly likely that Essad Bey denied his Jewish ancestry to doctors who were treating him, which led to the misdiagnosis of Raynaud's instead of Buerger's.&lt;ref&gt;Essad Bey consulted doctors in both Switzerland and Italy and they all insisted that he did not have Raynaud's Disease. However, his doctor in Positano assumed Raynaud's. Alice Schulte's unpublished hand-written 12-page manuscript entitled "Biographie Essad-Bey (in German, 1943), p. 5. Archived in Central Library of the University of Zurich, Rascher Fund 78-III, A-2; B6498 and A0570.&lt;/ref&gt; Little was known in the early 1940s about Buerger's disease, especially that the disease could be reversed if the patient stopped smoking. Essad Bey, who was known to be a heavy smoker,&lt;ref&gt;Armin Wegner's diary: "[Essad Bey's] bed cover was full of cigarette holes." Gerhard Höpp, "Mohammed Essad Bey: Nur Orient Für Europäer?" ''Asien, Afrika, Lateinamerika'', 25:1 (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1997), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; died a painful death at the age of 37.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried Fuhrmann "[http://essadbey.de/pdf/EB_im%20Auftrag%20von%20Mussolini.pdf Essad-Bey: im Auftrag von Mussolini und die Raynaudsche oder die Buerger Krankheit], August 25, 2009, pp. 4-5, at essadbey.de.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
Nussimbaum had a romantic view of Islam, seeing it as part of the grand cultural heritage of [[Orient|"the East"]] (to which he felt connected by his Jewish heritage) and a bulwark against the evils of Western modernity and [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]]. Writing about his childhood in Azerbaijan, he notes the emotional response he had to looking at the old palaces in Baku: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the broad expanse of the sandy Arabian desert, I saw the horsemen, their snow-white burnooses billowing in the wind, I saw the flocks of prophets praying towards Mecca and I wanted to be one with this wall, one with this desert, one with this incomprehensible, intricate script, one with the entire Islamic Orient, which in our Baku had been so ceremoniously carried to the grave, to the victorious drumbeats of European culture.... Throughout my entire childhood, I dreamed of the Arabic edifices every night... I do know that it was the most powerful, most formative feeling of my life.&lt;ref&gt;"Reiss, Tom 2005, p. 34"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Confusion surrounds the details of Essad Bey's conversion to Islam. There are at least three accounts that attempt to explain his alleged conversion:

(1) That when Essad Bey was 17 years old, he officially obtained a certificate as "document of proof" in a declaration to Imam Hafiz Shuku (1871-1924) of the former Ottoman Embassy in Berlin on August 13, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Höpp, "Mohammed Essad Bey: Nur Orient Für Europäer?" in "Asien, Afrika, Lateinamerika," Vol. 25:1 (1997), p. 77. Also sited in Tom Reiss, 2005, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) However, later accounts circulated that Essad Bey did not convert to Islam but simply reclaimed his religious identity since he had been born a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Giamil Vacca Mazzara, "Mohammed Es'ad-Bey: Scrittore Musulmano Dell'Azerbaigian Caucasico" (Mohammed Essad Bey: Muslim Writer from Azerbaijan Caucasus), in "Oriente Moderno" 22:10 (1942), pp. 434-443. The same claims were made by his governess Alice Schulte, in a handwritten, unpublished, 12-page sketch that Schulte had prepared for Essad Bey's Swiss publisher Rascher ("Biographie Essad-Bey" 1943), archived at the Central Library at the University of Zurich (Rascher 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

(3) That Essad Bey converted to Islam along with his family when he was eight years old.&lt;ref&gt;"Mohammed Essad Bey: Starhemberg – Prince and Politician. Austrian Vice-Chancellor was Once a Friend of Hitler, But Now is a Bitter Foe of the Nazis; Once an Enemy of Italy, but Now is a Friend of Mussolini," in "The Literary Digest," 119, No. 23 (New York: June 8, 1935), p. 9, edited by Arthur S. Draper.  Note that the article continues by explaining "Madame Essad-Bey [Erika Loewendahl] has adhered to her Jewish faith, for Moslem wives are not required to follow the husband's creed."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 in Berlin Nussimbaum helped found an Islamic student group Islamia, where he met other Muslims: Arabs, Turks, Iranians, Afghans and Indians, as well as converts like himself. They "spoke out about the wretched situation of Muslims in the colonial world."&lt;ref name="Reiss, Tom 2005, p.34"&gt;Reiss, Tom. ''The Orientalist''. Random House, 2005, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Muslims objected to the way Nussimbaum depicted Islam in his writings, accusing him of [[Orientalism]] and of not being a "real" Muslim. In 1930, Mohammed Hoffman, a member of Islamia and himself a convert to Islam, accused Nussmbaum of trying "to pass for a born Muslim" and suggesting that his conversion was merely a ploy.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, ''The Orientalist'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this and similar accusations, Nussimbaum stopped attending Islamia meetings; however, he never renounced Islam or distanced himself from it. In 1934 the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' ran a profile of "Essad Bey" which described him as an irreverent Muslim who "carries no prayer rug; he fails to salute Mecca when he prays... eats pigs and drinks wine; yet when he came to be married in Berlin he refused to abjure his creed."&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, Tom. ''The Orientalist''. Random House, 2005, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Armin Wegner, a contemporary of Essad Bey who knew him in his last years in Positano, Italy, observed that Bey "kept up the comedy of being Muslim to the end." &lt;ref&gt;Armin Wegner wrote in his diary that Essad Bey "was a Jewish Viennese journalist" and "a typical literary swindler, who was "gifted but irresponsible." When Wegner learned that Essad bey had been buried as a Muslim "with the Koran under his head, facing the Orient," he noted: "Thus, Essad Bey played the comedy up to the very end." Gerhard Höpp, "Mohammed Essad Bey: Nur Orient Für Europäer?" ''Asien, Afrika, Lateinamerika'', 25:1 (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1997), p. 90, Endnote 166, quoting Wegner's diary entries of September 29 to October 1, 1942. Tom Reiss also references Höpp: "The Orientalist'' (New York: Random House, 2005), p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

A scathing review of Essad Bey's biography ''Mohammed'' expressed doubt that the author "had ever read the Quran, either in the original or in translation." It claimed: "Essad Bey's Mohammed is a potpourri of bad history, distorted facts and naive interpretations. It should never have been written... In fact, I am impelled to go still further and state that there is hardly a page in this 'biography' which is free from error." &lt;ref&gt;Nabih Amin Faris, Princeton, New Jersey: ''The Moslem World: A Christian Quarterly Review of Current Events, Literature and Thought Among Mohammedans,'' Vol. 27:2, April 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Despite Nussimbaum's being an ethnic Jew, his monarchist and anti-Bolshevik politics were such that, before his origins were discovered, the [[Nazi propaganda]] [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|ministry]] included his works on their list of "excellent books for German minds".&lt;ref name="lazare" /&gt; Among the works credited to him are early biographies of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Czar Nicholas II]], Mohammed, the Prophet; and Reza Shah of Iran. All these "biographies" were allegedly written between 1932 and 1936. At one point, Nussimbaum was requested to write an official biography of [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Reiss, ''The Orientalist'' (New York: Random House, 2005), pp. 316-317.&lt;/ref&gt; Essad Bey's works, many of which he claimed were biographies, are discredited by historians and literary critics and rarely referenced today except to note how unreliable they are.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact or Fiction? What Essad Bey's Contemporaries Said," in ''Azerbaijan International'', Vol. 15:2-4, pp. 166-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Ali and Nino'' ===
[[Tom Reiss]] attributes the 1937 novel ''[[Ali and Nino: A Love Story]]'', published under the pseudonym [[Kurban Said]], to Lev Nussimbaum. Reiss, in his biography ''The Orientalist'' (about Nussimbaum), argues that Said was Nussimbaum's pseudonym, and the work was written directly by Nussimbaum.&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;{{cite book|last=Reiss|first=Tom|title=The Orientalist : Solving the Mystery of a Strange and Dangerous Life|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-7276-4|edition=2006 Random House trade pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiss also debunks claims made by the heirs of Austrian baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels, who claimed co-authorship. Reiss argues that she registered the book with German authorities in Austria at the time (after 1938); this was because Nussimbaum could not have received money for publishing the book in Germany due to his Jewish ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Kalder&gt;{{cite news|last=Kalder|first=Daniel|title=The vanishing fascination of truly anonymous authors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/15/vanishing-fascination-anonymous-authors|accessdate=9 January 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics, however, have demonstrated that the book is partially plagiarized . They suggest that it was adapted by Nussimbaum from a hypothetical earlier manuscript. A 2011 issue of ''[[Azerbaijan International]]'' re-opened the issue of the authorship of ''Ali and Nino''. Its primary author, Betty Blair, states that "we are convinced" that the book was written mostly by Azerbaijani author [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Azerbaijan International]] |year=2011|volume=15.2-15.4|title=Reasons why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of "Ali and Nino,"|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they also offer evidence that Nussimbaum wrote at least some portions of the book.&lt;ref name=cutandpaste/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
Their arguments include the claims that the folkloric and legendary passages include exact "cut and paste" passages that Nussimbaum published in his earlier works, over and over again, as was his practice.&lt;ref name=cutandpaste&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Azerbaijan International]]|year=2011|title=Specifically, exact treatments of legendary material was taken from Essad Bey's "Blood and Oil in the Orient (1929), "Twelve Secrets of the Caucasus", "Der Kaukasus," Flussiges Gold" (Liquid Gold) and the German literary journal "Die Literarische Welt". Specific examples and text are provided in the article 'Cut and Paste' Author: Essad Bey's Fingerprints|volume=15.2-15.4|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also note that Nussimbaum left the Caucasus when he was only 14 years old &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Azerbaijan International]]|year=2011|last=Blair|first=Betty|title=Folklore: What Essad Bey Didn't Know: Portrait of the Caucasus|volume=15.2-15.4|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he boasted that he was a Monarchist, although the novel expresses the views of someone who sought the independence of Azerbaijan. Reiss dismissed the claim that Chamanzaminli was the author behind the Said pseudonym, claiming that he looked at one of Chamanzaminli's novellas and found him to be a (Muslim communalist) nationalist. Betty Blair of ''Azerbaijan International'' argues, in contrast, that ''Ali and Nino'' is a "nationalist" book in a broader, non-communalist sense, since the novel is essentially about Azerbaijan's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Azerbaijan International]]|year=2011|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the Authorship of "Ali and Nino" (specifically questions 45 and 46)|volume=15.2-15.4|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_articles/English/152_faq_list.html|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tamar Injia]] published a book entitled ''[[Ali and Nino – Literary Robbery!]]'', showing that substantial portions of the book were "stolen" from the book ''[[The Snake's Skin]]'' by [[Georgian people|Georgian]] author [[Grigol Robakidze]]. Injia analyzed the two books, and found a number of similar and identical passages, and concluded that "[[Kurban Said]]" (whose real life identity she does not attempt to determine) deliberately copied passages from Robakidze's earlier novel.

===Under pen name of ''Kurban Said''===
As discussed above, there is a dispute over whether or not Lev Nussimbaum is the core author behind works written under the pseudonym [[Kurban Said]]. The works written under this name include the following:

*''[[Ali and Nino: A Love Story|Ali and Nino]]'' (1937, reissued by Anchor, 2000, {{ISBN|0-385-72040-8}}, as "Ali and Nino: A Love Story").
*''Girl from the Golden Horn'' (1938, reissued by Overlook Press, 2001,  {{ISBN|1-58567-173-8}})
*''The Man Who Knew Nothing About Love'' (Unpublished, but advertised in the back pages of Annemarie Selinko's novel ''I Was an Ugly Girl'', Vienna: Kirschner, 1937), the same year that "Ali and Nino" was published.

'''Ole Andreas Øverland''' (17 March 1855 &amp;ndash; 20 June 1911) was a Norwegian historian, writer and illustrator. He was characterized by [[Terje Bratberg]] as "one of the most prolific historians Norway has produced". He is best known for writing and illustrating two editions of a history of Norway; ''Illustreret Norges Historie'' (published by Folkebladet, Kristiania)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Ole_Andreas_%C3%98verland
|title=  Ole Andreas Øverland|publisher= Store norske leksikon|accessdate= October  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
Øverland was born in [[Trondheim|Trondhjem]] (now Trondheim), Norway. He was the son of Ole Andreas Øverland (1819-1871) and his wife Gjertine Birgitte Moe (1818-1881). He graduated from [[Trondheim Cathedral School]] in 1873. Two years later he was awarded his [[Examen philosophicum|philosophicum]]. He worked for a few years as a teacher before moving to Christiania (now Oslo) in 1878.  He  worked at the [[National Archives of Norway]]  (''Riksarkivet'')  until 1885.  In 1880 he was awarded a  Peter Andreas Munch scholarship (''P. A. Munchs legat'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/data/forvaltning/enhet/21629/endringshistorie|title=  Riksarkivet

He then began writing what would become the first edition of his ''Illustreret Norges Historie'', which was published in five volumes from 1885 to 1895. He was at the same time developing a 12-volume edition of the work, finishing in 1898.  In between working on this major work which received funding from [[Storting|Stortinget]], he also wrote a number of other, smaller studies, biographies, and reviews. He produced a variety of historical works and published several textbooks. He was made a [[Government scholar]] (''statsstipendiat'') in 1898.  &lt;ref&gt;Terje Bratberg.

'''''One Woman's War: Da (Mother)''''' ({{lang-fa|دا، جنگ یک زن}}) is a memoir by [[Sayyid|Seyyedeh]] Zahra Hosseini detailing her experiences during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] as recorded by Seyedeh Azam Hosseini (no relation). The memoir was recorded  through thousands of hours of conversation between Zahra Hosseini and Azam Hosseini, while parts of the book are autobiography by the narrator. The title, ''Da'', means "mother" in [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] and [[Luri language|Luri]], and was meant to memorialize the role of Iranian mothers during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

The book won the 2009 [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad Literary Award]] in the "Documentation and historiography" category,&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205140115/http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1201075 |archivedate=December 5, 2010 |url=http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1201075 |title=No works deserve Iran’s most lucrative literary award this year |work=mehrnews.com |author= |date=November 29, 2010 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;!--Note: The source says no awards for 2010, but has information for awards given in 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's most lucrative literary award.&lt;ref name=tt2011&gt;[http://www.tehrantimes.com/index.php/component/content/article/92700 "''War Road'' author not surprised over lucrative Jalal award"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127162556/http://www.tehrantimes.com/index.php/component/content/article/92700 |date=November 27, 2011 }}, ''Tehran Times'', November 20, 2011,&lt;/ref&gt; undergone more than 140 reprints in three years and became the biggest best seller in the shortest period as the publishers say.

==Narrative==
''One Woman's War: Da (Mother)'' focuses on Zahra Hosseini's life in [[Basra]] and [[Khorramshahr]]. The book consists of three parts with the years of city under siege making the core part of this memoir. The first part details Hosseini's childhood in Iraq, her family's migration to Iran due to pressure from the [[Ba'ath Party|Ba'ath regime]], and her first years in Iran. The second part details Hosseini's activities in nursing injured fighters, helping in the delivery of supplies to the front line, [[Islamic funeral#Common Islamic burial rituals|preparing the corpses of fighters for burial]], and participating in firefights. The final part details Hosseini's recovery from a shrapnel injury and her married life.&lt;ref name="Mazda Publishers"/&gt;

==The narrator==
Seyyedeh Zahra Hosseini is an Iranian [[Kurdish people|Kurd]] who was born in Iraq in 1963. Her parents came to Iran when she was a child and lived in [[Khorramshahr]] and the father of the family was hired by the municipality. She was the second child of six, and stopped going to school after she finished fifth grade.  When the war broke out Hosseini aided the war effort in various roles such as cemetery work. She also engaged in firefights and received a dangerous shrapnel wound near her spine. The injury forced her to leave the battlefield and spend a month in hospital.&lt;ref name="Mazda Publishers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mazdapublishers.com/book/one-womans-war |title= One Woman’s War: Da (Mother), The Memoirs of Seyyedeh Zahra Hoseyni |author=Staff writers |date= |website= Mazda Publishers|publisher= |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre==

'''Pavlo Khrystiuk''' ({{lang-ua|Павло Оникійович Христюк}} ''Pavlo Onykiyovych Khrystiuk'') (1880 &amp;ndash; September 19, 1941) was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Cooperative|cooperator]], [[historian]], [[journalist]], [[political activist]], and [[politician|statesman]].

== Biography ==
Khrystiuk was born in [[Kiev Governorate]]. He studied in [[Kiev Polytechnic Institute]] as his party co-member, [[Vsevolod Holubovych]]. He worked for the newspaper ''Rada'' (Council). In 1916-17 he also worked for journal "Komashnia". Later in his career were the socialists-revolutionary newspapers "Borotba" and "Trudova Hromada".

He became a member of the Central Committee of the [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (UPSR) and the Villagers Association. Also he was a member of the [[Central Rada]] and the Rada Minor as well as the Pysar (Scribe) in the [[General Secretariat of Ukraine]]. He is the co-author of the Land Reform of January 31, 1918.

He was a Minister of the Internal Affairs in the government of [[Vsevolod Holubovych]] (1918) and the deputy Minister in the government of [[Isaak Mazepa]] (1919). After the IV Party Congress he was among the members of the ''central current'' as [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|M.Hrushevsky]].

From 1919 Khrystiuk emigrated to [[Vienna]], where he was a member of the UPSR "foreign delegation" and worked in the magazine "Boritesia-poboryte!". He returned to Ukraine in 1924 and worked for the Association of scientific and technological workers to influence the socialist construction ([[Kharkiv]], 1928-1931). At that time he was also employed for the ''[[Chervony Shliach]]'' newspaper along with [[Pavlo Tychyna]]. He was the author of the history of revolution in Ukraine as well as numerous other books on the history of Ukraine.

Khrystiuk was arrested on March 2, 1931 as the member of the [[Ukrainian National Center Affair|Ukrainian National Center]] and was convicted to imprisonment. He died in one of the camps of the [[Sevvostlag]], [[Khabarovsk Krai]].

'''Peter the Deacon''' ({{lang-fr|Pierre le Diacre}}) was the librarian of the abbey of [[Montecassino]] and continuator of the ''Chronicon Monasterii Casinensis'', usually called the Montecassino Chronicle in English. The chronicle was originally written by [[Leo of Ostia]]. According to both [[Ferdinand Chalandon|Chalandon]] and [[John Julius Norwich|Lord Norwich]], Peter is a poor historian and writer, much inferior to Leo. 

Reputedly a descendant of the [[Counts of Tusculum]], he was offered in 1115 to the monastery of Monte Cassino. About 1127 he was forced to leave the abbey and retired to the neighbouring Atina ([[Atina, Lazio]]), because he had supported Abbot Oderisius, who had been deposed by Pope Honorius II.  In 1131 he returned to the abbey owing to the death of Pope Honorius. In 1137, he appeared before [[Emperor Lothair II]], then in Italy, on behalf of his monastery. The sovereign was so pleased with him that he appointed him his chaplain and secretary, and would probably have attached him permanently to his person had not [[Abbot]] [[Wibald]] considered Peter's return necessary to the abbey. 

In 1131 on his return to Monte Cassino Peter became librarian and keeper of the abbey archives, of which he compiled a cartulary (Registrum Petri Diaconi). Besides editing the existing chronicle of Monte Cassino (and introducing many falsehoods), he wrote several historical works: "De viris illustribus Casinensibus"; "De ortu et obitu justorum Casinensium"; "De Locis sanctis"; Disciplina Casinensis"; "Rhythmus de novissimis diebus". 

Peter forged, under the name of Gordian, the ''Passion of St. Placidus''. He is vain and occasionally untruthful, but an entertaining writer. His works are in ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', CLXXIII, 763-1144.

The judge Abu ʿAbd Allah Muhammad b. ʿIsa (d. 505/1111) was ʿIyad’s first important teacher and is credited with his basic academic formation. Growing up, ʿIyad benefited from the traffic of scholars from al-Andalus, the Maghrib, and the eastern Islamic world. He became a prestigious scholar in his own right and won the support of the highest levels of society.&lt;ref&gt;Camilo Gómez-Rivas,  Islamic Legal Thought: A Compendium of Muslim Jurists, p 325. Koninklijke Brill NV {{ISBN|978-90-04-25452-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his quest for knowledge, Iyad spent part of 507/1113 and 508/1114 visiting Cordoba, Murcia,  Almeria, and Granada. He received ijāzas from the most important traditionist of his time, Abū ʿAlī al-Ṣadafī (d. 514/1120) in Murcia, and met  with some of the most celebrated scholars of the moment, such as [[Ibn al-Hajj]] (d. 529/1134), [[Ibn Rushd]] (d. 520/1126), and [[Ibn Hamdin]] (d. 508/1114).&lt;ref&gt;Camilo Gómez-Rivas,  Islamic Legal Thought: A Compendium of Muslim Jurists, p 326. Koninklijke Brill NV {{ISBN|978-90-04-25452-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ʿIyad was appointed judge of Ceuta in 515/1121 and served in the position until 531/1136. During his tenure as judge of Ceuta he was extremely prolific. Iyad's overall fame as a jurist and as a writer of fiqh (positive law) was based on the work he did in this city.&lt;ref&gt;Camilo Gómez-Rivas,  Islamic Legal Thought: A Compendium of Muslim Jurists, p 326. Koninklijke Brill NV {{ISBN|978-90-04-25452-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iyad was also appointed the judge of Grenada where he worked for just over a year.&lt;ref&gt;Camilo Gómez-Rivas,  Islamic Legal Thought: A Compendium of Muslim Jurists, p 326. Koninklijke Brill NV {{ISBN|978-90-04-25452-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He headed a revolt against the coming of the [[Almohades]] to [[Ceuta]], but lost and was banished to [[Tadla]] and later [[Marrakech]]. He was a pupil of Abu Abdillah ibn Isa, Abu Abdillah ibn Hamdin and Abu al-Hassan ibn Siraj, and was a teacher of [[Averroes]] and [[Ibn Maḍāʾ Al-Qurṭubī|Ibn Maḍāʾ]].

He died in 1149.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arab-ency.com/index.php?module=pnEncyclopedia&amp;func=display_term&amp;id=13644 |title=
Ibn Mada’(Ahmad ibn Abdul Rahman-) Ibn Mada’(Ahmad ibn Abdul Rahman-)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he refused to acknowledge [[Ibn Tumart]] as the awaited [[Mahdi]], Qadi Ayyad was executed with a [[spear]] and his body subsequently cut to pieces. Although he was opposed to the Almohads and the ideas of Ibn Hazm, he did not hold enmity for the [[Zahiri]]te school of Sunni Islam, which the Almohads and Ibn Hazm followed. Ayyad's comments on Ibn Hazm's teacher Abu al-Khiyar al-Zahiri were positive, as was Ayyad's characterization of his own father, a Zahirite theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Delfina Serrano, "Claim or complaint?"

[[Cadi Ayyad University]], also known as the University of Marrakech, was named after him. Qadi Ayyad is also well known as one of the seven saints of [[Marrakech]] and is buried near Bab Aïlen.

'''Robert Fabyan''' (died c.1512) was a London [[Worshipful Company of Drapers|draper]], [[List of Sheriffs of London|Sheriff]] and Alderman, and author of ''Fabyan's Chronicle''.

==Family==
Robert Fabyan was the son of John Fabyan and his wife, Agnes. He is said to have been born in London. He had a brother, John.{{sfn|Ellis|1811|pp=i–ii}}{{sfn|McLaren|2004}} His nephew, John Fabyan, married Anne Waldegrave, by whom he had a daughter, Mary Fabian, wife of [[Thomas Spert|Sir Thomas Spert]].{{sfn|Baldwin|2004}}

==Career==
[[File:Brief History of Wood-engraving Richard Pynson Mark.png|thumb|right|230px|Mark of [[Richard Pynson]], who printed ''Fabyan's Chronicle'']]
He was apprenticed as a draper to William Holme about 1470, and was granted the freedom of the [[Worshipful Company of Drapers]] in 1476. In 1485 he served as renter warden of the Drapers, and in 1486 as auditor of the accounts of the City of London. In 1493 he was elected [[List of Sheriffs of London|Sheriff]], and in the following year as alderman of the ward of [[Farringdon Without]]. In 1495 he was elected Master of the Drapers, and in 1496 was chosen to petition [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] on behalf of the Company with respect to the levies on cloth exported from England to [[Flanders]]. During the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] Fabyan, John Brooke and John Warner were charged with securing [[Ludgate]] and [[Newgate]]. After the suppression of the rebellion they travelled with the King to [[Woodstock Palace|Woodstock]]. In 1498 he was one of the assessors of a subsidy levied to finance the war in Scotland. In 1501 he was again elected Master of the Drapers. In 1503 he resigned his office of alderman on the ground that he lacked the financial resources to support election as [[List of Lord Mayors of London|Lord Mayor]].{{sfn|Ellis|1811|pp=i–ii}}{{sfn|McLaren|2004}}

He is best known as the author of the work commonly known as ''Fabyan's Chronicle'', which presents 'parallel histories of England and France', and covers the period from the arrival of the legendary [[Brutus of Troy]] in England to the death of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. Two manuscripts are extant ([[Holkham Hall]], MS 671, and [[British Library|BL]], Cotton MS Nero C.xi), and although these are not in Fabyan's hand, it is almost certain that the text is his.{{sfn|McLaren|2004}} The chronicle was initially printed without attribution by [[Richard Pynson]] in 1516 as ''The New Chronicles of England and France'', but an edition of 1533 printed by [[William Rastell]] bore Fabyan's name on the title page: ''Fabyans cronycle newly prynted''.{{sfn|McLaren|2004}} Both [[John Bale]] and [[John Stow]] described the chronicle as Fabyan's work, although according to McLaren, Stow also wrongly attributes to him the manuscript of the ''Great Chronicle'' (London, [[Guildhall Library]], MS 3313), likely because both Fabyan's Chronicle and the Great Chronicle are written (or copied) in the same hand.{{sfn|McLaren|2004}}

A continuation in 1509 appears also to be attributable to Fabyan,{{sfn|McLaren|2004}} and includes events personally witnessed by him, such as the arrest in 1468 of Thomas Cooke,&lt;ref&gt;Great-grandfather of [[Anthony Cooke|Sir Anthony Cooke]]; {{Harvnb|Richardson IV|2011|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent merchant in London,{{sfn|Wagner|Schmid|2012|p=431}} and the arrival in England in 1502 of three men, inhabitants of [[Newfoundland]], 'whom the King kept a time after'.{{sfn|Vaughan|2004}}

Fabyan was the first London chronicler to cite his sources, which included ''[[Prose Brut|The Brut]]'', [[Bede]], [[William of Malmesbury]], [[Ranulf Higden]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]] and numerous others, as well as records of the City of London. [[John Bale]] claimed that the 1516 edition was burned by [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]]. The second edition of 1533 was printed after Wolsey's death, and was followed by editions in 1542 and 1559. [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]] edited a modern edition in 1811.{{sfn|Ellis|1811|pp=xiii–xviii}}{{sfn|McLaren|2004}}

Fabyan was executor of the will of his father-in-law, and through his wife inherited a house called Halstedys together with other lands in [[Theydon Garnon]], Essex. At his death he also owned tenements in the London parishes of [[St Benet Fink]] and [[St Michael's, Cornhill]], as well as lands and tenements in [[East Ham]], [[West Ham]], [[Leyton]] and other towns in [[Essex]].{{sfn|Ellis|1811|p=iii}}{{sfn|McLaren|2004}}

[[John Stow|Stow]] states that Fabyan died in 1511, while [[John Bale|Bale]] dates his death to 25 February 1512.{{sfn|Ellis|1811|p=iii}} Stow also records that he was buried at [[St Michael's Cornhill]], where his monument is no longer extant, although Stow preserved the English part of his epitaph. In his will, proved 12 July 1513, he left bequests to his wife, his six surviving children, his cousin, Dorothy, and the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|mercer]] Robert Tate, [[List of Lord Mayors of London|Lord Mayor of London]], among others.{{sfn|Ellis|1811|pp=iii–xiii}}{{sfn|McLaren|2004}}

==Marriage and issue==
Fabyan married Elizabeth Pake, daughter and heir of a London [[Worshipful Company of Drapers|draper]], John Pake, by Elizabeth Stokker, by whom he had sixteen children, only six of whom, four sons, John, Robert, Thomas, and Anthony, and two daughters, Joan Haryat and Mary, were alive at his death.{{sfn|McLaren|2004}}

Ellis notes that a John Fabyan, in his will dated 16 March 1541, mentions 'the Lady Spert' (see above) as his sister, and refers to the [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]] as his master. He also mentions another sister, Martha, to whom he bequeaths four [[Noble (English coin)|nobles]] yearly, and the Lady Marney, to whom he bequeaths his books of meditation and his chronicles.{{sfn|Ellis|1811|pp=i–ii}} McLaren suggest that this might be the will of 'a grandson of Robert';{{sfn|McLaren|2004}} however Baldwin's statement that Robert Fabyan had a nephew, John Fabyan, whose daughter Mary married [[Thomas Spert|Sir Thomas Spert]] (see above), suggests that the 1541 will was the will of the son of Robert Fabyan's nephew.{{sfn|Baldwin|2004}}

The protected area was discovered in 1990 in the [[Altai Mountains]] ([[Ukok Plateau]]).&lt;ref name="kt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kt.kz/rus/society/otkrit_novij_ekskursionnij_marshrut_v_boraldajskie_carskie_kurgani_1153637932.html|website=kt.kz|title=Открыт новый экскурсионный маршрут в Боралдайские царские курганы|accessdate=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tombs date back to the early [[Iron Age]], and are the only find of this period in the [[Almaty]] region.&lt;ref name="voxpopuli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxpopuli.kz/history/chto-zhdet-kazahstanskiy-stounhendzh-13013.html|website=voxpopuli.kz|title=Что ждет казахстанский Стоунхендж?|accessdate=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site comprises 430 hectares, and includes 47 mounds of the [[Saka]] period from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BC. The average diameter of the mounds is 60 meters by 150 meters, and their average height is 14 meters. The dry climate conditions in the area have preserved and mummified remains, including human remains, clothing, and various objects. A burial area for horses has also been found.

The Tsar and his mother were found in the biggest burial mound (number 11). Researchers believe that the various burial mounds had multiple functions, including [[astronomical]] purposes and calendar ceremonies. There are current plans of turning the site into a museum.&lt;ref name="e-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-history.kz/en/publications/view/768|website=e-history.kz|title=Berel mounds will turn into museum · Publications · "Kazakhstan History" portal |accessdate=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inform.kz/ru/sakskie-kurgany-v-almaty-mogut-stat-analogom-doliny-piramid_a3042902|website=inform.kz|title=Сакские курганы в Алматы могут стать аналогом Долины пирамид &amp;#124; Все права защищены |accessdate=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simon Pelloutier''' (Oct. 27, 1694 – Oct. 3, 1757) was a French historian, was born at [[Leipzig|Leipsic]], Germany, Oct. 27, 1694. His father, a merchant established at [[Lyon|Lyons]], had been driven from France by the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]. Aided by an excellent memory and a strong desire to educate himself, he studied at [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], at [[Berlin]], and [[Geneva]]. Admitted to the evangelical ministry, he served the French churches of [[Buchholterberg|Buchholtz]] (1715), of [[Magdeburg|Madgeburg]] (1719), and of Berlin (1725), where he was the colleague of Lentant. In 1743 he was elected member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences at Berlin]], and was chosen for its librarian in 1745. He died at Berlin Oct. 3, 1757. 

His principal work is, ''Histoiare des Celtes et particulierement des Gaulois et des Germains depuis les temps fabuleux jusqua la prise de Roze par les Gaulois'' (La Haye, 1740-1750, 2 vols. 12mo). This edition is full of faults; Chiniac de la Bastide has given a second, revised and enlarged after the MSS. of the author (Paris, 1771, 2 vols. 4to, or 8 vols. 12mo), which was translated into German by Purmann (Frankfort, 1777-1784, 3 vols. 8vo). "This work," says the ''Journal des Savants,'' "is very curious and agreeable in many respects; it is full of an extremely varied erudition. The author, not satisfied with proving what he advances, always accompanies his proofs with judicious reflections, from which he afterwards draws very extended conclusions, calculated to throw light upon the history and antiquities of all the different peoples of Europe." The editor has added to the ''Histoire des Celtes'' several dissertations by Pelloutier; among others the ''Discours sur les Galates,'' which gained for him in 1742 a prize from the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|French Academy of Inscriptions]]. See Brucker, ''Pinacotheca,'' dec. 3, No. 9; Formey, ''Eloges;'' Haag, ''La France Protestante.''

'''Sneakers''' (also known as '''athletic shoes''', '''tennis shoes''', '''gym shoes''', '''sport shoes''', '''runners''', or '''trainers''') are [[shoe]]s primarily designed for [[sport]]s or other forms of [[physical exercise]], but which are now also widely used for everyday wear. The term generally describes a type of footwear with a flexible [[sole (shoe)|sole]] made of [[rubber]] or synthetic material and an upper part made of [[leather]], synthetic substitutes or cloth.

==Names and etymology==
[[File:Reebok Royal Glide Ripple Clip shoe.jpg|thumb|[[Reebok]] sneakers]]
The shoes have gone by a variety of names, depending on geography, and changing over the decades. The term "sneakers" is most commonly used in the [[Northeastern United States]], [[South Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Josh|title=Speaking American: How Y’all, Youse, and You Guys Talk: A Visual Guide|date=25 October 2016|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0544703391|pages=4–5|url=https://smile.amazon.com/Speaking-American-Youse-Illustrated-Guide/dp/0544703391?sa-no-redirect=1|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/22-maps-that-show-the-deepest-linguistic-conflicts-in-america-2013-6?op=1|title=22 Maps That Show How Americans Speak English Totally Differently From One Another|last=Hickey|first=Walter|date=5 June 2013|work=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=2017-03-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Carolina]], and parts of [[Canada]]. The [[British English]] equivalent of "sneaker" in its modern form is "'''trainer'''". In some urban areas in the [[United States]], the slang for sneakers is '''''kicks'''''. Other terms include '''training shoes''' or '''trainers''' ([[British English|Britain]]), '''sandshoes''', '''gym boots''' or '''joggers''' ([[Geordie English]] in the [[UK]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/GeordieDictionary.html|title=Geordie Dictionary|website=www.englandsnortheast.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;), '''running shoes''', '''runners''' or '''gutties''' ([[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Australian English|Australia]] and [[Scottish English|Scotland]]), '''daps''' in [[Welsh English|Wales]], '''runners''' in [[Hiberno-English]], '''sneakers''' ([[North American English|North America]]) and ([[Australian English|Australia]]), '''tennis shoes''' ([[North American English|North American]] and [[Australian English|Australia]]), '''gym shoes''', '''tennies''', '''sports shoes''', '''sneaks''', '''takkies''' ([[South African English|South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TYZswEACAAJ|title=Africanderisms: A Glossary of South African Colloquial Words and Phrases and of Place and Other Names|last=Pettman|first=Charles|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=1913|isbn=1515051226|location=|page=491|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hiberno-English), '''rubber shoes''' ([[Philippine English]]) or '''canvas shoes''' ([[Nigeria]]).



[[Plimsoll shoe|Plimsolls]] (British English) are "low tech" athletic shoes, and are also called 'sneakers' in [[American English]]. The word "sneaker" is often attributed to American Henry Nelson McKinney who was an advertising agent for N. W. Ayer &amp; Son.  In 1917, he used the term because the rubber sole made the shoe stealthy. The word was already in use at least as early as 1887, as the ''Boston Journal'' made reference to "sneakers" as "the name boys give to tennis shoes." The name "sneakers" originally referred to how quiet the rubber soles were on the ground, in contrast to noisy standard hard leather sole dress shoes. Someone wearing sneakers could "sneak up" on someone while someone wearing standards could not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mental Floss|''Mental Floss magazine'']], Sept-Oct 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, the name "sneaks" had been used by prison inmates to refer to warders because of the rubber-soled shoes they wore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ko4BAAAAQAAJ&amp;oe=UTF-8|title=Female life in prison, by a prison matron|last=Robinson|first=Frederick William|publisher=Hurst and Blackett|year=1863|isbn=9781341245022|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
These shoes acquired the nickname 'plimsoll' in the 1870s, derived according to Nicholette Jones' book ''The Plimsoll Sensation'', from the coloured horizontal band joining the upper to the sole, which resembled the [[Plimsoll line]] on a ship's hull. Alternatively, just like the Plimsoll line on a ship, if water got above the line of the rubber sole, the wearer would get wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWKp52--eoYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=How to Talk Like a Local: From Cockney to Geordie|first=|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=9781409061953|location=|page=99|pages=|author=Susie Dent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plimsolls were widely worn by vacationers and also began to be worn by sportsmen on the [[tennis]] and [[croquet]] courts for their comfort. Special soles with engraved patterns to increase the surface grip of the shoe were developed, and these were ordered in bulk for the use of the [[British Army]]. Athletic shoes were increasingly used for leisure and outdoor activities at the turn of the 20th century - plimsolls were even found with the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|Scott Antarctic expedition]] of 1911. Plimsolls were  commonly worn by pupils in schools' [[physical education]] lessons in the UK from the 1950s until the early 1970s .{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

British company [[J.W. Foster and Sons]] designed and produced the first shoes designed for running in 1895; the shoes were spiked to allow for greater traction and speed. The company sold its high-quality handmade running shoes to athletes around the world, eventually receiving a contract for the manufacture of running shoes for [[Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics|the British team]] in the 1924 Summer Olympics. [[Harold Abrahams]] and [[Eric Liddell]] won the 100-m and 400-m events, kitted out with Foster's running gear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=Rachael|title=Foster's Famous Shoes|url=http://www.boltonrevisited.org.uk/p-fosters-shoes.html|website=Bolton Revisited|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EVD-tenis-050.jpg|right|240 px|thumb|A pair of white athletic tennis shoes with pink accents]]
This style of footwear also became prominent in America at the turn of the 20th century, where they were called 'sneakers'. In 1892, the [[U.S. Rubber]] Company introduced the first rubber-soled shoes in the country, sparking a surge in demand and production. The first basketball shoes were designed by [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] as early as 1907.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The market for sneakers grew after [[World War I]], when sports and athletics increasingly became a way to demonstrate moral fiber and [[patriotism]]. The U.S. market for sneakers grew steadily as young boys lined up to buy sneakers endorsed by [[American football|football player]] [[Jim Thorpe]] and [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars|Converse All Stars]] endorsed by [[basketball player]] [[Chuck Taylor (salesman)|Chuck Taylor]].

During the [[interwar period]], athletic shoes began to be marketed for different sports, and differentiated designs were made available for men and women. Athletic shoes were used by competing athletes at the [[Olympics]], helping to popularise athletic shoes among the general public. In 1936, a French brand, Spring Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Running Shoes for Plantar Fasciitis Men &amp; Women|url=http://www.yourcomfyfeet.com/|publisher=Your Comfy Feet|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketed the first canvas [[tennis shoe]] featuring signature eight ventilation channels on a vulcanised natural rubber sole.

[[Adolf Dassler|Adolf "Adi" Dassler]] began producing his own sports shoes in his mother's wash kitchen in [[Herzogenaurach]], [[Bavaria]], after his return from [[World War I]], and went on to establish one of the leading athletic shoe manufacturers, [[Adidas]].&lt;ref name="Sneaker Wars"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Smit|first=Barbara|title=Sneaker Wars|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2009|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-124658-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also successfully marketed his shoes to athletes at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], which helped cement his good reputation. Business boomed and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes each year before World War II.&lt;ref name=rediff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/sports/2005/nov/08adi.htm |title=How Adidas and PUMA were born |publisher=in.rediff.com |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-War ===
During the 1950s, leisure opportunities greatly expanded, and children and adolescents began to wear sneakers as [[school dress codes]] relaxed. Sneaker sales rose so high, they began to adversely impact on the sales of conventional [[leather]] shoes, leading to a fierce advertising war for market share in the late '50s. In the 1970s, [[jogging]] for exercise became increasingly popular, and trainers designed specifically for comfort while jogging sold well. Companies also started to target some of their products at the casual fashion market. Soon, shoes were available for football, jogging, basketball, [[running]], etc. Many sports had their relevant shoe, made possible by podiatrist development of athletic shoe technology.

During the 1990s, shoe companies perfected their fashion and marketing skills. Sports endorsements with famous athletes grew larger, and marketing budgets went through the roof. Sneakers became a fashion statement and were marketed as a definition of identity and personality rather than simply athletic aids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drpribut.com/sports/sneaker_odyssey.html Pribut, Stephen M. "A Sneaker Odyssey."] Dr. Stephen M. Pribut's Sport Pages. 2002. Web. 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970 (5 models) over 1998 (285 models) to 2012 (3,371), the number of sport shoe models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.&lt;ref name="Aichner, T 2013"&gt;Aichner, T. and Coletti, P. 2013.

==Use in sports==
[[File:New Balance 750v1.jpg|thumb|260 px|Road runners [[New Balance]] 750v1 after marathon event]]
The term 'athletic shoes' is typically used for shoes utilized for [[jogging]] or road running and indoor sports such as [[basketball]], but tends to exclude shoes for sports played on grass such as [[association football]] and [[rugby football]], which are generally known in North America as '[[Cleat (shoe)|cleats]]' and in British English as "boots".

Attributes of an athletic shoe include a flexible sole, appropriate tread for the function, and ability to absorb impact.  As the industry and designs have expanded, the term "athletic shoes" is based more on the design of the bottom of the shoe than the aesthetics of the top of the shoe. Today's designs include sandals, [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]], and even elevated styles suitable for running, dancing, and jumping.

The shoes themselves are made of flexible compounds, typically featuring a sole made of dense rubber. While the original design was basic, manufacturers have since tailored athletic shoes for their specific purposes. An example of this is the [[Track spikes|spiked shoe]] developed for track running. Some of these shoes are made up to unusually large sizes for athletes with large feet.

===Running shoes===
Running shoes come in a range of shapes suited to different running styles/abilities. Generally, they are divided by running style: the majority are for heel-toe joggers/runners which are further subdivided into '[[Pronation_of_the_foot#Neutral_pronation|neutral]]', '[[Pronation_of_the_foot#Overpronation|overpronation]]' and '[[Pronation_of_the_foot#Supination|underpronation]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understand pronation to get the correct running shoes|url=http://comforthacks.com/understand-pronation-to-get-the-correct-running-shoes/|website=Comfort Hacks|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fitting Your Running Shoes to Your Feet | author = [[Marius Bakken]]  | url = http://www.runningshoeswizard.com/  | accessdate = 2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are constructed with a complex structure of "rubber" with plastic/metal stiffeners to restrict foot movement. More advanced runners tend to wear [[racing flats|flatter and flexible shoes]], which allow them to run more quickly with greater comfort.

According to the [[NPD Group]], one in four pairs of running shoes that were sold in the United States in 2016 were bought from an [[online retailer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chesto |first=Jon |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/07/19/new-city-sports-owners-plot-revival-boston-brand/TNSOVoB0UBv7WN0pvZaTHO/story.html |title=New City Sports owners plot revival of Boston brand |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2017-07-19 |accessdate=2017-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toribio of Benavente, [[Franciscans|O.F.M.]]''' (1482, [[Benavente, Zamora|Benavente]], Spain – 1568, Mexico City, [[New Spain]]), also known as '''Motolinía''', was a [[Franciscan]] missionary who was one of the famous [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico]] who arrived in [[New Spain]] in May 1524.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas, Prologue, chapter 4 where he names (i) the clerics (including a Franciscan friar) who were present with [[Hernán Cortés]] in 1522; (ii) the three Flemish Franciscan lay brothers who came out in 1523 (two of whom died prematurely); and (iii) the "Twelve" (10 Franciscan priests and two Franciscan lay brothers) who came out to New Spain in 1524&lt;/ref&gt; His published writings are a key source for the history and ethnography of the [[Nahuas]] of central Mexico in the immediate post-conquest period as well as for the challenges of Christian evangelization. He is probably best known for his attacks on the Dominican defender of the rights of the indigenous peoples, [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who criticized the Conquest. Motolinia supported the subjugation of the Indians as savages and did all he could to vilify Las Casas, who tried to protect the Indians' natural rights and full humanity.

==Early life==
Toribio entered the Franciscan Order as a young boy, dropping his family name of Paredes in favor of his city of birth, as was the custom among the Franciscans. In 1523, he was chosen to be among the [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico]], to be sent to the [[New World]].

==Evangelist New Spain==
After a strenuous journey he arrived in Mexico, where he was greeted with great respect by [[Hernán Cortés]]. Upon walking through [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] the Indians said of his ragged Franciscan robes "Motolinia", [[Nahuatl]] for "one who is poor or afflicted." That was the first word he learned in the language, and he took it as his name. For the [[Franciscan Order]], poverty was an important and defining virtue. He was named [[custos (Franciscans)|Guardian]] of the Convent of San Francisco in [[Mexico City]], where he resided from 1524 to 1527.

From 1527 to 1529, he worked in [[Guatemala]] and perhaps [[Nicaragua]], studying the new missions in that area. Back in Mexico, he stayed at the convent of Huejotzinco, near Tlaxcala, where he had to help the natives against the abuse and atrocities committed by [[Nuño de Guzmán]]. He suggested for the native leaders to complain to Bishop Fray [[Juan de Zumárraga]] about Guzmán, but the latter accused him of trying to instigate a revolt among the Indians against the Spanish. In 1530, he went to the Convent of Tlaxcala and contributed in the foundation of the City of ''[[Puebla de los Ángeles]]'', which was chosen for its agricultural and other economic potential; it was to be a settlement of Spaniards who pursued agriculture themselves without the aid of indigenous labor of the ''[[encomienda]]''. With Franciscan colleagues, he traveled to Tehuantepec, Guatemala, and to the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] to undertake further missionary work.

Even though Motolinía protected Indians against the abuse of Guzmán, he did not share the opinions of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] bishop, [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who saw the conquest and subjugation of the Indians as a crime against all Christian morality. Motolinía believed that God would protect the Indians once converted and that the missionary work thus was more important than fighting the ''encomienda'' system, and defended it along with evangelization. In fact, in a famous letter to King [[Charles V of Spain]], he undertook a virulent attack on Las Casas, intending to discredit him completely. He called him "a grievous man, restless, importunate, turbulent, injurious, and prejudicial", and even an [[apostate]], in that he had renounced the Bishopric of Chiapas. He furthermore advised the king to have Las Casas shut up for safe keeping in a monastery. In 1545, the ''encomenderos'' of [[Chiapas]] asked for him to come there to defend them against Las Casas but he declined, in the same way he declined a position as bishop offered to him by the king. The letter to the king is an important document, clarifying the Franciscan position of baptizing as many Indians as possible if they presented themselves for it. In the time of the conquest Mexico's devastating plagues had reduced the indigenous population considerably and the Franciscans feared for the souls of Indians who died without baptism. They took the position that they should baptize to ensure salvation, but also continue pastoral care so that Indians would grow more knowledgeable about their new Christian faith. The Dominican Order was famous for its adherence to firm doctrinal positions, which meant that they refused baptism to Indians in Mexico if were deemed with a lack of knowledge in the tenets of Christianity.

In his letter to the king, Motolinia recounts an incident of Las Casas's refusal to baptize an Indian in Tlaxcala.;&lt;blockquote&gt; I said to Las Casas: "How is this, father, all this zeal and love that you say you have for the Indians is exhausted in loading them down and going around writing about Spaniards, and vexing the Indians, since your grace loads down more Indians than thirty (Franciscan) friars? And since you won't baptize or instruct an Indian, it would be well if you would pay those that you so load down and tire out."&lt;ref&gt;Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, "The Franciscan reply (to Las Casas)" in ''Letters and People of the Spanish Indies, Sixteenth century,'' edited and translated by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and Enrique Otte. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1976, p. 226. The entire letter is translated to English with an introduction, placing it in context, pp. 218-247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early chapter of Motolinia's history recounts what he considered the ten plagues afflicting New Spain, bringing the Biblical metaphor of the [[Ten Plagues]] into the unfolding events in early Mexico. He considered smallpox the first plague; the second, the number of those who died in the conquest; the third, famine following the fall of Tenochtitlan; the fourth, native and black labor bosses and tribute collectors; the fifth, the Indians' tax and tribute obligations; the sixth, Indians forced to labor in Spanish gold mines; the seventh, the building of Mexico City; the eighth, enslavement of Indians to work in the mines; the ninth, the labor in mines far from Indians' homes; and the tenth plague, the factionalism of Spaniards, particularly when Cortés left central Mexico for conquests in Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;Motolinia, ''Motolinia's History of the Indians of New Spain,'' pp. 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of smallpox and factionalism among Spaniards, Motolinia considered Spaniards' deliberate oppression and exploitation of the Indians the worst afflictions.

==Death==
Having founded many cloisters and convents in Mexico and baptized an estimated 400,000-plus Indians, he retired to the friary of San Francisco in Mexico City, where he died in 1568. He is remembered in Mexico as one of the most important evangelists.

==Ethnographies==
Motolinia is well known for his two histories of the [[Aztec]] and for recording incidents in the evangelization of the Indians. Motolinia recounted the martyrdom of three converted boys from Tlaxcala (Cristóbal, Antonio, and Juan), who were killed by adults who resisted conversion. In Motolinia's account, the deaths of Juan and Antonio were premeditated:&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]ome lords and important men had... arranged to kill these children [Juan and Antonio] because they were breaking their idols and depriving them of their gods.... Antonio came out at once, and when he saw the cruelty with which these brutes were treating his servant (Juan), instead of fleeing he said to them with great spirit: "Why are you killing my companion; for it is not his fault but mine? I am the one who is taking away your idols, because I know that they are devils and not gods. If you consider them gods, take them and leave that boy alone, for he has done you no harm." Saying this he threw on the ground some idols which he was carrying in his skirt. By the time he finished speaking these words, the Indias had killed the child Juan, and then they fell upon the other, Antonio, so that they also killed him.&lt;ref name="Motolinia_251_252"&gt;Motolinia,''Motolinia's History of the Indians of New Spain'', pp. 251-252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The children had been put in the care of lords of Tlaxcala by the leader of the Twelve Apostles of Mexico, Fray [[Martín de Valencia]], who Motolinia thought would be especially saddened by the murders. Antonio was not just a child convert but would have become heir to a principal lord of Tlaxcala.&lt;ref name="Motolinia_251_252"/&gt; To the Franciscans, the martyrdom of the Tlaxcalan boys showed the bravery and the zeal of new converts to the faith and the excellence of the Franciscans' strategy of converting children for the long-term growth of Christianity.

Unlike the writings of fellow Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], particularly the [[Florentine Codex]], Motolinia's writings are unsystematic in their organization, as he himself acknowledged. However, as one of the earliest friars evangelizing in the densest area of [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] populations, what he wrote is extremely important as a record of indigenous life and first encounters with the Spaniards.

An English translation of significant portions of Motolinia's works was done by Elizabeth Andros Foster in 1950 for the Cortés Society and reissued in 1973 by Greenwood Press. Her introduction to the translation has a careful discussion of Motolinia's life and works.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Andros Foster, "Introduction" to ''Motolinia's History of the Indians of New Spain'', Greenwood Press 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uncle''' (from {{lang-la|avunculus}} the diminutive of ''avus'' "grandfather") is a male [[family]] relationship or [[kinship]] within an extended or immediate family. An uncle is the [[brother]], [[half-brother]], [[step-brother]], or [[brother-in-law]] of one's parent, or the husband of one's [[aunt]] or uncle. The specific terms for the last three respectively are half-uncle, stepuncle and uncle-in-law which can refer also to the husband of one's aunt. A biological uncle is a second degree male relative and shares 25% genetic overlap. However people who are not a biological uncle, are sometimes affectionately called as an uncle, as a title of admiration and respect.

A woman with the equivalent relationship of an uncle is an [[aunt]]. The reciprocal relationship to both of these is that of a [[Nephew and niece|nephew]] or [[Nephew and niece|niece]].

A great-uncle (sometimes written as great uncle, grand-uncle or granduncle) is the brother or brother-in-law of one's grandparent.

A male cousin of one's parent is often addressed as "uncle" instead of "cousin".

== Cultural variations ==
In some cultures and families, children may refer to the cousins of their parents as "aunt" or "uncle". It is also a [[title of respect]] for elders (for example older cousins, neighbors, acquaintances, close family friends, and even sometimes total strangers). Using the term in this way is a form of [[fictive kinship]].

=== Albanian, Slavic and Persian ===
In some cultures, like Albanian, Slavic, or Persian, no single inclusive term describing both a person's [[kinship]] to their parental male sibling or parental male in-law exists. Instead, there are specific terms describing a person's kinship to their mother's brother ("dajë" in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] language, "daiyee" in [[Persian language|Persian]], "wuj" (diminutive: "wujek") in [[Polish language|Polish]]) or a person's kinship to their father's brother ("xhajë" in Albanian, "amou" in Persian, "stryj" (diminutive: "stryjek") in [[Polish language|Polish]]). An analogous differentiation exists using separate terms to describe a person's kinship to their mother's female sibling, ("teze" in Albanian, "khaleh" in Persian, "ciotka" (diminutive: "ciocia") in [[Polish language|Polish]]), and a person's kinship to their father's female sibling, ("hallë" in Albanian, "ammeh" in Persian, "stryjna" (diminutive: "stryjenka") in [[Polish language|Polish]]).

Furthermore, in Persian culture the terms used to describe a person's kinship to their maternal or paternal in-laws bear clear and unambiguous descriptions of that relationship, differentiating the parental in-laws from blood-relatives. For example, there is a specific term describing a person's kinship to the spouse of their paternal uncle (i.e. "zan-amou", literally 'wife-of-' amou). This clarifies that kinship is to the spouse of the person's paternal male sibling, as opposed to a blood-relationship.

=== Irish ===
Uncles and aunts are considered important in modern Irish culture and are usually chosen to be [[Godparent|godfather or godmother]] of children during [[Catholic]] [[baptism]]. A young Irish person might seek the counsel of their favourite aunt or uncle before making an important decision, and the opinion of the respective aunt or uncle is treated seriously.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

== Uncles in popular culture==

Due to the loving image of an old but wise and friendly uncle in many cultures the word has been used as a loving nickname for many people. In [[Tibetan mythology]] [[Akhu Tönpa]] (''Uncle Tompa'') is a familiar and well-beloved figure. The American national personification [[Uncle Sam]] serves as an allegorical fatherly figure to many Americans. Various children's TV hosts have used ''uncle'' as their nickname, including [[Walt Disney]] (''Uncle Walt''), [[Bob Davidse]] (''Nonkel Bob'', literally ''Uncle Bob''), [[Edwin Rutten]] (who hosted a children's show named ''De Show van Ome Willem'' (''The Show of Uncle Willem''). The Dutch poet Ome Ko also used ''uncle'' as part of his pseudonym.

Rich, wise or otherwise eccentric uncles are also popular in works of fiction.

'''William Alfred "Bill" Cook''' (January 27, 1931 – April 15, 2011), an American [[entrepreneur]], [[philanthropist]] and historic preservationist, co-founded the medical equipment manufacturer [[Cook Group]] with his wife [[Gayle Cook]] in 1963. He resided in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] and was one of [[List of richest Americans in history|America's wealthiest men]].&lt;ref name="ibj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/bill-cook-medical-device-magnate-and-philanthropist-dies-at-80/PARAMS/article/26206|title=Bill Cook, medical device magnate and philanthropist, dies at 80|publisher=Indianapolis Business Journal|date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Cook was born in [[Mattoon, Illinois]], and he grew up and graduated from high school in [[Canton, Illinois]] where he was a letterman in football, basketball, and track. He majored in biology at [[Northwestern University]] where he joined [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity and graduated in 1953.&lt;ref name="cookmed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://condolences.cookmedical.com/?page_id=15|title=Condolences: The Passing of Our Founder, William A. Cook|publisher=Cook|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had planned to go on to medical school, but was [[military draft|drafted]] into the [[U.S. Army|army]], where he served his two-year stint as a surgical technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/10/07billionaires_William-Cook_P9MO.html|title=The World's Billionaires: #273 William Cook|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill married Gayle Karch in 1957, and they had a son (now an executive within the Cook Group), Carl, in 1962. In 1963, the Cook family moved to [[Bloomington, Indiana]], where they started the company in their apartment that was eventually to become the Cook Group.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/business/26cook.html|title=Bill Cook, Medical Device Maker, Dies at 80|author=Douglas Martin|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his many contributions to society, Cook was honored with [[honorary degrees]] from Northwestern University, [[Indiana University]], [[Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology]], [[Marian University (Indiana)|Marian College]] (now Marian University), and [[Vincennes University]].&lt;ref name="rfa"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Bill Cook Story: Ready, Fire, Aim! | first=Bob | last=Hammel | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=2009 |url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=84745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cook Group==
Initially making medical devices, including guidewires for catheter angiography, Bill Cook and his wife Gayle started Cook Group in a spare bedroom in their Bloomington, Indiana apartment in 1963.&lt;ref name="founded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cookgroup.com/history/index.html|title=The History of Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt; They collaborated with many of the founders of Interventional Radiology, including Dr. [[Charles Dotter]], to grow Cook, Inc. into the world's largest family-owned medical device manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/taxing-jobs-out-of-existence/2012/05/09/gIQA75D2DU_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;   Notable products included the Spectrum antibiotic-impregnated catheter (Rifamphin/Minocycline); the Gianturco-Roubin coronary stent, the first coronary stent approved for use in the USA; the first paclitaxel-coated [[drug-eluting stent]], the Supra-G, tested in Asia; and the V-Flex, tested in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cook Marketing Communications |url=http://www.cookgroup.com/history/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010124153900/http://www.cookgroup.com/history/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-01-24 |title=COOK® &amp;#124; History &amp; Innovators |publisher=Cookgroup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic preservation==
Cook and his wife Gayle took an interest in [[historic preservation]] projects as business ventures.  The most notable project has been the restoration of the [[West Baden Springs Hotel]] in partnership with [[Indiana Landmarks]].  This project led Cook to take on the development of the [[French Lick Resort Casino]] project in [[Orange County, Indiana]].  In June 2007, Indiana Landmarks unveiled an award, to be called the "Cook Cup," for outstanding individual contributions to historic preservation in Indiana.   Also in 2007 Bill, his wife Gayle and son Carl provided the funds to restore [[Beck's Mill]] at [[Salem, Indiana]]. In April, 2010, Indiana Landmarks announced a $7-million pledge from the Cooks to restore the former Central Avenue Methodist Church in Indianapolis as a performance venue and new state headquarters for Landmarks now known as the Indiana Landmarks Center. From  early 2009 he worked to build up and preserve the downtown area of his hometown, Canton, Illinois, also building a factory and new hotel there, with plans to build a second factory.&lt;ref name="rfa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wthr.com/story/14468657/billionaire-bill-cook-leaves-historic-legacy |title=Billionaire Bill Cook leaves historic legacy - 13 WTHR Indianapolis |publisher=Wthr.com |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Star of Indiana and ''Blast!''==
In 1985, Bill Cook began a [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum &amp; bugle corps]] known as the [[Star of Indiana]]. He not only provided the $1 million in seed money necessary to start the corps, but he also often helped drive the [[coach (bus)|coach buses]] that transported the corps around the U.S and Canada on summer tour. Unlike most drum corps, Star of Indiana was run as a business venture, and, in that respect, served as a model for the corps that remain in active competition today. Star of Indiana made DCI finals in every year of competition, and won the [[Drum Corps International]] Division I World Championship in 1991 and placed no lower than third from 1990 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Drum &amp; Bugle Corps, Vol. 2; Steve Vickers, ed.; ''Drum Corps World''; 2003&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1993 season, Cook and Star of Indiana left DCI and began touring as Brass Theater before debuting the show ''[[Blast! (musical)|Blast!]]'' at the London Apollo Theatre in [[Hammersmith]].  The show opened in the United States in 2000 and moved to Broadway in 2001.  It won the 2001 [[Tony Award]] for "Best Special Theatrical Event"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0881145.html |title=Private Tutor |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=2001-06-03 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also won the 2001 [[Emmy Award]] for "Best Choreography." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Emmy_Awards/2001 Primetime Emmy Awards (2001)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indiana University==
Although a graduate of Northwestern University, Bill Cook developed an attachment to Indiana University (IU), located in his adopted hometown of [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]. Cook and his wife, Gayle, were ardent supporters of IU's [[Jacobs School of Music]] and the school's renowned music library is named in their honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/18275.html |title=The Jacobs School of Music remembers Bill Cook: IU News Room: Indiana University |publisher=Newsinfo.iu.edu |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the Cooks designated a $1 million gift to honor IU Foundation President Bill Armstrong and his wife, Martha Lea; this gift was used to fund the Martha Lea and Bill Armstrong Teacher Educators, which allows a group of Indiana public school teachers to advance their professional development by working with IU faculty and education students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/18346.html |title=Eight outstanding Indiana teachers make up new Armstrong Teacher Educators: IU News Room: Indiana University |publisher=Newsinfo.iu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, IU's Kelley School of Business presented the Cooks with the William L.

==Wealth==
Bill Cook was the richest man in the state of Indiana. In 2008, he was worth around $5 billion, according to the [[Forbes 400|''Forbes'' 400]].

[[Image:Flag of the Orange Order.svg|thumb|alt=Flag of the Orange Order|upright|The purple star of the Williamite army is part of the [[flag of the Orange Order]]]]
A '''Williamite''' is a follower of King [[William III of England]] who deposed King [[James II of England|James II]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]]. William, the [[Stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic]], replaced James with the support of English [[British Whig Party|Whigs]]. 

One of William's aims was to ensure England's entry into his [[League of Augsburg]] against France in the [[Nine Years War]]. For Williamites in England, Scotland and Ireland, William was seen as the guarantor of civil and religious liberty and the Protestant monarchy against Catholic [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]]. 

The term "Williamite" is also commonly used to refer to William's multi-national army in Ireland during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], 1689-91. In Ireland itself, William was primarily supported by Protestants {{cn|date=May 2016}} and opposed by the native{{cn|date=May 2016}} and Anglo-Irish Catholic [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] who supported James. Once James II had come to the throne in 1685, he had his [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Viceroy]] [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnell]] replace Protestants with Catholics in the government. The [[Royal Irish Army]] was purged of Protestants, who were replaced by Catholic officers and soldiers. The [[Irish Militia]] was disarmed and its weapons issued to Catholics.

In response in 1689 Irish Protestants formed their own [[Army of the North (Ireland)|Army of the North]], proclaimed William of Orange to be King, and began seizing strongholds around [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and particularly in Ulster. However the Jacobite Irish Army was able to re-establish control [[Capture of Bandon|taking Bandon]] and routing the Army of the North during the [[Break of Dromore]]. Before long only [[Derry]] and [[Enniskillen]] still held out.

After these early setbacks, Williamite forces won a series of victories during the war [[Siege of Derry|defending Derry]] and [[Siege of Carrickfergus|capturing Carrickfergus]] in 1689. Subsequent battles at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] and [[Battle of Aughrim]] led to a [[Siege of Limerick (1691)|decisive victory at Limerick]] by 1691. William himself led his forces at the Boyne in 1690, which was widely commemorated in paintings such as [[Benjamin West]]'s ''[[The Battle of the Boyne (painting)|The Battle of the Boyne]]''. He is still depicted in the iconography of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]], whose name comes from William's dynasty, the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].

[[Image:Stoke in Herefordshire Vit Brit.jpg|thumb|left|Stoke House (1695) in ''[[Vitruvius Britannicus]]'' I (1715)]]
"Williamite" is sometimes applied to Late Stuart [[English country house|country house]] architecture built ''c'' 1690 - 1710 in the conservative classicising English tradition that had been established under Charles II by [[Hugh May]] and Sir [[Christopher Wren]], of which [[Belton House]], Lincolnshire, and, formerly [[Stoke Edith House|Stoke Edith]], Herefordshire&lt;ref&gt;Stoke Edith was referred to as an example of "the standard seventeenth-century product (the [[Hugh May]] type)" by Sir [[John Summerson]], ''Architecture in Britain 1530 to 1830'', 1985:192.&lt;/ref&gt; are typical examples. Such compact houses do not fit easily within the conventions of [[English Baroque|English baroque architecture]].

The "Williamite Purple Star" is up to the present part of the flag of the [[Orange Order]] in [[Northern Ireland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2057">The '''Women's Classical Caucus''', Inc. ('''WCC''') is an affiliate of the [[American Philological Association]], the organization for North American scholars and teachers of Greek and Latin language, literature, and culture (known as "classicists"), Greek and Roman historians, and scholars of ancient philosophy, science, material culture, [[papyrology]], [[epigraphy]], and other fields.  The WCC also maintains liaisons with the [[American Institute of Archaeology]] and with Lambda, formerly the Lesbian and Gay Classical Caucus.

== History, Membership, Goals ==
The WCC is a not-for-profit group founded in 1972 and incorporated in 1992; membership is open to men as well as women.  University professors and graduate students make up the majority of its members, but membership includes high school teachers, independent scholars, college students, and retired academics.   According to its website, the group's goals are both scholarly and professional. It seeks to incorporate feminist perspectives in the study and teaching of ancient [[Mediterranean culture]]s, particularly the study of women in classical antiquity.  It also strives to advance the goals of equality and diversity within the profession of Classics, to foster supportive professional relationships among classicists concerned with questions of gender, and to forge links with feminist scholars in other disciplines.  The WCC also publishes ''Cloelia'', an annual newsletter.

Its Steering Committee meets each year at the APA Annual Meeting, when the group also hosts 
get-togethers for graduate students and a Business Meeting open to all members.
