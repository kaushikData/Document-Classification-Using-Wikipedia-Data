The '''2008 Yevpatoria gas explosion''' took place on December 24, 2008 with an explosion in an apartment block in [[Yevpatoria]], a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Black Sea]] resort town. Within hours, the death toll stood at 22 with 10 missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nabou.com/cgi-bin/newsframe/437892yks4328903Dnabou2BInews421789994asgw3798etys6787/18A8047A97056E4D9B2CDA039BFF5E58backheadline3DHow2Bdo2BI2Bcut2Ba2Boout3Fnews26o3D0/FrameIt.cgi?Url=http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?r1746091356n news.nabou]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 26 the total number of deaths was 27 people. [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] declared December 26 to be a day of national mourning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/3910/ Death toll of Crimean blast reaches 27, says Emergencies Ministry], [[Interfax|Interfax-Ukraine]] (December 26, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/171480.html Friday Declared Mourning Day In Ukraine For Victims Of Yevpatoria Gas Explosion] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913213556/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/171480.html |date=2012-09-13 }}, Ukrainian News Agency (December 26, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/12/26/ukraine.explosions.death.toll/ 27 dead after Ukrainian apartment blast], [[CNN]] (December 26, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government reaction==
On 27 December 2008 the [[Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers]] ordered the central government agencies and the Yevpatoria administration to provide the victims of the blast and the families of those killed with new housing and all financial compensations they are entitled to by January 1, 2009. The Education and Science Ministry has been instructed to make sure that the children from the families who suffered from the incident be provided with free school instruction.

The government also ordered that tougher control measures be taken in the gas supply industry to prevent new accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/4012/ Ukrainian Cabinet issues instructions to deal with Yevpatoria apartment block blast aftermath], [[Interfax|Interfax-Ukraine]] (27 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Pestering Journey''''' is a [[documentary film]] directed by K.R. Manoj. A voyage through two similar [[pesticide]] tragedies in post independent India, Pestering Journey interrogates the legitimate forms and technologies of killing available in a culture. In an atypical move it challenges and changes the idioms of pesticide and genocide. It is a journey which takes a pestering turn and blurs the boundaries of nature and culture, of self and other, of life and death and many other comfortable binaries.

The 1983 exercise introduced several new elements not seen in previous years, including a new, unique format of coded communication, [[radio silence]]s, and the participation of [[head of government|heads of government]].  This increase in realism, combined with [[Cold War (1979–1985)|deteriorating relations]] between the United States and the Soviet Union and the anticipated arrival of [[Pershing II]] nuclear missiles in Europe, led some members of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Politburo]] and military to believe that Able Archer 83 was a [[ruse of war]], obscuring preparations for a genuine nuclear [[first strike]].&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov's Instructions'', 85–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fischer Reversal 123,31"&gt;Beth Fischer, ''Reagan Reversal'', 123, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pry Scare 37–9"&gt;Pry, ''War Scare'', 37–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Soviets readied their nuclear forces and placed air units in [[East Germany]] and [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Poland]] on alert.&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorfer, ''A New Era'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SNIE 84"&gt;''SNIE 11–10–84'' "Implications of Recent Soviet Military-Political Activities" Central Intelligence Agency, May 18, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent threat of nuclear war ended with the conclusion of the exercise on November 11.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov’s Instructions'', 87–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pry Scare 43–4"&gt;Pry, ''War Scare'', 43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/nordland/fylkesleksikon/index.php/And%C3%B8yrakett_satte_Russland_i_krigsberedskap|title=

Historians such as Thomas Blanton, Director of the [[National Security Archive]], and [[Tom Nichols (academic)|Tom Nichols]], a professor at the [[Naval War College]], have since argued that Able Archer 83 was one of the times when the world has come closest to [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] since the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="Blanton"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://wee.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/world/europe/nato-war-games-unwittingly-put-soviets-and-us-on-hair-trigger-in-83-analysis-suggests.html |last=Roberts |first=Sam |title=NATO War Games Unwittingly Put Soviets and U.S. on ‘Hair Trigger’ in ’83, Analysis Suggests |publisher=New York Times |date=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/five-ways-nuclear-armageddon-was-almost-unleashed-11044?page=3 |last=Nichols |first=Tom |title=Five Ways Nuclear Armageddon Was Almost Unleashed |publisher=The National Interest |date=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other incidents that also brought the world close to such a war include the [[1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident|Soviet nuclear false alarm incident]] that occurred a month earlier and the [[Norwegian rocket incident]] of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =[[John Lewis Gaddis]] |author2=John Hashimoto |title=Cold War Chat: Professor John Lewis Gaddis, Historian |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/guides/debate/chats/gaddis|work=CNN |accessdate=29 December 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901185224/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/guides/debate/chats/gaddis/|archivedate=September 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude to NATO exercise==

=== Operation RYaN ===
{{Main article|Operation RYaN}}

[[File:KGB Report on 1981.jpg|thumb|right|A KGB report from 1981 reporting that the KGB had "implemented measures to strengthen intelligence work in order to prevent a possible sudden outbreak of war by the enemy." To do this, the KGB "actively obtained information on military and strategic issues, and the aggressive military and political plans of imperialism [the United States] and its accomplices," and "enhanced the relevance and effectiveness of its active intelligence abilities." (from the [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB426 National Security Archive]).]]

The greatest catalyst to the Able Archer war scare occurred more than two years earlier. In a May 1981 closed-session meeting of senior [[KGB]] officers and Soviet leaders, [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and KGB chairman [[Yuri Andropov]] bluntly announced that the [[United States]] was preparing a secret nuclear attack on the [[USSR]].&lt;ref name="Fischer Conundrum RYANII" /&gt;

To combat this threat, Andropov announced, the KGB and [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU military foreign intelligence arm]] would begin ''Operation RYaN''. RYaN (РЯН) was a Russian acronym for "Nuclear Missile Attack" (Ракетное Ядерное Нападение); Operation RYaN was the largest, most comprehensive peacetime [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]-gathering operation in [[Soviet history]]. Agents abroad were charged with monitoring the figures who would decide to launch a nuclear attack, the service and technical personnel who would implement the attack, and the facilities from which the attack would originate. It is possible that the goal of Operation RYaN was to discover the first ''intent'' of a nuclear attack and then preempt it.&lt;ref name="Fischer Conundrum RYANII"&gt;Fischer, Benjamin B (1997). [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-cold-war-conundrum/source.htm#HEADING1-08 ''A Cold War Conundrum: The 1983 Soviet War Scare – Phase II: A New Sense of Urgency''.] CIA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=instruction&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov's Instructions'', 74–6, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact impetus for the implementation of Operation RYaN is not known for sure. [[Oleg Gordievsky]], the highest-ranking KGB official ever to defect, attributed it to "a potentially lethal combination of Reaganite rhetoric and Soviet paranoia."&lt;ref name=instruction/&gt; Gordievsky conjectured that Brezhnev and Andropov, who "were very, very old-fashioned and easily influenced ... by Communist dogmas", truly believed that an antagonistic [[Ronald Reagan]] would push the [[nuclear button]] and relegate the Soviet Union to the literal "[[ash heap of history]]".&lt;ref name="Fischer Conundrum KGB"&gt;Fischer, "A Cold War Conundrum": [https://www.cia.gov/csi/monograph/coldwar/source.htm#HEADING1-18 Appendix A: RYAN and the Decline of the KGB] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060802003243/https://www.cia.gov/csi/monograph/coldwar/source.htm#HEADING1-18 |date=August 2, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordievsky"&gt;Testimony of Oleg Gordievsky to Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reagan"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ronald |last=Reagan |title=Address to Members of the British Parliament |date=June 8, 1982 |publisher=University of Texas archives |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1982/60882a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Intelligence Agency]] historian [[Benjamin B. Fischer]] lists several concrete occurrences that likely led to the birth of RYaN. The first of these was the use of [[psychological operations]] (PSYOP) that began soon after Reagan took office.

In his report, Fischer also writes that another CIA source was, at least partially, corroborating Gordievsky's reporting. This [[Czechoslovak intelligence]] officer—who worked closely with the KGB on RYaN—"noted that his counterparts were obsessed with the historical parallel between 1941 and 1983. He believed this feeling was almost visceral, not intellectual, and deeply affected Soviet thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB426/docs/3.The%201983%20War%20Scare%20in%20U.S.%20Soviet%20Relations-circa%201996.pdf|title=The 1983 War Scare in US-Soviet Relations|first=Ben B.|last=Fischer|publisher=National Security Archive|accessdate=21 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328151950/http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB426/docs/3.The%201983%20War%20Scare%20in%20U.S.%20Soviet%20Relations-circa%201996.pdf|archivedate=March 28, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological operations ===
[[File:GIUK gap.png|thumb|right|The [[GIUK gap|Greenland–Iceland–United Kingdom (GIUK) gap]] in the North Atlantic.]]
[[Psychological operations]] (PSYOP) by the United States began in mid-February 1981 and continued intermittently until 1983. These included a series of clandestine naval operations that stealthily accessed waters near the [[GIUK gap|Greenland–Iceland–United Kingdom (GIUK) gap]], and the [[Barents Sea|Barents]], [[Norwegian Sea|Norwegian]], [[Black Sea|Black]], and [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seas, demonstrating how close NATO ships could get to critical Soviet military bases. American bombers also flew directly towards Soviet [[airspace]], peeling off at the last moment, sometimes several times per week. These near-penetrations were designed to test Soviet radar vulnerability as well as demonstrate US capabilities in a nuclear war.&lt;ref name="Fischer Conundrum PSYOP"&gt;Peter Schweizer, ''Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy That Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union'' (New York: The Atlantic Monthly Press, 1994), p. 8, as quoted at Fischer, "A Cold War Conundrum" (CIA Centre for the Study of Intelligence, 2007)[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-cold-war-conundrum/source.htm#HEADING1-07]. Retrieved on May 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It really got to them," said Dr. [[William Schneider, Jr.|William Schneider]], [former] [[United States Department of State#Organization|undersecretary of state]] for military assistance and technology, who saw classified "after-action reports" that indicated U.S. flight activity. "They didn't know what it all meant. A squadron would fly straight at Soviet airspace, and other radars would light up and units would go on alert. Then at the last minute the squadron would peel off and return home."&lt;ref name="Fischer Conundrum PSYOP" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== FleetEx '83===
In April 1983, the United States Navy conducted [[FleetEx '83-1]], the largest fleet exercise held to date in the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]].&lt;ref name="Johnson-55"&gt;Johnson, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richelson-385"&gt;Richelson, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; The conglomeration of approximately 40 ships with 23,000 crewmembers and 300 aircraft was arguably one of the most powerful naval armadas ever assembled. U.S. aircraft and ships attempted to provoke the Soviets into reacting, allowing the U.S. [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] to study Soviet radar characteristics, aircraft capabilities, and tactical maneuvers. On April 4 at least six U.S. Navy aircraft flew over [[Zeleny Island]], one of the [[Kurile Islands]]. In retaliation the Soviets ordered an overflight of the [[Aleutian Islands]]. The Soviet Union also issued a formal diplomatic note of protest, which accused the United States of repeated penetrations of Soviet airspace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1902&amp;context=thesesdissertations&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2F%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dfleetex%252083%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D6%26sqi%3D2%26ved%3D0CE0QFjAF%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalscholarship.unlv.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1902%2526context%253Dthesesdissertations%26ei%3Dx09OUJfoFenh4QTYwICwBA%26usg%3DAFQjCNHfeF8YbXtuqsXkw755TiVP19BMXg%26cad%3Drjt#search=%22fleetex%2083%22 ''1983: The most dangerous year'' by Andrew R.

===Korean Air Lines Flight 007===
{{Main article|Korean Air Lines Flight 007}}
On September 1, 1983, the [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] (KAL 007) was shot down by a Soviet interceptor over the [[Sea of Japan]] near [[Moneron Island]] (just west of [[Sakhalin]] island) while flying over prohibited Soviet airspace. All 269 passengers and crew aboard were killed, including Congressman [[Larry McDonald]], a sitting member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from Georgia and President of the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[John Birch Society]].&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;

===Weapons buildup===
From the start, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] adopted a bellicose stance toward the Soviet Union, one that favored seriously constraining Soviet strategic and global military capabilities. The administration's rigorous focus on this objective resulted in the largest peacetime military buildup in the history of the United States. It also ushered in the final major escalation in rhetoric of the Cold War. On June 8, 1982, Reagan, in a speech to the [[British House of Commons]], declared that, "... Freedom and democracy will leave Marxism and Leninism on the ash heap of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagansheritage.org/reagan/html/reagan_panel_pipes.shtml|title=Ash Heap of History: President Reagan’s Westminster Address 20 Years Later - Remarks by Dr. Richard Pipes|work=reagansheritage.org|date=3 June 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111232733/http://www.reagansheritage.org/reagan/html/reagan_panel_pipes.shtml|archivedate=January 11, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 1983, Reagan announced one of the most ambitious and controversial components to this strategy, the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (labeled "Star Wars" by the media and critics). While Reagan portrayed the initiative as a safety net against nuclear war, leaders in the Soviet Union viewed it as a definitive departure from the relative weapons parity of [[détente]] and an [[militarisation of space|escalation of the arms race into space]]. [[Yuri Andropov]], who had become General Secretary following [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] in November 1982, criticised Reagan for "inventing new plans on how to unleash a nuclear war in the best way, with the hope of winning it".&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum Star"&gt;Fischer, ''A Cold War Conundrum'': [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-cold-war-conundrum/source.htm#HEADING1-11 "Star Wars"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pershing II.jpg|thumb|upright|The US [[Pershing II]] missile]]

Despite the Soviet outcry over the Strategic Defense Initiative, the weapons plan that generated the most alarm among the Soviet Union's leadership during Able Archer 83 was NATO's planned deployment of intermediate-range [[Pershing II]] missiles in Western Europe.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Although Able Archer 83 simulated the release of Pershing II missiles for the first time, the missiles themselves were not deployed until November 23, twelve days after the exercise completed (Pry, p. 34)&lt;/ref&gt; These missiles, deployed to counter Soviet [[RSD-10 Pioneer|SS-20]] intermediate-range missiles on the USSR's western border, represented a major threat to the Soviets. The Pershing II was capable of destroying Soviet "hard targets" such as underground [[missile silo]]s and command and control [[bunker]]s.&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum RYANII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov’s Instructions'', 74–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "White 1983 25–9"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Andrew |last=White |title=Symbols of War: Pershing II and Cruise Missiles in Europe |location=London |publisher=Merlin Press |year=1983 |pages=25–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missiles could be emplaced in and launched from any surveyed site in minutes, and because the [[guidance system]] was self-correcting, the missile system possessed a genuine "[[first strike]] capability". Furthermore, it was estimated that the missiles (deployed in [[West Germany]]) could reach targets in the western Soviet Union within four to six minutes of their launch.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} These capabilities led Soviet leaders to believe that the only way to survive a Pershing II strike was to [[Preemptive war|preempt]] it. This fear of an undetected Pershing II attack, according to CIA historian Benjamin B. Fischer, was explicitly linked to the mandate of Operation RYaN: to detect a decision by the United States to launch a nuclear attack and to preempt it.&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum RYANII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White 1983 25–9"/&gt;

===False alarm from the Soviet early missile warning system===
{{main article|1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident}}
On the night of September 26, 1983, the Soviet orbital missile early warning system (SPRN), code-named [[Oko]], reported a single intercontinental ballistic missile launch from the territory of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Schmalz, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Colonel [[Stanislav Petrov]], who was on duty during the incident, correctly dismissed the warning as a computer error when ground early warning radars did not detect any launches. Part of his reasoning was that the system was new and known to have malfunctioned previously; also, a full-scale nuclear attack from the United States would involve thousands of simultaneous launches, not a single missile.

Later, the system reported four more ICBM launches headed to the Soviet Union, but Petrov again dismissed the reports as false. The investigation that followed revealed that the system indeed malfunctioned and false alarms were caused by a rare alignment of sunlight on high-altitude clouds underneath the satellites' orbits.

==Exercise Able Archer 83==
[[File:Able Archer 83 After Action Report.jpg|thumb|upright| A US Air Force after-action report describes three days of "low spectrum" conventional play followed by two days of "high spectrum nuclear warfare." From the [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB427 National Security Archive].]]

A [[Military exercise|scenario]] released by NATO details the hypothetical lead-up to the Able Archer exercise, which was used by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in Washington D.C. and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB427/docs/6.a.%20Exercise%20Able%20Archer%20SHAPE%20March%202013%20NATO.pdf|title=Exercise ABLE ARCHER 83: Information from SHAPE Historical Files|date=28 March 2013|publisher=National Security Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616095833/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB427/docs/6.a.%20Exercise%20Able%20Archer%20SHAPE%20March%202013%20NATO.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Gregory Pedlow, a SHAPE historian explains the war game:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The exercise scenario began with Orange (the hypothetical opponent) opening hostilities in all regions of [[Allied Command Europe|ACE]] on 4 November (three days before the start of the exercise) and Blue (NATO) declaring a general alert. Orange initiated the use of chemical weapons on 6 November and by the end of that day had used such weapons throughout ACE. All of these events had taken place prior to the start of the exercise and were simply part of the written scenario. There had thus been three days of fighting and a deteriorating situation prior to the start of the exercise. This was desired because—as previously stated—the purpose of the exercise was to test procedures for transitioning from conventional to nuclear operations. As a result of Orange advance, its persistent use of chemical weapons, and its clear intentions to rapidly commit second echelon forces, [[SACEUR#Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)|SACEUR]] requested political guidance on the use of nuclear weapons early on Day 1 of the exercise (7 November 1983)...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB427/docs/6.b.%20Exercise%20Able%20Archer%2083%20SHAPE%20March%202013%20NATO.pdf|title=Exercise Scenario|publisher=National Security Archive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616055025/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB427/docs/6.b.%20Exercise%20Able%20Archer%2083%20SHAPE%20March%202013%20NATO.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, on November 7, 1983, as Soviet intelligence services were attempting to detect the early signs of a nuclear attack, NATO began to simulate one. The exercise, codenamed Able Archer, involved numerous NATO allies and simulated NATO's [[Command and control|Command, Control, and Communications]] (C³) procedures during a nuclear war. Some Soviet leaders, because of the preceding world events and the exercise's particularly realistic nature, feared that the exercise was a cover for an actual attack.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Reagan Reversal'', 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer Conundrum Archer"&gt;Fischer, "A Cold War Conundrum": [https://www.cia.gov/csi/monograph/coldwar/source.htm#HEADING1-13 Able Archer 83] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060802003243/https://www.cia.gov/csi/monograph/coldwar/source.htm#HEADING1-13 |date=August 2, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A KGB telegram of February 17 described one likely scenario:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In view of the fact that the measures involved in State Orange [a nuclear attack within 36 hours] have to be carried out with the utmost secrecy (under the guise of maneuvers, training etc) in the shortest possible time, without disclosing the content of operational plans, it is highly probable that the battle alarm system may be used to prepare a surprise RYaN [nuclear attack] in peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov's Instructions'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also on February 17, KGB Permanent Operational Assignment assigned its agents to monitor several possible indicators of a nuclear attack. These included actions by "A cadre of people associated with preparing and implementing decision about RYaN, and also a group of people, including service and technical personnel&amp;nbsp;... those working in the operating services of installations connected with processing and implementing the decision about RYaN, and communication staff involved in the operation and interaction of these installations."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov’s Instructions'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SS20 irbm.jpg|thumb|right|A Soviet [[SS-20]] missile]]

Because Able Archer 83 simulated an actual release, it is likely that the service and technical personnel mentioned in the memo were active in the exercise. More conspicuously, British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] participated (though not concurrently) in the nuclear drill. United States President Reagan, Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]], and Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]] were also intended to participate. [[Robert McFarlane]], who had assumed the position of [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] just two weeks earlier, realized the implications of such participation early in the exercise's planning and rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorfer, ''A New Era'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another illusory indicator likely noticed by Soviet analysts was a high rate of [[encryption|ciphered]] communications between the United Kingdom and the United States. Soviet intelligence was informed that "so-called nuclear consultations in NATO are probably one of the stages of immediate preparation by the adversary for RYaN".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov's Instructions'', 76.&lt;/ref&gt; To the Soviet analysts, this burst of secret communications between the United States and the UK one month before the beginning of Able Archer may have appeared to be this "consultation". In reality, the burst of communication was about the US [[invasion of Grenada]] on October 25, 1983, which caused a great deal of diplomatic traffic as the sovereign of the island was [[Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Martin |last=Walker |title=The Cold War: A History |location=New York |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |year=1993 |page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further startling aspect reported by KGB agents concerned the NATO communications used during the exercise. According to Moscow Centre's February 17 memo,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It [is] of the highest importance to keep a watch on the functioning of communications networks and systems since through them information is passed about the adversary's intentions and, above all, about his plans to use nuclear weapons and practical implementation of these. In addition, changes in the method of operating communications systems and the level of manning may in themselves indicate the state of preparation for RYaN.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov's Instructions'', 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soviet intelligence appeared to substantiate these suspicions by reporting that NATO was indeed using unique, never-before-seen procedures as well as message formats more sophisticated than previous exercises, which possibly indicated the proximity of nuclear attack.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''KGB'', 599–600.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, during Able Archer 83, NATO forces simulated a move through all alert phases, from [[DEFCON]] 5 to DEFCON 1. While these phases were simulated, alarmist KGB agents mistakenly reported them as actual. According to Soviet intelligence, NATO doctrine stated, "''Operational readiness No. 1'' is declared when there are obvious indications of preparation to begin military operations. It is considered that war is inevitable and may start at any moment."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov’s Instructions'', 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Able Archer Summary.jpg|thumb|right|The unclassified NATO summary of Able Archer 83, kindly provided by SHAPE chief historian Gregory Pedlow, provides a narrative of how the Cold War could have turned nuclear. Image provided by the [http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB427/ National Security Archive].]]

According to a 2013 analysis by the [[National Security Archive]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB427/|title=The 1983 War Scare: "The Last Paroxysm" of the Cold War Part II|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Able Archer controversy has featured numerous descriptions of the exercise as so "routine" that it could not have alarmed the Soviet military and political leadership. Today's posting reveals multiple non-routine elements, including: a 170-flight, radio-silent air lift of 19,000 US soldiers to Europe, the shifting of commands from "Permanent War Headquarters to the Alternate War Headquarters," the practice of "new nuclear weapons release procedures," including consultations with cells in Washington and London, and the "sensitive, political issue" of numerous "slips of the tongue" in which B-52 sorties were referred to as nuclear "strikes." These variations, seen through "the fog of nuclear exercises," did in fact match official Soviet intelligence-defined indicators for "possible operations by the USA and its allies on British territory in preparation for RYaN"—the KGB code name for a feared Western nuclear missile attack.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon learning that U.S. nuclear activity mirrored its hypothesized first strike activity, the Moscow Centre sent its residencies a flash [[telegram]] on November 8 or 9 ([[Oleg Gordievsky]] cannot recall which), incorrectly reporting an alert on American bases and frantically asking for further information regarding an American first strike. The alert precisely coincided with the seven- to ten-day period estimated between NATO's preliminary decision and an actual strike.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''KGB'', 600.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the peak of the war scare.

The Soviet Union, believing its only chance of surviving a NATO strike was to preempt it, readied its nuclear arsenal. The CIA reported activity in the [[Baltic Military District]] and in [[Czechoslovakia]], and it determined that nuclear-capable aircraft in Poland and East Germany were placed "on high alert status with readying of nuclear strike forces".&lt;ref name = "Pry Scare 43–4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gates, ''From the Shadows'', 271, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Former CIA analyst Peter Vincent Pry goes further, saying he suspects that the aircraft were merely the tip of the iceberg. He hypothesizes that—in accordance with Soviet military procedure and history—[[intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] silos, easily readied and difficult for the United States to detect, were also prepared for a launch.&lt;ref&gt;Pry, ''War Scare'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Lt. Gen. [[Leonard H. Perroots]] is credited with the decision not to place NATO forces on increased alert despite increased Soviet readiness, thereby reducing the possibility of a nuclear exchange.&lt;ref name="nsarchive.gwu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb533-The-Able-Archer-War-Scare-Declassified-PFIAB-Report-Released/ |title=The 1983 War Scare Declassified and For Real |website=National Security Archive |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet fears of the attack ended as the Able Archer exercise finished on November 11. Upon learning of the Soviet reaction to Able Archer 83 by way of the [[double agent]] Oleg Gordievsky, a British [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] asset, President Reagan commented, "I don't see how they could believe that—but it's something to think about."&lt;ref name = "Oberdorfer Era 67"&gt;Oberdorfer, ''A New Era'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet reaction==
[[File:Reagan and Gordievsky.jpg|thumb|right|upright|President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Soviet double agent [[Oleg Gordievsky]].]]
The [[double agent]] [[Oleg Gordievsky]], whose highest rank was KGB [[resident (title)|resident]] in London, is the only Soviet source ever to have published an account of Able Archer 83. [[Oleg Kalugin]] and [[Yuri Shvets]], who were KGB officers in 1983, have published accounts that acknowledge Operation RYaN, but they do not mention Able Archer 83.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, "A Cold War Conundrum": [https://www.cia.gov/csi/monograph/coldwar/source.htm#HEADING1-19 Appendix B: The Gordievsky File] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060802003243/https://www.cia.gov/csi/monograph/coldwar/source.htm#HEADING1-19 |date=August 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordievsky and other [[Warsaw Pact]] intelligence agents were extremely skeptical about a NATO first strike, perhaps because of their proximity to, and understanding of, the West.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Nevertheless, agents were ordered to report their observations, not their analysis, and this critical flaw in the Soviet intelligence system—coined by Gordievsky as the "[[intelligence cycle]]"—fed the fear of US nuclear aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov’s Instructions'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/reviews/190618/dicicco-jones-able-archer-83-secret-history-nato-exercise-almost |publisher=[[H-Net]] |title=DiCicco on Jones, 'Able Archer 83: The Secret History of the NATO Exercise That Almost Triggered Nuclear War' |first=Jonathan M. |last=DiCico |date=August 2017 |quote=Trapped in an intelligence cycle that reinforced fears of susceptibility to surprise nuclear attack, Soviet leaders took steps toward an anticipatory counterattack.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Sergei Akhromeyev]], who at the time was chief of the main operations directorate of the Soviet General Staff, told [[Cold War]] historian Don Orbendorfer that he had never heard of Able Archer. The lack of public Soviet response over Able Archer 83 has led some historians, including [[Fritz W. Ermarth]] in his piece, "Observations on the 'War Scare' of 1983 From an Intelligence Perch", to conclude that the Soviet Union did not see Able Archer 83 as posing an immediate threat to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Ermarth"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_17/texts/ermarth.pdf |format=PDF |date=November 11, 2003 |accessdate=May 21, 2006 |title=Observations on the ‘War Scare’ of 1983 From an Intelligence Perch |first=Fritz W. |last=Ermarth |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724160027/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_17/texts/ermarth.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2006 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American reaction==
In May 1984, CIA Russian specialist Ethan J. Done drafted "Implications of Recent Soviet Military-Political Activities", which concluded: "we believe strongly that Soviet actions are not inspired by, and Soviet leaders do not perceive, a genuine danger of imminent conflict with the United States."&lt;ref name = "SNIE 84"/&gt; [[Robert Gates]], Deputy Director for Intelligence during Able Archer 83, has published thoughts on the exercise that dispute this conclusion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Information about the peculiar and remarkably skewed frame of mind of the Soviet leaders during those times that has emerged since the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Yeltsin and the dissolution of the USSR|collapse of the Soviet Union]] makes me think there is a good chance—with all of the other events in 1983—that they really felt a NATO attack was at least possible and that they took a number of measures to enhance their military readiness short of mobilization. After going through the experience at the time, then through the postmortems, and now through the documents, I don't think the Soviets were crying wolf. They may not have believed a NATO attack was imminent in November 1983, but they did seem to believe that the situation was very dangerous. And US intelligence [SNIE 11–9-84 and SNIE 11–10–84] had failed to grasp the true extent of their anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, ''From the Shadows'', 273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:1983 Memo on US Soviet Tension.jpg|thumb|right|A memorandum from Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey to President Reagan and other Cabinet-level officials after Able Archer 83 warning of a "rather stunning array of indicators" showing that "The [Soviet] military behaviors we have observed involve high military costs ... adding thereby a dimension of genuineness to the Soviet expressions of concern that is often not reflected in intelligence issuances." From the [http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB428 National Security Archive].]]

A report written by Nina Stewart for the President's Foreign Advisory Board concurs with Gates and refutes the previous CIA reports, concluding that further analysis shows that the Soviets were, in fact, genuinely fearful of US aggression. The decision of Gen. Perroots was described as "fortuitous," noting "[he] acted correctly out of instinct, not informed guidance," suggesting that had the depth of Soviet fear been fully realized, NATO may have responded differently.&lt;ref name="nsarchive.gwu.edu"/&gt;

Some historians, including Beth A. Fischer in her book ''The Reagan Reversal'', pin Able Archer 83 as profoundly affecting President Reagan and his turn from a policy of confrontation towards the Soviet Union to a policy of [[rapprochement]]. The thoughts of Reagan and those around him provide important insight upon the nuclear scare and its subsequent ripples. On October 10, 1983, just over a month before Able Archer 83, President Reagan viewed a television film about [[Lawrence, Kansas]], being destroyed by a nuclear attack titled ''[[The Day After]]''. In his diary, the president wrote that the film "left me greatly depressed".&lt;ref name = "Reagan Life 585"&gt;Reagan, ''An American Life'', 585.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in October, Reagan attended a Pentagon briefing on nuclear war. During his first two years in office, he had refused to take part in such briefings, feeling it irrelevant to rehearse a nuclear apocalypse; finally, he consented to the Pentagon official requests. According to officials present, the briefing "chastened" Reagan. Weinberg said, "[Reagan] had a very deep revulsion to the whole idea of nuclear weapons&amp;nbsp;... These war games brought home to anybody the fantastically horrible events that would surround such a scenario." Reagan described the briefing in his own words: "A most sobering experience with &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Caspar Weinberger]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and [[John William Vessey Jr.|Gen. Vessey]] in the [[White House Situation Room|Situation Room]], a briefing on our complete plan in the event of a nuclear attack."&lt;ref name = "Reagan Life 585"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Reagan Reversal'', 120–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two glimpses of nuclear war primed Reagan for Able Archer 83, giving him a very specific picture of what would occur had the situation further developed. After receiving intelligence reports from sources including Gordievsky, it was clear that the Soviets were unnerved. While officials were concerned with the Soviet panic, they were hesitant about believing the proximity of a Soviet attack. Secretary of State [[George P. Shultz]] thought it "incredible, at least to us" that the Soviets would believe the US would launch a genuine attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shultz |first=George P |title=Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner’s Sons |year=1993 |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Reagan did not share the secretary's belief that cooler heads would prevail, writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We had many contingency plans for responding to a nuclear attack. But everything would happen so fast that I wondered how much planning or reason could be applied in such a crisis... Six minutes to decide how to respond to a blip on a radar scope and decide whether to unleash [[Armageddon]]! How could anyone apply reason at a time like that?&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, ''An American Life'', 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to McFarlane, the president responded with "genuine anxiety" in disbelief that a regular NATO exercise could have led to an armed attack. To the ailing [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]—led from the deathbed of the terminally ill Andropov, a man with no firsthand knowledge of the United States, and the creator of Operation RYaN—it seemed "that the United States was preparing to launch ... a sudden nuclear attack on the Soviet Union".&lt;ref name = "Gordievsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Stewart"&gt;Nina Stewart, in a report to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, 1990, as cited in Oberdorfer, ''A New Era'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Reagan Reversal'', 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Reagan, without specifically mentioning Able Archer 83, wrote of a 1983 realization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Three years had taught me something surprising about the Russians: Many people at the top of the Soviet hierarchy were genuinely afraid of America and Americans. Perhaps this shouldn't have surprised me, but it did...During my first years in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], I think many of us in the administration took it for granted that the Russians, like ourselves, considered it unthinkable that the United States would launch a [[first strike]] against them. But the more experience I had with Soviet leaders and other heads of state who knew them, the more I began to realize that many Soviet officials feared us not only as adversaries but as potential aggressors who might hurl nuclear weapons at them in a first strike...Well, if that was the case, I was even more anxious to get a top Soviet leader in a room alone and try to convince him we had no designs on the Soviet Union and Russians had nothing to fear from us."&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, ''An American Life'', 585, 588–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Alliance to Save Energy''' is a coalition consisting largely of industrial, technological, and energy corporations. The Alliance states that its mission is to "support [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] as a cost-effective energy resource under existing market conditions and advocate energy-efficiency policies that minimize costs to society and individual consumers, and that lessen [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and their impact on the global climate." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ase.org/section/aboutus/ |title=Alliance to Save Energy - Promoting Energy Efficiency World Wide: About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810193915/http://www.ase.org/section/aboutus |archive-date=2006-08-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance's chief activities include [[public relations]], research, and [[lobbying]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Alliance+to+Save+Energy&amp;year=2008 Lobbying Spending Database: Agencies lobbied for by Alliance to Save Energy, 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to change [[energy policy of the United States|U.S. energy policy]].

The creation of the Alliance was announced on February 10, 1977 with the support of the then U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jimmy Carter|title=Alliance To Save Energy Statement on the Formation of the Organization|date=February 10, 1977|work=The American Presidency Project|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7744|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the initiative of senators [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]] and Hubert Humphrey.

==Member organizations==
The alliance includes over 170 organizations committed to energy efficiency as a primary way to achieve the nation's environmental, economic, energy security and affordable housing goals.

== Support of Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ==
In 2007, Alliance to Save Energy came out in support of the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ase.org/content/news/detail/3856 |title=Alliance to Save Energy - Promoting Energy Efficiency World Wide: News: Alliance to Save Energy Hails Efficiency-Focused Senate Energy Bill, But Laments Lack of Tax Incentives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706145227/http://www.ase.org/content/news/detail/3856 |archive-date=2007-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071219/GPG03/712190540/1247/GPGbusiness Green Bay Press-Gazette - Congress' energy bill phasing out traditional light bulbs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/business/14light.html | work=The New York Times | first=Matthew L. | last=Wald | title=A U.S. Alliance to Update the Light Bulb | date=14 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Banning of incandescent lightbulbs|phases out]] the use of inefficient forms of [[incandescent light bulb]]s in favor of more energy-efficient lights, such as CFL, halogen incandescents, and LED lights. The purchase price of more efficient lights is typically higher than the purchase price of legacy incandescents. However, the low energy consumption and long life span of high-efficiency lights result in lower [[Life cycle assessment|life-cycle costs]] than their legacy incandescent counterparts. Several of the founding member corporations (including [[Philips]], [[Panasonic]], and [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]]) are manufacturers of high-efficiency bulbs. However, all of these corporations are also manufacturers of the incandescent light bulbs that were phased out of production following passage of the Clean Energy Bill of 2007.

== CarbonCount ==
CarbonCount is a metric developed by the Alliance to Save Energy that quantifies the impact of investments in U.S.-based energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects given the expected reduction in carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions resulting from each $1,000 of investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ase.org/resources/carboncounttm-quantitative-carbon-scoring-system-green-bonds|title=CarbonCount™: Quantitative Carbon Scoring System for "Green" Bonds|date=2015-03-30|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Bloomberg New Energy Finance honored CarbonCount with its Finance for Resilience (FiRE) award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financeforresilience.com/finalists-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;  FiRE is an open and action-oriented platform that collects, develops and helps implement powerful ideas to accelerate finance for clean energy, climate, sustainability and green growth.  FiRe singles out ideas that have the potential for incremental finance of at least $1bn in clean energy in the first three years of implementation, that are achievable within 1–3 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financeforresilience.com/us/&lt;/ref&gt; Hannon Armstrong's 2015 issuance of Sustainable Yield Bonds secured by a portion of its utility scale solar and wind real estate related assets was the first investment to be certified under the CarbonCount methodology, receiving a CarbonCount score of 0.39 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; offset per $1000 of investment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ase.org/news/alliance-issues-inaugural-carboncounttm-certification&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://investors.hannonarmstrong.com/file.aspx?IID=4376922&amp;FID=31284549&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Deutsche Bank received a CarbonCount score of  0.18 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; offset per $1000 of investment in a portfolio of rooftop solar PV systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ase.org/news/alliance-save-energys-carboncounttm-scoring-tool-brings-transparency-green-bond-market&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The Alliance to Save Energy supported the bill [[To require the Secretary of Energy to prepare a report on the impact of thermal insulation on both energy and water use for potable hot water (H.R. 4801; 113th Congress)]], which would require the [[United States Secretary of Energy]] to prepare a report on the effects that [[thermal insulation]] has on both energy consumption and systems for providing [[potable water]] in [[:Category:Buildings of the United States government|federal buildings]].&lt;ref name=cbo4801&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4801|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45466|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called the bill a step "in the right direction" and saying that they "are hopeful energy efficiency can once again be an area of common ground between parties."&lt;ref name=ASEcommitteepass&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaFreniere|first1=Kelsey|title=Alliance Vice-Chair Rep.

They supported the [[EPS Service Parts Act of 2014 (H.R. 5057; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would exempt certain [[external power supply|external power supplies]] from complying with standards set forth in a final rule published by the [[United States Department of Energy]] in February 2014.&lt;ref name=cbo5057&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 5057|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45574|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ITIhankin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hankin|first1=Christopher|title=House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee passes bipartisan regulatory relief for external power supplies|url=http://blog.itic.org/blog/house-energy-commerce-committee-passes-bipartisan-regulatory-relief-for-external-power-supplies|publisher=Information Technology Industry Council|accessdate=10 September 2014|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] describes the bill as a bill that "provides regulatory relief by making a simple technical correction to the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007|2007 Energy Independence and Security Act]] to exempt certain power supply (EPS) service and spare parts from federal efficiency standards."&lt;ref name=ECCpr&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee to Build on #RecordOfSuccess with Nine Bills On the House Floor This Week|url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/committee-build-recordofsuccess-nine-bills-house-floor-week|publisher=House Energy and Commerce Committee|accessdate=10 September 2014|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Board of directors ==

The board includes CEOs, presidents and senior executives of companies, associations, consumer and environmental organizations, as well as officials from state government, universities and law firms.

The first board of directors and board of advisors were chaired by Senator Percy and [[Henry A. Kissinger]], respectively. Honorary chairmen included Senators [[Daniel J. Evans]], [[H. John Heinz III]] and [[Timothy E. Wirth]].

The current{{When |date= June 2013}} board is chaired by Senator [[Mark Warner]] (D-VA) and co-chaired by Tom King, President of [[National Grid USA]].  Congressional vice-chairs include Senators [[Jeff Bingaman]] (D-NM), [[Susan M. Collins]] (R-ME), [[Chris Coons]] (D-DE), [[Richard Lugar]] (R–IN), [[Lisa Murkowski]] (R–AK), [[Rob Portman]] (R-OH), [[Mark Pryor]] (D-AR.), [[Jeanne Shaheen]] (D-NH), [[Mark Udall]] (D–CO).

'''The Association of Power Producers of Ontario''' (abbreviated '''APPrO''') is a trade and professional body representing commercial electricity generators in Ontario, and the largest organization of its type in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;See list of other power producer organizations in Canada in the section titled "Links to other power producer organizations"&lt;/ref&gt; APPrO was established in 1986 as the Independent Power Producers' Society of Ontario (IPPSO) and changed its name to APPrO in 2003. It projects a unified voice of advocacy for Ontario-based generators of all types, addressing a range of public policy and regulatory issues of concern to the power industry. The organization also operates industry conferences and produces a number of publications, both hardcopy and electronic. The APPrO conference is the largest annual event of its type in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;It is in fact the only annual conference covering all types of generation in Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; and its magazine, IPPSO FACTO, is considered by many in the industry to be one of the most authoritative periodicals on electricity business and policy issues in Canada.

APPrO currently has about 100 corporate members including some of the most well-known names in the Canadian power business such as [[TransCanada Corporation]], [[Bruce Power]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20090708034701/http://www.brookfieldpower.com/ Brookfield Renewable Power], along with many lesser-known companies. APPrO members produce electricity from a range of sources including [[Natural gas#Power generation|natural gas]], [[hydroelectricity]] (waterpower), [[cogeneration]], [[windpower]], [[solar energy]], [[biomass]] (wood waste), [[biogas]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]],  and other sources.

The organization has been a leading advocate for public policies and regulatory treatments that it believes would facilitate the development of power generation in the province and assist in the development of a more open and competitive market for power.

APPrO's mission statement cites the following as its top objective: The achievement of an economically and environmentally sustainable electricity sector in Ontario that supports the business interests of electricity generators including a reasonable rate of return.
 
APPrO's current advocacy work is focused on regulatory and policy issues affecting generators in Ontario including electricity market rules, power procurement processes, the regulation of the natural gas market, both provincially and federally, climate change rules and compliance mechanisms, approval requirements, transmission development, [[distributed generation]], and a number of other issues.

== Structure and history ==

APPrO has frequently put forward the view that the greatest benefits for consumers of electricity are likely to be achieved through the development of open and competitive markets for the production of electricity. Since it was established in 1986, APPrO has been one of the most vocal and consistent advocates for increasing the use of renewable energy in Ontario. Originally incorporated as the Independent Power Producers' Society of Ontario, the organization grew in scale and scope during the 1990s.

APPrO's predecessor IPPSO was one of the forces that helped convince the Ontario government to end the near-monopoly status of the former Ontario Hydro and introduce a competitive wholesale market for electricity in the province.
 
The organization is governed by a Board of 28 directors, and is operated on a day-to-day basis by a President, an Executive Director and support staff. 14 of the directors are appointed as direct representatives of major generator members or staff, and the remainder are elected from various categories of APPrO members. The first full-time (and current) president of APPrO is David Butters. The Executive Director is Jake Brooks.

APPrO describes its role as one in which it has "raised awareness and understanding of its members' concerns with senior decision-makers in government, regulatory bodies and the public at large." One of its publications says "Through its consistent record of insightful and constructive input, top-notch spokespeople, landmark conferences and widely respected publications, APPrO has earned status as a key stakeholder in Ontario's energy sector that ensures it will be consulted on any major developments of concern." APPrO has formally intervened in a large number of public hearings and policy development consultations.

Over the years, APPrO's efforts have affected important decisions in the areas of ramp rates, natural gas supply services, net load billing for network transmission services, market design, and large number of technical rules and procedures. APPrO has worked closely with the Ontario government to ensure that the concerns and perspectives of its members are reflected in the contracting process for various procurement processes. APPrO says it intends to continue to advocate for "fair access to the market for all generators, reasonable terms for interconnection to the electric grid, a more efficient system in the future, and lower costs for all users of the electric system in Ontario."

== Positions and principles ==

A vision statement released by APPrO in 2006 cited the following as among its goals and as its "preferred direction for evolution of the electricity sector":

Goals for Evolution of the Electricity Sector:

* Encourage efficient and timely investment in Ontario's power system to ensure adequacy and reliability.
* Produce the optimal electricity cost for Ontario consumers.

Principles for Evolution:

1. Decisions affecting the power sector should be made on an economically rational basis
&lt;br&gt;
2. Prices should reflect the true cost/value of production.
&lt;br&gt;
3. Robust competition among generators is a critical factor in achieving the optimal electricity cost for Ontario consumers.
&lt;br&gt;
4. Public and private sector entities should compete on a level playing field.
&lt;br&gt;
5. Markets with multiple sellers and buyers are the most effective way to harness the benefits of competition.
&lt;br&gt;
6. Stable and predictable public policy is critical to efficient investment and effective markets.

== The Canadian Power Conference and Trade Show ==

APPrO's annual conference, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013, has become the largest annual event in the Canadian power generation industry.&lt;ref&gt;As above, it is in fact the only annual conference covering all types of generation in Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regularly featuring the Ontario Minister of Energy as a keynote speaker, along with senior executives, regulators, and a range of experts from the provincial and national power sector, it has become a key place for important announcements and for the industry to discuss the critical concerns of the day. The 2014 event attracted nearly 1000 people and featured more than 60 speakers.

The '''Bald Hills Wind Farm''' is an operating [[wind farm]] located approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km south east of [[Tarwin Lower]] in [[South Gippsland]], Victoria, Australia.  The Bald Hills Wind Farm site covers approximately 1,750ha of largely cleared cattle and sheep grazing farmland. The turbines are located in three distinct areas, one to the west and one to the east of Tarwin Lower Waratah Road, and one near the end of Bald Hills Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baldhillswindfarm.com.au/project/location.php Bald Hills Windfarm: ''Location''], retrieved 21 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The Bald Hills Wind Farm has received planning approval from the Victorian Government and approval from the Federal Government under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.  This followed extensive project feasibility studies and Environmental Effects Statements (EESs). The EESs were assessed by an independent panel.

Bald Hills Wind Farm comprises 52 turbines of 2.05 MW capacity each, giving it a total capacity of 106.6 MW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baldhillswindfarm.com.au/project-overview/ Bald Hill Wind Farm: About], retrieved 18 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  It is expected to produce 335,100 MWh of electricity per year, based on the long-term average forecast wind data.  This is the equivalent of meeting the electricity requirements of over 62,000 homes—over four and a half times the homes in the South Gippsland Shire (based on 2006 census data).

Construction of the wind farm commenced in August 2012 and it became fully operational in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baldhillswindfarm.com.au/ Bald Hill Wind Farm], retrieved 18 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Jenni: [http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2014/05/27/4012728.htm "Bald Hill wind farm progresses despite ongoing hurdles"], ABC, 27 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>lot's of strange typos, and slight clarification on type of fusion reactors that use magnetic confinement</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12746">The '''beta''' of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], symbolized by ''β'', is the ratio of the plasma [[pressure]] (''p'' = [[Number density|''n'']] [[Boltzmann's constant|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Temperature|''T'']]) to the [[magnetic pressure]] (''p''&lt;sub&gt;mag&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Magnetic field|''B'']]²/2[[Permeability (electromagnetism)|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]). The term is commonly used in studies of the Sun and Earth's [[magnetic field]], and in the field of [[fusion power]] designs.

In the fusion power field, plasma is often confined using strong magnets. Since the temperature of the fuel scales with pressure, reactors attempt to reach the highest pressures possible. The costs of large magnets roughly scales like ''β&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;''.  Therefore, beta can be thought of as a ratio of money out to money in for a reactor, and beta can be thought of (very approximately) as an economic indicator of reactor efficiency. For [[tokamak|tokamaks]], betas of larger than 0.05 or 5% are desired for economically viable electrical production.

The same term is also used when discussing the interactions of the [[solar wind]] with various magnetic fields. For example, beta in the corona of the Sun is about 0.01.

==Background==
===Fusion basics===
[[Nuclear fusion]] occurs when the [[Nucleus (atomic structure)|nuclei]] of two atoms approach closely enough for the [[nuclear force]] to pull them together into a single larger nucleus. The strong force is opposed by the [[electrostatic force]] created by the positive charge of the nuclei's [[proton]]s, pushing the nuclei apart. The amount of energy that is needed to overcome this repulsion is known as the [[Coulomb barrier]]. The amount of energy released by the fusion reaction when it occurs may be greater or less than the Coulomb barrier. Generally, lighter nuclei with a smaller number of protons and greater number of [[neutron]]s will have the greatest ratio of energy released to energy required, and the majority of [[fusion power]] research focusses on the use of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]], two [[isotope]]s of [[hydrogen]].

Even using these isotopes, the Coulomb barrier is large enough that the nuclei must be given great amounts of energy before they will fuse. Although there are a number of ways to do this, the simplest is to heat the gas mixture, which, according to the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], will result in a small number of particles with the required energy even when the gas as a whole is relatively "cool" compared to the Coulomb barrier energy. In the case of the D-T mixture, rapid fusion will occur when the gas is heated to about 100 million degrees.&lt;ref name=b18&gt;Bromberg, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confinement===
This temperature is well beyond the physical limits of any material container that might contain the gasses, which has led to a number of different approaches to solving this problem. The main approach relies on the nature of the fuel at high temperatures. When the fusion fuel gasses are heated to the temperatures required for rapid fusion, they will be completely [[Ionization|ionized]] into a plasma, a mixture of [[electron]]s and nuclei forming a globally neutral gas. As the particles within the gas are charged, this allows them to be manipulated by electric or magnetic fields. This gives rise to the majority of controlled fusion concepts.

Even if this temperature is reached, the gas will be constantly losing energy to its surroundings (cooling off). This gives rise to the concept of the "confinement time", the amount of time the plasma is maintained at the required temperature. However, the fusion reactions might deposit their energy back into the plasma, heating it back up, which is a function of the density of the plasma. These considerations are combined in the [[Lawson criterion]], or its modern form, the fusion triple product.  In order to be efficient, the rate of fusion energy being deposited into the reactor would ideally be greater than the rate of loss to the surroundings, a condition known as "ignition".

===Magnetic confinement fusion approach===
In [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (MCF) reactor designs, the plasma is confined within a vacuum chamber using a series of magnetic fields. These fields are normally created using a combination of [[electromagnet]]s and [[electrical current]]s running through the plasma itself. Systems using only magnets are generally built using the [[stellarator]] approach, while those using current only are the [[Pinch (plasma physics)|pinch]] machines. The most studied approach since the 1970s is the [[tokamak]], where the fields generated by the external magnets and internal current are roughly equal in magnitude.

In all of these machines, the density of the particles in the plasma is very low, often described as a "poor vacuum". This limits its approach to the triple product along the temperature and time axis. This requires magnetic fields on the order of tens of [[Tesla (unit)|Teslas]], currents in the megaampere, and confinement times on the order of tens of seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jet.efda.org/fusion-basics/conditions-for-a-fusion-reaction/ "Conditions for a fusion reaction"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114032026/http://www.jet.efda.org/fusion-basics/conditions-for-a-fusion-reaction/ |date=January 14, 2011 }}, JET&lt;/ref&gt; Generating currents of this magnitude is relatively simple, and a number of devices from large banks of [[capacitor]]s to [[homopolar generator]]s have been used. However, generating the required magnetic fields is another issue, generally requiring expensive [[superconducting magnet]]s. For any given reactor design, the cost is generally dominated by the cost of the magnets.

==Beta==
Given that the magnets are a dominant factor in reactor design, and that density and temperature combine to produce pressure, the [[Ratio#Notation and terminology|ratio]] of the pressure of the plasma to the magnetic energy density naturally becomes a useful figure of merit when comparing MCF designs. In effect, the ratio illustrates how effectively a design confines its plasma. This ratio, beta, is widely used in the fusion field:

&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{p}{p_{mag}} = \frac{n k_B T}{B^2/(2\mu_0)}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Wesson, J: "Tokamaks", 3rd edition page 115, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is normally measured in terms of the total magnetic field. However, in any real-world design, the strength of the field varies over the volume of the plasma, so to be specific, the average beta is sometimes referred to as the "beta toroidal". In the tokamak design the total field is a combination of the external toroidal field and the current-induced poloidal one, so the "beta poloidal" is sometimes used to compare the relative strengths of these fields. And as the external magnetic field is the driver of reactor cost, "beta external" is used to consider just this contribution.

===Troyon beta limit===
In a [[tokamak]], for a stable plasma, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is always much smaller than 1 (otherwise it would collapse).&lt;ref&gt;Kenrō Miyamoto, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=-tLq4hzVnN8C&amp;pg=PA62 "Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion"], Springer, 2005 , pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, a MCF device would want to have as high beta as possible, as this would imply the minimum amount of magnetic force needed for confinement. In practice, most tokamaks  operate at beta of order 0.01, or 1%. Spherical tokamaks typically operate at beta values an order of magnitude higher. The record was set by the [[Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak|START]] device at 0.4, or 40%.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sykes, [http://www.triam.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ICPP/program/download/12-PL01.pdf "The Development of the Spherical Tokamak"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722072454/http://www.triam.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ICPP/program/download/12-PL01.pdf |date=July 22, 2011 }}, ICPP, Fukuoka September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

These low achievable betas are due to [[plasma instability|instabilities in the plasma]] generated through the interaction of the fields and the motion of the particles due to the induced current. As the amount of current is increased in relation to the external field, these instabilities become uncontrollable. In early pinch experiments the current dominated the field components and the kink and sausage instabilities were common, today collectively referred to as "low-n instabilities". As the relative strength of the external magnetic field is increased, these simple instabilities are damped out, but at a critical field other "high-n instabilities" will invariably appear, notably the [[ballooning mode]]. For any given fusion reactor design, there is a limit to the beta it can sustain. As beta is a measure of economic merit, a practical tokamak based fusion reactor must be able to sustain a beta above some critical value, which is calculated to be around 5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/lc/local/scenario/talks/Goldston_SLAC.ppt "Scientific Progress in Magnetic Fusion, ITER, and the Fusion Development Path"], SLAC Colloquium, 21 April 2003, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1980s the understanding of the high-n instabilities grew considerably. Shafranov and Yurchenko first published on the issue in 1971 in a general discussion of tokamak design, but it was the work by Wesson and Sykes in 1983&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sykes et all, ''Proceedings of 11th European Conference on Controlled Fusion and Plasma Physics'', 1983, pg. 363&lt;/ref&gt; and Francis Troyon in 1984&lt;ref&gt;F. Troyon et all, ''Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion'', Volume 26, pg. 209&lt;/ref&gt; that developed these concepts fully. Troyon's considerations, or the "Troyon limit", closely matched the real-world performance of existing machines. It has since become so widely used that it is often known simply as ''the'' beta limit in tokamaks.

The Troyon limit is given as:

&lt;math&gt;\beta_{max} = \frac{\beta_N I}{a B_0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=f379&gt;Friedberg, pg. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

Where ''I'' is the plasma current, &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt; is the external magnetic field, and a is the minor radius of the tokamak (see [[torus]] for an explanation of the directions). &lt;math&gt;\beta_N&lt;/math&gt; was determined numerically, and is normally given as 0.028 if ''I'' is measured in megaamperes. However, it is also common to use 2.8 if &lt;math&gt;\beta_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed as a percentage.&lt;ref name=f379/&gt;

Given that the Troyon limit suggested a &lt;math&gt; \beta_{max} &lt;/math&gt; around 2.5 to 4%, and a practical reactor had to have a &lt;math&gt; \beta_{max} &lt;/math&gt; around 5%, the Troyon limit was a serious concern when it was introduced. However, it was found that &lt;math&gt;\beta_N&lt;/math&gt; changed dramatically with the shape of the plasma, and non-circular systems would have much better performance. Experiments on the [[DIII-D]] machine (the second D referring to the cross-sectional shape of the plasma) demonstrated higher performance,&lt;ref&gt;T. Taylor, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10104172-nWRS2S/webviewable/10104172.pdf "Experimental Achievement of Toroidal Beta Beyond That Predicted by 'Troyon' Scaling"], General Atomics, September 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[spherical tokamak]] design outperformed the Troyon limit by about 10 times.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrophysics===
Beta is also sometimes used when discussing the interaction of plasma in space with different magnetic fields. A common example is the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the magnetic fields of the [[Sun]]&lt;ref name=h&gt;Alan Hood, [http://www-solar.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~alan/sun_course/Chapter3/node3.html "The Plasma Beta"], Magnetohydrostatic Equilibria, 11 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Haerendel et all, "High-beta plasma blobs in the morningside plasma sheet", ''Annales Geophysicae'', Volume 17 Number 12, pg. 1592-1601&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the betas of these natural phenomena are generally much smaller than those seen in reactor designs; the Sun's [[corona]] has a beta around 1%.&lt;ref name=h/&gt; Active regions have much higher beta, over 1 in some cases, which makes the area unstable.&lt;ref&gt;G. Allan Gary, [http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/papers/garyga/PlasmaBeta.pdf "Plasma Beta Above a Solar Active region: Rethinking the Paradigm"], ''Solar Physics'', Volume 203 (2001), pg. 71–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bourke engine''' was an attempt by Russell Bourke, in the 1920s, to improve the [[two-stroke]] engine. Despite finishing his design and building several working engines, the onset of [[World War II]], lack of test results,&lt;ref&gt;http://bourke-enginefiles.i8.com/146.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the poor health of his wife compounded to prevent his engine from ever coming successfully to market. The main claimed virtues of the design are that it has only two [[moving parts]], is lightweight, has two power pulses per revolution, and does not need oil mixed into the fuel.

The Bourke engine is basically a two-stroke design, with one horizontally opposed piston assembly using two pistons that move in the same direction at the same time, so that their operations are 180 degrees out of phase. The [[piston]]s are connected to a [[Scotch Yoke]] mechanism in place of the more usual crankshaft mechanism, thus the piston acceleration is perfectly [[sinusoidal]]. This causes the pistons to spend more time at [[top dead center]] than conventional engines. The incoming charge is compressed in a chamber under the pistons, as in a conventional crankcase-charged two-stroke engine. The connecting-rod seal prevents the fuel from contaminating the bottom-end lubricating oil.

==Operation==
The operating cycle is very similar to that of a current production spark ignition [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] with crankcase compression, with two modifications:
# The fuel is injected directly into the air as it moves through the transfer port.
# The engine is designed to run without using spark ignition once it is warmed up. This is known as auto-ignition or dieseling, and the air/fuel mixture starts to burn due to the [[diesel engine|high temperature of the compressed gas]], and/or the presence of [[hot bulb engine|hot metal]] in the combustion chamber.

==Design features==

The following design features have been identified:

===Mechanical features===

* [[Scotch yoke]] instead of [[connecting rod]]s to translate [[linear motion]] to [[rotary motion]]
* Fewer [[moving part]]s (only 2 moving assemblies per opposed cylinder pair) and the opposed cylinders are combinable to make 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or any even number of cylinders
* The [[piston]] is connected to the Scotch yoke through a [[slipper bearing]] (a type of hydrodynamic tilting-pad [[fluid bearing]])
* Mechanical [[fuel injection]].
* [[Port (engine)|Port]]s rather than [[Poppet valve|valve]]s.
* Easy maintenance ([[top overhauling]]) with simple tools.
* The Scotch yoke does not create lateral forces on the piston, reducing friction and piston wear.
* [[O-ring]]s are used to seal joints rather than [[gasket]]s.
* The Scotch Yoke makes the pistons [[dwell angle|dwell]] very slightly longer at [[top dead center]], so the fuel burns more completely in a smaller volume.

===Gas flow and thermodynamic features===

* Low exhaust temperature (below that of boiling water) so metal exhaust components are not required, plastic ones can be used if strength is not required from exhaust system
* 15:1 to 24:1 [[compression ratio]] for high efficiency and it can be easily changed as required by different fuels and operation requirements.
* Fuel is vaporised when it is injected into the transfer ports, and the turbulence in the intake manifolds and the piston shape above the rings stratifies the fuel air mixture into the combustion chamber.
* Lean burn for increased efficiency and reduced emissions.

===Lubrication===

* This design uses oil seals to prevent the pollution from the combustion chamber (created by piston ring blow-by in four-strokes and just combustion in two-strokes) from polluting the [[crankcase]] oil, extending the life of the oil as it is used slowly for keeping the rings full of oil to hold and use to lubricate. Oil was shown to be used slowly by the dropfull as needed, but checking the quantity and cleanness of it was still recommended by Russell Bourke, its creator.
* The [[lubricating oil]] in the base is protected from combustion chamber pollution by an oil seal over the connecting rod.
* The [[piston ring]]s are supplied with oil from a small supply hole in the cylinder wall at bottom dead center.

==Claimed and measured performance==
*'''Efficiency'''   0.25&amp;nbsp;(lb/h)/hp is claimed - about the same as the best diesel engine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.bath.ac.uk/ccsshb/12cyl/index.html.o The Most Powerful Diesel Engine in the World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202400/http://people.bath.ac.uk/ccsshb/12cyl/index.html.o |date=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or roughly twice as efficient as the best two strokes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.land-and-sea.com/dyno-tech-talk/using_bsfc.htm best two strokes]&lt;/ref&gt; This is equivalent to a thermodynamic efficiency of 55.4%, which is an exceedingly high figure for a small [[internal combustion engine]]. In a test witnessed by a third party, the '''actual''' fuel consumption was 1.1&amp;nbsp;hp/(lb/hr),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Niquette |url=http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/bourke.htm |title=The Bourke Engine |publisher=Niquette.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 0.9&amp;nbsp;(lb/hr)/hp, equivalent to a thermodynamic efficiency of about 12.5%, which is typical of a 1920s steam engine.&lt;ref&gt;GS Baker "Ship Form, Resistance, and Screw Propulsion" p215&lt;/ref&gt; A test of a 30 cubic inch Vaux engine, built by a close associate of Bourke, gave a fuel consumption of 1.48 lb/(bhp hr), or 0.7 (lb/hr)/hp at maximum power.&lt;ref&gt;Sport Aviation March 1980 p 60 fig 18&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Power to weight''' The Silver Eagle was claimed to produce 25&amp;nbsp;hp from 45&amp;nbsp;lb, or a power to weight ratio of 0.55&amp;nbsp;hp/lb. The larger 140 cubic inch engine was good for 120&amp;nbsp;hp from 125&amp;nbsp;lb, or approximately 1&amp;nbsp;hp/lb. The Model H was claimed to produce 60&amp;nbsp;hp with a weight of 95&amp;nbsp;lb, hence giving a power to weight ratio of 0.63&amp;nbsp;hp/lb. The 30 cu in twin was reported to produce 114&amp;nbsp;hp at 15000rpm while weighing only 38&amp;nbsp;lb, an incredible 3&amp;nbsp;hp/lb  &lt;ref&gt;Sport Aviation March 1980 p 54&lt;/ref&gt; However a 30 cu in replica from Vaux Engines produced just 8.8&amp;nbsp;hp at 4000 rpm, even after substantial reworking.&lt;ref&gt;Sport Aviation March 1980 p 54&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources claim 0.9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bourke-engine.com/general_info.htm |title=Bourke Engine Com |publisher=Bourke-engine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2.5&amp;nbsp;hp/lb , although no independently witnessed test to support these high figures has been documented. The upper range of this is roughly twice as good as the best four-stroke production engine shown here,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportscardesigner.com/hp_per_lb.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; or 0.1&amp;nbsp;hp/lb better than a [[Graupner GmbH|Graupner]] G58 two-stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graupner.de/fileadmin/downloadcenter/anleitungen/20060502130007_Anleitung_1903_05_08_09.pdf |title=Unbenannt-1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002212953/http://www.graupner.de/fileadmin/downloadcenter/anleitungen/20060502130007_Anleitung_1903_05_08_09.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower claim is unremarkable, easily exceeded by production four-stroke engines, never mind two strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/aero_engines/aero_eng_dvmt.htm |title=aircraft engine development |publisher=Pilotfriend.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Emissions''' Achieved virtually no [[hydrocarbon]]s (80 ppm) or [[carbon monoxide]] (less than 10 ppm) in published test results,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bourkeengine.net/confirmedtestresults.htm The Bourke Engine Project L.L.C. - Confirmed Test Results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928121407/http://bourkeengine.net/confirmedtestresults.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however no power output was given for these results, and [[NOx]] was not measured.
*'''Low Emissions''' The engine is claimed to be able to operate on hydrogen or any hydro-carbon fuel without any modifications, producing only water vapor and [[carbon dioxide]] as emissions.

==Engineering critique of the Bourke engine==
{{criticism section|date=May 2014}}

The Bourke Engine has some interesting features, but the extravagant claims&lt;ref&gt;[[Bourke Engine#Claimed and measured performance]]&lt;/ref&gt; for its performance are unlikely to be borne out by real tests{{Citation needed|reason=26 January 2008|date=January 2008}}.

# When running in auto-ignition mode the timing of the start of the burn is controlled by the operating state of the engine, rather than directly as in a spark ignition or diesel engine.

The result will be reduced efficiency and higher emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hot bulb engine]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# If the efficiency is high, then combustion temperatures must be high, as required by the [[Carnot cycle]], and the air fuel mixture must be lean. High combustion temperatures and lean mixtures cause [[nitrogen dioxide]] to be formed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12075">'''Compounds of carbon''' are defined as [[chemical substances]] containing [[carbon]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' by Abraham William Simpson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry'' Bruce King Ed. Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt; More [[chemical compound|compound]]s of carbon exist than any other [[chemical element]] except for [[hydrogen]]. [[Organic chemistry|Organic]] carbon [[chemical compound|compound]]s are far more numerous than [[inorganic carbon compound]]s. In general [[chemical bond|bonds]] of carbon with other [[chemical element|element]]s are [[covalent bond]]s. Carbon is [[tetravalent]] but carbon [[free radicals]] and [[carbenes]] occur as short-lived intermediates. Ions of carbon are [[carbocations]] and [[carbanions]] are also short-lived. An important carbon property is [[catenation]] as the ability to form long carbon chains and [[carbon ring|ring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Inorganic Chemistry'' Cotton, F. Albert / Wilkinson, Geoffrey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allotropes of carbon==
{{Main|Allotropes of carbon}}
The known [[inorganic chemistry]] of the [[allotropy|allotrope]]s of carbon ([[diamond]], [[graphite]], and the [[fullerene]]s) blossomed with the discovery of [[buckminsterfullerene]] in 1985, as additional fullerenes and their various derivatives were discovered. O
derivatives is [[inclusion compound]]s, in which an ion is enclosed by the all-carbon shell of the fullerene. This inclusion is denoted by the "@" symbol in [[endohedral fullerene]]s. For example, an ion consisting of a lithium ion trapped within buckminsterfullerene would be denoted Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. As with any other ionic compound, this complex ion could in principle pair with a [[counterion]] to form a salt. Other elements are also incorporated in so-called [[graphite intercalation compound]]s.

==Carbides==
[[Carbide]]s are [[binary compound]]s of carbon with an element that is less [[electronegative]] than it.                     The most important are
[[Aluminum carbide|Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Boron carbide|B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C]],
[[Calcium carbide|CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Iron carbide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C]],
[[Hafnium(IV) carbide|HfC]],
[[Silicon carbide|SiC]],
[[Tantalum carbide|TaC]],
[[Titanium carbide|TiC]], and
[[Tungsten carbide|WC]].

==Organic compounds==
{{Main|Organic compound}}
It was once thought that [[organic compound]]s could only be created by living organisms. Over time, however, scientists learned how to synthesize organic compounds in the lab. The number of organic compounds is immense and the known number of defined compounds is close to 10 million.&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;{{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an indefinitely large number of such compounds are theoretically possible. 
{{ChemicalBondsToCarbon}}
By definition, an organic compound must contain at least one atom of carbon, but this criterion is not generally regarded as sufficient. Indeed, the distinction between organic and inorganic compounds is ultimately a matter of convention, and there are several compounds that have been classified either way, such as:
[[Phosgene|COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Thiophosgene|CSCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Thiourea|CS(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Urea|CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].
With carbon bonded to metals the field of organic chemistry crosses over into [[organometallic chemistry]].

==Inorganic compounds==
{{see also|Inorganic compounds by element#Carbon}}
{{carbon compounds}}
There is a rich variety of [[carbon]] [[chemistry]] that does not fall within the realm of [[organic chemistry]] and is thus called '''inorganic carbon chemistry'''.

===Carbon-oxygen compounds===
There are many [[oxide]]s of carbon ([[oxocarbon]]s), of which the most common are [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). Other less known oxides include [[carbon suboxide]] (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[mellitic anhydride]] (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;).  There are also numerous unstable or elusive oxides, such as [[dicarbon monoxide]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[oxalic anhydride]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[carbon trioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). 

There are several [[oxocarbon anion]]s, negative ions that consist solely of oxygen and carbon. The most common are the [[carbonate]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[oxalate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).  The corresponding acids are the highly unstable [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and the quite stable [[oxalic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively.  These anions can be partially deprotonated to give the [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[hydrogenoxalate]]  (HC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).  Other more exotic carbon–oxygen anions exist, such as [[acetylenedicarboxylic acid|acetylenedicarboxylate]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C–C≡C–CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[mellitic acid|mellitate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[squaric acid|squarate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[rhodizonic acid|rhodizonate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).  The [[anhydride]]s of some of these acids are oxides of carbon; carbon dioxide, for instance, can be seen as the anhydride of carbonic acid. 

Some important carbonates are

[[Calcium bicarbonate|Ca(HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Potassium bicarbonate|KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and
[[Sodium bicarbonate|NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].

The most important oxalates include
[[Silver oxalate|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Barium oxalate|BaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Calcium oxalate|CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], 
[[Cerium oxalate|Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Potassium oxalate|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and
[[Disodium oxalate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].

[[Carbonyl]]s are coordination complexes between transition metals and [[carbonyl]] ligands. [[Metal carbonyl]]s are complexes that are formed with the neutral ligand CO. These complexes are covalent. Here is a list of some carbonyls:
[[Chromium carbonyl|Cr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]],

[[Molybdenum carbonyl|Mo(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Nickel carbonyl|Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]],
[[Tungsten carbonyl|W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]].

===Carbon-sulfur compounds===
Important inorganic [[carbon]]-[[sulfur]] compounds are the carbon sulfides [[carbon disulfide]] (CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbonyl sulfide]] (OCS).

[[Paracyanogen]] is the [[polymerization]] product of cyanogen. [[Cyanuric chloride]] is the trimer of cyanogen chloride and [[2-cyanoguanidine]] is the dimer of cyanamide. 

Other types of inorganic compounds include the inorganic [[Salt_(chemistry)|salt]]s and [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] of the carbon-containing [[cyanide]], [[cyanate]], [[fulminate]], [[thiocyanate]] and [[cyanamide]] [[polyatomic ion|ions]]. Examples of cyanides are [[copper cyanide]] (CuCN) and [[potassium cyanide]] (KCN), examples of cyanates are [[potassium cyanate]] (KNCO) and [[silver cyanate]] (AgNCO), examples of fulminates are [[silver fulminate]] (AgOCN) and [[mercury fulminate]] (HgOCN) and an example of a thiocyanate is [[potassium thiocyanate]] (KSCN).

==Carbon halides==
The common carbon halides are [[carbon tetrafluoride]] (CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon tetrabromide]] (CBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon tetraiodide]] (CI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and a large number of other carbon-[[halogen]] compounds.

==Carboranes==
A [[carborane]] is a cluster composed of boron and carbon atoms such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Alloys==
There are [[list of alloys|hundreds of alloys]] that contain carbon. The most common of these [[alloy]]s is [[steel]], sometimes called "[[carbon steel]]" (see [[:Category:Steels]]). All kinds of steel contain some amount of carbon, by definition, and all [[alloy|ferrous alloy]]s contain some carbon. 

Some other common alloys that are based on [[iron]] and [[carbon]] include [[anthracite iron]], [[cast iron]], [[pig iron]], and [[wrought iron]]. 

In more technical uses, there are also [[spiegeleisen]], an alloy of iron, [[manganese]], and carbon; and [[stellite]], an alloy of [[cobalt]], [[chromium]], [[tungsten]], and carbon. 

Whether it was placed there deliberately or not, some traces of carbon is also found in these common metals and their alloys: [[aluminum]], [[chromium]], [[magnesium]], [[molybdenum]], [[niobium]], [[thorium]], [[titanium]], tungsten, [[uranium]], [[vanadium]], [[zinc]], and [[zirconium]]. For example, many of these metals are smelted with [[coke (fuel)|coke]], a form of carbon; and aluminum and magnesium are made in [[electrolytic cell]]s with carbon electrodes. Some distribution of carbon into all of these metals is inevitable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5139">[[File:Solar Array.jpg|thumbnail|Concentrated Solar Thermal Collector Array]]
[[File:Diss ME.png|thumbnail|Multiple-Effect Evaporator]]
A '''concentrated solar still''' is a system that uses the same quantity of solar heat input (same solar collection area) as a simple [[solar still]] but can produce a volume of freshwater that is many times greater.  While a simple [[solar still]] is a way of [[distilling]] water by using the heat of the sun to drive evaporation from a water source and ambient air to cool a condenser film, a concentrated solar still uses a [[concentrated solar thermal]] collector to concentrate solar heat and deliver it to a [[multiple-effect distillation|multi-effect evaporation]] process for distillation, thus increasing the natural rate of evaporation. The concentrated solar still is capable of large-scale water production in areas with plentiful solar energy.

==Performance==
The concentrated solar still can produce as much as 20x more water than the theoretical maximum of a standard solar still&lt;ref name=Diego1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alarcon-Padilla|first=Diego C.|author2=Garcia-Rodriguez, Lourdes |author3=Blanco-Galvez, Julian |title=Design Recommendations for a Multi-Effect Distillation Plant Connected to a Double-Effect Absorption Heat Pump: A Solar Desalination Case Study|journal=Desalination|year=2010|volume=262|pages=11–14|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916410002936|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2010.04.064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diego2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alarcon-Padilla|first=Diego C.|author2=Garcia-Rodriguez, Lourdes |author3=Blanco-Galvez, Julian |title=Experimental Assessment of Connection of an Absorption Heat Pump to a Multi-Effect Distillation Unit|journal=Desalination|year=2010|volume=250|pages=500–505|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001191640900962X|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2009.06.056}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in practice, can produce as much as 30x the volume.  For instance, with a solar collection area of 10 acres, a standard solar still operating at a typical 25% efficiency&lt;ref name=engineeringforchange&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Distillation: Technical Brief|url=https://www.engineeringforchange.org/static/content/Water/S00026/solar_distillation.pdf|work=engineeringforchange.org|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; may produce as much as 27.8acre-ft/yr in a region with an average daily solar irradiation value of 21.6MJ/m².  A concentrated solar still can produce more than 750acre-ft/yr in the same region with the same collection area.

==Heat integration==

===Multiple stage evaporation===
The concentrated solar still implements a method for recovering the latent heat of the distillate vapor not captured and reused by a standard solar still.  This is done by using multiple stages of evaporation in series (see [[multiple-effect evaporator]]).  The latent heat of the distillate vapor produced in the n-1 stage (or effect) is recovered in the nth stage by boiling the leftover concentrated brine from the n-1 stage which produces distillate vapor whose latent heat will be recovered in the n+1 stage by boiling the leftover concentrated brine from the nth stage.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis&gt;{{cite book|last=Geankoplis|first=Christie John|title=Transport Processes and Separation Process Principles|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1406065|year=2004|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle Creek}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since brine is continuously concentrated in each stage, its boiling point will continue to rise under standard conditions.  To overcome the boiling point elevation of the brine, each evaporator stage operates at a lower pressure than the previous stage, which effectively reduces the boiling point, allowing for sufficient heat transfer to take place in each stage.  This process can be repeated until the distillate conditions are sufficiently degraded (i.e., pressure and temperature are very low and the distillate vapor volume is very large).&lt;ref name=Geankoplis /&gt;

===Heat pump===
The final evaporation stage produces distillate vapor that is considered to be at very poor state conditions.  This vapor can either be condensed in a final condenser, in which case its latent heat will be shed as waste,&lt;ref name=alfalaval&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Desalination - Clean water from solar energy|url=http://www.aalborgcsp.com/fileadmin/user_upload/beUid/1/1-Downloadable_materials/1-Brochures/2017-01-19_Aalborg_CSP_SolarDesalination_with_AlfaLaval_4-pager_ENG.pdf|work=Aalborg CSP|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it can be condensed by using a heat pump, in which case its latent heat (or a portion of it) can be recovered.  In the latter case, the heat pump effectively “upgrades” the state conditions of the latent heat to more usable conditions (higher temperature and pressure) by performing work (e.g., compression).&lt;ref name=Diego1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Diego2/&gt;  The conditions can be sufficiently upgraded such that the recovered heat can be used to provide additional heat for evaporation in the first effect.

[[File:Papierblume.jpg|thumb|257x257px|Crêpe paper]]
'''Crêpe paper''' is [[tissue paper]] that has been coated with [[sizing]] (a glue-like substance) and  creped (creased in a way similar to [[Party favor#Other items considered party favors|party streamers]]) to create gathers, giving it a crinkly texture like that of [[crêpe (textile)|crêpe]].

==Production==
{{Main|Fourdrinier machine}}
[[Paper]] that is creped is produced on a [[Fourdrinier machine|paper machine]] that has a single large steam-heated drying cylinder (''yankee'') fitted with a hot-air hood. The raw material is [[paper pulp]]. The [[Yankee dryer|Yankee cylinder]] is sprayed with [[adhesives]] to make the paper stick. Crêping is done by the Yankee's ''[[doctor blade]]'' that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor blade, speed difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.

==Properties==
Crêpe paper and tissue are among the lightest papers and are normally below 35 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The crêpe ratio reflects how much the paper has shortened during crêping. The figure is normally between 10 - 30%. Crêping is used to adjust the paper's stretch and thickness, both of which have a marked effect on softness and absorbency.

Crêping can also be applied to specialty papers, such as microcrêping in [[sack paper]].

==Applications==
* Crêpe paper is popular for streamers and other party decorations.
* Props and costume accessories can be made of crêpe paper. It can be soaked in a small amount of water to create a dye for Easter eggs, white cardstock, and other materials.
* Crêpe paper can also be used to make paper flowers, appliqué, and paper sculpture.
* Crêpe paper is important as the backing for various types of [[Adhesive tape|tape]], including masking tape and electrical tape.
* Can be used in place of corn husks to make [[tamale]]s.
* In the former Soviet Union, undyed, unbleached crêpe paper was widely used for toilet paper.
* Used in recovery systems in small model rockets.
* Crêpe paper is one of the main components used in costume building for [[Junkanoo]] the most popular street parade in the Bahamas.
* Crêpe paper can also be used as lipstick, liptint and hair color.

'''Cyanophages''' are viruses that infect [[cyanobacteria]], also known as Cyanophyta or blue-green algae. Cyanobacteria are a phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through the process of [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ecology of Cyanobacteria: Their Diversity in Time and Space|last=Whitton|first=Brian A.|last2=Potts|first2=Malcolm|publisher=Kluwer Academic|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7923-4735-4|location=Boston|pages=563–589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cyanobacteria metabolize [[photoautotrophic]]ally like eukaryotic plants, they have [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cell structure. Cyanophages can be found in both freshwater and marine environments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Marine and freshwater cyanophages have [[Regular icosahedron|icosahedral]] heads, which contain double-stranded DNA, attached to a tail by connector proteins.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suttle|first=Curtis A.|last2=Chan|first2=Amy M.|year=1993|title=Marine cyanophages infecting oceanic and coastal strains of Synechococcus: abundance, . morphology, cross-infectivity and growth characteristics|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/92/m092p099.pdf|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=92|pages=99–109|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the head and tail vary among species of cyanophages. Cyanophages infect a wide range of cyanobacteria and are key regulators of the cyanobacterial populations in aquatic environments, and may aid in the prevention of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater and marine ecosystems. These blooms can pose a danger to humans and other animals, particularly in [[eutrophic]] freshwater lakes. Infection by these viruses is highly prevalent in cells belonging to ''[[Synechococcus]]'' spp. in marine environments, where up to 5% of cells belonging to marine cyanobacterial cells have been reported to contain mature phage particles.&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proctor|first=Lita M.|last2=Fuhrman|first2=Jed A.|year=1990|title=Viral mortality of marine bacteria and cyanobacteria|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v343/n6253/abs/343060a0.html|journal=Nature|volume=343|pages=60–62|doi=10.1038/343060a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==

The following three families of cyanophages have been recognized by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV): [[Myoviridae]], [[Siphoviridae]] and [[Podoviridae]]; all contain double-stranded DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virus Taxonomy Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses: Ninth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|last1=King|first1=A.M.Q.|last2=Lefkowitz|first2=E.|last3=Adams|first3=M.J.|last4=Carstens|first4=E.B.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2012|isbn=978-0-12-384684-6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123846846#ancp4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, cyanophages were named after their hosts. However, the ability of cyanophages to infect multiple hosts and lack of a universal naming system can cause difficulties with their taxonomic classification.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Safferman|first=R.S.|last2=Cannon|first2=R.E.|last3=Desjardins|first3=P.R.|last4=Gromov|first4=B.V.|last5=Haselkorn|first5=R.|last6=Sherman|first6=L.A.|last7=Shilo|first7=M.|title=Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses of Cyanobacteria|url=http://www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000149339|journal=Intervirology|volume=19|issue=2|pages=61–66|doi=10.1159/000149339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other classification systems used serological, morphological, or physiological properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Bases of Virus Evolution|last=Gibbs|first=Adrian J|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-02289-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanier|first=R.Y.|year=1971|title=Purification and properties of unicellular blue-green algae (order Chroocococcales)|pmc=378380|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|volume=35 (2)|pages=171–205|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the suggested procedure of naming strains is as follows: Cyanophage Xx-YYZaa, where Xx is the first two letters of the genus and species names of the host that the type specimen phage is found in, YY is the origin of the specimen, Z is the virus family, and aa is the reference number of the virus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Morphology==

Like all other tailed [[bacteriophages]] cyanophages have a tail and a protein [[capsid]] surrounding genetic material. The double-stranded DNA is approximately 45 kbp long and in some cyanophages encodes photosynthetic genes, an integrase, or genes involved with phosphate metabolism (phosphate-inducible).&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Matthew B.|last2=Coleman|first2=Maureen L.|last3=Weigele|first3=Peter|last4=Rohwer|first4=Forest|last5=Chisholm|first5=Sallie W.|date=2005-04-19|year=|title=Three Prochlorococcus Cyanophage Genomes: Signature Features and Ecological Interpretations|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030144|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=3|issue=5|pages=e144|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030144|issn=1545-7885|pmc=1079782|pmid=15828858|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tail binds the virus to the host cell and transfers viral DNA to the host cell upon infection. Based on morphological characteristics, cyanophages are placed into the families Myoviridae, Podoviridaeand Siphoviridae, and although not formally recognized by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]], historically cyanophages have been further classified into as a Cyanomyovirus, Cyanopodovirus or Cyanostylovirus based on which of the three families in which they are grouped.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Cyanomyovirus ===
The type species for Cyanomyovirus of the family ''[[Myoviridae]]'' is Cyanophage AS-1, which was isolated from a waste stabilization pond,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Safferman|first=R.S.|last2=Diener|first2=T.O.|last3=Desjardins|first3=P.R.|last4=Morris|first4=M.E.|title=Isolation and characterization of AS-1, a phycovirus infecting the blue-green algae, ''Anacystis nidulans'' and ''Synechococcus cedrorum''|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0042682272902437|journal=Virology|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=105–113|doi=10.1016/0042-6822(72)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also the first genus recognized.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Safferman|first=Robert S.|last2=Morris|first2=Mary-Ellen|year=1964|title=GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BLUE-GREEN ALGAL VIRUS LPP-1|pmc=277376|journal=J.

=== Cyanopodovirus ===
Cyanopodovirus, within the ''[[Podoviridae]]'', are present in both fresh and marine water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Nien-Tai|last2=Thiel|first2=Teresa|last3=Giddings|first3=Thomas H.|last4=Wolk|first4=C.Peter|title=New Anabaena and Nostoc cyanophages from sewage settling ponds|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0042682281902695|journal=Virology|language=en|volume=114|issue=1|pages=236–246|doi=10.1016/0042-6822(81)90269-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type specimen of cyanopodovirus is Cyanophage LPP-1, which infects ''Lyngbya'', ''Plectonema'' and ''Phormidium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=I.

=== Cyanostylovirus ===
Cyanostylovirus belong to the family ''[[Siphoviridae]]'', where the type species is Cyanophage S-1, which is known to infect ''[[Synechococcus]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cyanostyloviridae have smaller (50&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter) isometric capsids than the previous genera but longer tails (140&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adolph|first=Kenneth W.|last2=Haselkorn|first2=Robert|title=Isolation and characterization of a virus infecting a blue-green alga of the genus ''Synechococcus''|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0042682273901323|journal=Virology|language=en|volume=54|issue=1|pages=230–236|doi=10.1016/0042-6822(73)90132-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other genera in this family have tails that range from 200 to 300&amp;nbsp;nm in length.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Host==

The host range of cyanophages is very complex and is thought to play an important role in controlling [[cyanobacteria]]l populations.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xia|first=Han|last2=Li|first2=Tianxian|last3=Deng|first3=Fei|last4=Hu|first4=Zhihong|date=2013-10-01|title=Freshwater cyanophages|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12250-013-3370-1|journal=Virologica Sinica|language=en|volume=28|issue=5|pages=253–259|doi=10.1007/s12250-013-3370-1|issn=1674-0769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshwater cyanophages have been reported to infect hosts in more than one [[genus]] although this may also reflect problems in the taxonomic classification of their hosts. Nonetheless, they have been classified into three major groups based on the [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of their [[Host organism|host]] organism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== LPP group ===
The first group is LPP, which belongs to the cyanopodoviruses.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This group of viruses includes the original cyanophage isolate that infected "blue-green algae".&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Cyanophages in this group are easy to isolate from the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They carry short non-contractile tails and cause [[lysis]] of several species within three genera of cyanobacteria: ''[[Lyngbya]]'', ''Plectonema'' and ''Phormidium''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, the name LPP was derived from the three genera of hosts that they infect.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; LPP-1 and LPP-2 are two major types of LPP cyanhophages.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JOHNSON|first=DAVID W.|last2=POTTS|first2=MALCOLM|year=1985|title=Host Range of LPP Cyanophages|url=|journal=International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology|volume=35|pages=76–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group of cyanophages has the same host same range; however, their serum and other body fluids are not the same.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== AS and SM group ===
The AS and SM groups represent the third group of cyanophages classified based on host range.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This group of viruses is said to be the “new blue-green algae” and infects unicellular forms of [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SAFFERMAN|first=R.S|last2=Schneider|first2=I.R.|last3=Steere|first3=R.L.|last4=MORRIS|first4=M.E.|last5=DIENER|first5=T.O|year=1969|title=Phycovirus SM-1: A virus infecting unicellular blue-green algae|url=|journal=Virology|volume=37|pages=386–397|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[myovirus]] AS-1 infects ''Anacystis nidulans'', ''[[Synechococcus]] cedrorum'', ''Synechococcus elongatus'' and ''Microcystis aeruginosa''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Similarly, the unicellular blue-green algae ''Synechococcus elongatus'' and ''Microcystis aeruginosa'' are infected by the podovirus SM-1.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=John A.|last2=Booth|first2=S.J.|last3=Martin|first3=E.L.|year=1976|title=Cyanophage SM-2: A new blue-green algal virus|url=|journal=Virology|volume=73|issue=2|pages=557–560|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a new SM-group of virus, known as SM-2, which also lyses ''Microcystis aeruginosa''&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;''.''

=== A, AN, N and NP group ===
Cyanophages classified in the groups A, AN, N and NP represent a second group of cyanophages classified based on host range.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MURADOV|first=MM|year=1990|title=COMPARATIVE-STUDY OF NP-1T CYANOPHAGES, WHICH LYSOGENIZE NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA OF THE GENERA NOSTOC AND PLECTONEMA|url=|journal=Microbiology|volume=59|issue=5|pages=558–563|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kozayakov|first=SYa|year=1977|title=Cyanophages of the series A(L) specific for the blue-green alga ''Anabaena variabilis''.

==Replication==
Cyanophage replication has two dominant cycles: the [[lytic cycle]] and the [[lysogenic cycle]]. Viral nucleic-acid replication and immediate synthesis of virus-encoded protein is considered to be the lytic cycle. Phages are considered lytic if they only have the capacity to enter the lytic cycle; whereas, temperate phage can either enter the lytic cycle or become stabely integrated with the host genome and enter the lysogenic cycle.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jassim|first=Sabah A. A.|last2=Limoges|first2=Richard G.|date=2013-10-01|title=Impact of external forces on cyanophage–host interactions in aquatic ecosystems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11274-013-1358-5|journal=World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology|language=en|volume=29|issue=10|pages=1751–1762|doi=10.1007/s11274-013-1358-5|issn=0959-3993}}&lt;/ref&gt; To meet the metabolic demand of replication, viruses recruit a multitude of strategies to sequester nutrients from their host. One such technique is to starve their host cell. This is done by inhibiting the host cells CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation, which enables the cyanophage to recruit photosynthetically formed redox and ATP from the host cell to meet their nucleotide and metabolic response.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Aaron|year=2016|title=Cyanophages: Starving the Host to Recruit Resources|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216303529|journal=Cell|volume=26|pages=R511-R513|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cyanophages contain genes known as viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), which encode critical, rate-limiting steps of the host organism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; AMGs encode genes for the pentose phosphate pathway, phosphate acquisition, sulfur metabolism, and DNA/RNA processing; these genes interfere with the metabolism of the host cell. Metagenomic analysis highly supports the notion that these genes promote viral replication through the degradation of host DNA and RNA, as well as a shift in host-cell metabolism to nucleotide biosynthesis.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Cyanophages also use these genes to maintain host photosynthesis through the progression of the infection, shuttling the energy away from carbon fixation to anabolism, which the virus takes advantage of.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Jeremy A.|last2=Lorimer|first2=Don|last3=Youle|first3=Merry|last4=Witte|first4=Pam|last5=Craig|first5=Tim|last6=Abendroth|first6=Jan|last7=Rohwer|first7=Forest|last8=Edwards|first8=Robert A.|last9=Segall|first9=Anca M.|date=2013-06-01|year=|title=Structure and function of a cyanophage-encoded peptide deformylase|url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v7/n6/full/ismej20134a.html|journal=The ISME Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=6|pages=1150–1160|doi=10.1038/ismej.2013.4|issn=1751-7362|pmc=3660681|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMGs also code for proteins, which aid in the repair of the host photosystem, which is susceptible to photodegradation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; One such example is the D1 proteins which replace the host cells D1 protein when it becomes damaged.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The virus up-regulates photosynthesis, which leads to an increased rate of D1 protein degradation, the host cell alone can not efficiently replace these proteins so the cyanophage replaces them for the host cell, allowing it to continue providing energy for the cyanophage replication cycle.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

It is evident that cyanophage replication is heavily dependent on the diel cycle. The first step in the infectious cycle is for the cyanophage to make contact and bind to the cyanobacteria, this adsorption process is heavily dependent on light intensity.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ni|first=Tianchi|last2=Zeng|first2=Qinglu|date=2016-01-01|year=|title=Diel Infection of Cyanobacteria by Cyanophages|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2015.00123/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Marine Science|language=English|volume=2|pages=|doi=10.3389/fmars.2015.00123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field studies also show that the infection and replication of cyanophages is directly or indirectly synchronized with the light-dark cycle.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Adherence ===

Cyanophages like other [[bacteriophage]]s rely on [[Brownian motion]] to collide with bacteria, and then use receptor binding proteins to recognize cell surface proteins, which leads to adherence. Viruses with  contractile tails then rely on receptors found on their tails to recognize highly conserved proteins on the surface of the host cell.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westbye|first=Alexander B.|last2=Kuchinski|first2=Kevin|last3=Yip|first3=Calvin K.|last4=Beatty|first4=J.

Cyanophages also infect bloom-forming cyanobacteria that can be toxic to health of humans and other animals through the production of [[microcystin]] and cause [[eutrophication]], leading to [[oxygen minimum zone]]s. Cyanophages can infect and kill four common bloom-forming cyanobacteria: ''[[Lyngbya]] birgei'', ''[[Anabaena]] circinalis'', ''[[Anabaena]] flosaquae'', and ''[[Microcystis aeruginosa]]'',&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; and thus may be able to prevent [[harmful algal bloom]]s under normal conditions.

The [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] ([[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]]) is the key university of science and technology in Norway. The '''Department of Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics (IPT)''' was established in 1973, shortly after the start of production ([[Ekofisk|Ekofisk field]]) from the [[Norwegian continental shelf]]. The department came to include [[Petroleum Engineering]] as well as [[Geophysics]], which is seen as a major strength of the petroleum education at NTNU. The department has elected chairman and vice chairman, and 4 informal groups of professors; [[geophysics]], [[Drilling (oil)|drilling]], production and [[reservoir engineering]]. The stated primary purpose of maintaining the informal groups is to take care of the teaching in their respective disciplines. Each group is responsible for offering a sufficient number of courses, semester projects and thesis projects at [[M.Sc.]] and [[Ph.D.]] levels in their discipline, and to make annual revisions of these in accordance with the needs of society and industry. The total number of  [[Professor|professors, associate professors, assistant professors and adjunct professors]] is 32. The administrative staff is led by a department administrator, and consists of a total of 6 secretaries. The technical support staff reports to the department head, and consists of 8 engineers and technicians. Until 2000, the department was part of the Applied Earth Sciences faculty, together with the Geology-department. After that, the department is part of the Faculty of Engineering Science and Technology (one of a total of 10 departments).

Brief historical statistics of the department:
* Established in 1973
* More than 2000 graduated M.Sc.´s
* More than 150 graduated Ph.D.´s
* Around 120&amp;nbsp;M.Sc.´s graduate every year
* Around 10 Ph.D.´s graduate every year
* Currently around 120 full-time teachers, researchers and staff
* Around 450 students enrolled at B.Sc. and M.Sc. levels
* Around 65 PhD students enrolled

== Research ==

'''Integrated operations:''' The department hosts the [http://www.ntnu.no/iocenter/ Center for Integrated Operations in the Petroleum Industry]. Key research areas are drilling, reservoir management, production optimization, operation and maintenance.

== International ==
The department states that it intends to be strongly focused on the international profile with a friendly multi-cultural atmosphere. From the very beginning the international atmosphere existed at IPT in the form of teachers, researchers and students from various countries. IPT has been actively cooperating with countries like Angola, Aserbadjan, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Iran, Mozambique, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, USA, Venezuela; altogether more than 50 countries. There are two 2-years international programs leading to Master's degrees, one in Petroleum Engineering and one in Petroleum Geoscience. Exchange students may take shorter term education within this program. In addition Ph.D-positions are open to qualified international candidates. These positions also constitute the basis for international research cooperation. Professors have individual scientific cooperation with various foreign institutions. The funding comes from Norwegian agencies [http://www.siu.no/ SIU] (NORAD, QUOTA), [http://www.ntnu.edu/international/enpe/ EnPe] (NORAD, QUOTA), [http://www.forskningsradet.no/ The Research Council of Norway], oil companies [http://www.statoil.com/ Statoil], [[Total S.A.|Total]], [[BP]], and NTNU Scholarships; also from European Programs ([[ERASMUS programme|Erasmus]], Marie Curie, TIME, [[SOCRATES programme|Socrates]]) and others. IPT cultivates personal international contacts as originators of new collaboration. Graduated Ph.D.s represent a particular bridging potential for new joint research.

== Innovation ==
New companies, on average one new company each year, are founded by professors and/or students, including: Agir Boosting Technology,  Geoprobing Technology, [[DeepSeaAnchors]], [[Markland Technology]], [[Natural Gas Hydrate]], [[PERA]], [[Petrostreamz]], [[Petreco]], [[ResLab]], [[Corrocean]], [[Sensorlink]], [[Seres]], [[Technoguide]], [[Verande]], [[Voxelvision]], [[Waptheweb]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10118">'''Dixie Alley''' is a nickname sometimes given to areas of the [[southern United States]] that are particularly vulnerable to strong or violent [[tornado]]es.&lt;ref name="redefinealleys"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=John D.|publisher=[[Discovery Channel]]|url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/redefining-tornado-alleys.html|title=Redefining Tornado Alleys|date=April 27, 2010|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from the better known [[Tornado Alley]] and has a high frequency of strong, long-track tornadoes that move at higher speeds (50+ miles per hour). The term was coined by [[Storm Prediction Center|NSSFC]] Director Allen Pearson after witnessing a tornado outbreak which included more than 9 long-track, violent tornadoes that killed 121 on February 21, 1971. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rice|first=Doyle|publisher=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/tornadoes/2011-04-25-tornado-dixie-alley.htm|title=Dixie Alley may see more tornado action than even Tornado Alley|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific characteristics of the Southeast led to [[VORTEX projects|VORTEX-SE]], a field project studying [[tornadogenesis]], diagnosis and forecasting, in addition to social science implications, and examines both [[supercell]]ular tornadoes and those resulting from [[squall line|quasi-linear convective system]] (QLCS) thunderstorm structures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/vortexse/ VORTEX Southeast]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although tornadoes are less frequent in these states than they are in the southern Plains, the southeastern states have had more tornado-related deaths than any of the Plains states (excluding [[Texas]]). This is in part due to the relatively high number of strong/violent long tracked tornadoes and higher population density of this region, as well as the Southern United States having the highest percentage of [[manufactured homes]] in the US, where 63% of the overall tornado-related fatalities occur.&lt;ref name="supertues08"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=John L.|publisher=[[NOAA]]|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/super_tuesday.pdf|title=Service Assessment on the Super Tuesday Tornado Outbreak of February 5-6, 2008|date=March 2009|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]], for the period January 1, 1950 &amp;ndash; October 31, 2006, Alabama and [[Kansas]] received the largest amount of [[Fujita scale|F5]] tornadoes. Complicating matters is that tornadoes are rarely visible in this area, as they are more likely to be rain-wrapped, embedded in shafts of heavy rain, and that the hilly [[topography]] and heavily forested landscape makes them difficult to see.&lt;ref name="supertues08"/&gt;

== Prevalent tornado characteristics ==
[[File:Tornado in Mississippi on December 23, 2015.jpg|thumb|Tornado in Mississippi, located in Dixie Alley, obscured by trees and featuring a notably low, rugged base.]]
Dixie Alley is part of a region of enhanced tornadic activity extending between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Dixon |first = P. Grady |author2 = A. E. Mercer |author3 = J. Choi |author4 = J. S. Allen |title = Tornado Risk Analysis: Is Dixie Alley an Extension of Tornado Alley? |journal =  Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc. |volume = 92 |issue = 4 |pages = 433–441 |date = 2011 |doi = 10.1175/2010BAMS3102.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, but tornadoes and outbreaks in the Dixie Alley region exhibit some statistically distinguishable characteristics than the more well known Tornado Alley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Gagan |first = John P. |author2 = A.

Gordon |title = A Historical and Statistical Comparison of "Tornado Alley" to "Dixie Alley" |journal = NWA Digest |volume = 13 |issue = 2 |pages = 145–155 |date = 2010 |url = http://nwafiles.nwas.org/digest/papers/2010/Vol34No2/Pg145-Gagan-etal.pdf |doi = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadic storms in Dixie Alley are most often [[Supercell#High Precipitation (HP)|high precipitation supercells]] due to an increase of moisture from proximity to the nearby [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The Dixie Alley tornadoes accompanying the HP supercells are often partially or fully wrapped in rain visually impairing the tornadoes to storm [[storm spotting|spotters]] and [[storm chasing|chasers]], law enforcement, and the public.&lt;ref name="supertues08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=University of Alabama Birmingham|url=http://www.uab.edu/icrc/tornado_helmet_com.html|title=Safety Helmets: A Practical, Inexpensive Solution for Reducing the Risk of Head Injuries Resulting from Tornadoes|date=|accessdate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases of warmth and [[Convective instability|instability]] in conjunction with strong [[wind shear]] in the Dixie Alley region impacts the times when tornadoes form. In the traditional Tornado Alley, tornadoes most often form from the mid afternoon to early evening. Dixie Alley's instability can be maintained long after sunset due to being adjacent to the Gulf, increasing the frequency of intense nighttime and early morning tornadoes.&lt;ref name="supertues08"/&gt; There is also a less focused tornado season which tends to be most active in early spring and late autumn but can continue throughout the winter and into late spring, which can lead to complacency among residents of the region. The region often is subject to tornadoes much earlier than the general national peak from May and June, usually from February to Mid-April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saslow|first=Rachel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/tornado-season-is-at-its-height-in-dixie-alley/2011/04/28/AF18NA6E_story.html|title=Tornado season is at its height in ‘Dixie Alley’|date=April 28, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2012|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several notorious outbreaks have struck during the late winter and early spring and also in late fall.&lt;ref name="supertues08"/&gt; The complacency situation was noted after the [[2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak]] in February 2008 that hit the Dixie Alley killing 57 people, many people indicated that they had underestimated the threat of severe weather on that day since it was well before the peak of tornado season.&lt;ref name="supertues08"/&gt; 

Variations in [[climate pattern]]s and [[teleconnection]]s, such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) can also have significant impacts on tornadic activity in the region from year to year. [[Climate change]] is also expected to affect tornado activity in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Strader |first = Stephen M. |author2 = W. S. Ashley |author3 = T. J.

== Notable outbreaks ==
Dixie Alley has been subject to numerous [[tornado outbreak]]s throughout history, including very intense outbreaks and those of very large spatial and temporal extent. Notorious outbreaks affecting the region include: the [[Great Natchez Tornado]], the [[1884 Enigma tornado outbreak]], the [[April 1924 tornado outbreak]], the [[1932 Deep South tornado outbreak]], the [[1936 Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak]], the [[April 1957 Southeastern tornado outbreak]], the [[1984 Carolinas tornado outbreak]], and the [[November 1992 tornado outbreak]]. The [[1974 Super Outbreak]] also hit the area very hard, producing multiple F5 tornadoes in Alabama, and F4 tornadoes in North Georgia and the Appalachian southwest of North Carolina. More recently the region was hit by the [[2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak]] followed by the [[tornado outbreak of April 14–16, 2011]], the deadliest since the 2008 outbreak.&lt;ref name="supertues08"/&gt; Two weeks after the April 14–16 event, Dixie Alley was the epicenter of the [[2011 Super Outbreak]], which was the largest tornado outbreak ever recorded, as well as the fourth-deadliest outbreak in United States history, with over 300 people dead.&lt;ref name="2011super"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/april_2011_tornado_information.html|title=April 2011 tornado information|date=May 9, 2011|work=[[NOAA]]|publisher=[[USA.gov]]|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common rail injection ==
BMW's [[common rail]] injection involves managing the fuel injection at every stage from pre injection to delivery with one common rail. This improves fuel delivery and power delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/technology/technology_guide/articles/common_rail_fuel_injection.html|title=BMW Technology Guide : Common rail injection system|last=GmbH|first=Interone Worldwide|website=www.bmw.com|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stop start engine ==
The stop-start feature will automatically switch off the engine when the car is idling at a complete stop. This reduces fuel consumption  while idling for extended periods. The engine automatically switch on when the brake pedal is released, turning your steering wheel (which activates power steering), or shifting from park.

== Brake regeneration ==
The alternator is charging the battery only when the car is braking, coasting or decelerating&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/technology/technology_guide/articles/mm_brake_energy_regeneration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air vent control ==
The [[air vents]] in front of the radiator grille will open up to allow for air to cool. They will automatically close if it is not in use, reducing air resistance and fuel consumption.

== Electric power steering ==
The [[power steering]] is only active when the steering wheel is turning. If it is kept in a constant location or place, the electric power is inactive.

It is determined from the slope of a stress-strain curve produced by a flexural test (such as the [[ASTM]] D790), and uses units of force per area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

thus &lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{bend}} = E &lt;/math&gt;  ([[Elastic modulus]])

Ideally, flexural or bending [[modulus of elasticity]] is equivalent to the tensile modulus ([[Young's modulus]]) or compressive modulus of elasticity. In reality, these values may be different, especially for [[polymer]]s.

==History==

Flood Brothers Disposal started operations with one truck and one employee, at 139 N. Clark St. in Chicago, Illinois. In 1963, the main center of operations moved to 5435 W. Chicago Ave. From 1970 to 1977, the company continued expansion and moved to several additional locations, eventually settling at 4827 W. Harrison St. in Chicago, where the company is presently based.

In 1988, the company expanded to include a fully automated recycling center, and in 1990, became the first licensed special waste hauler in the Chicago community. In 1996, Flood Brothers Disposal opened an additional facility in Carol Stream, Illinois. As of today, Flood Brothers Disposal services more than 150 communities in the Chicago area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Brothers History|url=http://floodbrothersdisposal.com/about-us/history/|work=Flood Brothers Disposal Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Paleontology}}

'''Fossil wood''' is [[wood]] that is preserved in the [[fossil record]].  Over time the wood will usually be the part of a plant that is best preserved (and most easily found).  Fossil wood may or may not be [[petrified wood|petrified]]. The study of fossil wood is sometimes called palaeoxylology, with a "palaeoxylologist" somebody who studies fossil wood.

The fossil wood may be the only part of the plant that has been preserved, with the rest of the plant completely unknown:&lt;ref name="strauss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edstrauss.com/pwoodfx.html |title=Petrified Wood from Western Washington |author=Ed Strauss |year=2001 |accessdate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211224655/http://www.edstrauss.com/pwoodfx.html |archivedate=December 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore such wood may get a special kind of [[botanical name]]. This will usually include "xylon" and a term indicating its presumed affinity, such as ''[[Araucarioxylon arizonicum|Araucarioxylon]]'' (wood of ''[[Araucaria]]'' or some related genus), ''[[Palmoxylon]]'' (wood of an indeterminate [[Arecaceae|palm]]), or ''Castanoxylon'' (wood of an indeterminate [[Castanopsis|chinkapin]]).&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;{{cite book

==Types==

===Petrified wood===
{{Main|Petrified wood}}
Petrified wood are fossils of wood that have turned to stone through the process of [[permineralization]]. All organic materials are replaced with minerals while maintaining the original structure of the wood.

The most notable example is the [[Petrified Forest National Park|petrified forest]] in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.nps.gov/pefo/index.htm
|title=Petrified Forest National Park
|accessdate=April 8, 2011
|publisher=National Park Service, US Department of the Interior
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mummified wood===
Mummified wood are fossils of wood that have not permineralized.&lt;ref name="strauss2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/blog/posting.asp?ID=414 |title=Mummified Forest Shows Effect of Changing Climate |author=Kelly Greig |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2011 |publisher=Canadian Geographic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205052304/http://canadiangeographic.ca/blog/posting.asp?ID=414 |archivedate=February 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are formed when trees are buried rapidly in dry cold or hot environments. They are valued in paleobotany because they retain original cells and tissues capable of being examined with the same techniques used with extant plants in [[dendrology]].&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite book

The '''Global Forest Coalition''' (GFC) is a  coalition of [[NGO]]s and [[indigenous peoples]] organizations engaged in the global policy debate related to [[forest]]s. The mission of the Global Forest Coalition is to advocate the rights of forest-dependent peoples as a basis for forest policy and addressing the direct and underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Global Forest Coalition website: http://globalforestcoalition.org/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, the coalition facilitates effective and equitable participation of these groupsin global policy fora related to forests and monitors the implementation of agreed policy commitments. The three primary targets of the coalition are the [[United Nations Forum on Forests]], the [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].

The Global Forest Coalition was set up in 2000 by 19 groups from all over the world. It succeeds the NGO [[Forest Working Group]], which was established in 1995 to advocate for social justice issues and the underlying causes of forest loss to be addressed in international forest policy debates.

==Forest Working Group==
The ''Forest Working Group'' was an informal network of 15-20 NGOs established in 1995, predating the Global Forest Coalition. It included NGOs from all regions that participated in international forest policy meetings and organized joint advocacy campaigns on issues such as [[indigenous peoples]]’ rights, socially-just forest policy, and underlying causes of [[deforestation|forest loss]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6755">In [[fixed-wing aircraft]], '''ground effect''' is the increased [[lift (force)]] and decreased [[aerodynamic drag]] that an aircraft's [[wing]]s generate when they are close to a fixed surface.&lt;ref name="Irving Gleim"&gt;Gleim 1982, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; 
When landing, ground effect can give the pilot the feeling that the aircraft is "floating". When taking off, ground effect may temporarily reduce the [[stall speed]].  The pilot can then fly just above the runway while the aircraft accelerates in ground effect until a safe [[v speeds|climb speed]] is reached.&lt;ref name="Flight theory and aerodynamics"&gt;Dole 2000, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Principle of ground effect==

[[File:Flügel ohne Bodeneffekt.png|thumb|Normal lift: {{colorbox|lightyellow}} high pressure; {{colorbox|lightblue}} low pressure.]]
[[File:Positiver Bodeneffekt.png|thumb|Lift in ground effect due to the increase in high pressure under the wing.]]
[[File:El efecto suelo.ogg|thumb|Ground effect]]

When an aircraft flies at a ground level approximately at or below the length of the aircraft's [[wingspan]] or helicopter's rotor diameter, there occurs, depending on airfoil and aircraft design, an often noticeable ground effect. This is caused primarily by the ground interrupting the [[wingtip vortices]] and [[downwash]] behind the wing. When a wing is flown very close to the ground, wingtip vortices are unable to form effectively due to the obstruction of the ground. The result is lower [[induced drag]], which increases the [[speed]] and [[lift (force)|lift]] of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators.'' RAMESH TAAL, HOSUR, VIC. Australia: Aviation Theory Centre, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilot's Encyclopedia of Aeronautical Knowledge"&gt;''Pilot's Encyclopedia of Aeronautical Knowledge'' 2007, pp. 3-7, 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wing generates lift by deflecting the oncoming airmass (relative wind) downward.&lt;ref&gt;"Lift from Flow Turning". NASA Glenn Research Center. Retrieved July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The deflected or "turned" flow of air creates a resultant force on the wing in the opposite direction (Newton's 3rd law).  The resultant force is identified as lift.  Flying close to a surface increases air pressure on the lower wing surface, nicknamed the "ram" or "cushion" effect, and thereby improves the aircraft lift-to-drag ratio. The lower/nearer the wing is with regards to the ground, the more pronounced the ground effect becomes. While in the ground effect, the wing requires a lower [[angle of attack]] to produce the same amount of lift. If the angle of attack and [[velocity]] remain constant, an increase in the lift coefficient ensues,&lt;ref name="Pilot pp.3-8"&gt;Dole 2000, pp. 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt; which accounts for the "floating" effect. Ground effect also alters [[thrust]] versus velocity, where reduced induced drag requires less thrust in order to maintain the same velocity.&lt;ref name="Pilot pp.3-8"/&gt;

[[Low wing|Low winged aircraft]] are more affected by ground effect than [[high wing]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Flight theory and aerodynamics, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the change in up-wash, down-wash, and wingtip vortices there may be errors in the airspeed system while in ground effect due to changes in the local pressure at the [[Pitot tube|static source]].&lt;ref name="Pilot pp.3-8"/&gt;

Another important issue regarding ground effect is that the makeup of the surface directly affects the intensity; this is to say that a concrete or other smooth hard surface will produce more effect than water or broken ground.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Ground-effect vehicle==
{{main|Ground-effect vehicle}}
Many vehicles have a design that makes use of the wing in ground effect. Although all airplanes fly through ground effect at some point, craft that do so in a dedicated manner are designed in such a way that their wings are normally unable to take them into flight out of ground effect (free flight). Those that can fly out of ground effect are often capable of only a short distance take-off into free flight. Because of this, these craft are often licensed as ships rather than as aircraft. These specially designed craft may use [[delta wing]]s, [[ekranoplan]] wings, or [[tandem wing]]s.

==Low-pressure tanks==
Various applications have allowed the development of different H2 storage scenarios.
Recently, the Hy-Can&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen-canister.com/en/  Hycan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206064212/http://www.hydrogen-canister.com/en/ |date=2011-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consortium has introduced a small one liter, {{convert|10|bar|MPa psi}} format.  Horizon Fuel Cells is now selling a refillable {{convert|3|MPa|bar psi}} metal hydride form factor for consumer use called HydroStik.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horizonfuelcell.com/#!minipak/c156u/ Horizon HydroStik]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type I==
* Metal tank (steel/aluminum)
* Approximate maximum pressure, aluminum {{convert|175|bar|MPa psi}}, steel {{convert|200|bar|MPa psi}}.

==Type II==

==Tank testing and safety considerations==

In accordance with ISO/TS 15869 (revised):
* Burst test: the pressure at which the tank bursts, typically more than 2x the working pressure.
* Proof pressure: the pressure at which the test will be executed, typically above the working pressure.
* Leak test or permeation test,&lt;ref&gt;[http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf Modeling of dispersion following hydrogen permeation for safety engineering and risk assessment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142016/http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in NmL/hr/L (Normal liter of H2/time in hr/volume of the tank.
* Fatigue test, typically several thousand cycles of charging/emptying.
* Bonfire test where the tank is exposed to an open fire.
* Bullet test where live ammunition is fired at the tank.

Actual Standard EC 79/2009
* U.S Department of Energy maintains a hydrogen safety best practices site with a lot of information about tanks and piping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h2bestpractices.org/storage/ U.S. DOE storage safety]&lt;/ref&gt;  They dryly observe "Hydrogen is a very small molecule with low viscosity, and therefore prone to leakage.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://h2bestpractices.org/h2properties/ U.S. DOE best safety practices hydrogen properties]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metal hydride storage tank==

Using magnesium&lt;ref&gt;[http://neel.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article1281 CNRS Institut Neel H2 Storage]&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Hydrogen storage#Metal hydrides|hydrogen storage]], a safe but weighty reversible storage technology. Typically the pressure requirement are limited to {{convert|10|bar|MPa psi}}.
The charging process generates heat whereas the discharge process will require some heat to release the H2 contained in the storage material. To activate those type of hydrides, at the current state of development you need to reach approximately {{convert|300|C|F}}.

[[File:JPods Traffic Choice Colors.jpg|thumb|Illustration of JPods network]]

'''JPods''' is a [[personal rapid transit]] concept which uses distributed collaborative computer networks to route transit in a manner similar to the data trafficking of the Internet. Developed by JPods, Inc, the vehicles consist of ultra-light pods controlled by on-board computers.

Personal rapid transit was defined in Congressional Office of Technology Assessment Study ''PB-244854''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpods.com/JPods/003LastOilCrisis/7503_LastOilCrisis.PDF |title=PB-244854 |publisher=Congressional Office of Technology Assessment |date= |accessdate=1975-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as the solution for urban transport in response to the [[1973 oil embargo|1973 Oil Embargo]].  [[Morgantown, West Virginia]] installed a PRT system that has delivered 110&amp;nbsp;million oil-free, injury-free [[passenger miles]]{{cn|date=June 2015}}, but where huge budget overruns crippled interest in PRT for several decades.

== Transport Characteristics ==
In the demonstration JPod, people get in, select a destination on a touch screen and the vehicle navigates to that address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh3yYAShTjA |title=Fox 9 News |publisher=Fox 9 News |date= | accessdate= 2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In production models people and/or cargo will set destination and travel non-stop from origin to destination.

== Installations ==

[[File:Time-Map of Secaucus, NJ.jpg|thumb|Time map illustrating walking, ticketing, and travel time from the Blue Cross. Green is 10 minutes, Yellow is 20 minutes, and Red is 30 minutes.]]

JPods has signed [[letters-of-intent]] (see image of letter to the right) to build networks in 2014 with the cities of [[Secaucus, New Jersey|Secaucus]] ({{convert|5|mi|abbr=out|adj=on}} network, US-NJ), [[Anshan]] ({{convert|30|km|order=flip|abbr=out|adj=on}}, China), and [[Linyi]] ({{convert|200|km|adj=on|order=flip|abbr=out}}, China). On June 25, 2014 the Town of Secaucus passed a Performance Standards Ordinance making it a law to grant rights of way access based on exceeding 120 passenger-miles per gallon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/102592696 |title=Ordinance 2014-23, Performance Standards |publisher=Town of Secaucus, NJ |date= | accessdate= 2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* switch control is managed by the vehicle and/or by the network
* solar powered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtoys.com/emagazine.php?issue_number=07.06.01&amp;article=ingenuity |title=Alternative Energy eMagazine - &amp;#124; AltEnergyMag |publisher=Earthtoys.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer network is managed in three tiers:
* devices such as pods, switches, structures
* negotiators collaborate with devices and load managers to set routes
* load managers log time based demand to create a terrain map that allow appropriate routes to be identified and scheduled

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1482">A '''jobber''', or [[petroleum]] marketer, is a person or company that purchases quantities of refined fuel from refining companies (e.g. [[BP]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Exxon]]), either for sale to retailers (e.g., [[Filling station|gasoline stations]]), or to sell directly to the users of those products (e.g., home [[heating oil]] to homeowners, lubricating oils to industrial operations or repair shops, [[jet fuel]] to [[Fixed base operator|FBO]]s, etc.). In essence, the jobber acts as the "middleman" between the company that refines the petroleum products and those that either use them or market them at retail prices.{{fact|date=July 2015}}  The jobber often owns the gasoline being sold, and the station it is being sold to, but allows an operator to lease the store.{{fact|date=July 2015}}

In 2001, 44.3% of all gasoline in the U.S. was sold through jobbers.{{fact|date=July 2015}}  Approximately the same percentage was sold through integrated oil company owned and operated stores or franchise arrangements. The percentage of jobbers responsible for fuel sale in the USA in 2004 fell to 37.3%.{{fact|date=July 2015}}

Jobbers are represented by trade associations such as the Association for Convenience &amp; Fuel Retailing, National Association of Shell Marketers, Sigma: America's Leading Fuel Marketers, and the Petroleum Marketers Association of America.

'''Mutation Sensation''' is a [[recycling]] project based on reusing discarded “[[stuffed animals]]” toys.

The concept has become an evolutionary project that reconstructs the way people think about the [[market economy]] in reference to mass production (of toys, in this case) which symbolizes the early education of abundance as pleasure.  It is also awakening an avenue that opens eyes to the possibilities of alternative equal rights relations between the producers and the consumers of the world.  With respect to the inequality of the market, the 1st Mutation Sensation session occurred during a festival under various gamey stipulations such as:  long hours, unfavourable work conditions and no pay.  It was an intense lesson as to how much work is involved in sewing toys.  The Mutations have continued to develop amongst recycling festivals and childhood ecological recycling projects.

Mutation Sensations serve an important demand for performing illusionary transformations and possible elimination of iconographic plush toys into futuristic idealism.

'''Ningde Nuclear Power Plant''' ({{zh|s=宁德核电站|t=寧德核電站|p=Níngdé hé diàn zhàn}}) is a [[nuclear power plant]] in [[Fujian]] [[province (China)|province]], [[China]]. 
The site is located in Beiwan village in the town of [[Qinyu]], [[Fuding]], [[Ningde]], Fujian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90881/6356127.html  | title= Fujian nuclear plants begin construction  | date= February 18, 2008 | work= People's Daily Online |publisher=  | accessdate= 2009-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plant will ultimately have six 1,080&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] (MWe) [[CPR-1000]] [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWRs).&lt;ref name="wna-China"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html  | title= Nuclear Power in China  | date= April 2013 | work= Information Papers | publisher= [[World Nuclear Association]] (WNA) | accessdate= 24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first reactor began operation on 18&amp;nbsp;April 2013.&lt;ref name=wnn-20130423/&gt;The Ningde Nuclear Power project was approved by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in 2007.&lt;ref name="Approval"&gt;{{cite news |url        = http://www.chinainfoworld.com/shownews.php?id=23642 |title      = Ningde Nuclear Power Station Receives Approval |date       = 2007-11-13 |work       = China Energy Daily |publisher  =

The project is 51% funded by the Guangdong Nuclear Investment Company Ltd, with Datang International Power Generation Co and the Fujian Coal Group completing the shareholding. A total investment of 52&amp;nbsp;billion yuan (US$7.6&amp;nbsp;billion) should result in the completion of Ningde Phase&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref name="wnn-04101001"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Ningde_4_the_latest_Chinese_reactor_project_04101001.html | title= Ningde 4 the latest Chinese reactor project | date= 4 October 2010 | work= World Nuclear News |publisher=  | accessdate= 2010-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Including the final two units of Phase&amp;nbsp;II, the total cost will exceed 70&amp;nbsp;billion yuan.&lt;ref name="Approval"/&gt; 
The four units of Phase&amp;nbsp;I will generate about 30&amp;nbsp;billion [[kilowatt hour]]s per year, for which the plant will charge 0.37&amp;nbsp;yuan/kW·h (11&amp;nbsp;billion yuan/year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/gyzg/t408164.htm  | title= China's vice premier stresses improvement of energy structure  | date= February 18, 2008 |work= | publisher= [[Xinhua]]  | accessdate= 2009-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ningde marks a step in the development of China's domestic nuclear industry. 
Shu Guogang, GM of China Guangdong Nuclear Power Project said, "We built 55&amp;nbsp;percent of [[Ling Ao Nuclear Power Plant|Ling Ao]] Phase&amp;nbsp;2, 70&amp;nbsp;percent of [[Hongyanhe Nuclear Power Plant|Hongyanhe]], 80&amp;nbsp;percent of Ningde and 90&amp;nbsp;percent of [[Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant|Yangjiang Station]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cctv.com/program/bizchina/20090724/101260.shtml  | title= China aims to build its own nuclear power stations

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5101">In [[physics]], the '''pomeron''' is a [[Regge trajectory]] — a family of particles with increasing spin — postulated in 1961 to explain the slowly rising [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] of [[hadron]]ic collisions at high energies.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, E (1998).  [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9710546 ''Everything about reggeons.Part I: Reggeons in "soft" interaction'']  {{arXiv|hep-ph/9710546}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Isaak Pomeranchuk]].

==Overview==
While other trajectories lead to falling [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]], the pomeron can lead to logarithmically rising cross sections — which, experimentally, are approximately constant ones. The identification of the pomeron and the prediction of its properties was a major success of the [[Regge theory]] of [[strong interaction]] phenomenology. In later years, a '''BFKL pomeron'''&lt;ref&gt;E. Levin (1997) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9710546 Course notes]&lt;/ref&gt; was derived in further kinematic regimes from perturbative calculations in [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]], but its relationship to the pomeron seen in soft high energy scattering is still not fully understood.

One consequence of the pomeron hypothesis is that the cross sections of proton–proton and proton–antiproton scattering should be equal at high enough energies. This was demonstrated by the Soviet physicist [[Isaak Pomeranchuk]] by [[analytic continuation]] assuming only that the cross sections do not fall. The pomeron itself was introduced by [[Vladimir Gribov]], and it incorporated this theorem into [[Regge theory]]. [[Geoffrey Chew]] and [[Steven Frautschi]] introduced the pomeron in the West. The modern interpretation of [[Pomeranchuk's theorem]] is that the pomeron has no conserved charges—the particles on this trajectory have the [[quantum number]]s of the [[Vacuum#Quantum mechanics|vacuum]].

The pomeron was well accepted in the 1960s despite the fact that the measured cross sections of proton–proton and proton–antiproton scattering at the energies then available were unequal.

The pomeron carries no charges. The absence of electric charge implies that pomeron exchange does not lead to the usual shower of [[Cherenkov radiation]], while the absence of [[color charge]] implies that such events do not radiate [[pion]]s.

This is in accord with experimental observation. In high energy proton–proton and proton–antiproton collisions in which it is believed that pomerons have been exchanged, a ''rapidity gap'' is often observed: This is a large angular region in which no outgoing particles are detected.

The odderon, the counterpart of the pomeron that carries odd charge parity was introduced in 1973 by Leszek Łukaszuk and [[Basarab Nicolescu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Lettere al Nuovo Cimento | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | year = 1973 | pages = 405–413 | first1 = Leszek | last1 = Łukaszuk | first2 = Basarab | last2 = Nicolescu | title = A possible interpretation of pp rising total cross-sections | doi=10.1007/bf02824484}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was potentially observed only in 2017 by the [[TOTEM experiment]] at the [[LHC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Phys.

In early particle physics, the 'pomeron sector' was what is now called the '[[closed string]] sector' while what was called the '[[reggeon]] sector' is now the '[[Open string (physics)|open string]] theory'.

'''Prostanoic acid''' (7-[(1S,2S)-2-octylcyclopentyl]heptanoic acid) is a [[saturated fatty acid]] which contains a [[cyclopentane]] ring. Its [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]s are [[prostaglandin]]s - physiologically active [[lipid]] substances. Prostanoic acid is not found in nature, but it can be synthesized ''in vitro''.

== Synthesis ==
For the first time the synthesis of prostanoic acid from 1-formylcyclopentene was considered in detail in the scientific literature in 1975 by a group of French pharmacists.&lt;ref name=Wiki1&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hamon A |author2=Lacoume B |author3=Olivier A |author4=Pilgrim W.R. | title = Synthesis of prostanoic acid | journal = Tetrahedron Letters | volume = 16 | issue = 50 | pages = 4481–4482 | date = November 1975 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(00)91098-0 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403900910980 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, a group of Japanese scientists, who worked in the central research laboratory of the "Sankyo Co., Ltd." company ([[Shinagawa]], [[Tokyo]]), published another method for obtaining prostanoic acid from 2-[4-hydroxy-5-(methoxymethyl)cyclopent-2-en-1-yl] acetic acid.&lt;ref name=Wiki2&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sakai K, Inouye K, Nakamura N | title = Synthesis of (+)-prostanoic acid (1) | journal = Prostaglandins | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 399–401 | date = September 1976 | doi = 10.1016/0090-6980(76)90020-4 | pmid = 968053 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0090698076900204 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, a group of Japanese scientists from [[Kyushu University]] in [[Fukuoka]] proposed their own scheme for obtaining prostanoic acid from [[limonene]].&lt;ref name=Wiki3&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suemune H, Kawahara T, Sakai K | title = Conversion of limonene to prostanoic acid and 8-isoprostanoic acid | journal = Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 550–557 | date = February 1986 | doi = 10.1248/cpb.34.550 | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/cpb1958/34/2/34_2_550/_article | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox radium}}

'''Radium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Ra''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;88. It is the sixth element in [[alkaline earth metal|group 2]] of the [[periodic table]], also known as the [[alkaline earth metal]]s. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). All isotopes of radium are highly [[radioactive]], with the most stable [[isotope]] being [[radium-226]], which has a [[half-life]] of 1600 years and [[Radioactive decay|decays]] into [[radon]] gas (specifically the isotope [[radon-222]]). When radium decays, [[ionizing radiation]] is a product, which can excite [[fluorescent]] chemicals and cause [[radioluminescence]].

Radium, in the form of [[radium chloride]], was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in 1898. They extracted the radium compound from [[uraninite]] and published the discovery at the [[French Academy of Sciences]] five days later. Radium was isolated in its [[metal]]lic state by Marie Curie and [[André-Louis Debierne]] through the [[electrolysis]] of radium chloride in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/88/radium|title=Radium|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nature, radium is found in [[uranium]] and (to a lesser extent) [[thorium]] ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. Radium is not necessary for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity. Currently, other than its use in [[nuclear medicine]], radium has no commercial applications; formerly, it was used as a radioactive source for [[radioluminescent]] devices and also in [[radioactive quackery]] for its supposed curative powers. Today, these former applications are no longer in vogue because radium's toxicity has since become known, and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices.

==Bulk properties==
Radium is the heaviest known [[alkaline earth metal]] and is the only [[radioactive]] member of its group. Its physical and chemical properties most closely resemble its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] [[barium]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood112/&gt;

Pure radium is a [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] silvery-white metal, although its lighter congeners [[calcium]], [[strontium]], and [[barium]] have a slight yellow tint.&lt;ref name=Greenwood112&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Its color rapidly vanishes in air, yielding a black layer of [[radium nitride]] (Ra&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=k4&gt;Kirby et al., p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[melting point]] is either {{convert|700|°C}} or {{convert|960|°C}}{{efn|Both values are encountered in sources and there is no agreement among scientists as to the true value of the melting point of radium.}} and its [[boiling point]] is {{convert|1737|°C}}. Both of these values are slightly lower than those of barium, confirming [[periodic trend]]s down the group 2 elements.&lt;ref name="Lide2004"&gt;{{cite book|last = Lide|first=D. R. |title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition = 84th |location = Boca Raton (FL) |publisher = CRC Press |date = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-8493-0484-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like barium and the [[alkali metal]]s, radium crystallizes in the [[body-centered cubic]] structure at [[standard temperature and pressure]]: the radium–radium bond distance is 514.8&amp;nbsp;[[picometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weigel | first1 = F. | last2 = Trinkl | first2 = A. | year = 1968 | title =  Zur Kristallchemie des Radiums| doi = 10.1524/ract.1968.10.12.78 | journal = Radiochim.

These isotopes nevertheless still have half-lives too short to be [[primordial nuclide|primordial radionuclides]] and only exist in nature from these decay chains.&lt;ref name=k3&gt;Kirby et al., p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[synthetic radioisotope|artificial]] &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ra (15&amp;nbsp;d), these are the five most stable isotopes of radium.&lt;ref name=k3/&gt; All other known radium isotopes have half-lives under two hours, and the majority have half-lives under a minute.&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt; At least 12 [[nuclear isomer]]s have been reported; the most stable of them is radium-205m, with a half-life of between 130 and 230 milliseconds, which is still shorter than twenty-four [[ground state|ground-state]] radium isotopes.&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;

In the early history of the study of radioactivity, the different natural isotopes of radium were given different names. In this scheme, &lt;sup&gt;223&lt;/sup&gt;Ra was named actinium X (AcX), &lt;sup&gt;224&lt;/sup&gt;Ra thorium X (ThX), &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra radium (Ra), and &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra mesothorium 1 (MsTh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=k3/&gt; When it was realized that all of these are isotopes of the same element, many of these names fell out of use, and "radium" came to refer to all isotopes, not just &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra.&lt;ref name=k3/&gt; Some of radium-226's decay products received historical names including "radium", ranging from radium A to radium G, with the letter indicating approximately how far they were down the chain from their parent &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra.&lt;ref name=k3/&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra is the most stable isotope of radium and is the last isotope in the (4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) decay chain of uranium-238 with a half-life of over a millennium: it makes up almost all of natural radium. Its immediate decay product is the dense radioactive [[noble gas]] [[radon]], which is responsible for much of the danger of environmental radium.&lt;ref name=epa/&gt; It is 2.7 million times more radioactive than the same [[amount of substance|molar amount]] of natural [[uranium]] (mostly uranium-238), due to its proportionally shorter half-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ojaelt2o7AQC&amp;pg=PA139 | pages = 139– | title = The Interpretation of Radium | isbn = 978-0-486-43877-1 | author1 = Soddy | first1 = Frederick | date = 25 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t-fpKQ54f44C&amp;pg=PT115| pages = 115– | title = Radioactivity | isbn = 978-0-19-983178-4 |publisher=Oxford University Press| author1 = Malley | first1 = Marjorie C. | date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample of radium metal maintains itself at a higher [[temperature]] than its surroundings because of the radiation it emits&amp;nbsp;– [[alpha particles]], [[beta particles]], and [[gamma rays]]. More specifically, natural radium (which is mostly &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra) emits mostly alpha particles, but other steps in its decay chain (the [[Decay chain#Uranium series|uranium or radium series]]) emit alpha or beta particles, and almost all particle emissions are accompanied by gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=alC0vvE-ZUwC&amp;pg=PA133| pages = 133– | title = The Becquerel Rays and the Properties of Radium | isbn = 978-0-486-43875-7 | author1 = Strutt | first1 = R.

In 2013 it was discovered that the nucleus of Radium-224 is pear-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://home.cern/about/updates/2013/05/first-observations-short-lived-pear-shaped-atomic-nuclei|title=First observations of short-lived pear-shaped atomic nuclei – CERN|author=|date=|website=home.cern}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first discovery of an asymmetric nucleus.

==Chemistry==
Radium, like barium, is a highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] metal and always exhibits its group oxidation state of +2.&lt;ref name=k4/&gt; It forms the colorless Ra&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; [[cation]] in [[aqueous solution]], which is highly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] and does not form [[coordination complex|complexes]] readily.&lt;ref name=k4/&gt; Most radium compounds are therefore simple [[ionic bond|ionic]] compounds,&lt;ref name=k4/&gt; though participation from the 6s and 6p electrons (in addition to the valence 7s electrons) is expected due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] and would enhance the [[covalent bond|covalent]] character of radium compounds such as Ra[[fluorine|F]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ra[[astatine|At]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Thayer&gt;{{citation |last1=Thayer |first1=John S. |title=Relativistic Methods for Chemists |year=2010 |page=81 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9975-5_2|chapter=Relativistic Effects and the Chemistry of the Heavier Main Group Elements |isbn=978-1-4020-9974-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the [[standard electrode potential]] for the half-reaction Ra&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Ra (s) is −2.916&amp;nbsp;[[volt|V]], even slightly lower than the value −2.92&amp;nbsp;V for barium, whereas the values had previously smoothly increased down the group (Ca: −2.84&amp;nbsp;V; Sr: −2.89&amp;nbsp;V; Ba: −2.92&amp;nbsp;V).&lt;ref name=Greenwood111&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The values for barium and radium are almost exactly the same as those of the heavier alkali metals [[potassium]], [[rubidium]], and [[caesium]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood111/&gt;

===Compounds===
Solid radium compounds are white as radium ions provide no specific coloring, but they gradually turn yellow and then dark over time due to self-[[radiolysis]] from radium's [[alpha decay]].&lt;ref name=k4/&gt; Insoluble radium compounds [[Coprecipitation|coprecipitate]] with all barium, most [[strontium]], and most [[lead]] compounds.&lt;ref name=k8&gt;Kirby et al., p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radium oxide]] (RaO) has not been characterized well past its existence, despite oxides being common compounds for the other alkaline earth metals. [[Radium hydroxide]] (Ra(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most readily soluble among the alkaline earth hydroxides and is a stronger base than its barium congener, [[barium hydroxide]].&lt;ref name=k4to8&gt;Kirby et al., pp. 4–8&lt;/ref&gt; It is also more soluble than [[actinium hydroxide]] and [[thorium hydroxide]]: these three adjacent hydroxides may be separated by precipitating them with [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=k4to8/&gt;

[[Radium chloride]] (RaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a colorless, luminous compound. It becomes yellow after some time due to self-damage by the [[alpha radiation]] given off by radium when it decays. Small amounts of barium impurities give the compound a rose color.&lt;ref name=k4to8/&gt; It is soluble in water, though less so than [[barium chloride]], and its solubility decreases with increasing concentration of [[hydrochloric acid]]. Crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, isomorphous with its barium analog.&lt;ref name=k4to8/&gt;

[[Radium bromide]] (RaBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is also a colorless, luminous compound.&lt;ref name=k4to8/&gt; In water, it is more soluble than radium chloride. Like radium chloride, crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, isomorphous with its barium analog. The ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites [[nitrogen]] molecules in the air, making it glow. The [[alpha particle]]s emitted by radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral [[helium]], with builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals. This effect sometimes causes the crystals to break or even explode.&lt;ref name=k4to8/&gt;

[[Radium nitrate]] (Ra(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a white compound that can be made by dissolving [[radium carbonate]] in [[nitric acid]]. As the concentration of nitric acid increases, the solubility of radium nitrate decreases, an important property for the chemical purification of radium.&lt;ref name=k4to8/&gt;

Radium forms much the same insoluble salts as its lighter congener barium: it forms the insoluble [[radium sulfate|sulfate]] (RaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the most insoluble known sulfate), [[radium chromate|chromate]] (RaCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[radium carbonate|carbonate]] (RaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[radium iodate|iodate]] (Ra(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[radium tetrafluoroberyllate|tetrafluoroberyllate]] (RaBeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and nitrate (Ra(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). With the exception of the carbonate, all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts, but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts. Additionally, [[radium phosphate]], [[radium oxalate|oxalate]], and [[radium sulfite|sulfite]] are probably also insoluble, as they [[coprecipitation|coprecipitate]] with the corresponding insoluble barium salts.&lt;ref name=k8to9&gt;Kirby et al., pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The great insolubility of radium sulfate (at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, only 2.1&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] will dissolve in 1&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] of water) means that it is one of the less biologically dangerous radium compounds.&lt;ref name=k12&gt;Kirby et al., p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The large ionic radius of Ra&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (148&amp;nbsp;pm) results in weak complexation and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high pH.&lt;ref name=Ullmann97/&gt;

==Occurrence==
All isotopes of radium have half-lives much shorter than the [[age of the Earth]], so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago. Radium nevertheless still occurs [[Radium and radon in the environment|in the environment]], as the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;223&lt;/sup&gt;Ra, &lt;sup&gt;224&lt;/sup&gt;Ra, &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra, and &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes; since thorium and uranium have very long half-lives, these daughters are continually being regenerated by their decay.&lt;ref name=k3/&gt; Of these four isotopes, the longest-lived is &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra (half-life 1600&amp;nbsp;years), a decay product of natural uranium. Because of its relative longevity, &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra is the most common isotope of the element, making up about one [[parts per trillion|part per trillion]] of the Earth's crust; essentially all natural radium is &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra.&lt;ref name=Greenwood109/&gt; Thus, radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore [[uraninite]] and various other uranium [[minerals]], and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals. One [[ton]] of [[uraninite|pitchblende]] typically yields about one seventh of a [[gram]] of radium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://periodic.lanl.gov/88.shtml "Radium"], Los Alamos National Laboratory.

{{Details|Marie Curie#New elements}}
Radium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] by [[Marie Curie|Marie Sklodowska-Curie]] and her husband [[Pierre Curie]] on 21 December 1898, in a [[uraninite]] (pitchblende) sample.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Hammond, C. R. "Radium" in {{RubberBible92nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying the mineral earlier, the Curies removed uranium from it and found that the remaining material was still radioactive. They separated out an element similar to [[bismuth]] from pitchblende in July 1898, that turned out to be [[polonium]]. They then separated out a radioactive mixture consisting mostly of two components: compounds of [[barium]], which gave a brilliant green flame color, and unknown radioactive compounds which gave [[carmine]] [[spectral line]]s that had never been documented before. The Curies found the radioactive compounds to be very similar to the barium compounds, except that they were more insoluble. This made it possible for the Curies to separate out the radioactive compounds and discover a new element in them. The Curies announced their discovery to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] on 26 December 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1898|title=Sur une nouvelle substance fortement radio-active, contenue dans la pechblende (On a new, strongly radioactive substance contained in pitchblende)|journal=Comptes Rendus|volume= 127|pages= 1215–1217|url=http://www.aip.org/history/curie/discover.htm |accessdate=1 August 2009 |author=Curie, Pierre |author2=Curie, Marie |author3=Bémont, Gustave |last-author-amp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed010p79 | title = The discovery of the elements.

On September 1910, Marie Curie and [[André-Louis Debierne]] announced that they had isolated radium as a pure [[metal]] through the [[electrolysis]] of a pure radium [[chloride]] (RaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) solution using a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[cathode]], producing a radium–mercury [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]].&lt;ref name="ColbyChurchill1911"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Moore Colby|author2=Allen Leon Churchill|title=New International Yearbook: A Compendium of the World's Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWEMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA152|year=1911|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Co.|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amalgam was then heated in an atmosphere of [[hydrogen]] gas to remove the mercury, leaving pure radium metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Curie, Marie|author2=Debierne, André|last-author-amp=yes |year=1910|title=Sur le radium métallique" (On metallic radium)|journal=Comptes Rendus|volume=151 |pages=523–525 |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-3104&amp;I=523&amp;M=tdm |language=French|accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, E.

===Historical applications===
====Luminescent paint====
[[File:Radium-paint.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Self-luminous white paint which contains radium on the face and hand of an old clock.]]
[[File:Radium 2.jpg|thumb|Radium watch hands under ultraviolet light]]
Radium was formerly used in [[luminescence|self-luminous]] paints for watches, nuclear panels, aircraft switches, clocks, and instrument dials. A typical self-luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around 1 microgram of radium.&lt;ref name="PMC2024184" /&gt; In the mid-1920s, a lawsuit was filed against the [[United States Radium Corporation]] by five dying "[[Radium Girls]]" – dial painters who had painted radium-based [[luminous paint]] on the dials of watches and clocks. The dial painters were instructed to lick their brushes to give them a fine point, thereby ingesting radium.&lt;ref name=OakRidge&gt;Frame, Paul. [http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/radioluminescent/radioluminescentinfo.htm Radioluminescent Paint], [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities]]. Retrieved September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores, [[anemia]], and [[bone cancer]]. This is because radium is treated as [[calcium]] by the body, and [[bone seeker|deposited in the bones]], where radioactivity degrades [[bone marrow|marrow]] and can mutate [[bone cells]].&lt;ref name=epa/&gt;

During the litigation, it was determined that the company's scientists and management had taken considerable precautions to protect themselves from the effects of radiation, yet had not seen fit to protect their employees. Additionally, for several years the companies had attempted to cover up the effects and avoid liability by insisting that the Radium Girls were instead suffering from [[syphilis]]. This complete disregard for employee welfare had a significant impact on the formulation of [[occupational disease]] [[labor law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environmentalhistory.org/people/radiumgirls/|title=Environmental history timeline&amp;nbsp;– Radium Girls|accessdate=1 Sep 2018|date=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the lawsuit, the adverse effects of radioactivity became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear. In particular, dial painters no longer licked paint brushes to shape them (which caused some ingestion of radium salts). Radium was still used in dials as late as the 1960s, but there were no further injuries to dial painters. This highlighted that the harm to the Radium Girls could easily have been avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, R. E. (1995) [http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/documents/fullText/ACC0029.pdf Radium in humans: a review of U.S. studies]. Argonne National Laboratory. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s the use of radium paint was discontinued. In many cases luminous dials were implemented with non-radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light; such devices glow in the dark after exposure to light, but the glow fades.&lt;ref name=epa/&gt; Where long-lasting self-luminosity in darkness was required, safer radioactive [[promethium]]-147 (half-life 2.6 years) or [[tritium]] (half-life 12 years) paint was used; both continue to be used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man-made and natural radioactivity in environmental pollution and radiochronology|date = 2004|page = 78|isbn = 978-1-4020-1860-2|last1 = Tykva|first1 =  Richard|last2 =  Berg|first2 =  Dieter|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; These had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time, unlike radium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ru:Аналитическая химия технеция, прометия, астатина и франция |trans-title=Analytical Chemistry of Technetium, Promethium, Astatine, and Francium |language=Russian |first1=A.

Clocks, watches, and instruments dating from the first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint. They are usually no longer luminous; however, this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium (which has a half-life of 1600 years) but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium.&lt;ref name=emsley&gt;{{cite book|author=Emsley, John |title=Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA351|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850340-8|pages=351–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of an often thick layer of green or yellowish brown paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard. The radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk; but the paint is dangerous if released and inhaled or ingested.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130615033023/http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/489270/radium-Ra Radium].

{{Main|Radioactive quackery }}

Radium was once an additive in products such as toothpaste, hair creams, and even food items due to its supposed curative powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=1 August 2009|title=French Web site featuring products (medicines, mineral water, even underwear) containing radium|url=http://www.dissident-media.org/infonucleaire/radieux.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such products soon fell out of vogue and were prohibited by authorities in many countries after it was discovered they could have serious adverse health effects. (See, for instance, ''[[Radithor]]'' or ''[[Revigator]]'' types of "Radium water" or "Standard Radium Solution for Drinking".)&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; [[Destination spa|Spas]] featuring radium-rich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial, such as those in [[Misasa, Tottori]], Japan. In the U.S., nasal radium irradiation was also administered to children to prevent middle-ear problems or enlarged tonsils from the late 1940s through the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://baltimorechronicle.com/rupnose.html|title=Nasal Radium Irradiation of Children Has Health Fallout|last=Cherbonnier|first=Alice|date=1 October 1997|work=Baltimore Chronicle|accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical use====
Radium (usually in the form of [[radium chloride]] or [[radium bromide]]) was used in [[medicine]] to produce radon gas which in turn was used as a [[cancer]] treatment; for example, several of these radon sources were used in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=NtKUdnjaCxMC&amp;pg=PA135| title = An Element of Hope: Radium and the Response to Cancer in Canada, 1900–1940|first = Charles|last = Hayter|publisher = McGill-Queen's Press|date = 2005|isbn = 978-0-7735-2869-7|chapter = The Politics of Radon Therapy in the 1930s}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many treatments that were used in the early 1900s are not used anymore because of the harmful effects radium bromide exposure caused. Some examples of these effects are [[anaemia]], cancer, and [[mutation|genetic mutations]].&lt;ref name="Harvie"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0160-9327(99)01201-6| pmid = 10589294| title = The radium century| journal = Endeavour| volume = 23| issue = 3| pages = 100–5|year = 1999| last1 = Harvie| first1 = David I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safer gamma emitters such as [[cobalt-60|&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co]], which is less costly and available in larger quantities, are usually used today to replace the historical use of radium in this application.&lt;ref name=Ullmann97/&gt;

Early in the 1900s, biologists used radium to induce mutations and study [[genetics]]. As early as 1904, Daniel MacDougal used radium in an attempt to determine whether it could provoke sudden large mutations and cause major evolutionary shifts. [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] used radium to induce changes resulting in white-eyed fruit flies.
Nobel-winning biologist Hermann Muller briefly studied the effects of radium on fruit fly mutations before turning to more affordable x-ray experiments.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=Vivien|title=The Secrets of Life: Historian Luis Campos resurrects radium's role in early genetics research|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2 |pages=44–45 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-secrets-of-life|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Uranium had no large scale application in the late 19th century and therefore no large uranium mines existed. In the beginning the only large source for uranium ore was the [[silver]] mines in Joachimsthal, [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Jáchymov]], Czech Republic).&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; The uranium ore was only a [[byproduct]] of the mining activities.&lt;ref name=Ceranski&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00048-008-0308-z | title = Tauschwirtschaft, Reputationsökonomie, Bürokratie |year = 2008 | last1 = Ceranski | first1 = Beate | journal = NTM Zeitschrift für Geschichte der Wissenschaften, Technik und Medizin | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first extraction of radium Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, which is similar to barium sulfate but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to remove as much as possible of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate carrying the radium, thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution the barium and radium are reprecipitated as sulfates and this was repeated one or few times, for further purification of the mixed sulfate. Some impurities, that form insoluble sulfides, were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfate were pure enough they were once more converted to mixed chloride and barium and radium were separated by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallisation]] while monitoring the progress using a [[spectroscope]] (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the [[electroscope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lateralscience.blogspot.se/2012/11/marie-curie-method-of-extraction-of.html "Lateral Science"]. ''lateralscience.blogspot.se''. November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

After the isolation of radium by Marie and Pierre Curie from uranium ore from Joachimsthal several scientists started to isolate radium in small quantities. Later small companies purchased mine tailings from Joachimsthal mines and started isolating radium. In 1904 the Austrian government [[nationalization|nationalised]] the mines and stopped exporting raw ore. For some time radium availability was low.&lt;ref name="Ceranski"/&gt;

The formation of an Austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries to have access to radium led to a worldwide search for uranium ores. The United States took over as leading producer in the early 1910s. The [[Carnotite]] sands in [[Colorado]] provide some of the element, but richer ores are found in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and the area of the [[Great Bear Lake]] and the [[Great Slave Lake]] of northwestern Canada.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor =  40796935|author=Just, Evan|author2=Swain, Philip W.|author3=Kerr, William A.|last-author-amp=yes |journal=Financial Analysts Journal|volume=8|issue=1|year=1952 |pages=85–93|title=Peacetíme Impact of Atomíc Energy | doi =  10.2469/faj.v8.n1.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of the deposits is mined for radium but the uranium content makes mining profitable.

The Curies' process was still used for industrial radium extraction in 1940, but mixed bromides were then used for the fractionation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed017p417| title = Extraction of radium from Canadian pitchblende| journal = Journal of Chemical Education| volume = 17| issue = 9| pages = 417| year = 1940| last1 = Kuebel | first1 = A. | bibcode = 1940JChEd..17..417K}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the barium content of the uranium ore is not high enough it is easy to add some to carry the radium.

==Modern applications==
Some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties. More recently discovered [[radioisotope]]s, such as [[cobalt-60]] and [[caesium-137]], are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters, safer to handle, and available in more concentrated form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url  =  https://books.google.com/books?id=3cT2REdXJ98C&amp;pg=PA24| page =24 | title  =  Radiation source use and replacement: Abbreviated version | isbn  =  978-0-309-11014-3 | author1  =  Committee On Radiation Source Use And Replacement | first1  =  National Research Council (U.S.) | last2  =  Nuclear And Radiation Studies Board | first2  =  National Research Council (U.S.) | date  =  January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url  = https://books.google.com/books?id=bk0go_-FO5QC&amp;pg=PA8| page =8 | title  = Radiation therapy planning | isbn  = 978-0-07-005115-7 | author1  = Bentel | first1  = Gunilla Carleson | date  = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The isotope &lt;sup&gt;223&lt;/sup&gt;Ra (under the trade name [[Xofigo]]) was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 2013 for use in [[medicine]] as a [[cancer]] treatment of bone [[metastasis]].&lt;ref name=FBT-FDA2013&gt;{{Cite web |title=FDA OKs pinpoint prostate cancer radiation drug Xofigo from Bayer, Algeta |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/breaking-fda-oks-pinpoint-prostate-cancer-radiation-drug-xofigo-bayer-alget/2013-05-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gdfdbr1u?url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/breaking-fda-oks-pinpoint-prostate-cancer-radiation-drug-xofigo-bayer-alget/2013-05-15 |archivedate=15 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |access-date=1 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130706233317/http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/news/fda-approves-xofigo-for-advanced-prostate-cancer "FDA Approves Xofigo for Advanced Prostate Cancer"]. cancer.org.

==Hazards==
Radium is highly radioactive and its immediate daughter, [[radon]] gas, is also radioactive. When ingested, 80% of the ingested radium leaves the body through the [[feces]], while the other 20% goes into the [[bloodstream]], mostly accumulating in the bones.&lt;ref name=epa/&gt; Exposure to radium, internal or external, can cause cancer and other disorders, because radium and radon emit alpha and [[gamma ray]]s upon their decay, which kill and mutate cells.&lt;ref name=epa/&gt; At the time of the [[Manhattan Project]] in 1944, the "tolerance dose" for workers was set at 0.1 micrograms of ingested radium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Weisgall, Jonathan M.|title=Operation crossroads: the atomic tests at Bikini Atoll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K63bAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 August 2011|date=1994|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-55750-919-2|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3579805| first =Shirley A. | last =Fry| title = Supplement: Madame Curie's Discovery of Radium (1898): A Commemoration by Women in Radiation Sciences | journal =Radiation Research | volume= 150 | issue = 5 |year = 1998 | pages = S21–S29 | pmid = 9806606| jstor =3579805 | bibcode =1998RadR..150S..21F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/documents/fullText/ACC0029.pdf--&gt;

Some of the biological effects of radium were apparent from the start. The first case of so-called "radium-dermatitis" was reported in 1900, only 2 years after the element's discovery. The French physicist [[Antoine Becquerel]] carried a small ampoule of radium in his waistcoat pocket for 6 hours and reported that his skin became [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerated]]. Pierre and Marie Curie were so intrigued by radiation that they sacrificed their own health to learn more about it. Pierre Curie attached a tube filled with radium to his arm for ten hours, which resulted in the appearance of a skin lesion, suggesting the use of radium to attack cancerous tissue as it had attacked healthy tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redniss|first1=Lauren|title=Radioactive: Marie &amp; Pierre Curie: A Tale Of Love And Fallout|date=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-135132-7|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handling of radium has been blamed for Marie Curie's death due to [[aplastic anemia]]. A significant amount of radium's danger comes from its daughter radon: being a gas, it can enter the body far more readily than can its parent radium.&lt;ref name=epa/&gt;

Today, &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra is considered to be the most toxic of the quantity radioelements, and it must be handled in tight glove boxes with significant airstream circulation that is then treated to avoid escape of its daughter &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn to the environment. Old ampoules containing radium solutions must be opened with care because radiolytic decomposition of water can produce an overpressure of hydrogen and oxygen gas.&lt;ref name=Ullmann97&gt;{{Ullmann | first1=Cornelius |last1=Keller |first2=Walter |last2=Wolf |first3=Jashovam |last3=Shani | title = Radionuclides, 2.

In [[nuclear physics]], '''separation energy''' is the energy needed to remove one [[nucleon]] (or other specified particle or particles) from a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]].

The separation energy is different for each nuclide and particle to be removed. Values are stated as "neutron separation energy", "two-neutron separation energy", "proton separation energy", "deuteron separation energy", "alpha separation energy", and so on.

The lowest separation energy among stable nuclides is 1.67MeV, to remove a neutron from beryllium-9.

The energy can be added to the nucleus by an incident high-energy [[gamma ray]]. If the energy of the incident photon exceeds the separation energy, a [[photodisintegration]] might occur. Energy in excess of the threshold value becomes kinetic energy of the ejected particle.

By contrast, [[nuclear binding energy]] is the energy needed to completely disassemble a nucleus, or the energy released when a nucleus is assembled from nucleons. It is the sum of multiple separation energies, which should add to the same total regardless of the order of assembly or disassembly.

==Physics and chemistry==
Electron separation energy or electron binding energy, the energy required to remove one electron from a neutral atom or molecule (or cation) is called [[ionization energy]]. The reaction leads to [[photoionization]], [[photodissociation]], [[photoelectric effect]], [[photovoltaics]], etc.

[[Bond-dissociation energy]] is the energy required to break one [[chemical bond|bond]] of a molecule or ion, usually separating an atom or atoms.

. Adding short fibers to thermoplastic resins improves the composite performance for lightweight applications.&lt;ref name="Struct" /&gt; In addition, short fiber thermoplastic composites are easier and cheaper to produce than continuous fiber reinforced composites.&lt;ref name="Struct" /&gt; This compromise between cost and performance allows short fiber reinforced thermoplastics to be used in myriad applications.

== Mechanical properties ==

Mechanical properties of short fiber reinforced composites depend critically on the fiber length distribution (FLD) and the fiber orientation distribution (FOD).&lt;ref name="Fu2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fu | first1 = S. | last2 = Lauke | first2 = B. | year = 1996 | title = Effects of fiber length and fiber orientation distributions on the [[tensile strength]] of short-fiber-reinforced polymers | doi = 10.1016/S0266-3538(96)00072-3 | journal = Composites Science and Technology | volume = 56 | issue = 10| pages = 1179–1190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the strength of short fiber reinforced composites increases with the increase of the mean fiber length and with the decrease of the mean fiber orientation angle  (angle between the fiber axis and the loading direction).&lt;ref name="Fu2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of fiber orientation and anisotropy on tensile strength and elastic modulus of short fiber reinforced polymer composites|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359836814005642|journal = Composites Part B: Engineering|date = 2015-04-01|pages = 116–129|volume = 72|doi = 10.1016/j.compositesb.2014.11.041|first = Seyyedvahid|last = Mortazavian|first2 = Ali|last2 = Fatemi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[elastic modulus]] (E) of misaligned short fiber reinforced polymer composites depends on the distributions of fiber lengths and orientations within the composite structure.&lt;ref name="Fu1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fu | first1 = S. | last2 = Lauke | first2 = B. | year = 1998 | title = The elastic modulus of misaligned short-fiber-reinforced polymers | doi = 10.1016/S0266-3538(97)00129-2 | journal = Composites Science and Technology | volume = 58 | issue = 3-4| pages = 389–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the composite elastic modulus increases with the decrease of the mean fiber orientation angle and with the increase of the fiber orientation coefficient; and the elastic modulus increases with the increase of mean fiber length when the mean fiber length is small. When the mean fiber length is large, it has nearly no influence on the elastic modulus of short fiber reinforced composites.&lt;ref name="Fu1" /&gt;

== Aspect ratio ==

An important characterizing parameter of short fiber composites is the aspect ratio (s)  defined as the ratio between the length (l) and the diameter (d) of the fibers used as reinforcement:
:&lt;math&gt;s =\frac{l}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
The value of s can vary depending on fiber type and design, assuming values from approximately 50 to 500.&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;D.Hull, T.W. Clyne. An introduction to composite materials: Cambridge University Press, 1996. https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Composite_Materials.html?id=BRcdDu4bUhMC&lt;/ref&gt; Aspect ratios can affect properties such as the [[Stress strain curve|strain to failure]] and toughness. A higher aspect ratio will result in lower values of strain at failure and toughness, due to angular particles inducing crack formation.&lt;ref name="Orefice"&gt;Oréfice, R. L., L. L. Hench, and A. B. Brennan. "Effect of Particle Morphology on the Mechanical and Thermo-Mechanical Behavior of Polymer Composites."Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences 23.1 (2001): n. pag. Web. 3 Dec. 2014. http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-73862001000100001&amp;script=sci_arttext.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Void formation ==

Short fiber reinforced composites are used increasingly as a structural material because they provide superior mechanical properties and can be easily produced by the rapid, low-cost injection molding process, by extrusion and with [[Fiberglass spray lay-up process|spray-up]] technique.&lt;ref name="Vaxman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vaxman | first1 = A. | last2 = Narkis | first2 = M. | last3 = Siegmann | first3 = A. | last4 = Kenig | first4 = S. | year = 1989 | title = Void formation in short-fiber thermoplastic composites | url = | journal = Polym Compos | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 449–453 | doi = 10.1002/pc.750100609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important issue for short fiber thermoplastic composites is void formation and growth during production processes. It has been shown that voids tend to nucleate at fiber ends, and their content depends on processing conditions, fiber concentration, and fiber length.&lt;ref name="Vaxman"/&gt; For example, in an injection molding process bubble growth is suppressed by cooling the material under pressure. Density measurements confirm a much lower void content  (-1%) in the injection-molded samples in comparison with the extrudates.&lt;ref name="Vaxman"/&gt; 
Another factor playing an important role in void formation is the cooling rate. While the melt is cooled external surface layers solidify first. These layers restrain the contraction of material within the melt. This leads to internal voiding. As a result, slower cooling rates decrease void content in the composite. Finally, in an extruded structure, longer fibers result in higher void contents. This unexpected behaviour&lt;ref name="Vaxman"/&gt; is due to the overcoming of other factors like viscosity, extrusion pressure and shear rate, which make the analysis on this phenomenon very complicated.

== Simulations and modelling ==

Short fiber thermoplastics can be modelled as a matrix with fiber inclusions.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaiser | first1 = J. | last2 = Stommel | first2 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Modified mean-field formulations for the improved simulation of short fiber reinforced thermoplastics | doi = 10.1016/j.compscitech.2014.05.010 | journal = Composites Science and Technology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 75–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the inclusion model, the stress within the material is proportional to the product of inclusion volume fraction and the stress within a single inclusion.&lt;ref name="Mori"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mori | first1 = T. | last2 = Tanaka | first2 = K. | year = 1973 | title = Average stress in matrix and average elastic energy of materials with misfitting inclusions | url = | journal = Acta Metallurgica | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 571–574 | doi = 10.1016/0001-6160(73)90064-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the stress within the composite is proportional to the fiber volume fraction and the stress on a single fiber. Using [[Mean Field Theory]] and the Mori-Tanaka model, the stresses within a short fiber thermoplastic can be modelled computationally.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;
Assuming the matrix is a [[newtonian material]], the creep from an applied shear stress can be approximated from equilibrium thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ghosh | first1 = T. | last2 = Grmela | first2 = M. | last3 = Carreau | first3 = P. J. | year = 1995 | title = Rheology of Short Fiber Filled Thermoplastics | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pc.750160206/pdf | journal = Polymer Composites | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 144–153 | doi=10.1002/pc.750160206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will yield information about the composite’s [[rheological]] response.

== Applications and processing ==

Short fiber reinforced thermoplastics have a broad range of applications due to fiber reinforcement properties.&lt;ref name="Unterweger" /&gt; Short fiber thermoplastics are able to withstand up to 30,000 psi of applied tensile load and have an elastic modulus on the order of 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; psi.&lt;ref name="Struct" /&gt; They are ideal for applications for which toughness is of critical importance, high volume production is involved, and long shelf life and scrap recycling are important issues.&lt;ref name="Struct" /&gt; With all of these performance capabilities, one of the greatest advantages to using short fiber reinforced thermoplastics is their ease of processing and reprocessability.&lt;ref name="Struct" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fatigue behavior and modeling of short fiber reinforced polymer composites: A literature review|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142112314002564|journal = International Journal of Fatigue|date = 2015-01-01|pages = 297–321|volume = 70|doi = 10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2014.10.005|first = Seyyedvahid|last = Mortazavian|first2 = Ali|last2 = Fatemi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ease of processing has been the key factor to the widespread use of short fiber reinforced thermoplastics.&lt;ref name="Unterweger" /&gt; Effective processing techniques and the ability to recycle scrap offer significant cost reductions that compare to those of thermoset compounds and metals. Because of this, short fiber reinforced thermoplastics are desired in the electrical and electronic, automotive, oilfield, chemical process, and defense industries.&lt;ref name="Struct" /&gt; Although short fiber thermoplastics have progressed considerably over the years and have a secured spot in a colossally-sized market, further refinement of compounding and process technology along with improvements in part design could allow the performance window of these materials to widen significantly, allowing them to be used for more applications in the future.

== Morphology ==
Injection molding is a traditional cost effective method for manufacturing of short fiber thermoplastics. The processing conditions such as mold temperature and pressure as well as filling time, the part geometry, position and number of injection gates are main factors influencing distribution of fibers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, depending on the total thickness of the manufactured parts as well as the distance from mold wall, different fiber orientation distributions can be observed. In a thin layer in mid-thickness fiber orientations are preferably perpendicular to the mold flow direction, while in two near wall thicknesses fibers are preferably in line with the mold flow direction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Self-heating ==
An aspect of thermoplastics which distinguishes them from metallic materials is their time dependent properties as well as relatively low melting temperatures. As a result, the frequency at which a load is applied or rate of applied load is a determining factor on mechanical properties of such materials. Due to low thermal conductivity of thermoplastics, the generated heat due to energy dissipation under applying load results in self-heating or thermal degradation.In short fiber thermoplastics, the frictional heating between fiber and matrix as well as a higher intensity of stress near fiber ends increase the degree of self-heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effect of cycling frequency and self-heating on fatigue behavior of reinforced and unreinforced thermoplastic polymers|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pen.24124/abstract|journal = Polymer Engineering &amp; Science|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1548-2634|pages = 2355–2367|volume = 55|issue = 10|doi = 10.1002/pen.24124|language = en|first = Seyyedvahid|last = Mortazavian|first2 = Ali|last2 = Fatemi|first3 = Stephen R.|last3 = Mellott|first4 = Abolhassan|last4 = Khosrovaneh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4563">In [[electricity distribution]] networks, '''spot network substations''' are used in  interconnected distribution networks. They have the secondary network (also called a grid network) with all supply [[transformer]]s bussed together on the secondary side at one location.  Spot networks are considered the most reliable and most flexible arrangement of connecting power to all types of loads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-61697-14555/unrestricted/Ch2.pdf Cugnet, Pierre: Master's Thesis - Power Distribution Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;  Switching can be done without interrupting the power to the loads.

==Description==
Electricity distribution networks are typically of two types, radial or interconnected. A radial network arranges the station and branches like a tree with no connection to any other supply. This is typical of long rural lines with isolated load areas. In general, the radial distribution network has more power failures than the interconnected distribution networks.

In a [[secondary network]] the transformers are distributed across an area (e.g. in streets) and have multiple supplies. The transformers are wired together on the secondary side. The system is arranged so that nearby transformers do not use the same feeder. In case of an issue with a feeder (or transformer) the load is fed by nearby transformers, so there is no interruption, perhaps some voltage drop. Usually a fault on the secondary side is not a big problem since the conductors will destroy themselves.

A '''spot network''' is basically a secondary network condensed to a point. Several transformers have multiple supplies and their secondaries are bussed together. Besides a region-wide [[Power outage|blackout]], they are vulnerable to a bus fault, which is extremely rare. The simplest case is where each transformer connects to one feeder and vice versa ("unit system"). High-voltage switching can be used to handle more cases, e.g., working transformer but faulty feeder or the reverse.

Urban (spot) network substations can be used to make interconnected distribution networks to serve a single facility.  Examples of such single facilities include airports, [[hospitals]], major data processing centers (especially those using [[uninterruptible power supply]]), and sports arenas that regularly broadcast nationally televised events.

In large cities, many electric [[Utility company|utility companies]] use grid feeders to make interconnected distribution networks to serve the downtown core.  The interconnected network has multiple connections to the points of supply.

[[Network protector]]s, (reverse current relays), are used to detect any open circuits that are letting the electrical current flow back towards its source.

==Examples==
A local spot network of two to eight primary transformers can be connected to the same secondary bus to provide reliable power to a particular facility, like a large hospital or computer and major data processing center.  [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] has eight primary transformers that are connected to the same secondary bus. The [[FedExForum]] (home of the NBA Grizzlies basketball team) in Memphis has a network of four primary transformers connected to the same secondary bus. In some arrangements with four transformers, any of the transformers can carry all of its connected loads.  The [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] is electrically fed by four grid feeders, each capable of carrying the entire 20+ MW load.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arup.com/_assets/_download/download282.pdf Toronto Pearson International Airport, see page 13 of 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14189">In [[electrical engineering]], the method of '''symmetrical components''' simplifies analysis of unbalanced [[three-phase]] power systems under both normal and abnormal conditions. The basic idea is that an asymmetrical set of ''N'' [[phasor]]s can be expressed as a [[linear combination]] of ''N'' symmetrical sets of phasors by means of a [[complex number|complex]] [[linear transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpEeycYeWJIC&amp;pg=PT244 |title=Power Systems and Restructuring |last1=Hadjsaïd |first1=Nouredine |first2=Jean-Claude |last2=Sabonnadière |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2013 |ISBN=9781118599921 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the most common case of three-phase systems, the resulting "symmetrical" components are referred to as ''direct'' (or ''positive''), ''inverse'' (or ''negative'') and ''zero'' (or ''homopolar''). The analysis of power system is much simpler in the domain of symmetrical components, because the resulting equations are mutually [[linearly independent]] if the circuit itself is [[balanced circuit|balanced]].{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==Description==
[[File:Unbalanced symmetrical components.pdf|thumb|400px|Set of three unbalanced phasors, and the necessary symmetrical components that sum up to the resulting plot at the bottom.]]

In 1918 [[Charles Legeyt Fortescue]] presented a paper&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Fortescue, "[http://www.energyscienceforum.com/files/fortescue/methodofsymmetrical.pdf Method of Symmetrical Co-Ordinates Applied to the Solution of Polyphase Networks]".  Presented at the 34th annual convention of the AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers) in Atlantic City, N.J. on 28 June 1918.  Published in: ''AIEE Transactions'', vol. 37, part II, pages 1027–1140 (1918). For a brief history of the early years of symmetrical component theory, see: J. Lewis Blackburn, ''Symmetrical Components for Power Engineering'' (Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, 1993), pages 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; which demonstrated that any set of N unbalanced [[phasor]]s (that is, any such ''[[Polyphase system|polyphase]]'' signal) could be expressed as the sum of N symmetrical sets of balanced phasors, for values of N that are prime. Only a single frequency component is represented by the phasors. 

In 1943 [[Edith Clarke]] published a textbook giving a method of use of symmetrical components for three-phase systems that greatly simplified calculations over the original Fortescue paper. &lt;ref&gt; Gabriele Kass-Simon, Patricia Farnes, Deborah Nash (ed), ''Women of Science: Righting the Record'' , Indiana University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0253208130}}. pages 164-168 &lt;/ref&gt;  In a three-phase system, one set of phasors has the same [[phase sequence]] as the system under study (positive sequence; say ABC), the  second set has the reverse phase sequence (negative sequence; ACB), and in the third set the phasors A, B and C are in phase with each other (zero sequence, the [[common-mode signal]]). Essentially, this method converts three unbalanced phases into three independent sources, which makes [[Fault (power engineering)#Asymmetric_fault|asymmetric fault]] analysis more tractable.

By expanding a [[one-line diagram]] to show the positive sequence, negative sequence and zero sequence impedances of [[Electrical generator|generator]]s, [[transformer]]s and other devices including [[Overhead power line|overhead lines]] and [[electrical cable|cable]]s, analysis of such unbalanced conditions as a single line to ground short-circuit fault is greatly simplified.  The technique can also be extended to higher order phase systems.

Physically, in a three phase winding a positive sequence set of currents produces a normal rotating field, a negative sequence set produces a field with the opposite rotation, and the zero sequence set produces a field that oscillates but does not rotate between phase windings. Since these effects can be detected physically with sequence filters, the mathematical tool became the basis for the design of [[protective relay]]s, which used negative-sequence voltages and currents as a reliable indicator of fault conditions. Such  relays may be used to trip [[circuit breaker]]s or take other steps to protect electrical systems.

The analytical technique was adopted and advanced by engineers at [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] and after [[World War II]] it became an accepted method for asymmetric fault analysis.

As shown in the figure to the above right, the three sets of symmetrical components (positive, negative, and zero sequence) add up to create the system of three unbalanced phases as pictured in the bottom of the diagram. The imbalance between phases arises because of the difference in magnitude and phase shift between the sets of vectors. Notice that the colors (red, blue, and yellow) of the separate sequence vectors correspond to three different phases (A, B, and C, for example). To arrive at the final plot, the sum of vectors of each phase is calculated. This resulting vector is the effective phasor representation of that particular phase. This process, repeated, produces the phasor for each of the three phases.

Symmetrical components are most commonly used for analysis of [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase electrical power systems]]. The voltage or current of a three-phase system at some point can be indicated by three phasors, called the three components of the voltage or the current.  

This article discusses voltage, however, the same considerations also apply to current.  In a perfectly balanced three-phase power system, the voltage phasor components have equal magnitudes but are 120 degrees apart. In an unbalanced system, the magnitudes and phases of the voltage phasor components are different. 

Decomposing the voltage phasor components into a set of symmetrical components helps analyze the system as well as visualize any imbalances. 
If the three voltage components are expressed as [[phasor]]s (which are complex numbers), a complex vector can be formed in which the three phase components are the components of the vector. A vector for three phase voltage components can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{abc} = \begin{bmatrix} V_a \\ V_b \\ V_c \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and decomposing the vector into three symmetrical components gives
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} V_a \\ V_b \\ V_c \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} V_{a,0} \\ V_{b,0} \\ V_{c,0} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} V_{a,1} \\ V_{b,1} \\ V_{c,1} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} V_{a,2} \\ V_{b,2} \\ V_{c,2} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 refer respectively to the zero, positive, and negative sequence components.  The sequence components differ only by their phase angles, which are symmetrical and so are &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\frac{2}{3}\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians or 120°. 

===A matrix===
Define a phasor rotation operator [[alpha]], which rotates a phasor vector counterclockwise by 120 degrees:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \equiv e^{\frac{2}{3}\pi i}&lt;/math&gt;.
Note that &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 so that &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The zero sequence components have equal magnitude and in phase with each other, therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;V_0 \equiv V_{a,0} = V_{b,0} = V_{c,0}&lt;/math&gt;,

and the other phase sequences have the same magnitude, but their phases differ by 120°:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 V_1 &amp;\equiv V_{a,1} = \alpha V_{b,1} = \alpha^2 V_{c,1}\\
 V_2 &amp;\equiv V_{a,2} = \alpha^2 V_{b,2} = \alpha V_{c,2}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \mathbf{v}_{abc}
 &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} V_0 \\ V_0 \\ V_0 \end{bmatrix} +
    \begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ \alpha^2 V_1 \\ \alpha V_1 \end{bmatrix} +
    \begin{bmatrix} V_2 \\ \alpha V_2 \\ \alpha^2 V_2 \end{bmatrix} \\
 &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; \alpha^2 &amp; \alpha \\ 1 &amp; \alpha &amp; \alpha^2 \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} V_0 \\ V_1 \\ V_2 \end{bmatrix} \\
 &amp;= \textbf{A} \mathbf{v}_{012}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{012} = \begin{bmatrix} V_0 \\ V_1 \\ V_2 \end{bmatrix}, \textbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; \alpha^2 &amp; \alpha \\ 1 &amp; \alpha &amp; \alpha^2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Decomposition===
The sequence components are derrived from the analysis equation
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{012} = \textbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_{abc} &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{3} \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; \alpha &amp; \alpha^2 \\ 1 &amp; \alpha^2 &amp; \alpha \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The above two equations tell how to derive symmetrical components corresponding to an asymmetrical set of three phasors:

*Sequence 0 is one-third the sum of the original three phasors.
*Sequence 1 is one-third the sum of the original three phasors rotated counterclockwise 0°, 120°, and 240°.
*Sequence 2 is one-third the sum of the original three phasors rotated clockwise 0°, 240°, and 120°.

Visually, if the original components are symmetrical, sequences 1 and 2 will each form a triangle, summing to zero, and sequence 0 components will sum to a straight line.

===Intuition===
[[Image:Napoleon's theorem.svg|thumb|Napoleon's theorem: If the triangles centered on ''L'', ''M'', and ''N'' are equilateral, then so is the green triangle.]]
The phasors &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V_{(ab)}= V_{(a)}-V_{(b)}; \;V_{(bc)}= V_{(b)}-V_{(c)}; \; V_{(ca)}= V_{(c)}-V_{(a)}&lt;/math&gt; form a closed triangle (e.g., outer voltages or line to line voltages). To find the synchronous and inverse components of the phases, take any side of the outer triangle and draw  the two possible equilateral triangles sharing the selected side as base. These two equilateral triangles represent a synchronous and an inverse system. 

If the phasors V were a perfectly synchronous system, the vertex of the outer triangle not on the base line would be at the same position as the corresponding vertex of the equilateral triangle representing the synchronous system. Any amount of inverse component would mean a deviation from this position. The deviation is exactly 3 times the inverse phase component. 

The synchronous component is in the same manner 3 times the deviation from the "inverse equilateral triangle". The directions of these components are correct for the relevant phase. It seems counter intuitive that this works for all three phases regardless of the side chosen but that is the beauty of this illustration.

The illustration is from [[Napoleon's Theorem]].

==Poly-phase case==
It can be seen that the transformation matrix above is a [[discrete Fourier transform]], and as such, symmetrical components can be calculated for any poly-phase system.  However, by [[Pontryagin duality]], only certain groups have a unique inverse, which is necessary for use in fault analysis.

==Contribution of harmonics to symmetrical components in 3-phase power systems==
[[Harmonics (electrical power)|Harmonics]] often occur in power systems as a consequence of non-linear loads. Each order of harmonics contributes to different sequence components. Harmonics of order &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2n&lt;/math&gt; make no contribution. Harmonics of order &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 3+6n&lt;/math&gt; contribute to the zero sequence. Harmonics of order &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 5+6n&lt;/math&gt; contribute to the negative sequence. Harmonics of order &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 7+6n&lt;/math&gt; contribute to the positive sequence.

Note that the rules above are only applicable if the phase values (or distortion) are exactly the same.

==Consequence of the zero sequence component in power systems==
The zero sequence represents the component of the unbalanced phasors that is equal in magnitude and phase. Because they are in phase, zero sequence currents flowing through an n-phase network will sum to n times the magnitude of the individual zero sequence currents components. Under normal operating conditions this sum is small enough to be negligible. However, during large zero sequence events such as lightning strikes, this nonzero sum of currents can lead to a larger current flowing through the neutral conductor than the individual phase conductors. Because neutral conductors are typically not larger than individual phase conductors, and are often smaller than these conductors, a large zero sequence component can lead to overheating of neutral conductors and to fires.

One way to prevent large zero sequence currents is to use a delta connection, which appears as an open circuit to zero sequence currents. For this reason, most transmission, and much sub-transmission is implemented using delta. Much distribution is also implemented using delta, although "old work" distribution systems have occasionally been "wyed-up" (converted from [[Delta-wye transformer|delta]] to [[Delta-wye transformer|wye]]) so as to increase the line's capacity at a low converted cost, but at the expense of a higher central station protective relay cost.

'''Terrestrial Time''' ('''TT''') is a modern astronomical [[time standard]] defined by the [[IAU|International Astronomical Union]], primarily for time-measurements of astronomical observations made from the surface of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;The 1991 definition refers to the scale agreeing with the SI second "on the geoid", i.e. close to mean sea level on Earth's surface, see [http://iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1991_French.pdf IAU 1991 XXIst General Assembly (Buenos Aires) Resolutions], Resolution A.4 (Recommendation IV).  A redefinition by [http://syrte.obspm.fr/IAU_resolutions/Resol-UAI.htm resolution of the IAU 2000 24th General Assembly (Manchester)], at Resolution B1.9, is in different terms intended for continuity and to come very close to the same standard.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the [[Astronomical Almanac]] uses TT for its tables of positions ([[ephemeris|ephemerides]]) of the Sun, Moon and planets as seen from Earth. In this role, TT continues '''Terrestrial Dynamical Time''' (TDT or TD),&lt;ref name=iau1991-4-n4&gt;TT is equivalent to TDT, see IAU conference 1991, Resolution A4, recommendation IV, note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn succeeded [[Ephemeris time|ephemeris time (ET)]]. TT shares the original purpose for which ET was designed, to be free of the [[ΔT|irregularities in the rotation of Earth]].

The unit of TT is the [[Second#International second|SI second]], the definition of which is currently based on the caesium [[atomic clock]],&lt;ref name=iau1991-4-2&gt;IAU conference 1991, Resolution A4, recommendation IV, part 2 states that the unit for TT is to agree with the SI second 'on the geoid'.&lt;/ref&gt; but TT is not itself defined by atomic clocks.  It is a theoretical ideal, and real clocks can only approximate it.

TT is distinct from the time scale often used as a basis for civil purposes, [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).  TT indirectly underlies UTC, via [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI).  Because of the historical difference between TAI and ET when TT was introduced, TT is approximately 32.184 s ahead of TAI.

==History==

A definition of a terrestrial time standard was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in 1976 at its XVI General Assembly, and later named ''Terrestrial Dynamical Time'' (TDT).  It was the counterpart to [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]] (TDB), which was a time standard for Solar system [[ephemerides]], to be based on a [[dynamical time scale]].  Both of these time standards turned out to be imperfectly defined.  Doubts were also expressed about the meaning of 'dynamical' in the name TDT.

In 1991, in [http://www.iers.org/MainDisp.csl?pid=98-134 Recommendation IV of the XXI General Assembly], the IAU redefined TDT, also renaming it "Terrestrial Time".  TT was formally defined in terms of [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), defined by the IAU on the same occasion.  TT was defined to be a linear scaling of TCG, such that the unit of TT is the SI second on the [[geoid]] (Earth surface at mean sea level).  This left the exact ratio between TT time and TCG time as something to be determined by experiment.  Experimental determination of the [[gravitational potential]] at the geoid surface is a task in [[physical geodesy]].

In 2000, the IAU very slightly altered the definition of TT by adopting an exact value for the ratio between TT and TCG time, as 1 − {{val|6.969290134}} × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiron.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~toshio/iaudiv1/IAU_resolutions/Resol-UAI.htm Resolution B1.9 of the IAU XXIV General Assembly, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; (As measured on the geoid surface, the rate of TCG is very slightly faster than that of TT, see below, [[#Relativistic relationships|Relativistic relationships of TT]].)

==Current definition==

TT differs from [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG) by a constant rate.  Formally it is defined by the equation

&lt;math display="block"&gt;TT = \bigl(1-L_g\bigr) \times TCG\ + \ E&lt;/math&gt;

where TT and TCG are linear counts of [[SI]] [[second]]s in Terrestrial Time and Geocentric Coordinate Time respectively, L&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is the constant difference in the rates of the two time scales, and E is a constant to resolve the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s (see below).  L&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as exactly {{val|6.969290134}} × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;.  (In 1991 when TT was first defined, L&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; was to be determined by experiment, and the best available estimate was {{val|6.969291}} × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The equation linking TT and TCG is more commonly seen in the form

&lt;math display="block"&gt;TT = TCG - L_g \times \bigl(JD_{TCG} - 2443144.5003725\bigr) \times 86400&lt;/math&gt;

where JD &lt;sub&gt;TCG&lt;/sub&gt; is the TCG time expressed as a [[Julian day|Julian date (JD)]].  This is just a transformation of the raw count of seconds represented by the variable TCG, so this form of the equation is needlessly complex.  The use of a Julian Date specifies the [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] fully.  The above equation is often given with the Julian Date {{gaps|2443|144.5}} for the epoch, but that is inexact (though inappreciably so, because of the small size of the multiplier L&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;).  The value {{gaps|2443|144.500|3725}} is exactly in accord with the definition.

Time coordinates on the TT and TCG scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of Earth.  Specifically, both Julian Dates and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used.  For continuity with their predecessor [[Ephemeris Time]] (ET), TT and TCG were set to match ET at around Julian Date {{gaps|2443|144.5}} (1977-01-01T00Z).  More precisely, it was defined that TT instant 1977-01-01T00:00:32.184 exactly and TCG instant 1977-01-01T00:00:32.184 exactly correspond to the [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) instant 1977-01-01T00:00:00.000 exactly.  This is also the instant at which TAI introduced corrections for [[gravitational time dilation]].

TT and TCG expressed as Julian Dates can be related precisely and most simply by the equation

:JD&lt;sub&gt;TT&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sub&gt;JD&lt;/sub&gt; + (JD&lt;sub&gt;TCG&lt;/sub&gt; − E&lt;sub&gt;JD&lt;/sub&gt;) (1 − L&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;)

where E&lt;sub&gt;JD&lt;/sub&gt; is {{gaps|2443|144.500|3725}} exactly.

==Realization==

TT is a theoretical ideal, not dependent on a particular realization. For practical purposes, TT must be realized by actual clocks in the Earth system.

The main realization of TT is supplied by TAI. The TAI service, running since 1958, attempts to match the rate of proper time on the geoid, using an ensemble of [[atomic clock]]s spread over the surface and low orbital space of Earth. TAI is canonically defined retrospectively, in monthly bulletins, in relation to the readings that particular groups of atomic clocks showed at the time.  Estimates of TAI are also provided in real time by the institutions that operate the participating clocks.  Because of the historical difference between TAI and ET when TT was introduced, the TAI realization of TT is defined thus:

:TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s

Because TAI is never revised once published, it is possible for errors in it to become known and remain uncorrected.  It is thus possible to produce a better realization of TT based on reanalysis of historical TAI data.  The [[BIPM]] has done this approximately annually since 1992.  These realizations of TT are named in the form "TT(BIPM08)", with the digits indicating the year of publication.  They are published in the form of table of differences from TT(TAI). The latest {{As of|2018|02|lc=on}} is [ftp://ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/ttbipm/TTBIPM.17 TT(BIPM17)].

The international communities of precision timekeeping, [[astronomy]], and [[radio]] broadcasts have considered creating a new precision time scale based on observations of an ensemble of [[rotation-powered pulsar#History|pulsar]]s.  This new pulsar time scale will serve as an independent means of computing TT, and it may eventually be useful to identify defects in TAI.

==Approximation==

Sometimes times described in TT must be handled in situations where TT's detailed theoretical properties are not significant.  Where millisecond accuracy is enough (or more than enough), TT can be summarized in the following ways:

* To millisecond accuracy, TT runs parallel to the atomic timescale ([[International Atomic Time]], TAI) maintained by the [[BIPM]].  TT is ahead of TAI, and can be approximated as TT ≅ TAI + 32.184 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;IAU conference 1991, Resolution A4, recommendation IV, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt; (The offset 32.184 s arises from the history.&lt;ref&gt;The atomic time scale A1 (a predecessor of TAI) was set equal to UT2 at its conventional starting date of 1 January 1958 (see L Essen, [http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1968-Metrologia-v4-n4-Essen.pdf "Time Scales"], Metrologia, vol.4 (1968), 161-165, at 163), when [[ΔT]] (ET-UT) was about 32 seconds. The offset 32.184 seconds was the 1976 estimate of the difference between [[Ephemeris Time]] (ET) and [[International Atomic Time|TAI]], "to provide continuity with the current values and practice in the use of Ephemeris Time" (see IAU Commission 4 (Ephemerides), Recommendations to IAU General Assembly 1976, Notes on Recommendation 5, note 2).&lt;/ref&gt;)
* TT also runs in parallel with the [[GPS time]] scale, which has a constant difference from atomic time (TAI − GPS time = +19 seconds),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/timescales.html |author=Steve Allen |title=Time Scales |publisher=[[Lick Observatory]] |access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that TT ≅ GPS time + 51.184 seconds.
* TT is in effect a continuation of (but is more precisely uniform than) the former [[Ephemeris Time]] (ET).  It was designed for continuity with ET,&lt;ref&gt;P K Seidelmann (ed.) (1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&amp;pg=PA42 'Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac', at p.42]; also IAU Commission 4 (Ephemerides), Recommendations to IAU General Assembly 1976, Notes on Recommendation 5, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and it runs at the rate of the SI second, which was itself derived from a calibration using the second of ET (see, under Ephemeris time, [[Ephemeris time#Redefinition of the second|Redefinition of the second]] and [[Ephemeris time#Implementations|Implementations]].)  
*TT runs a little ahead of [[UT1]] (a refined measure of mean solar time at Greenwich) by an amount known as [[ΔT]] = TT − UT1.  ΔT was measured at +67.6439 seconds (TT ahead of UT1) at 0h [[UTC]] on 1 January 2015;&lt;ref&gt;[[US Naval Observatory]] ([[USNO]]) data file online at [ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data (accessed 27 October 2015)].&lt;/ref&gt; and by retrospective calculation, [[ΔT]] was close to zero around the year 1900.  The difference ΔT, though somewhat unpredictable in fine detail, is expected to continue to increase, with UT1 becoming steadily (but irregularly) further behind TT in the future.

==Relativistic relationships==

Observers in different locations, that are in relative motion or at different altitudes, can disagree about the rates of each other's clocks, owing to effects described by the [[theory of relativity]].  As a result, TT (even as a theoretical ideal) does not match the proper time of all observers.

In relativistic terms, TT is described as the [[proper time]] of a clock located on the [[geoid]] (essentially [[mean sea level]]).&lt;ref&gt;For example, IAU Commission 4 (Ephemerides), Recommendations to IAU General Assembly 1976, Notes on Recommendation 5, note 1, as well as other sources, indicate the time scale for apparent geocentric ephemerides as a proper time.&lt;/ref&gt;
However,&lt;ref name=guin86&gt;B Guinot (1986), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986CeMec..38..155G "Is the International Atomic Time a Coordinate Time or a Proper Time?"], Celestial Mechanics, 38 (1986), pp.155-161.&lt;/ref&gt;
TT is now actually defined as a [[coordinate time scale]].&lt;ref&gt;IAU General Assembly 1991, Resolution A4, Recommendations III and IV, define TCB and TCG as coordinate time scales, and TT as a linear scaling of TCG, hence also a coordinate time.&lt;/ref&gt;
The redefinition did not quantitatively change TT, but rather made the existing definition more precise.  In effect it defined the geoid (mean sea level) in terms of a particular level of [[gravitational time dilation]] relative to a notional observer located at infinitely high altitude.

The present definition of TT is a linear scaling of [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), which is the proper time of a notional observer who is infinitely far away (so not affected by gravitational time dilation) and at rest relative to Earth. TCG is used so far mainly for theoretical purposes in astronomy. From the point of view of an observer on Earth's surface the second of TCG passes in slightly less than the observer's SI second. The comparison of the observer's clock against TT depends on the observer's altitude: they will match on the geoid, and clocks at higher altitude tick slightly faster.

'''''The Zombie Survival Guide''''', written by American author [[Max Brooks]] and published in 2003, is a survival manual dealing with the fictional potentiality of a [[zombie]] attack. It contains detailed plans for the average citizen to survive zombie uprisings of varying intensity and reach, and describes "cases" of zombie outbreaks in history, including an interpretation of [[Roanoke Colony]]. ''The Zombie Survival Guide'' was also featured on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller's list.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-03-21/paperback-nonfiction/list.html?scp=1&amp;sq=ZOmbie%20survival%20guide&amp;st=cse "Best Sellers."]. The New York Times, 21 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks' inspiration for ''The Zombie Survival Guide'' was his childhood interest in zombies, sparked by the first zombie movie he ever saw, ''circa'' age 10: ''[[Revenge of the Zombies]]'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knowles|first=Harry|title=Max Brooks and Quint discuss his ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE follow-up novel, WORLD WAR Z!!!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30038|website=Ain't It Cool News|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
&lt;!-- Please stop removing the word 'fictional' from this article --&gt; 
The book is divided into six separate chapters, followed by a list of fictional attacks throughout history and an appendix. The first chapter, "The Undead: Myths and Realities", outlines Solanum, a fictional and incurable virus that creates a zombie, along with details on how it is spread (such as through an open wound, or contact with infected blood or saliva), and treatment of the infected (such as [[suicide]] or amputation of the injured limb, though the latter rarely works). The middle of this chapter explains the abilities and behavioral patterns of the undead, and the differences between "voodoo" zombies, movie zombies, and zombies created by Solanum.

In subsequent chapters, the book describes weapons and combat techniques, places of safety, and how to survive a zombie-infested world. In the section describing weapons, Brooks writes about the human body:  "If cared for and trained properly, is the greatest weapon on earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Max Brooks|author=Brooks, Max|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mcT7A371xQC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=If+cared+for+and+trained+properly,+is+the+greatest+weapon+on+earth+max+brooks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n_JlaO_NcY&amp;sig=92P1jBNFOHRHxOLty53SfvgHUck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Pb2LVJ33LIOoogSHlYFw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=If%20cared%20for%20and%20trained%20properly%2C%20is%20the%20greatest%20weapon%20on%20earth%20max%20brooks&amp;f=false|work=[[Google Books]]|pages=30|title=The Zombie Survival Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The guide concludes with a fictional list of documented zombie encounters throughout history. The oldest entry is 60,000 BC, in [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]], Central Africa, although the author expresses doubt about its validity. Instead, he presents evidence from 3,000 B.C. in Ancient Egypt as the first verifiable instance of a zombie outbreak. The most recent entry is 2002, in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands]]. Some of these encounters make reference to historical events, such as [[Roanoke Island]].

===Appendix===
This is a sample "outbreak journal": the author notes covered-up zombie outbreaks seen on the local news as well as the preparations he recommends in the event that the outbreak worsens. The following pages are blank entries, for the reader to use as a basis for his or her own notes on surviving zombies.

[[Image:Napier Nomad.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Napier Nomad]] engine. The power-recovery turbine sits underneath a two-stroke diesel engine.]]

A '''turbo-compound engine''' is a [[reciprocating engine]] that employs a [[turbine]] to recover energy from the exhaust gases. Instead of using that energy to drive a [[turbocharger]] as found in many high-power [[aircraft engine]]s, the energy is instead sent to the output shaft to increase the total power delivered by the engine. The turbine is usually mechanically connected to the [[crankshaft]], as on the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone]], but electric and hydraulic power recovery systems have been investigated as well. 

As this recovery process does not increase [[fuel consumption]], it has the effect of reducing the [[specific fuel consumption (shaft engine)|specific fuel consumption]], the ratio of fuel use to power.&lt;ref name="popmech0256"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stimson|first1=Thomas E., Junior|title=The Race of the Airliners|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=February 1956|pages=113–118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uoxET6-bFcPVgQf2s_i2BA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turbo-compounding was used for commercial airliners and similar long-range, long-endurance roles before the introduction of high-bypass [[turbofan]] engines replaced them in this role. Examples using the Duplex-Cyclone include the [[Douglas DC-7B]] and [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]], while other designs did not see production use.

==Concept==

Most piston engines have a hot exhaust that still contains considerable undeveloped [[energy]] that could be used for propulsion if extracted. A turbine is often used to extract energy from such a stream of gases. A conventional gas turbine is fed high-pressure, high-velocity air, extracts energy from it, and leaves as a lower-pressure, slower-moving stream. This action has the side-effect of increasing the upstream pressure, which makes it undesirable for use with a piston engine as it increases the back-pressure in the engine, which decreases scavenging of the [[exhaust gas]] from the cylinders and thereby lowers the efficiency of the piston portion of a compound engine.&lt;ref name="EH"&gt;{{cite book|title=Facts about the Wright Turbo Compound|date=October 1956|publisher=Curtiss-Wright Corporation:Wright Aeronautical Division|location=Wood Ridge New Jersey|url=http://www.enginehistory.org/Wright/TC%20Facts.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2016|format=pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216210835/http://www.enginehistory.org/Wright/TC%20Facts.pdf|archivedate=16 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the late 1930s and early 1940s one solution to this problem was the introduction of "jet stack" exhaust manifolds. These were simply short sections of metal pipe attached to the exhaust ports, shaped so that they would interact with the airstream to produce a jet of air that produced forward thrust. Another [[World War II]] introduction was the use of the [[Meredith effect]] to recover heat from the radiator system to provide additional thrust.

By the late-war era, turbine development had improved dramatically and led to a new turbine design known as the "blowdown turbine" or "power-recovery turbine". This design extracts energy from the momentum of the moving air, but does not appreciably increase back-pressure. This means it does not have the undesirable effects of conventional designs when connected to the exhaust of a piston engine, and a number of manufacturers began studying the design.

==History==
[[Image:Wright R-3350 Cyclone Engine 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone]] Turbo-Compound [[radial engine]].]]

The first aircraft engine to be tested with a power-recovery turbine was the [[Rolls-Royce Crecy]]. This was used primarily to drive a geared centrifugal supercharger, although it was also coupled to the crankshaft and gave an extra 15 to 35 percent fuel economy.&lt;ref name=nzrrbc&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Rolls-Royce and the Sleeve Valve |url=http://www.kda132.com/Praeclarum/NZ07-3.pdf |issue=07-3 |year=2007 |journal=New Zealand Rolls-Royce &amp; Bentley Club Inc |page=15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206092033/http://kda132.com/Praeclarum/NZ07-3.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blowdown turbines became relatively common features in the late- and post-war era, especially for engines designed for long overwater flights. Turbo-compounding was used on several [[airplane]] engines after [[World War II]], including the [[Napier Nomad]]&lt;ref name="Flight, 30 April 1954, Napier Nomad" &gt;

The exhaust restriction imparted by the three blowdown turbines used on the Wright R-3350 is equal to a well-designed jet stack system used on a conventional [[radial engine]], while recovering about {{convert|550|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at METO (maximum continuous except for take-off) power.&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt; In the case of the R-3350, maintenance crews sometimes nicknamed the turbine the ''parts recovery turbine'' due to its negative effect on engine reliability. Turbo-compound versions of the [[Napier Deltic]], [[Rolls-Royce Crecy]], [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]], and [[Allison V-1710]] were constructed but none was developed beyond the prototype stage. It was realized in many cases the power produced by the simple turbine was approaching that of the enormously complex and maintenance-intensive piston engine to which it was attached. As a result, turbo-compound aero engines were soon supplanted by [[turboprop]] and [[turbojet]] engines.

Some modern heavy truck diesel manufacturers have incorporated turbo-compounding into their designs. Examples include the [[Detroit Diesel]] DD15&lt;ref&gt;

Starting with the 2014 season, [[Formula 1]] switched to a new 1.6 liter turbocharged V6 [[Formula One engines#2014|formula]] that uses turbo-compounding. The engines use a single turbocharger that is connected to an electric motor/generator called the MGU-H. The MGU-H uses a turbine to drive a generator, converting waste heat from the exhaust into electrical energy that is either stored in a battery or sent directly to an electric motor in the car's powertrain.

[[File:JACOEL-Wave Tow Tank-Image16.png|thumb|right|Model testing with periodic [[Stokes wave]]s in the Wave–Tow Tank of the Jere A. Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory, [[University of New Hampshire]].]]
A '''wave tank''' is a [[laboratory]] setup for observing the behavior of [[surface wave]]s.  The typical wave tank is a box filled with [[liquid]], usually [[water]], leaving open or [[air]]-filled space on top.  At one end of the tank an actuator generates waves; the other end usually has a wave-absorbing surface.  A similar device is the [[ripple tank]], which is flat and shallow and used for observing patterns of surface waves from above.

==Wave basin==
[[File:Alfond W2 Ocean Engineering Lab at the UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center.jpg|thumb|right|A wave basin at the [[University of Maine]].]]
A '''wave basin''' is a wave tank which has a width and length of comparable magnitude, often used for testing ships, offshore structures and three-dimensional models of harbors (and their breakwaters).

==Wave flume==
[[File:Soliton hydro.jpg|thumb|A [[solitary wave (water waves)|solitary wave]] in a laboratory wave flume]]
[[File:Wellenkanal Marienwerder Monsterwelle.jpg|thumb|right|A large wave flume of ''Forschungszentrum Küste'' in Marienwerder/[[Hannover, Germany]], with a length of 307 m and a depth of 7 m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fzk.uni-hannover.de/406.html Information on the flume at the ''Forschungszentrum Küste'' research institute of the University of Hannover].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''wave flume''' (or '''wave channel''') is a special sort of wave tank: the width of the flume is much less than its length. The generated waves are therefore – more or less – [[two-dimensional]] in a vertical plane (2DV), meaning that the orbital [[flow velocity]] component in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the flume side wall is much smaller than the other two components of the [[three-dimensional]] velocity [[Euclidean vector|vector]]. This makes a wave flume a well-suited facility to study near-2DV structures, like cross-sections of a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. Also (3D) constructions providing little blockage to the flow may be tested, e.g. measuring wave forces on vertical cylinders with a diameter much less than the flume width.

Wave flumes may be used to study the effects of [[water waves]] on [[coastal management|coastal structure]]s, [[offshore construction|offshore structure]]s, [[sediment transport]] and other [[transport phenomena]].

The waves are most often generated with a mechanical wavemaker, although there are also wind–wave flumes with (additional) wave generation by an air flow over the water – with the flume closed above by a roof above the free surface. The wavemaker frequently consists of a translating or rotating rigid wave board. Modern wavemakers are computer controlled, and can generate besides [[periodic function|periodic]] waves also [[random wave]]s, [[solitary wave (water waves)|solitary wave]]s, [[wave group]]s or even [[tsunami]]-like wave motion. The wavemaker is at one end of the wave flume, and at the other end is the construction being tested, or a wave absorber (a beach or special wave absorbing constructions).

Often, the side walls contain glass windows, or are completely made of glass, allowing for a clear visual observation of the experiment, and the easy deployment of optical instruments (e.g. by [[Laser Doppler velocimetry]] or [[particle image velocimetry]]).

== Circular wave basin ==

In 2014, the first , circular, combined current and wave test basin, [[FloWaveTT]] was commissioned in [[University of Edinburgh|The University of Edinburgh]]. This allows for "true" 360° waves to be generated to simulate rough storm conditions as well as scientific controlled waves in the same facility. It was designed by [[Edinburgh Designs]].
