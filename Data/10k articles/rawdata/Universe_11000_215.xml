The '''aircraft gross weight''' (also known as the all-up weight (AUW)) is the total aircraft weight at ''any moment'' during the flight or ground operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Airplane Design |author= Jan Roskam |date= 1985 |publisher= DARcorporation |isbn= 9781884885426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A229f2817-9be9-49b6-959a-d653b5bac054 |title= Synthesis of subsonic airplane design |author= Egbert Torenbeek |publisher= Delft University Press |isbn= 90-247-2724-3 |date= 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Aircraft Design Projects For Engineering Students |author= Lloyd R. Jenkinson Jim Marchman |isbn= 0-7506-5772-3 |date=  28 April 2003 |publisher= Butterworth-Heinemann |url= https://www.elsevier.com/books/aircraft-design-projects/jenkinson/978-0-7506-5772-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aircraft's gross weight will decrease during a flight due to fuel and oil consumption. An aircraft's gross weight may also vary during a flight due to payload dropping or [[in-flight refuelling]].

At the moment of releasing its brakes, the gross weight of an aircraft is equal to its takeoff weight. During flight, an aircraft's gross weight is referred to as the ''en-route weight'' or ''in-flight weight''.

==Design weight limits (structural design weights)==

An aircraft's gross weight is limited by several weight restrictions in order to avoid overloading its structure or to avoid unacceptable performance or handling qualities while in operation.

Aircraft gross weight limits are established during an aircraft's design and certification period and are laid down in the aircraft's type certificate and manufacturer specification documents.

The absolute maximum weight capabilities of a given aircraft are referred to as the ''structural weight limits''.
The structural weight limits are based on aircraft maximum structural capability and define the envelope for the CG charts(both maximum weight and CG limits).

An aircraft's structural weight capability is typically a function of when the aircraft was manufactured, and in some cases, old aircraft can have their structural weight capability increased by structural modifications.

===Maximum design taxi weight (MDTW)===

The maximum design taxi weight (also known as the maximum design ramp weight (MDRW)) is the maximum weight certificated for aircraft manoeuvring on the ground (taxiing or towing) as limited by aircraft strength and airworthiness requirements.

===Maximum design takeoff weight (MDTOW)===

Is the maximum certificated design weight when the brakes are released for takeoff and is the greatest weight for which compliance with the relevant structural and engineering requirements has been demonstrated by the manufacturer.

===Maximum design landing weight (MDLW)===

The maximum certificated design weight at which the aircraft meets the appropriate landing certification requirements. It generally depends on the landing gear strength or the landing impact loads on certain parts of the wing structure.

The MDLW must not exceed the MDTOW.

The maximum landing weight is typically designed for 10 feet per second (600 feet per minute) sink rate at touch down with no structural damage.

===Maximum design zero-fuel weight (MDZFW)===

The maximum certificated design weight of the aircraft less all [[usable fuel]] and other specified usable agents (engine injection fluid, and other consumable propulsion agents). It is the maximum weight permitted before usable fuel and other specified usable fluids are loaded in specified sections of the airplane. The MDZFW is limited by strength and airworthiness requirements. At this weight, the subsequent addition of fuel will not result in the aircraft design strength being exceeded. The weight difference between the MDTOW and the MDZFW may be utilised only for the addition of fuel.

===Minimum flight weight (MFW)===

Minimum certificated weight for flight as limited by aircraft strength and airworthiness requirements.

==Authorised weight limits==

Aircraft ''authorised'' gross weight limits (also referred to as ''certified'' weight limits) are laid down in the [[aircraft flight manual]]s (AFM) and/or associated certificate of airworthiness (C of A). The authorised or permitted limits may be equal to or lower than the [[#Design weight limits (structural design weights)|structural design weight limits]].

The authorised weight limits that can legally be used by an operator or airline are those listed in the AFM and the weight and balance manual.

The authorised (or certified) weight limits are chosen by the customer/airline and they are referred to as the "purchased weights". An operator may purchase a certified weight below the maximum design weights because many of the airport operating fees are based on the aircraft AFM maximum allowable weight values. An aircraft purchase price is, typically, a function of the certified weight purchased.

Maximum weights established, for each aircraft, by design and certification must not be exceeded during aircraft operation (ramp or taxying, takeoff, en-route flight, approach, and landing) and during aircraft loading (zero fuel conditions, centre of gravity position, and weight distribution).

Weights could be restricted on some type of aircraft depending on the aircraft handling requirements; for example aerobatic aircraft, where certain aerobatic manoeuvres can only be executed with a limited gross weight.

In addition, the authorised maximum weight limits may be less as limited by centre of gravity, fuel density, and fuel loading limits.

===Maximum taxi weight (MTW)===

The maximum taxi weight (MTW) (also known as the [[Maximum Ramp Weight|maximum ramp weight]] (MRW) is the maximum weight authorized for maneuvering (taxiing or towing) an aircraft on the ground as limited by aircraft strength and airworthiness requirements. It includes the weight of taxi and run-up fuel for the engines and the APU.

It is greater than the maximum takeoff weight due to the fuel that will be burned during the taxi and runup operations.

The difference between the maximum taxi/ramp weight and the maximum take-off weight ('''maximum taxi fuel allowance''') depends on the size of the aircraft, the number of engines, APU operation, and engines/APU fuel consumption, and is typically assumed for 10 to 15 minutes allowance of taxi and run-up operations.

===Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW)===
{{main|Maximum takeoff weight}}

The maximum takeoff weight (also known as the ''maximum brake-release weight'') is the maximum weight authorised at brake release for takeoff, or at the start of the takeoff roll.

The maximum takeoff weight is always less than the maximum taxi/ramp weight to allow for fuel burned during taxi by the engines and the APU.

In operation, the maximum weight for takeoff may be limited to values less than the maximum takeoff weight due to aircraft performance, environmental conditions, airfield characteristics (takeoff field length, altitude), maximum tire speed and brake energy, obstacle clearances, and/or en route and landing weight requirements.

===Maximum landing weight (MLW)===
{{main|Maximum landing weight}}

The maximum weight authorised for normal landing of an aircraft.

The MLW must not exceed the MTOW.

The operation landing weight may be limited to a weight lower than the Maximum Landing Weight by the most restrictive of the following requirements:

* Aircraft performance requirements for a given altitude and temperature:
:: landing field length requirements,
:: approach and landing climb requirements
* Noise requirements

If the flight has been of short duration, fuel may have to be jettisoned to reduce the landing weight.

Overweight landings require a structural inspection or evaluation of the touch-down loads before the next aircraft operation.

===Maximum zero-fuel weight (MZFW)===
{{main|Maximum zero-fuel weight}}

The maximum permissible weight of the aircraft less all usable fuel and other specified usable agents (engine injection fluid, and other consumable propulsion agents). It is the maximum weight permitted before usable fuel and other specified usable fluids are loaded in specified sections of the airplane.

== Early life and education ==
Epstein grew up in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]] and attended [[Montgomery County Public Schools (Maryland)|Montgomery County Public Schools]]. In childhood his favorite subjects were [[mathematics]] and [[science]], and in [[high school]] he became interested in [[politics]] and humanities. He cites [[Ayn Rand]] as his greatest influence, having been especially impressed by her novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Among his other favorite writers is [[Thomas Sowell]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/2011/11/interview-with-alex-epstein-founder-of-center-for-industrial-progress/|title = Interview with Alex Epstein, Founder of Center for Industrial Progress|date = November 17, 2011|accessdate = January 9, 2015|website = [[The Objective Standard]]|publisher = |last = Lipana|first = Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 to 2002, Epstein earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[philosophy]] from [[Duke University]], where he was the editor and publisher of ''The Duke Review'' for two years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ari.convio.net/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=21361&amp;news_iv_ctrl=2527 |title=Energy |date=September 23, 2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2015 |website=Ayn Rand Institute |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109224804/http://ari.convio.net/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=21361&amp;news_iv_ctrl=2527 |archivedate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and where he also studied [[computer science]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Career ==
=== Ayn Rand Institute ===
After college, Epstein knew that he wanted to be a professional intellectual but also that he did not want to go to [[graduate school]] or to work at a university. He became a freelance writer, and two years later joined the Ayn Rand Institute, a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] in [[Irvine, California]] that promotes Ayn Rand's novels and her philosophy of Objectivism. Epstein was a writer and fellow at the Ayn Rand Institute between 2004 and 2011, where he specialized in business issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ari.convio.net/site/PageServer?pagename=media_AlexEpstein |title=Alex Epstein |date= |accessdate=January 9, 2015 |website=Ayn Rand Institute |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109224807/http://ari.convio.net/site/PageServer?pagename=media_AlexEpstein |archivedate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Epstein founded the Center for Industrial Progress (CIP), an advocacy group and think tank whose mission is "to bring about a new industrial revolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://industrialprogress.com/about/ About Us] “Center for Industrial Progress” January 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Epstein debated American environmentalist [[Bill McKibben]] while representing CIP at an event held at Duke University.&lt;ref name=ecowatch&gt;{{cite web|title=DEBATE: McKibben vs. Epstein—Are Fossil Fuels a Risk to the Planet?|url=http://ecowatch.com/2012/11/06/fossil-fuels-a-risk-to-planet/|publisher=EcoWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Epstein and the Center for Industrial Progress on their list of top Global Warming Deniers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-denier-elite-20130912 |title=Global Warming's Denier Elite |author=Rolling Stone |website=RollingStone.com |accessdate=July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein wrote a rebuttal to the piece in ''[[Forbes]]'', in which he refutes ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s characterization of his views and mocks the piece for including scientifically inaccurate information.&lt;ref name="denier"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/2013/09/16/rolling-stone-attacks-global-warming-deniers-as-anti-science-then-commits-big-scientific-blunder/#5a8b19804cb7 |title=Rolling Stone Attacks Global Warming 'Deniers' As Anti-Science, Then Commits Big Scientific Blunder |author=Epstein, Alex |website=Forbes.com |accessdate=July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his rebuttal, Epstein also criticizes the term [[Climate change denial|global warming ''denier'']], which he claims is a [[Smear campaign|smear tactic]] intended to liken critics of environmentalism to [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]].&lt;ref name="denier"/&gt;

In 2014, Epstein and CIP publicly supported the [[Keystone Pipeline]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Sara [http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/live-news/articles/2014/11/17/house-passes-billonkeystonexlpipeline.html House passes bill on Keystone XL pipeline] “Al Jazeera America”. January 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''[[The Guardian]]'' published an opinion piece by Jason Wilson critical of Epstein and CIP, stating, "Epstein's work has been popular and influential on the right because it is a particularly fluent, elaborate form of [[Climate change denial|climate denialism]]. The CIP [''sic''] prides itself on being able to train corporate leaders to 'successfully outmessage "environmentalists"'."&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; He also criticizes Epstein for being an "ideologue" funded by petrochemical billionaires, the [[Koch family|Koch brothers]], though CIP is for-profit and thus does not receive funds from anyone, including the Kochs.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

In 2016, Epstein testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]] at the invitation of the committee's chairman, [[James Inhofe]] (R-OK), who has called climate change a "hoax." Epstein suggested that rising carbon dioxide levels "benefit plants and Americans." When questioned by committee member [[Barbara Boxer]] as to why Epstein, who self-identifies as a philosopher, was even there, Epstein responded, "to teach you how to think clearly." Boxer replied that she doesn't "appreciate being lectured by a philosopher and not a scientist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060035542/print|title=CLIMATE: 'Moral Case for Fossil Fuels' sparks angry Senate debate|website=www.eenews.net|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/4/examining-the-role-of-environmental-policies-on-access-to-energy-and-economic-opportunity|title=Examining the Role of Environmental Policies on Access to Energy and Economic Opportunity|website=U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epstein has contributed to several media outlets regarding climate and energy issues, including ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and [[Fox News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/10/19/climate-change-presidential-debate-fossil-fuels-editorials-debates/92386846/ |title=Warming is mild and manageable: Opposing view |author=Epstein, Alex |website=USAToday.com |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704407804575425541427252542 |title= Obama Follows Nixon on Oil Spills |author=Epstein, Alex |website=WSJ.com |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/11/14/fossil-fuels-moral-choice.html |title=Fossil fuels: The moral choice |author=Epstein, Alex |website=FoxNews.com |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein and CIP challenge the belief that the consumption of fossil fuels harms human life, arguing that recent gains in public health and safety were achieved not in spite of mankind's reliance on carbon energy but, in large measure, because of it.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Marlo [http://www.globalwarming.org/2015/01/13/some-free-market-talking-points-on-the-keystone-xl-pipeline-amendments/ Some Free Market Talking Points on the Keystone XL Pipeline Amendments].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2188">The '''Burton process''' is a [[Cracking (chemistry)|thermal cracking]] process invented by [[William Merriam Burton]] and [[Robert E. Humphreys]], each of whom held a Ph.D. in chemistry from Johns Hopkins University. The process they developed is often called the Burton process. More fairly, though, it should be known as the Burton-Humphreys process, since both men played key roles in its development. This issue was settled in court, although the decision gave primary recognition to Burton.&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Giddens, ''Standard Oil Company (Indiana): Oil Pioneer of the Middle West'',1955; pp. 167-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process uses the destructive distillation of crude oil heated in a still under pressure. In this revolutionary still, different products emerging from a bubble tower at different temperatures and pressures. Of critical importance, the use of these stills  more than doubled the production of gasoline from most kinds of oil. The first large-scale use of these towers began with the decision by Standard Oil of Indiana to build 120 stills for an appropriation of $709,000, authorized in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, op. cit. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was taken just as the US Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the [[Standard Oil Trust]].

This thermal cracking process was [[patent]]ed on January 7, 1913 (Patent No. 1,049,667). The first [[Cracking (chemistry)|thermal cracking]] method, the [[Shukhov cracking process]], was invented by [[Vladimir Shukhov]] (Patent of [[Russian empire]] No. 12926 on November 27, 1891). While the Russians contended that the Burton process was essentially a slight modification of the Shukhov process, Americans refused to concede and the Burton-Humphreys patent remained in use. Ultimately, it contributed to the development of petrochemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, op. cit., pp. vi-vii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 the Burton process was superseded by [[catalytic cracking]], but it is still in use today to produce [[Diesel fuel|diesel]].

In [[Extraction of petroleum|petroleum production]], the '''casing hanger''' is that portion of a [[wellhead]] assembly which provides support for the [[casing string]] when it is lowered into the [[wellbore]]. It serves to ensure that the casing is properly located. When the casing string has been run into the wellbore it is hung off, or suspended, by a casing hanger, which rests on a landing shoulder inside the casing spool. Casing hangers must be designed to take the full weight of the casing, and provide a seal between the casing hanger and the spool.

Casing Hangers may also be suspended within the wellhead by means of radial distortion of the wellhead bore e.g. the "Pos-Grip" method. 

This is installed to support the individual casing strings in the well. It is the landing base or the casing head. This is usually welded or screwed to the top of the surface casing string. The surface casing serves as a foundation pile for the well which transfers the hanging load to the earth. The casing head is prepared with a bowl into which the slips sit and chuck the casing in place. Most casing heads allow for the pressure readings to be taken on the [[annulus (oil well)|annulus]] and provide the means to pump out or into if necessary. The top of the casing string and annulus is usually sealed.

The most common size of casing hanger is 13-3/8" with over 155,000 such units installed worldwide in 2014 alone.

The contraction of the oilfield industry throughout 2015 meant that this figure was reduced somewhat to just under 120,000 units, of which 36,822 were "Pos-Grip" casing hangers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">[[Image:Cone.svg|right|thumb|250px|Cone of a circle. The original space is in blue, and the collapsed end point is in green.]]
In [[topology]], especially [[algebraic topology]], the '''cone''' ''CX'' '''of a [[topological space]]''' ''X'' is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]]:

:&lt;math&gt;CX = (X \times I)/(X \times \{0\})&lt;/math&gt;

of the [[product topology|product]] of ''X'' with the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0, 1]. 
Intuitively, this construction makes ''X'' into a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and collapses one end of the cylinder to a [[point (topology)|point]].

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Compact space|compact]] subspace of [[Euclidean space]], the cone on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[union (set theory)|union]] of segments from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to any fixed point &lt;math&gt; v \not\in X &lt;/math&gt; such that these segments intersect only by &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; itself. That is, the topological cone agrees with the geometric cone for compact spaces when the latter is defined. However, the topological cone construction is more general.

==Examples==
Here we often use geometric cone (defined in the introduction) instead of the topological one. The considered spaces are compact, so we get the same result up to homeomorphism.

* The cone over a point ''p'' of the real line is the interval {''p''} x [0,1].
* The cone over two points {0,1} is a "V" shape with endpoints at {0} and {1}.
* The cone over a closed interval ''I'' of the real line is a filled-in [[triangle]] (with one of the edges being ''I''), otherwise known as a 2-simplex (see the final example). 
* The cone over a [[polygon]] ''P'' is a pyramid with base ''P''.
* The cone over a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] is the solid [[cone (geometry)|cone]] of classical geometry (hence the concept's name).
* The cone over a [[circle]] given by
::&lt;math&gt;\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb R^3 \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \mbox{ and } z=0\}&lt;/math&gt;
is the curved surface of the solid cone:
::&lt;math&gt;\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb R^3 \mid x^2 + y^2 = (z-1)^2 \mbox{ and } 0\leq z\leq 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:This in turn is homeomorphic to the closed [[disc (mathematics)|disc]].
* In general, the cone over an [[n-sphere]] is homeomorphic to the closed (''n''+1)-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]].
* The cone over an ''n''-[[simplex]] is an (''n''+1)-simplex.

==Properties==

All cones are [[path-connected space|path-connected]] since every point can be connected to the vertex point. Furthermore, every cone is [[contractible]] to the vertex point by the [[homotopy]]

:''h''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''s'') = (''x'', (1&amp;minus;''t'')''s'').

The cone is used in algebraic topology precisely because it embeds a space as a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of a contractible space.

When ''X'' is [[compact space|compact]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (essentially, when ''X'' can be embedded in Euclidean space), then the cone ''CX'' can be visualized as the collection of lines joining every point of ''X'' to a single point. However, this picture fails when ''X'' is not compact or not Hausdorff, as generally the [[quotient topology]] on ''CX'' will be [[finer topology|finer]] than the set of lines joining ''X'' to a point.

== Cone functor ==
The map &lt;math&gt;X\mapsto CX&lt;/math&gt; induces a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;C:\mathbf{Top}\to\mathbf {Top}&lt;/math&gt; on the [[category of topological spaces]] '''Top'''. If &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;is a continuous map, then &lt;math&gt;Cf : CX \to CY&lt;/math&gt;is defined by &lt;math&gt;(Cf)([x,t])=[f(x),t]&lt;/math&gt;, where square brackets denote equivalence classes.

==Reduced cone==
If &lt;math&gt;(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[pointed space]], there is a related construction, the '''reduced cone''', given by 
:&lt;math&gt;(X\times [0,1]) / (X\times \left\{0\right\}
\cup\left\{x_0\right\}\times [0,1])&lt;/math&gt;

where we take the basepoint of the reduced cone to be the equivalence class of  &lt;math&gt;(x_0,0)&lt;/math&gt;. With this definition, the natural inclusion  &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto (x,1)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a based map.  This construction also gives a functor, from the category of pointed spaces to itself.

[[Image:Cshaft.gif|300px|thumb|Flat-plane crankshaft (red), pistons (gray) in their cylinders (blue), and flywheel (black)]]

A '''crankshaft'''&amp;mdash;related to ''[[crank (mechanism)|crank]]''&amp;mdash;is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between [[reciprocating motion]] and [[rotational motion]]. In a [[reciprocating engine]], it translates [[reciprocating motion]] of the [[piston]] into rotational motion; whereas in a [[reciprocating compressor]], it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has "crank throws" or "[[crankpin]]s", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the "big ends" of the [[connecting rod]]s from each cylinder attach.

It is typically connected to a [[flywheel]] to reduce the pulsation characteristic of the [[four-stroke cycle]], and sometimes a [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] or vibrational damper at the opposite end, to reduce the [[torsional vibration]]s often caused along the length of the crankshaft by the cylinders farthest from the output end acting on the torsional elasticity of the metal.

The upright handle of such rotary handmills, set at a distance from the centre of rotation, works as a crank.&lt;ref name="Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas 2005, 5, fn. 9"/&gt;]]

The earliest hand-operated cranks appeared in [[China]] during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC-220 AD). They were used for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, for the agricultural [[winnowing]] fan, in the water-powered flour-sifter, for hydraulic-powered metallurgic [[bellows]], and in the well [[windlass]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 118"&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Pages 118&amp;ndash;119.&lt;/ref&gt; The rotary winnowing fan greatly increased the efficiency of separating grain from husks and stalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Brief Illustrated History of Machines and Mechanisms |last= Bautista Paz |first=Emilio |last2=Ceccarelli |first2=Marco  |last3= Otero |first3=Javier Echávarri |last4= Sanz |first4=José Luis Muñoz |publisher=Springer |year=2010 |isbn=978-9048125111 |publication-date=May 12, 2010 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Understanding China: Dangerous Resentments |last= Du Bois  |first=George |publisher=Trafford on Demand |year= 2014 |isbn=978-1490745077}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the potential of the crank of converting circular motion into reciprocal motion never seems to have been fully realized in China, and the crank was typically absent from such machines until the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=104}}: {{quote|Yet a student of the Chinese technology of the early twentieth century remarks that even a generation ago the Chinese had not 'reached that stage where continuous rotary motion is substituted for reciprocating motion in technical contrivances such as the drill, lathe, saw, etc. To take this step familiarity with the crank is necessary. The crank in its simple rudimentary form we find in the [modern] Chinese windlass, which use of the device, however, has apparently not given the impulse to change reciprocating into circular motion in other contrivances'. In China the crank was known, but remained dormant for at least nineteen centuries, its explosive potential for applied mechanics being unrecognized and unexploited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crank in the form of an eccentrically-mounted handle of the rotary [[Quern-stone|handmill]] appeared in 5th century BC [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] [[Spain]] and ultimately spread across the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Date: {{harvnb|Frankel|2003|pp=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 159"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas 2005, 5, fn. 9"&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=5, fn. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman iron crank dating to the 2nd century AD was excavated in [[Augusta Raurica]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Schiöler 2009, 113"&gt;{{harvnb|Schiöler|2009|pp=113f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laur-Belart|1988|pp=51–52, 56, fig. 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crank-operated [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mill is dated to the late 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Volpert|1997|pp=195, 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the crank combined with a connecting rod appears in the [[Hierapolis mill]], dating to the 3rd century; they are also found in stone [[sawmill]]s in [[Roman Syria]] and [[Ephesus]] dating to the 6th century.&lt;ref name="Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 161"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=161}}: {{quote|Because of the findings at Ephesus and Gerasa the invention of the crank and connecting rod system has had to be redated from the 13th to the 6th c; now the Hierapolis relief takes it back another three centuries, which confirms that water-powered stone saw mills were indeed in use when [[Ausonius]] wrote his Mosella.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pediment]] of the Hierapolis mill shows a [[waterwheel]] fed by a [[mill race]] powering via a [[gear train]] two [[frame saw]]s which cut blocks by the way of some kind of connecting rods and cranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|pp=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crank and connecting rod mechanisms of the other two archaeologically-attested sawmills worked without a gear train.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|pp=149–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mangartz|2006|pp=579f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water-powered [[marble]] saws in [[Germany]] were mentioned by the late 4th century poet [[Ausonius]];&lt;ref name="Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 161"/&gt; about the same time, these mill types seem also to be indicated by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] from [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2007, 161"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=156, fn. 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rotary [[Grindstone (tool)|grindstone]]&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 110"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; operated by a crank handle is shown in the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] manuscript ''[[Utrecht Psalter]]''; the pen drawing of around 830 goes back to a late antique original.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=425f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranks used to turn wheels are also depicted or described in various works dating from the tenth to thirteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 110"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986|pp=112&amp;ndash;113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first depictions of the compound crank in the carpenter's [[Brace (tool)|brace]] appear between 1420 and 1430 in northern European artwork.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 112"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid adoption of the compound crank can be traced in the works of an unknown German engineer writing on the state of military technology during the Hussite Wars: first, the connecting-rod, applied to cranks, reappeared; second, double-compound cranks also began to be equipped with connecting-rods; and third, the flywheel was employed for these cranks to get them over the 'dead-spot'.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 113"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was much improved by the Italian engineer and writer [[Roberto Valturio]] in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting-rod, an idea also taken up by his compatriot Italian painter [[Francesco di Giorgio]].&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 114"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anonymous of the Hussite Wars. Clm 197, Part 1, Folio 17v Supra.jpg|thumb|left|15th century paddle-wheel boat whose paddles are turned by single-throw crankshafts (Anonymous of the [[Hussite Wars]])]]

The crank had become common in Europe by the early 15th century, as seen in the works of the military engineer [[Konrad Kyeser]] (1366&amp;ndash;after 1405).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 113"&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986|p=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"/&gt; Devices depicted in Kyeser's ''[[Bellifortis]]'' include cranked windlasses for spanning siege crossbows, cranked chain of buckets for water-lifting and cranks fitted to a wheel of bells.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"/&gt; Kyeser also equipped the [[Archimedes' screw]]s for water-raising with a crank handle, an innovation which subsequently replaced the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|pp=105, 111, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence for the fitting of a well-hoist with cranks is found in a miniature of c. 1425 in the German ''Hausbuch of the Mendel Foundation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=167}}; {{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pisanello]] painted a piston-pump driven by a water-wheel and operated by two simple cranks and two connecting-rods.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 113"/&gt; The Italian physician [[Guido da Vigevano]] (c. 1280−1349), planning for a new crusade, made illustrations for a [[Paddle steamer#History|paddle boat]] and war carriages that were propelled by manually turned compound cranks and gear wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Luttrell Psalter]]'', dating to around 1340, describes a grindstone which was rotated by two cranks, one at each end of its axle; the geared hand-mill, operated either with one or two cranks, appeared later in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s were occasionally powered by cranks, although more often by [[windlass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th century also saw the introduction of cranked rack-and-pinion devices, called cranequins, which were fitted to the [[crossbow]]'s stock as a means of exerting even more force while spanning the missile weapon (see right).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|pp=74f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the textile industry, cranked [[reel]]s for winding skeins of yarn were introduced.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"/&gt;

Around 1480, the early medieval rotary grindstone was improved with a treadle and crank mechanism. Cranks mounted on push-carts first appear in a German engraving of 1589.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crankshafts were also described by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519)&lt;ref name=Crank/&gt; and a Dutch farmer and windmill owner by the name [[Cornelis Corneliszoon van Uitgeest]] in 1592. His wind-powered [[sawmill]] used a crankshaft to convert a windmill's circular motion into a back-and-forward motion powering the saw. Corneliszoon was granted a [[patent]] for his crankshaft in 1597.

==== Modern Europe ====
From the 16th century onwards, evidence of cranks and connecting rods integrated into machine design becomes abundant in the technological treatises of the period: [[Agostino Ramelli]]'s ''The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines'' of 1588 depicts eighteen examples, a number that rises in the ''Theatrum Machinarum Novum'' by [[Georg Andreas Böckler]] to 45 different machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranks were formerly common on some machines in the early 20th century; for example almost all [[phonograph]]s before the 1930s were powered by [[clockwork]] motors wound with cranks. Reciprocating piston engines use cranks to convert the linear piston motion into rotational motion. [[Internal combustion engine]]s of early 20th century [[automobile]]s were usually started with hand cranks, before [[Automobile self starter|electric starters]] came into general use. The 1918 [[REO Motor Car Company|Reo]] owner's manual describes how to hand crank the automobile:

* First: Make sure the gear shifting lever is in neutral position.
* Second: The clutch pedal is unlatched and the clutch engaged. The brake pedal is pushed forward as far as possible setting brakes on the rear wheel.
* Third: See that spark control lever, which is the short lever located on top of the steering wheel on the right side, is back as far as possible toward the driver and the long lever, on top of the steering column controlling the carburetor, is pushed forward about one inch from its retarded position.
* Fourth: Turn ignition switch to point marked "B" or "M"
* Fifth: Set the carburetor control on the steering column to the point marked "START." Be sure there is gasoline in the carburetor. Test for this by pressing down on the small pin projecting from the front of the bowl until the carburetor floods. If it fails to flood it shows that the fuel is not being delivered to the carburetor properly and the motor cannot be expected to start. See instructions on page 56 for filling the vacuum tank.
* Sixth: When it is certain the carburetor has a supply of fuel, grasp the handle of starting crank, push in endwise to engage ratchet with crank shaft pin and turn over the motor by giving a quick upward pull. Never push down, because if for any reason the motor should kick back, it would endanger the operator.

== Internal combustion engines ==
{{see also|Internal combustion engine#Structure}}
[[File:Cad crank.jpg|thumb|Crankshaft, [[piston#Internal combustion engines|piston]]s and [[connecting rod]]s for a typical internal combustion engine]]
[[File:MAN ship crankshaft.JPG|thumb|right|[[MAN SE|MAN]] marine crankshaft for 6cyl marine [[diesel engine|diesel]] applications. Note locomotive on left for size reference]]
Large [[internal combustion engine|engine]]s are usually [[engine configuration|multicylinder]] to reduce pulsations from individual firing [[stroke (engines)|strokes]], with more than one piston attached to a complex crankshaft. Many [[small engine]]s, such as those found in [[moped]]s or garden machinery, are single cylinder and use only a single piston, simplifying crankshaft design.

A crankshaft is subjected to enormous stresses, potentially equivalent of several tonnes of force. The crankshaft is connected to the fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to [[torque]]), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (timing chains, belts, pulleys, camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.

===Bearings===
The crankshaft has a linear [[Axis of rotation|axis]] about which it rotates, typically with several [[bearing journal]]s riding on replaceable [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] (the [[main bearing]]s) held in the engine block. As the crankshaft undergoes a great deal of sideways load from each cylinder in a multicylinder engine, it must be supported by several such bearings, not just one at each end. This was a factor in the rise of [[V8 engine]]s, with their shorter crankshafts, in preference to [[straight-8]] engines. The long crankshafts of the latter suffered from an unacceptable amount of flex when engine designers began using higher [[compression ratio]]s and higher rotational speeds. High performance engines often have more main bearings than their lower performance cousins for this reason.

===Piston stroke===
The distance the axis of the crank throws from the axis of the crankshaft determines the piston [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] measurement, and thus [[engine displacement]]. A common way to increase the low-speed torque of an engine is to increase the stroke, sometimes known as "shaft-stroking." This also increases the [[engine balance|reciprocating vibration]], however, limiting the high speed capability of the engine. In compensation, it improves the low speed operation of the engine, as the longer intake stroke through smaller valve(s) results in greater turbulence and mixing of the intake charge. Most modern high speed production engines are classified as "over square" or short-stroke, wherein the stroke is less than the diameter of the [[cylinder bore]].  As such, finding the proper balance between shaft-stroking speed and length leads to better results.

===Engine configuration===
The [[Engine configuration|configuration]], meaning the number of pistons and their placement in relation to each other leads to [[straight engine|straight]], [[V engine|V]] or [[flat engine]]s. The same basic [[engine block]] can sometimes be used with different crankshafts, however, to alter the [[firing order]]. For instance, the 90° [[V6 engine]] configuration, in older days{{when|date=November 2016}} sometimes derived by using six cylinders of a [[V8 engine]] with a 3 throw crankshaft, produces an engine with an [[V6 engine#Odd and even firing|inherent pulsation in the power flow]] due to the "gap" between the firing pulses alternates between short and long pauses because the 90 degree engine block does not correspond to the 120 degree spacing of the crankshaft. The same engine, however, can be made to provide evenly spaced power pulses by using a crankshaft with an individual crank throw for each cylinder, spaced so that the pistons are actually phased 120° apart, as in the [[GM 3800 engine]]. While most production V8 engines use four crank throws spaced 90° apart, high-performance V8 engines often use a "flat" crankshaft with throws spaced 180° apart, essentially resulting in two [[straight four engine]]s running on a common crankcase. The difference can be heard as the flat-plane crankshafts result in the engine having a smoother, higher-pitched sound than cross-plane (for example, [[IndyCar Series|IRL IndyCar Series]] compared to [[Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]], or a [[Ferrari 355]] compared to a [[Chevrolet Corvette]]). This type of crankshaft was also used on early types of V8 engines. See the main article on [[crossplane]] crankshafts.

===Engine balance===
For some engines it is necessary to provide [[counterweight]]s for the reciprocating mass of each piston and connecting rod to improve [[engine balance]]. These are typically cast as part of the crankshaft but, occasionally, are bolt-on pieces. While counter weights add a considerable amount of weight to the crankshaft, it provides a smoother running engine and allows higher RPM levels to be reached.

===Flying arms===
[[File:Crankshaft jap grayscale.jpg|thumb|left|Crankshaft with flying arms (the boomerang-shaped link between the visible crank pins)]]
In some [[engine configuration]]s, the crankshaft contains direct links between adjacent crank pins, without the usual intermediate main bearing. These links are called ''flying arms''.{{sfn|Nunney|2007|pp=16, 41}} This arrangement is sometimes used in [[V6 engine|V6]] and [[V8 engine]]s, as it enables the engine to be designed with different V angles than what would otherwise be required to create an even firing interval, while still using fewer main bearings than would normally be required with a single piston per crankthrow. This arrangement reduces weight and engine length at the expense of less crankshaft rigidity.{{clear|left}}

===Rotary aircraft engines===
Some early aircraft engines were a [[rotary engine]] design, where the crankshaft was fixed to the [[airframe]] and instead the cylinders rotated with the propeller.

===Radial engines===
The [[radial engine]] is a reciprocating type internal combustion engine configuration in which the cylinders point outward from a central crankshaft like the spokes of a wheel. It resembles a stylized star when viewed from the front, and is called a "star engine" (German Sternmotor, French Moteur en étoile) in some languages. The radial configuration was very commonly used in aircraft engines before turbine engines became predominant.

==Construction==
[[Image:Marine Crankshafts 8b03602r.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Continental engine]] marine crankshafts, 1942]]

Crankshafts can be monolithic (made in a single piece) or assembled from several pieces. Monolithic crankshafts are most common, but some smaller and larger engines use assembled crankshafts.

===Forging and casting===
[[File:IPH Kurbelwelle.jpg|thumb|Forged crankshaft]]
Crankshafts can be [[forging|forged]] from a steel bar usually through roll forging or [[casting (metalworking)|cast]] in ductile steel. Today more and more manufacturers tend to favor the use of forged crankshafts due to their lighter weight, more compact dimensions and better inherent damping. With forged crankshafts, [[Vanadium#Applications|vanadium]] microalloyed steels are mostly used as these steels can be air cooled after reaching high strengths without additional heat treatment, with exception to the surface hardening of the bearing surfaces. The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels. Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties. Cast iron crankshafts are today mostly found in cheaper production engines (such as those found in the Ford Focus diesel engines) where the loads are lower. Some engines also use cast iron crankshafts for low output versions while the more expensive high output version use forged steel.

===Machining===
Crankshafts can also be [[Machining|machined]] out of a [[Billet (manufacturing)|billet]], often a bar of high quality vacuum remelted steel. Though the fiber flow (local inhomogeneities of the material's chemical composition generated during casting) doesn’t follow the shape of the crankshaft (which is undesirable), this is usually not a problem since higher quality steels, which normally are difficult to forge, can be used. These crankshafts tend to be very expensive due to the large amount of material that must be removed with lathes and milling machines, the high material cost, and the additional heat treatment required. However, since no expensive tooling is needed, this production method allows small production runs without high costs.

In an effort to reduce costs, used crankshafts may also be machined. A good core may often be easily reconditioned by a crankshaft grinding &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crankshaft Grinding|url=http://crankshaftrepair.org/grinding/|publisher=Crankshaft Repair}}&lt;/ref&gt; process. Severely damaged crankshafts may also be repaired with a welding operation, prior to grinding, that utilizes a submerged arc welding machine. To accommodate the smaller journal diameters a ground crankshaft has, and possibly an over-sized thrust dimension, undersize engine bearings are used to allow for precise clearances during operation.

Machining or remanufacturing crankshafts are precision machined to exact tolerances with no odd size crankshaft bearings or journals. Thrust surfaces are micro-polished to provide precise surface finishes for smooth engine operation and reduced thrust bearing wear. Every journal is inspected and measured with critical accuracy. After machining, oil holes are chamfered to improve lubrication and every journal polished to a smooth finish for long bearing life. Remanufactured crankshafts are thoroughly cleaned with special emphasis to flushing and brushing out oil passages to remove any contaminants. Remanufacturing a crankshaft typically involves the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Remanufactured Crankshafts - Capital Reman Exchange|url = http://capitalremanexchange.com/remanufactured-crankshafts/|website = Capital Reman Exchange|accessdate = 2015-12-28|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cleaning and inspection ====
Machine shops soak the crankshafts in a hot tank and power wash the overall shaft. The oil holes are then wire brushed. A [[magnetic particle inspection]] checks for cracks. The crankshaft is magnetized and sprayed with an [[iron oxide]] powder which, under blacklight conditions, makes any imperfections visible. 

The counterweights are removed, cleaned, and checked for cracks and tightness. The bolts of loose counterweights are replaced. The counterweights are then installed back into the crankshafts, which are inspected for damage. A machinist determines the size and hardness of the journals and mains. 

A technician checks the keyway, nose, and bolt holes, then seals the surface for non-conformities. Bolt holes are typically tapped ½” or less on remanufactured crankshafts. The bearings and the straightness of the crankshaft are also inspected, and it must be re-straightened with an industrial straightening machine if not up to OEM standards. The straightening machine determines how many dials are out of line. To re-straighten the shaft, technicians heat the crankshaft to 500-600 degrees. Any more than 700 degrees takes the hardness out of the shaft. 

The magnetic particle inspection is repeated after the crankshaft has been straightened.

==== Stamp counterweight webbing ====
The counterweights and webbing are stamped in proper firing order (alpha if numeric and vice versa). Technicians then stamp the employee ID#, Work Order # and date on #1 rod webbing. Stamping this information on the rod webbing helps keep the quality control process order in case of future issues during the manufacturing process.

==== Undercutting and thermal spraying ====
Technicians undercut the rod or journals to eliminate wear before buildup. Further buildup and corrosion is typically prevented via [[thermal spraying]], which involves protrusion of molten particles onto the heated metallic surface, forming a smooth coating interwoven into the structure. Typically, boron alloys are used for this process, as they are very dense, hard, and oxide-free. They prevent against abrasive materials that cause divots, scratches, and cracks, and prevent surface erosion and corrosion.

==== Welding ====
The welding process for re-manufactured crankshafts is called submerged arc welding. It is a powdered flux plus a weld which combines to produce a more precise weld. The most common flux powder used is called #1 Flux 2245 HD. This powder eliminates the need for technicians to wear weld masking and reduces the amount of dust by-product.

==== Relieving stress and rechecking for straightness  ====
The crankshaft is once more heated to 500-600 degrees to relieve structural stress. Its overall straightness is also rechecked. If the re-manufactured crankshaft is out of alignment, then the technician must re-straighten the structure. 

==== Crankshaft grinding ====
Crankshaft grinding involves rough grinding the excess material from the rod or journals. On the rod there are various mains that need to be reground to proper OEM specifications. These rods are spun grind to the next under-size using the pultrusion crankshaft grinding machine. Rod mains are ground inside and outside. 

The technician then performs a finished crankshaft grinding procedure, which is a more precise grind which reaches the correct OEM specifications. Before the technician starts the crankshaft grinding they should see what crankshaft bearings are available and start from there. For example, the OEM specification for a Caterpillar 3306 Rod is 2.9987” – 3.0003”. Top industrial crankshaft grinding technicians always stop at the high end of the tolerance level. 

==== Shot peening ====
[[Shot peening]] adds an additional layer of hardness to the re-manufactured crankshaft.

==== Replacing counterweights and determining proper balance  ====
The counterweights are replaced in proper firing order. Either the new counterweights are installed or the old counterweight bolts are re-tightened.

The machine shop then determines if the proper rotational balance of the re-manufactured crankshafts is achieved. In the engine, the crankshaft, pistons, and rods are all in a constant rotation. The counterweights are designed to offset the weight of the rod and the pistons. When in motion, the kinetic energy and the sum of all forces should be equal to zero on all moving parts. If the counterweights are imbalanced, it adds additional stress on other components of the engine. The technician must ensure that the internal and external balance of the crankshaft counterweights are properly aligned.

==== Micro-polishing and testing Rockwell hardness ====
The technician micro-polishes each of the rebuilt crankshafts by hand. To further refine the crankshaft grinding process the machinist makes the most precise fit by micro-polishing the component with a 600-grit emery cloth. Through micro-polishing and industrial crankshaft grinding, the machine shop achieves the recommended Rockwell hardness and Ra finish (Roughness Parameter).

Industry standard crankshaft hardness is 40 on the [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell hardness scale]]. A 45-50 rating is what most reputable machine shops try to employ for all remanufactured crankshafts. Typically, hardness can be reduced if the engine is out of oil or the journal is spun incorrectly.

==== Final steps ====
Quality control inspects all of the finished crankshafts mistakes. A typical quality control department uses separate testing and analytical measurement tools from the technicians to ensure accuracy. The remanufactured crankshafts are then rustproofed using [[Cosmoline]] and packaged in damage-proof coverings.

===Microfinishing===
Microfinishing is a method of finishing the surface of the crankshaft in such a manner that microscopic roughness, pitting or cracking is reduced to a smooth, integral surface. Crankshafts fail by fatigue cracking and cracks start at the most highly stressed point in the material, which is the surface. Once a crack has developed, it increases the local stress in the area at its 'V' point, which slowly increases the size of the crack. The objective of microfinishing is to reduce to the smallest number and size any deviation in the surface and thus minimize the opportunity for cracks to develop. Increased requirements on microfinishing has become a common requirement as Industries are moving towards lead-free bearings. Improved performance and longevity are associated with the microfinishing requirements.

===Fatigue strength===
The fatigue strength of crankshafts is usually increased by using a radius at the ends of each main and crankpin bearing. The radius itself reduces the stress in these critical areas, but since the radius in most cases is rolled, this also leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which prevents cracks from forming.

===Hardening===
Most production crankshafts use induction hardened bearing surfaces, since that method gives good results with low costs. It also allows the crankshaft to be reground without re-hardening. But high performance crankshafts, billet crankshafts in particular, tend to use [[nitridization]] instead. Nitridization is slower and thereby more costly, and in addition it puts certain demands on the alloying metals in the steel to be able to create stable nitrides. The advantage of nitridization is that it can be done at low temperatures, it produces a very hard surface, and the process leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which is good for fatigue properties. The low temperature during treatment is advantageous in that it doesn’t have any negative effects on the steel, such as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. With crankshafts that operate on roller bearings, the use of [[carburization]] tends to be favored due to the high [[Hertzian contact stress]]es in such an application. Like nitriding, carburization also leaves some compressive residual stresses in the surface.

===Counterweights===
Some expensive, high performance crankshafts also use heavy-metal counterweights to make the crankshaft more compact. The heavy-metal used is most often a [[tungsten]] alloy but [[depleted uranium]] has also been used. A cheaper option is to use lead, but compared with tungsten its density is much lower.

==Stress on crankshafts==
The shaft is subjected to various forces but generally needs to be analysed in two positions. Firstly, failure may occur at the position of maximum bending; this may be at the centre of the crank or at either end. In such a condition the failure is due to bending and the pressure in the cylinder is maximal. Second, the crank may fail due to twisting, so the conrod needs to be checked for shear at the position of maximal twisting. The pressure at this position is the maximal pressure, but only a fraction of maximal pressure.''{{Clarify|date=July 2014}}

==Counter-rotating crankshafts==

In a conventional piston-crank arrangement in an engine or compressor, a piston is connected to a crankshaft by a connecting rod. As the piston moves through its stroke, the connecting rod varies its angle to the direction of motion of the piston and as the connecting rod is free to rotate at its connection to both the piston and crankshaft, no torque is transmitted by the connecting rod and forces transmitted by the connecting rod are transmitted along the longitudinal axis of the connecting rod. The force exerted by the piston on the connecting rod results in a reaction force exerted by the connecting rod back on the piston. When the connecting rod makes an angle to the direction of motion of the piston, the reaction force exerted by the connecting rod on the piston has a lateral component. This lateral force pushes the piston sideways against the cylinder wall. As the piston moves within the cylinder, this lateral force causes additional friction between the piston and cylinder wall. Friction accounts for approximately 20% of all losses in an internal combustion engine, of which approximately 50% is due to piston cylinder friction &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Company’s perspective in vehicle tribology. In: 18th Leeds-Lyon Symposium (eds D Dowson, CM Taylor and MGodet), Lyon, France, 3-6 September 1991|author=[[Andersson BS]]|publisher=[[New York: Elsevier]]|year=1991|pages=503-506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paired counter-rotating crankshaft arrangement, each piston is connected to two crankshafts so lateral forces due to the angle of the connecting rods cancel each other out. This reduces piston-cylinder friction and therefore fuel consumption. The symmetrical arrangement reduces the requirement for counterweights, reducing overall mass and making it easier for the engine to accelerate and decelerate. It also eliminates engine rocking and torque effects. Several counter-rotating crankshaft arrangements have been patented, for example US2010/0263621. An early example of a counter-rotating crankshaft arrangement is the Lanchester [[Flat twin engine|flat-twin]] engine.

The '''December 2000 nor'easter''' was a significant winter storm that impacted the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] regions of the [[United States]] around the end of the month.&lt;ref name="report1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Ross|title=Climate-Watch, December 2000|date=January 8, 2001|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 4, 2010|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/extremes/2000/december/extremes1200.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as an [[Alberta clipper]] that moved southeastward through the central United States and weakened over the [[Ohio Valley]]. However, it redeveloped off the coast of [[North Carolina]] and moved northward as it intensified. It moved into central [[Long Island]] and eventually tracked northward into New England. The storm dropped heavy precipitation throughout the Northeast, especially in northern [[New Jersey]] and eastern [[New York (state)|New York]], where snowfall often exceeded {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Even so, as it struck on a weekend, its effects were generally minor and mostly limited to travel delays, traffic accidents, and business closures.

==Synoptic history==
[[File:December 2000 nor'easter snowfall map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Snowfall accumulations from the nor'easter|alt=Map detailing total snowfall amounts from a particular storm. Light snowfall—marked in gray—extends as far south as Tennessee; the heaviest snow, indicated by two shades of blue, is concentrated over northern New Jersey, New York, and western New England.]]
The storm developed as an [[Alberta clipper]]-type [[low pressure area]] that moved southeastward across the [[Great Plains]] and [[Midwest U.S.|Midwest]]. Throughout [[North Dakota]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Iowa]], moderate snowfall accompanied the system. After weakening over the [[Ohio Valley]], the storm redeveloped off the coast of [[North Carolina]]. In the days preceding the event, a cyclone over eastern Canada circulated cold air southward. Computer models indicated the potential for a major storm up to seven days in advance; however, initially, certain forecasts suggested that a separate storm over the southern U.S. would merge with the clipper. Instead, this feature moved out to sea.&lt;ref name="Kocin1"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt;

As the secondary storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern [[Virginia]], eastern [[Maryland]] and [[Delaware]], largely in the form of freezing rain, ice, and snow. From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 [[mbar]], and continued to deepen for several more hours. Snowfall reached southern [[New Jersey]] between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and [[New York City]] at around 1000 UTC. [[Thundersnow]] developed within heavy bands in some areas.&lt;ref name="Kocin2"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 630&lt;/ref&gt; The significant snow was characterized by a sharp western cutoff; for example, in Chester County, accumulations ranged from around 6&amp;nbsp;inches in the far eastern parts of the county to only an inch along its western border with Lancaster County.

While located off the [[New Jersey]] coast, the storm stopped strengthening and slowly moved northward. The center was situated near central Long Island at 2100 UTC. Across eastern [[Long Island]] and parts of eastern New England, snow mixed with and, in some cases, changed over to rain. The surface low had moved into eastern [[Connecticut]] by early on December 31.&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt; As it continued to head northeastward, a new center of low pressure developed near [[Boston]] and moved towards coastal [[Maine]].&lt;ref name="Kocin3"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 636&lt;/ref&gt; The storm system had abated by January 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NOAA Central Library Data Imaging Project|title=Monday, January 1, 2001 Daily Weather Map|date=January 1, 2001|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=January 4, 2010|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/dwm/2001/20010101-20010107.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

The storm produced moderate to heavy snowfall from eastern [[Pennsylvania]] through New Jersey, New York, and New England, extending as far north as Maine. As much as {{convert|30|in|m|abbr=on}} fell west of the New York City metropolitan region, which generally reported {{convert|10|to|16|in|m|abbr=on}} of snow, making it the biggest snowstorm at the time since the [[North American blizzard of 1996]]. [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore]] recorded little or no snowfall, while {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} impacted Philadelphia. Eastern New York, especially the [[Hudson Valley]] and [[Catskill Mountains]], western Connecticut, western and central [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]] and Maine also picked up heavy snowfall.&lt;ref name="report1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kocin1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt; Eastern New England received up to {{convert|1|ft|m|abbr=on}} before dry air from the south reduced the duration of the snow.&lt;ref name="Kocin3"/&gt;

About 30 flights were canceled at the [[Philadelphia International Airport]], and the city declared a snow emergency. [[Amtrak]] canceled [[Metroliner (Amtrak)|Metroliner]] service along the northeast corridor from Washington, D.C. to New York City. Numerous businesses throughout eastern Pennsylvania closed on December 30, although because the storm struck on a weekend, the number of traffic accidents was fairly low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for Pennsylvania: Heavy Snow|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 4, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~405163}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In New Jersey, increasing winds caused blowing and drifting of the snow and led to near-blizzard conditions. Behind the storm, very cold and gusty weather lingered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for New Jersey: Heavy Snow|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 4, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~398978}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey Transit]] shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while shoveling, [[snow blower]] accidents or slips and falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]], a few roads were closed due to the snow. A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a [[Spotswood, New Jersey|Spotswood]] trailer park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for New Jersey: Heavy Snow (2)|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 4, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~398977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York State, the heaviest snow peaked at {{convert|29|in|m|abbr=on}} in Platte Cove, [[Greene County, NY|Greene County]]. Despite 50 flight cancellations at the [[Albany International Airport]] and several traffic accidents, no major damage or injuries were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for New York: Heavy Snow|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 4, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~400055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although heavy snow fell in the state, no major damage was reported in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for Connecticut: Heavy Snow|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 4, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~383000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, high winds, gusting to as high as {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} buffeted the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for Massachusetts: Strong Wind|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 4, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~383000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Event Record Details for Rhode Island: Strong Wind|date=|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=January 4, 2010|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~405214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dewatering''' {{IPAc-en|d|iː|ˈ|w|ɔː|t|ər|ɪ|ŋ}} is the removal of [[water]] from solid material or soil by wet classification, [[centrifugation]], [[filtration]], or similar solid-liquid [[separation process]]es, such as removal of residual liquid from a [[filter cake]] by a [[filter press]] as part of various industrial processes.

Construction dewatering, unwatering, or water control are common terms used to describe removal or draining groundwater or surface water from a [[Stream bed|riverbed]], [[construction site]], [[Deep foundation|caisson]], or [[shaft mining|mine shaft]], by pumping or evaporation. On a construction site, this dewatering may be implemented before subsurface excavation for foundations, shoring, or cellar space to lower the [[water table]]. This frequently involves the use of submersible "dewatering" [[pump]]s, centrifugal ("trash") pumps, eductors, or application of [[vacuum]] to well points.

==Processes==
=== Deep wells ===

A deep well typically consists of a borehole fitted with a slotted liner and an electric submersible pump. As water is pumped from a deep well, a [[hydraulic gradient]] is formed and water flows into the well forming a [[cone of depression]] around the well in which there is little or no water remaining in the [[pore space]]s of the surrounding soil. Deep wells work best in soils with a permeability of k&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{10^|-3}}&amp;nbsp;m/s to {{10^|-5}}&amp;nbsp;m/s; the amount of [[Drawdown (hydrology)|drawdown]] that a well can achieve is limited only by the size of the fish pump.&lt;ref&gt;CIRIA515 Groundwater control&amp;nbsp;– design and practice. Spon. London. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep wells can be installed in a ring around an excavation to lower the water level and maintain a safe, dry site. Several equations can be used to design deep well dewatering systems, however many of these are based on empirical data and occasionally fail. Practice and experience, along with a firm understanding of the underlying principles of dewatering, are the best tools for designing a successful system.&lt;ref&gt;The design of groundwater control systems using the observational method. TOL Roberts and M Preene. Geotechnique 44, No. 4, 727–34, December 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dewatering situations "are so common that they can be designed almost by rule of thumb".&lt;ref&gt;On the analysis of dewatering systems. JK White. Proceedings of the Xth International Conference of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, June 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water well|Deep wells]] are also used for [[aquifer test]]ing and for groundwater [[drainage by wells]].&lt;ref&gt;ILRI, 2000, ''Subsurface drainage by (tube)wells: Well spacing equations for fully and partially penetrating wells in uniform or layered aquifers with or without anisotropy and entrance resistance'', 9 pp. Principles used in the "WellDrain" model. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line:  [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/wellspac.pdf] . Free download "WellDrain" software from web page : [http://www.waterlog.info/software.htm] , or from : [http://www.waterlog.info/weldrain.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wellpoints ===

Wellpoints are small-diameter (about 50&amp;nbsp;mm) tubes with slots near the bottom that are inserted into the ground from which water is drawn by a vacuum generated by a dewatering pump. Wellpoints are typically installed at close centers in a line along or around the edge of an excavation. As a vacuum is limited to 0 bar, the height to which water can be drawn is limited to about 6 meters (in practice).&lt;ref&gt;The adaptable wellpoint. JK White. Water Services, May 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellpoints can be installed in stages, with the first reducing the water level by up to five meters, and a second stage, installed at a lower level, lowering it further.The water trickling between the deep wells may be collected by a single row of well point at the toe. This method ensures a much thicker width free from seepage forces.

Wellpoint spears are generally used to draw out groundwater in sandy soil conditions and are not as effective in clay or rock conditions. Open pumps are sometimes employed instead of spears if the ground conditions contain significant clay or rock content. &lt;ref&gt;Civil Assist Australia. 2014. Complete Water Table Management. [ONLINE] Available at: http://civilassistaustralia.com.au/service/ground-water-control/. [Accessed 03 March 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal drainage ===
The installation of horizontal dewatering systems is relatively easy.&lt;ref&gt;ILRI, 2000, ''The energy balance of groundwater flow applied to sububsurface drainage by pipes or ditches in anisotropic soils with entrance resistance: drain spacing equations.'', 18 pp. Principles used in the "EnDrain" model. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line:  [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/enerart.pdf] . Free download of "EnDrain" software from web page : [https://www.waterlog.info/software.htm] , or from : [http://www.waterlog.info/endrain.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; A trencher installs an unperforated pipe followed by a synthetic or organic wrapped perforated pipe. The drain length is determined by the drain diameter, soilconditions and the water table. In general drain lengths of 50 meters is common. After installation of the drainpipe a pump is connected to the drain. After the water table has been lowered, the intended construction can start. After the construction is finished the pumps are stopped, and the water table will rise again. Installation depths up to 6 meters are common.

== Control of pore pressures ==

Whilst engineers can use dewatering to lower a groundwater table, or to drain soils, they can also use the process to control [[pore pressure]] in soils and avoid damage to structures by [[base heave]]. High pore pressures occur in soils composed of fine silts or clays. Since these soils have a very low [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]], dewatering in a traditional sense (gravity flow into an abstraction well) may prove very costly or even futile. Instead, a [[vacuum]]-assisted dewatering scheme, such as [[ejector wells]], or vacuum-sealed [[Water well|deep wells]] may serve to draw water into a well for abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''drop''' or '''droplet''' is a small column of [[liquid]], bounded completely or almost completely by [[free surface]]s. A drop may form when liquid accumulates at the lower end of a tube or other surface boundary, producing a hanging drop called a [[pendant]] drop. Drops may also be formed by the [[condensation]] of a [[vapor]] or by [[atomizer nozzle|atomization]] of a larger mass of liquid.

Liquid forms drops because the liquid exhibits [[surface tension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o8MdoOd6pOcC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=Liquids+form+droplets+because+of+surface+tension#v=onepage&amp;q=Liquids%20form%20droplets%20because%20of%20surface%20tension&amp;f=false|title=The American Desk Encyclopedia|last=Luck|first=Steve|date=1998-10-22|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195214659|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple way to form a drop is to allow liquid to flow slowly from the lower end of a vertical tube of small diameter. The surface tension of the liquid causes the liquid to hang from the tube, forming a pendant. When the drop exceeds a certain size it is no longer stable and detaches itself. The falling liquid is also a drop held together by surface tension.

=== Viscosity and pitch drop experiments===
{{main|Viscosity|Pitch drop experiment}}
Some substances that appear to be solid, can be shown to instead be extremely [[viscosity|viscous]] liquids, because they form drops and display droplet behavior. In the famous [[pitch drop experiment]]s, [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] - a substance somewhat like solid [[bitumen]] - is shown to be a liquid in this way. Pitch in a funnel slowly forms droplets, each droplet taking about 10 years to form and break off.

== Pendant drop test ==
In the pendant drop test, a drop of liquid is suspended from the end of a tube by [[surface tension]]. The force due to surface tension is proportional to the length of the boundary between the liquid and the tube, with the proportionality constant usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Cutnell
  | first = John D.
  |author2=Kenneth W. Johnson
  | title = Essentials of Physics
  | publisher = Wiley Publishing
  | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the length of this boundary is the circumference of the tube, the force due to surface tension is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\,F_{\gamma} = \pi d \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the tube diameter.

The mass ''m'' of the drop hanging from the end of the tube can be found by equating the force due to gravity (&lt;math&gt;F_{g} = mg&lt;/math&gt;) with the component of the surface tension in the vertical direction (&lt;math&gt;F_{\gamma} \sin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;) giving the formula

: &lt;math&gt;\,mg = \pi d \gamma \sin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where α is the [[contact angle|angle of contact]] with the tube, and ''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity.

The limit of this formula, as α goes to 90°, gives the maximum weight of a pendant drop for a liquid with a given surface tension, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\,mg = \pi d \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is the basis of a convenient method of measuring surface tension, commonly used in the petroleum industry. More sophisticated methods are available to take account of the developing shape of the pendant as the drop grows. These methods are used if the surface tension is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Drop adhesion to a solid ==
The drop [[adhesion]] to a solid can be divided into two categories: lateral adhesion and normal adhesion. Lateral adhesion resembles friction (though [[tribology|tribologically]] lateral adhesion is a more accurate term) and refers to the force required to slide a drop on the surface, namely the force to detach the drop from its position on the surface only to translate it to another position on the surface. Normal adhesion is the adhesion required to detach a drop from the surface in the normal direction, namely the force to cause the drop to fly off from the surface. The measurement of both adhesion forms can be done with the [[Centrifugal Adhesion Balance]] (CAB). The CAB uses a combination of centrifugal and gravitational forces to obtain any ratio of lateral and normal forces. For example, it can apply a normal force at zero lateral force for the drop to fly off away from the surface in the normal direction or it can induce a lateral force at zero normal force (simulating zero [[gravity]]).

== Droplet ==
The term '''droplet''' is a diminutive form of 'drop' - and as a guide is typically used for liquid particles of less than 500&amp;nbsp;µm diameter.  In [[pesticide application|spray application]], droplets are usually described by their perceived size (i.e., diameter) whereas the dose (or number of infective particles in the case of [[biopesticide]]s) is a function of their volume.  This increases by [[Volume of a sphere|a cubic function]] relative to diameter&lt;!-- (π.d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/6000 to convert µm into picolitres)--&gt;; thus a 50&amp;nbsp;µm droplet represents a dose in 65&amp;nbsp;pl and a 500&amp;nbsp;µm drop represents a dose in 65 nanolitres.

== Speed ==
A droplet with a diameter of 3&amp;nbsp;mm has a terminal velocity of approximately 8&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref name="uvasim"/&gt;
Drops smaller than {{nowrap|1 mm}} in diameter will attain 95% of their terminal velocity within {{nowrap|2 m}}. But above this size the distance to get to terminal velocity increases sharply. An example is a drop with a diameter of {{nowrap|2 mm}} that may achieve this at {{nowrap|5.6 m}}.&lt;ref name="uvasim"&gt;{{cite web |title=Numerical model for the fall speed of raindrops in a waterfall simulator |url=http://staff.science.uva.nl/~jboxel/Publications/PDFs/Gent_98.pdf |page=2 |date=2005-10-04 |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731002444/http://staff.science.uva.nl/~jboxel/Publications/PDFs/Gent_98.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optics ==
Due to the different [[refractive index]] of [[water]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[refraction]] and [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] occur on the surfaces of [[rain]]drops, leading to [[rainbow]] formation.

== Sound ==
{{listen|filename=Water drops dripping.ogg|title=Drops dripping into water.}}

The major source of sound when a droplet hits a liquid surface is the [[Liquid bubble#Pulsation|resonance of excited bubbles]] trapped underwater.  These oscillating bubbles are responsible for most liquid sounds, such as running water or splashes, as they actually consist of many drop-liquid collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==="Dripping tap" noise prevention===
Reducing the surface tension of a body of liquid makes possible to reduce or prevent noise due to droplets falling into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2018/06/25/dripping-tap-sound-solved|title=Scientists have finally come up with a solution for the world's most annoying household sound|first=Rachel|last=Thompson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would involve adding [[soap]], [[detergent]] or a similar substance to water. The reduced surface tension reduces the noise from dripping.

== Shape ==
[[File:Raindrops sizes.svg|thumb|The shapes of raindrops, depending on their sizes.]]

The classic shape associated with a drop (with a pointy end in its upper side) comes from the observation of a droplet clinging to a surface. The shape of a drop falling through a gas is actually more or less spherical  for drops less than 2 mm in diameter.&lt;ref name="Pruppacher 1971 86–94"&gt;{{cite journal

== Size ==
Raindrop sizes typically range from 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 4&amp;nbsp;mm, with size distributions quickly decreasing past diameters larger than 2-2.5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists traditionally thought that the variation in the size of raindrops was due to collisions on the way down to the ground. In 2009 French researchers succeeded in showing that the distribution of sizes is due to the drops' interaction with air, which deforms larger drops and causes them to fragment into smaller drops, effectively limiting the largest raindrops to about 6&amp;nbsp;mm diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Emmanuel Villermaux, Benjamin Bossa |title=Single-drop fragmentation distribution of raindrops |url=https://www.irphe.fr/~fragmix/publis/VB2009.pdf |journal=Nature Physics |date=September 2009 |volume=5 |pages=697–702 |doi=10.1038/NPHYS1340 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8155883.stm |issue=9 |bibcode = 2009NatPh...5..697V }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, drops up to 10&amp;nbsp;mm (equivalent in volume to a sphere of radius 4.5&amp;nbsp;mm) are theoretically stable and could be levitated in a wind tunnel.&lt;ref name="Pruppacher 1971 86–94"/&gt;
The largest recorded raindrop was 8.8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, located at the base of a [[cumulus congestus cloud]] in the vicinity of [[Kwajalein Atoll]] in July 1999. A raindrop of identical size was detected over northern Brazil in September 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Standardized droplet sizes in medicine===
In [[medicine]], this property is used to create [[dropper]]s and IV infusion sets which have a [[Technical standard|standardized]] [[diameter]], in such a way that 1 [[millilitre]] is equivalent to 20 [[Drop (unit)|drops]]. When smaller amounts are necessary (such as paediatrics), microdroppers or paediatric infusion sets are used, in which 1 millilitre = 60 microdrops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www6.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=millilitre|title=https://www6.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=millilitre|website=www6.dict.cc|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25272">'''ISO 14000''' is a family of standards related to [[environmental management]] that exists to help organizations (a) minimize how their operations (processes, etc.) negatively [[environmental effects|affect the environment]] (i.e. cause adverse changes to air, water, or land); (b) comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other environmentally oriented requirements; and (c) continually improve in the above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISO 14000 family - Environmental management |url=https://www.iso.org/iso-14001-environmental-management.html |website=www.iso.org |publisher=ISO |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14000 is similar to [[ISO 9000]] [[quality management]] in that both pertain to the process of how a product is produced, rather than to the product itself. As with ISO 9001, certification is performed by third-party organizations rather than being awarded by ISO directly. The [[ISO 19011]] and [[Accreditation|ISO 17021]] audit standards apply when audits are being performed.

The requirements of ISO 14001 are an integral part of the [[European Union]]'s [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme]] (EMAS). EMAS's structure and material  are more demanding, mainly concerning performance improvement, legal compliance, and reporting duties.&lt;ref name="EMASFrom14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emas.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_service/PDF-Dateien/UGA_Infosheet_From-ISO-14001-to-EMAS.pdf |format=PDF |title=From ISO 14001 to EMAS: Mind the gap |publisher=Office of the German EMAS Advisory Board |date=August 2014 |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of ISO 14001 is ISO 14001:2015, which was published in September 2015.&lt;ref name="NadenTheNewly15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/news/2015/09/Ref1999.html |title=The newly revised ISO 14001 is here |author=Naden, C. |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |date=15 September 2015 |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief history of environmental management systems ==
{{See also|Environmental management system}}
In March 1992, [[BSI Group]] published the world's first environmental management systems standard, BS 7750, as part of a response to growing concerns about protecting the environment.&lt;ref name="SmithBS7750_93"&gt;{{cite journal |title=BS 7750 and environmental management |journal=Coloration Technology |author=Smith, C. |volume=109 |issue=9 |pages=278–279 |year=1993 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-4408.1993.tb01574.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, environmental management had been part of larger systems such as [[Responsible Care]]. BS 7750 supplied the template for the development of the ISO 14000 series in 1996, which has representation from ISO committees all over the world.&lt;ref name="ClementsComplete96"&gt;{{cite book |title=Complete Guide to ISO 14000 |author=Clements, R.B. |publisher=Prentice Hall |pages=316 |isbn=9780132429757}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrorsonEnviro99"&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Management: How to Implement an Environmental Management System Within a Company Or Other Organisation |author=Brorson, T. |publisher=EMS AB |pages=300 |isbn=9789163076619}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, more than 300,000 certifications to ISO 14001 can be found in 171 countries.&lt;ref name="ISO14000Fam"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/iso-14001-environmental-management.html |title=ISO 14000 family - Environmental management |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the development of the ISO 14000 series, organizations voluntarily constructed their own EMSs, but this made comparisons of environmental effects between companies difficult; therefore, the universal ISO 14000 series was developed. An EMS is defined by ISO as: "part of the overall management system, that includes organizational structure, planning activities, responsibilities, practices, procedures, processes, and resources for developing, implementing, achieving, and maintaining the environmental policy."&lt;ref name="NRCEnviro99"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/6481/environmental-management-systems-and-iso-14001-federal-facilities-council-report |title=Environmental Management Systems and ISO 14001 Federal Facilities Council Report No. 138 |author=National Research Council |publisher=National Academies Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780309184342 |doi=10.17226/6481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the ISO 14000 series ==
The ISO 14000 family includes most notably the ISO 14001 standard, which represents the core set of standards used by organizations for designing and implementing an effective [[environmental management system]] (EMS). Other standards in this series include ISO 14004, which gives additional guidelines for a good EMS, and more specialized standards dealing with specific aspects of environmental management. The major objective of the ISO 14000 series of norms is to provide "practical tools for companies and organizations of all kinds looking to manage their environmental responsibilities."&lt;ref name="ISO14000Fam" /&gt;

The ISO 14000 series is based on a voluntary approach to environmental regulation.&lt;ref name="SzymanskiISO04"&gt;{{cite journal |title=ISO 14001 and the Reduction of Toxic Emissions |journal=The Journal of Policy Reform |author=Szymanski, M.; Tiwari, P. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |year=2004 |doi=10.1080/1384128042000219717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series includes the ISO 14001 standard, which provides guidelines for the establishment or improvement of an EMS. The standard shares many common traits with its predecessor, ISO 9000, the international standard of quality management&lt;ref name="JacksonMonitor97"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Monitoring and measurement systems for implementing ISO 14001 |journal=Environmental Quality Management |author=Jackson, S.L. |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=33–41 |year=1997 |doi=10.1002/tqem.3310060306}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which served as a model for its internal structure&lt;ref name="NRCEnviro99" /&gt;, and both can be implemented side by side. As with ISO 9000, ISO 14000 acts both as an internal management tool and as a way of demonstrating a company’s environmental commitment to its customers and clients.&lt;ref name="BoiralCorp07"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Corporate Greening Through ISO 14001: A Rational Myth? |journal=Organization Science |author=Boiral, O. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=127–46 |year=2007 |doi=10.1287/orsc.1060.0224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO 14001 standard==
ISO 14001 defines criteria for an EMS. It does not state requirements for environmental performance but rather maps out a framework that a company or organization can follow to set up an effective EMS. It can be used by any organization that wants to improve resource efficiency, reduce waste, and reduce costs. Using ISO 14001 can provide assurance to company management and employees as well as external stakeholders that environmental impact is being measured and improved.&lt;ref name="ISO14000Fam" /&gt; ISO 14001 can also be integrated with other management functions and assists companies in meeting their environmental and economic goals.

ISO 14001, like other ISO 14000 standards, is voluntary&lt;ref name="IISD_ISO14001"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iisd.org/business/tools/systems_iso.aspx |title=ISO 14001 |publisher=International Institute for Sustainable Development |date=2013 |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with its main aim to assist companies in continually improving their environmental performance and complying with any applicable legislation. The organization sets its own targets and performance measures, and the standard highlights what an organization needs to do to meet those goals, and to monitor and measure the situation.&lt;ref name="IISD_ISO14001" /&gt; The standard does not focus on measures and goals of environmental performance, but of the organization. The standard can be applied to a variety of levels in the business, from the organizational level down to the product and service level. 

ISO 14001 is known as a generic management system standard, meaning that it is relevant to any organization seeking to improve and manage resources more effectively. This includes:

* single-site to large multi-national companies
* high-risk companies to low-risk service organizations
* the manufacturing, process, and service industries, including local governments
* all industry sectors, including public and private sectors
* original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers

=== ISO 14001:2015 ===

All standards are periodically reviewed by ISO to ensure they still meet market requirements. The current version is ISO 14001:2015, and certified organizations were given a three-year transition period to adapt their environmental management system to the new edition of the standard. The new version of ISO 14001 focuses on the improvement of environmental performance rather than the improvement of the management system itself.&lt;ref name="ISO14001Revis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/iso-14001-revision.html |title=ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems - Revision |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes several new updates all aimed at making environmental management more comprehensive and relevant to the supply chain. One of the main updates asks organizations to consider environmental impact during the entire life cycle, although there is no requirement to actually complete a life cycle analysis. Additionally, the commitments of top management and the methods of evaluating compliance have also been strengthened. Another significant change linked ISO 14001 to the general management system structure, introduced in 2015, called the High Level Structure. Both ISO 9001 and 14001 use this same structure, making implementation and auditing more uniform. The new standard also requires the holder of the certificate to specify risks and opportunities and how to address them.

=== Basic principles and methodology ===
[[File:PDCA Cycle.svg|thumb|The PDCA cycle]]
The basic principles of ISO 14001 are based on the well-known [[PDCA|Plan-Do-Check-Act]] (PDCA) cycle.

==== Plan: Establish objectives and processes required ====
Prior to implementing ISO 14001, an initial review or gap analysis of the organization's processes and products is recommended, to assist in identifying all elements of the current operation and, if possible, future operations, that may interact with the environment, termed "environmental aspects."&lt;ref name="MartinISO98Arch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usistf.org/download/ISMS_Downloads/ISO14001.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728150948/http://www.usistf.org/download/ISMS_Downloads/ISO14001.pdf |format=PDF |title=ISO 14001 Guidance Manual |author=Martin, R. |publisher=National Center for Environmental Decision-Making Research |date=10 March 1998 |archivedate=28 July 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental aspects can include both direct, such as those used during manufacturing, and indirect, such as raw materials. This review assists the organization in establishing their environmental objectives, goals, and targets (which should ideally be measurable); helps with the development of control and management procedures and processes; and serves to highlight any relevant legal requirement, which can then be built into the policy.&lt;ref name="MartinISO98Arch" /&gt;

==== Do: Implement the processes ====
During this stage, the organization identifies the resources required and works out those members of the organization responsible for the EMS' implementation and control.&lt;ref name="MartinISO98Arch" /&gt; This includes establishing procedures and processes, although only one documented procedure is specifically related to operational control. Other procedures are required to foster better management control over elements such as documentation control, emergency preparedness and response, and the education of employees, to ensure that they can competently implement the necessary processes and record results. Communication and participation across all levels of the organization, especially top management, is a vital part of the implementation phase, with the effectiveness of the EMS being dependent on active involvement from all employees.&lt;ref name="MartinISO98Arch" /&gt;

==== Check: Measure and monitor the processes and report results ====
During the "check" stage, performance is monitored and periodically measured to ensure that the organization's environmental targets and objectives are being met. In addition, internal audits are conducted at planned intervals to ascertain whether the EMS meets the user's expectations and whether the processes and procedures are being adequately maintained and monitored.&lt;ref name="MartinISO98Arch" /&gt;

==== Act: Take action to improve performance of EMS based on results ====
After the checking stage, a management review is conducted to ensure that the objectives of the EMS are being met, the extent to which they are being met, and that communications are being appropriately managed. Additionally, the review evaluates changing circumstances, such as legal requirements, in order to make recommendations for further improvement of the system. These recommendations are incorporated through continual improvement: plans are renewed or new plans are made, and the EMS moves forward.&lt;ref name="MartinISO98Arch" /&gt;

==== Continual Improvement Process (CI) ====
ISO 14001 encourages a company to continually improve its environmental performance. Apart from the obvious – the reduction in actual and possible negative environmental impacts – this is achieved in three ways&lt;ref name="GastlKontinu09"&gt;{{cite book |title=Kontinuierliche Verbesserung im Umweltmanagement: Die KVP-Forderung der ISO 14001 in Theorie und Unternehmenspraxis |author=Gastl, R. |publisher=vdf Hochschulverlag AG |pages=336 |year=2009 |isbn=9783728132314 |doi=10.3218/3231-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Expansion: Business areas increasingly get covered by the implemented EMS.
* Enrichment: Activities, products, processes, emissions, resources, etc. increasingly get managed by the implemented EMS.
* Upgrading: The structural and organizational framework of the EMS, as well as an accumulation of knowledge in dealing with business-environmental issues, is improved.

Overall, the CI concept expects the organization to gradually move away from merely operational environmental measures towards a more strategic approach on how to deal with environmental challenges.

=== Benefits ===
ISO 14001 was developed primarily to assist companies with a framework for better management control, which can result in reducing their environmental impacts. In addition to improvements in performance, organizations can reap a number of economic benefits, including higher conformance with legislative and regulatory requirements&lt;ref name="SheldonISO97"&gt;{{cite book |title=ISO 14001 and Beyond: Environmental Management Systems in the Real World |author=Sheldon, C. |publisher=Greenleaf Publishing |pages=410 |year=1997 |isbn=9781874719014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by adopting the ISO standard. By minimizing the risk of regulatory and environmental liability fines and improving an organization’s efficiency&lt;ref name="DelmasErratum04"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Erratum to "Stakeholders and Competitive Advantage: The Case of ISO 14001" |journal=Production and Operations Management |author=Delmas, M. |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=398 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1937-5956.2004.tb00226.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;, benefits can include a reduction in waste, consumption of resources, and operating costs. Secondly, as an internationally recognized standard, businesses operating in multiple locations across the globe can leverage their conformance to ISO 14001, eliminating the need for multiple registrations or certifications.&lt;ref name="HutchensUsing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intertek.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4431 |title=Using ISO 9001 or ISO 14001 to Gain a Competitive Advantage |author=Hutchens Jr., S. |publisher=Intertek |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, there has been a push in the last decade by consumers for companies to adopt better internal controls, making the incorporation of ISO 14001 a smart approach for the long-term viability of businesses. This can provide them with a competitive advantage against companies that do not adopt the standard (Potoki &amp; Prakash, 2005). This in turn can have a positive impact on a company's asset value (Van der Deldt, 1997). It can lead to improved public perceptions of the business, placing them in a better position to operate in the international marketplace.&lt;ref name="PotoskiGreen05"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Green Clubs and Voluntary Governance: ISO 14001 and Firms' Regulatory Compliance |journal=American Journal of Political Science |author=Potoski, M.; Prakash, A. |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=235–248 |year=2005 |doi=10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00120.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SheldonISO97" /&gt; The use of ISO 14001 can demonstrate an innovative and forward-thinking approach to customers and prospective employees. It can increase a business’s access to new customers and business partners. In some markets it can potentially reduce public liability insurance costs. It can also serve to reduce trade barriers between registered businesses.&lt;ref name="VanDerVeldtCase97"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Case studies of ISO 14001: A new business guide for global environmental protection |journal=Environmental Quality Management |author=Van der Veldt, D. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |year=1997 |doi=10.1002/tqem.3310070102}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is growing interest in including certification to ISO 14001 in tenders for public-private partnerships for infrastructure renewal. Evidence of value in terms of environmental quality and benefit to the taxpayer has been shown in highway projects in Canada.{{Citation needed|reason=What evidence?|date=November 2017}}

=== Conformity assessment===
ISO 14001 can be used in whole or in part to help an organization (for-profit or not-for-profit) better manage its relationship with the environment. If all the elements of ISO 14001 are incorporated into the management process, the organization may opt to prove that it has achieved full alignment or conformity with the international standard, ISO 14001, by using one of four recognized options. These are&lt;ref name="MartinISO98Arch" /&gt;:

#make a self-determination and self-declaration, or
#seek confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organization, such as customers, or
#seek confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external to the organization, or
#seek certification/registration of its EMS by an external organization.

ISO does not control conformity assessment; its mandate is to develop and maintain standards. ISO has a neutral policy on conformity assessment in so much that one option is not better than the next. Each option serves different market needs. The adopting organization decides which option is best for them, in conjunction with their market needs.

Option one is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "self-certify" or "self-certification". This is not an acceptable reference under ISO terms and definitions, for it can lead to confusion in the market.&lt;ref name="MartinISO98Arch" /&gt; The user is responsible for making their own determination. 

Option two is often referred to as a customer or 2nd-party audit, which is an acceptable market term. 

Option three is an independent third-party process by an organization that is based on an engagement activity and delivered by specially trained practitioners. This option was based on an accounting procedure branded as the EnviroReady Report, which was created to help small- and medium-sized organizations. Its development was originally based on the Canadian Handbook for Accountants; it is now based on an international accounting standard.

The fourth option, certification, is another independent third-party process, which has been widely implemented by all types of organizations. Certification is also known in some countries as registration. Service providers of certification or registration are accredited by national accreditation services such as [[UKAS]] in the UK.

==ISO 14001 and EMAS==
In 2010, the latest [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]] Regulation (EMAS III) entered into force; the scheme is now globally applicable, and includes key performance indicators and a range of further improvements. 
{{As of|April 2017}}, more than 3,900 organizations and approximately 9,200 sites are EMAS registered.&lt;ref name="EMASStats17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/emas_registrations/statistics_graphs_en.htm |title=Statistics &amp; graphs |publisher=European Commission |date=April 2017 |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complementarities and differences ===
ISO 14001's EMS requirements are similar to those of EMAS. Additional requirements for EMAS include&lt;ref name="EMASFrom14" /&gt;: 
 
* stricter requirements on the measurement and evaluation of environmental performance against objectives and targets
* government supervision of the environmental verifiers 
* strong employee involvement; EMAS organizations acknowledge that active employee involvement is a driving force and a prerequisite for continuous and successful environmental improvements.
* [[environmental core indicators]] creating multi-annual comparability within and between organizations 
* mandatory provision of information to the general public 
* registration by a public authority

===ISO 14001 use in supply chains===
There are many reasons that ISO 14001 should be potentially attractive to [[supply chain]] managers, including the use of the voluntary standard to guide the development of integrated systems, its requirement for supply chain members in industries such as [[automotive industry|automotive]] and [[aerospace industry|aerospace]], the potential of [[pollution prevention]] leading to [[cost reduction|reduced costs]] of production and higher [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], its alignment with the growing importance of [[corporate social responsibility]], and the possibility that an ISO-registered system may provide firms with a unique environmental resource, capabilities, and benefits that lead to [[competitive advantage]].
 
Research on the supply chain impact of ISO 14001 registration posited that potential positive impacts might include more proactive environmental management, higher levels of communication, higher levels of [[waste reduction]] and [[cost efficiency]], better [[Return on investment|ROI]], higher levels of customer relationship management, fewer issues with employee health, and a reduced number of safety incidents. This research concluded that ISO 14001 registration can be leveraged across the supply chain for competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="CurkovicUsing10"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Using ISO 14001 to promote a sustainable supply chain strategy |journal=Business Strategy and the Environment |author=Curkovic, S.; Sroufe, R. |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=71–93 |year=2011 |doi=10.1002/bse.671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==
This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986–2001, 2002–2009, and 2010–2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

* On January 6, 2002, an El Paso Field Services natural gas pipeline was damaged at Schutenburg, Texas, when a log drift created by heavy rains and flooding hit the pipeline, creating longitudinal strain stressing a coupling, which separated. The coupling was located approximately 15' landward from the riverbank. The pipe depth at the location of the leak was 84 inches.&lt;ref name="dot"&gt;PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 2002–2009, PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed January 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 26, 2002, a [[Northern Natural Gas Company]] (Enron) underwater natural gas transmission pipeline sprung a leak through a pinhole rupture due to internal corrosion in the body of a 24-inch diameter pipe manufactured in 1981.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;
* On February 6, an 8-inch diesel pipeline was found to be leaking in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. About 14,600 gallons of fuel were leaked, with about 5,900 of it recovered. The cause was from external corrosion.&lt;ref name="dot2"&gt;[https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/portal/site/PHMSA/menuitem.6f23687cf7b00b0f22e4c6962d9c8789/?vgnextoid=fdd2dfa122a1d110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=3430fb649a2dc110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=print]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* On February 8, a trenching machine with a new rock bit being tested hit a 20-inch diameter gas transmission pipeline in [[Noble County, Oklahoma]], causing an explosion that killed the trencher operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/document.cfm?docID=292679&amp;docketID=38133&amp;mkey=59739 |title=Document 1 Oklahoma Corporation Commission Pipeline Failure Investigation Report (manually redacted) Filing Date April 17, 2008 13 page(s) of Text (PDF) Photos |publisher=Dms.ntsb.gov |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203115859/http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/document.cfm?docID=292679&amp;docketID=38133&amp;mkey=59739 |archivedate=February 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 20, 2002, in a “high consequence area” at [[Longview, Texas]], a Voyageur Pipeline natural gas gathering line leaked due to bacterial corrosion causing two holes in the pipe. Twelve people were evacuated from the area as a precautionary measure. The eight-inch diameter pipe was manufactured in 1956.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;
* On March 6, 2002, near [[Jeffersonville, Kentucky]], a 26-inch diameter [[Tennessee Gas Pipeline]] ruptured in a compressor station yard, causing a fire and explosion that did more than $2&amp;nbsp;million in property damage. The failure originated at a manufacturing defect which caused a weld to crack. The pipe was manufactured in 1950.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt; 30 families in the area voluntarily evacuated. There were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=20020305&amp;id=YmoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=W8kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1838,896318|title=Times Daily – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/270790 |title=March 6, 2002 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020202843/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/270790 |archivedate=October 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On May 22, an 8-inch petroleum products pipeline failed, spilling about 2,000 barrels of unleaded gasoline on to a wheat field near [[Ottawa, Kansas]]. Booms had to be deployed in nearby creeks. The pipe failed along a seam, possibly due to LF-[[Electric resistance welding|ERW]] pipeline failure issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May 31, 2002 – Re: CPF No. 3-2002-501 I H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320025011H/320025011h_text.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028014046/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320025011H/320025011h_text.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 29, 2002, a Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corporation pipeline at [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] leaked after being punctured by a driller who struck the 12-inch diameter gas transmission line. Because it was a “high consequence area,” 180 people were evacuated as a precautionary measure.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;
* On June 20, PHMSA ordered [[Columbia Gas Transmission]] Company to do extensive repair to one of their gas transmission pipelines in the states of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], after finding extensive wall thinning on sections of that pipeline system caused by external corrosion. Approximately 800 anomalies with wall thickness losses of greater than 65 percent were found during a smart pig examination, with 76 of the found anomalies having a wall thickness loss of greater than 80 percent. Many of the affected sections of pipe were older sections lacking coating, which is known to reduce external corrosion on pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 20, 2002 – RE: CPF No. 1-2002-1004-H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120021004H/120021004H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_06202002.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028024147/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120021004H/120021004H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_06202002.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 4, there was a rupture of an [[Enbridge]] Pipeline, and release of crude oil near [[Cohasset, Minnesota]]. The pipeline ruptured in a marsh in [[Itasca County]], spilling {{convert|6000|oilbbl|m3}} of crude oil. In an attempt to keep the oil from contaminating the [[Mississippi River]], the [[Minnesota Department of Natural Resources]] set a controlled burn that lasted for one day and created a smoke plume about 1 mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) high and 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) long. The pipe failed due to cracking caused by train shipping induced cracking of the pipe being delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0401.aspx |title=Pipeline Accident Report PAR-04-01 |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date= |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922142541/http://ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0401.aspx |archivedate=September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 22, 2002, [[Kinder Morgan]]’s KN Interstate Gas Transmission 12-inch diameter natural gas pipeline at [[Lodgepole, Nebraska]] ruptured due to galvanic corrosion on an interior seam weld. The pipe was manufactured in 1954. The instantaneous release of gas was ignited, probably by overhead electric power lines. The fire burned farm crops in vicinity of rupture along with the power pole and some power lines.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;
* On July 24 a gas explosion leveled a [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]] house, killing a 4-year-old girl and her 5-year-old sister. A failed sleeve on the gas line in the basement of the house was suspected of being the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/x1602165196/Family-still-grieves-10-years-after-fatal-Hopkinton-explosion?zc_p=0 |title=Family still grieves ten years after fatal Hopkinton explosion – News – Framingham, MA |publisher=The MetroWest Daily News |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028042824/http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/x1602165196/Family-still-grieves-10-years-after-fatal-Hopkinton-explosion?zc_p=0 |archivedate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 5, a natural gas pipeline exploded and caught fire west of Rt. 622, on Poca River Road near [[Lanham, West Virginia]]. Emergency workers evacuated three or four families. Kanawha and Putnam Counties in the area were requested to shelter in place. Parts of the pipeline were thrown hundreds of yards away, around and across Poca River. The fire was not contained for several hours because valves to shut down the line did not exist. The orange glow from the fire at 11&amp;nbsp;PM; could be seen for several miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/portal/site/PHMSA/menuitem.ebdc7a8a7e39f2e55cf2031050248a0c/?vgnextoid=fdd2dfa122a1d110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=3430fb649a2dc110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=print |title=PHMSA – Data and Statistics – Distribution, Transmission, and Liquid Accident and Incident Data |publisher=Phmsa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428103024/http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/portal/site/PHMSA/menuitem.ebdc7a8a7e39f2e55cf2031050248a0c/?vgnextoid=fdd2dfa122a1d110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=3430fb649a2dc110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=print# |archivedate=April 28, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion and fire caused $2,735,339 of property damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/safety/IncDetSt_st_WV_flt_sig.html?nocache=2986 |title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications |website=Primis.phmsa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028020753/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/safety/IncDetSt_st_WV_flt_sig.html?nocache=2986 |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Columbia Gas Transmission]] Corporation's 30-inch diameter pipeline ruptured due to earth movement (a landslide on an unstable slope) which stressed and buckled the steel pipe installed in 1969.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;

'''Lithium niobate''' ({{Lithium}}{{Niobium}}{{Oxygen|3}}) is a compound of [[niobium]], [[lithium]], and [[oxygen]]. Its single crystals are an important material for optical waveguides, mobile phones, piezoelectric sensors, optical modulators and various other linear and non-linear optical applications. It is a human-made dielectric material that does not exist in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weis, R. S. |author2=Gaylord, T.

==Properties==
Lithium niobate is a colorless solid insoluble in water. It has a [[trigonal]] [[crystal system]], which lacks [[inversion symmetry]] and displays [[ferroelectricity]], the [[Pockels effect]], the [[piezoelectric]] effect, [[photoelasticity]] and [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] polarizability. Lithium niobate has negative uniaxial [[birefringence]] which depends slightly on the [[stoichiometry]] of the crystal and on temperature. It is transparent for wavelengths between 350 and 5200 [[nanometer]]s.

Lithium niobate can be doped by [[magnesium oxide]], which increases its resistance to optical damage (also known as photorefractive damage) when doped above the [[optical damage threshold]]. Other available dopants are {{iron}}, {{zinc}}, {{hafnium}}, {{copper}}, {{gadolinium}}, {{erbium}}, {{yttrium}}, {{Manganese}} and {{boron}}.

==Applications==
Lithium niobate is used extensively in the telecoms market, e.g. in [[mobile telephone]]s and [[optical modulator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Lithium Niobate Photonics|first = James|last = Toney |publisher = Artech House|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-60807-923-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the material of choice for the manufacture of [[surface acoustic wave]] devices. For some uses it can be replaced by [[lithium tantalate]], {{lithium}}{{tantalum}}{{oxygen|3}}. Other uses are in [[laser]] [[second harmonic generation|frequency doubling]], [[nonlinear optics]], [[Pockels effect#Pockels cells|Pockels cell]]s, [[optical parametric oscillator]]s, [[Q-switching]] devices for lasers, other [[acousto-optic effect|acousto-optic]] devices, [[optical switch]]es for gigahertz frequencies, etc. It is an excellent material for manufacture of [[optical waveguide]]s. It's also used in the making of optical spatial low-pass ([[Anti-aliasing filter|anti-aliasing]]) filters. 

In the past few years lithium niobate is finding applications as a kind of electrostatic tweezers, an approach known as optoelectronic tweezers as the effect requires light excitation to take place.&lt;ref name="Carrascosa M 2015"&gt;Carrascosa M, García-Cabañes A, Jubera M, Ramiro JB, and Agulló-López F. LiNbO3: A photovoltaic substrate for massive parallel manipulation and patterning of nano-objects. Applied Physics Reviews 2: 040605 0(2015).doi:10.1063/1.4929374&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="García-Cabañes A 2018"&gt;García-Cabañes A, Blázquez-Castro A, Arizmendi L, Agulló-López F, and Carrascosa M. Recent Achievements on Photovoltaic Optoelectronic Tweezers Based on Lithium Niobate. Crystals 8: 65 (2018).doi:10.3390/cryst8020065&lt;/ref&gt; This effect allows for fine manipulation of micrometer-scale particles with high flexibility since the tweezing action is constrained to the illuminated area. The effect is based on the very high electric fields generated during light exposure (1–100 kV/cm) within the illuminated spot. These intense fields are also finding applications in biophysics and biotechnology, as they can influence living organisms in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name="Blázquez-Castro A 2018"&gt;Blázquez-Castro A, García-Cabañes A, and Carrascosa M. Biological applications of ferroelectric materials. Applied Physics Reviews 5: 041101 (2018).doi:10.1063/1.5044472&lt;/ref&gt; For example, iron-doped lithium niobate excited with visible light has been shown to produce cell death in tumoral cell cultures.&lt;ref name="Blázquez-Castro A 2011"&gt;Blázquez-Castro A, Stockert JC, López-Arias B, Juarranz A, Agulló-López F, García-Cabañes A, and Carrascosa M.

==Periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN)==
'''Periodically-poled lithium niobate''' ('''PPLN''') is a domain-engineered lithium niobate crystal, used mainly for achieving [[quasi-phase-matching]] in [[nonlinear optics]]. The [[ferroelectric]] domains point alternatively to the ''+c'' and the ''−c'' direction, with a period of typically between 5 and 35 [[micrometre|µm]]. The shorter periods of this range are used for [[second harmonic generation]], while the longer ones for [[Optical parametric oscillator|optical parametric oscillation]]. [[Periodic poling]] can be achieved by electrical poling with periodically structured electrode. Controlled heating of the crystal can be used to fine-tune [[phase matching]] in the medium due to a slight variation of the dispersion with temperature.

Periodic poling uses the largest value of lithium niobate's nonlinear tensor, d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; = 27 pm/V. Quasi-phase matching gives maximum efficiencies that are 2/π (64%) of the full d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;, about 17 pm/V.

Other materials used for [[periodic poling]] are wide [[band gap]] inorganic crystals like [[potassium titanyl phosphate|KTP]] (resulting in [[periodically poled KTP]], [[PPKTP]]), [[lithium tantalate]], and some organic materials.

The periodic poling technique can also be used to form surface [[nanostructure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Surface nanoscale periodic structures in congruent lithium niobate by domain reversal patterning and differential etching |author=S. Grilli |author2=P. Ferraro |author3=P. De Natale |author4=B. Tiribilli |author5=M. Vassalli  |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=87 |issue=23 |pages=233106 |year=2005 |doi=10.1063/1.2137877|bibcode=2005ApPhL..87w3106G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Modulating the thickness of the resist pattern for controlling size and depth of submicron reversed domains in lithium niobate
| author =P. Ferraro |author2=S. Grilli  |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=89 |issue=13 |pages=133111 |year=2006 |doi=10.1063/1.2357928| bibcode =2006ApPhL..89m3111F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to its low photorefractive damage threshold, PPLN only finds limited applications: at very low power levels. MgO-doped lithium niobate is fabricated by periodically-poled method. Periodically-poled MgO-doped lithium niobate (PPMgOLN) therefore expands the application to medium power level.

==Sellmeier equations==
The [[Sellmeier equation]]s for the extraordinary index are used to find the poling period and approximate temperature for quasi-phase matching. Jundt&lt;ref name=Jundt&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dieter H. Jundt| journal=Optics Letters|volume=22 |title=Temperature-dependent Sellmeier equation for the index of refraction &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; in congruent lithium niobate| year=1997|pages=1553–5 |doi=10.1364/OL.22.001553| pmid=18188296| issue=20| bibcode=1997OptL...22.1553J}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives

&lt;math&gt;{
  n^2_e \approx 5.35583 + 4.629 \times 10^{-7} f
                + {0.100473 + 3.862 \times 10^{-8} f \over \lambda^2 - (0.20692 - 0.89 \times 10^{-8} f)^2}
                + {100 + 2.657 \times 10^{-5} f \over \lambda^2 - 11.34927^2}
                - 1.5334 \times 10^{-2} \lambda^2
}&lt;/math&gt;

valid from 20 to 250&amp;nbsp;°C for wavelengths from 0.4 to 5 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s, whereas for longer wavelength,&lt;ref name=Deng&gt;{{cite journal|author=LH Deng|journal = Optics Communications|volume=268| title=Improvement to Sellmeier equation for periodically poled {{Lithium}}{{Niobium}}{{Oxygen|3}} crystal using mid-infrared difference-frequency generation|issue=1|year=2006| pages=110|doi=10.1016/j.optcom.2006.06.082|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2006OptCo.268..110D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{
  n^2_e \approx 5.39121 + 4.968 \times 10^{-7} f
                + {0.100473 + 3.862 \times 10^{-8} f \over \lambda^2 - (0.20692 - 0.89 \times 10^{-8} f)^2}
                + {100 + 2.657 \times 10^{-5} f \over \lambda^2 - 11.34927^2} - (1.544 \times 10^{-2} + 9.62119 \times 10^{-10} \lambda) \lambda^2
}&lt;/math&gt;

which is valid for ''T'' = 25 to 180&amp;nbsp;°C, for wavelengths λ between 2.8 and 4.8 micrometers.

In these equations ''f'' = (''T'' − 24.5)(''T'' + 570.82), λ is in micrometers, and ''T'' is in °C.

More generally for ordinary and extraordinary index for MgO-doped {{Lithium}}{{Niobium}}{{Oxygen|3}}:

&lt;math&gt;{
  n^2 \approx a_1 + b_1 f
              + {a_2 + b_2 f \over \lambda^2 - (a_3 + b_3 f)^2}
              + {a_4 + b_4 f \over \lambda^2 - a_5^2}
              - a_6 \lambda^2

'''Marthozite''' is an [[orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] [[mineral]] that has a general formula of Cu(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;  It was named after French mineralogist Aime Marthoz, former Director-general of the [[Union Miniere du Haut Katanga]].&lt;ref name=webmin /&gt;

It is usually found in cavities in selenian ([[selenium]]-containing) [[digenite]].&lt;ref name=webmin /&gt;  It is specifically found in the zones of oxidation of the [[Musonoi deposit]] in [[Katanga (province)|Katanga]], [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=Fleischer&gt;Fleischer, M. (1970) New mineral names. American Mineralogist, 55, 533.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marthozite is [[orthorhombic]], meaning that it has three axes of unequal lengths all [[orthogonal]] to each other. Since it is orthorhombic, marthozite is biaxial, meaning that it has three different [[Refractive index|indices of refraction]].&lt;ref name=Fleischer/&gt;  Marthozite is [[anisotropic]], which means that it breaks light into one fast ray and one slow ray.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/minerals/marthozite/u7/vh/op/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  Accessed 16 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Marthozite shows pleochroism from yellowish brown to greenish yellow.&lt;ref name=webmin /&gt;

==Career==

===Electrochemistry (1950s – 1983)===
Fleischmann's professional career was focused almost entirely on fundamental electrochemistry. Fleischmann went on to teach at [[Durham University|King's College, Durham University]],&lt;ref name="natureobit"/&gt; which in 1963 became the newly established [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]].&lt;ref name=KingsCollege&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/library/asc/collection_information/cldload/?collno=547 King's College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318215545/http://www.dur.ac.uk/library/asc/collection_information/cldload/?collno=547 |date=18 March 2011 }}, Official Records of Durham University.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Fleischmann became Professor of Electrochemistry at the [[University of Southampton]],&lt;ref name="platt"&gt;{{cite news | title = What If Cold Fusion Is Real?|author = [[Charles Platt (science-fiction author)|Charles Platt]] | date = November 1998|work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.11/coldfusion.html?pg=2&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; occupying the Faraday Chair of Chemistry.&lt;ref name="natureobit"/&gt; From 1970 to 1972, he was president of the International Society of Electrochemists.&lt;ref name="broad"&gt;{{cite news | title = Brilliance and Recklessness Seen in Fusion Collaboration | author = William J.

'''Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications.''' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2nd Edition, '''2000'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he was awarded the medal for electrochemistry and [[thermodynamics]] by the [[Royal Society]] of London. In 1982 he retired from the University of Southampton. In 1985 he received the [[Olin Palladium Award]] from the [[Electrochemical Society]], and in 1986 was elected to the [[Royal Society#Fellows|Fellowship of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fellows of the Royal Society |publisher = The Royal Society | date = August 2008 | url=http://royalsociety.orgdownloaddoc.asp?id=5150 | format = pdf | accessdate = 2009-02-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from teaching in 1983 and was given an honorary professorship at Southampton University.&lt;ref name="broad"/&gt;

===Cold fusion (1983-1992)===
Fleischmann confided to [[Stanley Pons]] that he might have found what he believed to be a way to create nuclear fusion at room temperatures.&lt;ref name="platt"/&gt; From 1983 to 1989, he and Pons spent $100,000 in self-funded experiments at the [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref name="natureobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="platt"/&gt; Fleischmann wanted to publish it first in an obscure journal, and had already spoken with a team that was doing similar work in a different university for a joint publication.&lt;ref name="shamoo 86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simon 28"/&gt; The details have not surfaced, but it would seem that the University of Utah wanted to establish priority over the discovery and its patents by making a public announcement before the publication.&lt;ref name="shamoo 86"&gt;Shamoo, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RLZin-f9eooC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;vq=announcement 86]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simon 28"&gt;Simon, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dEJJqgw8pvwC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;vq=announcement 28-36]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on 19 April 2009, Fleischmann said that the public announcement was the university's idea, and that he regretted doing it.&lt;ref&gt;Cold Fusion is Hot Again, CBS News http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/04/17/60minutes/main4952167_page4.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; This decision would later cause heavy criticism against Fleischmann and Pons, being perceived as a breach of how science is usually communicated to other scientists.&lt;ref name="simon 28"/&gt;

On 23 March 1989 it was finally announced at a press conference as "a sustained nuclear fusion reaction,"&lt;ref&gt;Press release, published in Huizenga, ''Cold fusion,'' Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; which was quickly labeled by the press as [[cold fusion]]&lt;ref&gt;Simon, 2002, p. 39. Simon says that the first article naming Fleischmann's work as "cold fusion" was: Jerry Bishop, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', "Research in Utah to announce a development in fusion energy", 23 March 1989, or "Scientist sticks to claimed test-tube fusion advance", 27 March.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fleischmann |first=Martin|last2=Pons |first2=Stanley |authorlink2=Stanley Pons |last3=Hawkins |first3=M.|title=Electrochemically induced nuclear fusion of deuterium|journal=[[Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry]]|volume=261|issue=2A|pages=301–308|year=1989|doi=10.1016/0022-0728(89)80006-3 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}, and errata in Vol. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; – a result previously thought to be unattainable. On 26 March Fleischmann warned on the ''[[Wall Street Journal Report]]'' not to try replications until a published paper was available two weeks later in ''[[Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry]]'', but that did not stop hundreds of scientists who had already started work at their laboratories the moment they heard the news on 23 March,&lt;ref name="simon 35"&gt;Simon, 2002, page [https://books.google.com/books?id=dEJJqgw8pvwC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;vq=23+march 35]&lt;/ref&gt; and more often than not they failed to reproduce the effects.&lt;ref name="shamoo 76" /&gt; Those who failed to reproduce the claim attacked the pair for fraudulent,&lt;ref name="shamoo 76" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Science, Reason, and Rhetoric |author1=Henry Krips |author2=J.

In 2009, [[Michael McKubre]] concluded from his attempt to duplicate the "Fleischmann-Pons Effect", that there is "heat production consistent with nuclear but not chemical energy or known lattice storage effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=15th Annual Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science |chapter=COLD FUSION, LENR, the Fleischmann-Pons Effect; ONE PERSPECTIVE on the STATE of the SCIENCE |editor1=Vittorio Violante |editor2=Francesca Sarto |author=McKubre, M.C.H. |year=2009 |isbn=978-88-8286-256-5 |publisher=Rome, Italy: ENEA }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an extension of the work done by Miles at the Navy Laboratory (NAWCWD) at China Lake, California (1990-1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tenth International Conference on Cold Fusion |year=2003 |author=Miles, M. |chapter=Correlation Of Excess Enthalpy And Helium-4 Production: A Review. |editors=Peter L Hagelstein (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA) &amp; Scott R Chubb (Naval Research Laboratory, USA) |publisher=Hackensack, New Jersey: World Scientific Publishing |isbn= 978-981-256-564-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement (1992 – 2012)===
In 1992, Fleischmann moved to France with Pons to continue their work at the IMRA laboratory (part of Technova Corporation, a subsidiary of [[Toyota]]), but in 1995 he retired and returned to England.&lt;ref name="simon 137"&gt;Simon, 2002, p.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4782">In [[physics]], the '''Maxwell–Jüttner distribution''' is the distribution of speeds of particles in a hypothetical gas of relativistic particles. Similar to [[Maxwell's distribution]], the Maxwell–Jüttner distribution considers a classical ideal gas where the particles are dilute and do not significantly interact with each other. The distinction from Maxwell's case is that effects of [[special relativity]] are taken into account. In the limit of low temperatures ''T'' much less than ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''k'' (where ''m'' is the mass of the kind of particle making up the gas, ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]), this distribution becomes identical to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.

The distribution can be attributed to [[Ferencz Jüttner]], who derived it in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jüttner | first1 = F. | title = Das Maxwellsche Gesetz der Geschwindigkeitsverteilung in der Relativtheorie | doi = 10.1002/andp.19113390503 | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 339 | issue = 5 | pages = 856–882 | year = 1911 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1911AnP...339..856J }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become known as the Maxwell–Jüttner distribution by analogy to the name Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution that is commonly used to refer to Maxwell's distribution.

==The distribution function ==

Speed is represented in terms of the [[Lorentz factor]].]]

As the gas becomes hotter and ''kT'' approaches or exceeds ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the probability distribution for &lt;math&gt;\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; in this relativistic Maxwellian gas is given by the Maxwell–Jüttner distribution:&lt;ref name="Synge"&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac {v}{c}=\sqrt{1-1/\gamma^2},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{kT}{mc^2},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt; is the modified [[Bessel function]] of the second kind.

Alternatively, this can be written in terms of the momentum as

:&lt;math&gt; f(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi m^3 c^3 \theta K_2(1/\theta)} \exp\left( -\frac{\gamma(p)}{\theta}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma(p) = \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{p}{mc}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The Maxwell–Jüttner equation is covariant, but not [[Manifest covariance|manifestly]] so, and the temperature of the gas does not vary with the gross speed of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Limitations==

Some limitations of the Maxwell–Jüttner distributions are shared with the classical ideal gas: neglect of interactions, and neglect of quantum effects. An additional limitation (not important in the classical ideal gas) is that the Maxwell–Jüttner distribution neglects antiparticles.

If particle-antiparticle creation is allowed, then once the thermal energy ''kT'' is a significant fraction of ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, particle-antiparticle creation will occur and begin to increase the number of particles while generating antiparticles (the number of particles is not conserved, but instead the conserved quantity is the difference between particle number and antiparticle number). The resulting thermal distribution will depend on the [[chemical potential]] relating to the conserved particle-antiparticle number difference. A further consequence of this is that it becomes necessary to incorporate statistical mechanics for indistinguishable particles, because the occupation probabilities for low kinetic energy states becomes of order unity. For [[fermion]]s it is necessary to use [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and the result is analogous to the thermal generation of electron-[[electron hole|hole]] pairs in [[semiconductors]]. For [[boson]]ic particles, it is necessary to use the [[Bose–Einstein statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;See first few paragraphs in [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9604039v1] for extended discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biomechanics]], the '''Moens–Korteweg equation''' models the relationship between wave speed or [[pulse wave velocity]] (PWV) and the incremental [[elastic modulus]] of the arterial wall or its [[distensibility]]. The equation was derived independently by [[Adriaan Isebree Moens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |publisher=S.C. Van Doesburgh |location=Leiden, The Netherlands |last=Moens |first=Adr.

The Moens–Korteweg equation states that PWV is proportional to the square root of the incremental elastic modulus, (''E''&lt;sub&gt;inc&lt;/sub&gt;), of the vessel wall given constant ratio of wall thickness, ''h'', to vessel radius, ''r'', and blood density, ρ, assuming that the artery wall is [[isotropic]] and experiences isovolumetric change with pulse pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gosling| first1=R.G. |last2=Budge |first2=M.M. |title=Terminology for Describing the Elastic Behavior of Arteries |journal=Hypertension |year=2003 |volume=41 |pages=1180–1182 |doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000072271.36866.2A |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Multiple Use - Sustained Yield Act of 1960''' (or '''MUSYA''') ([[Act of Congress|Public Law]] 86-517) is a [[United States federal law|federal]] law passed by the [[United States Congress]] on June 12, 1960. This law authorizes and directs the [[Secretary of Agriculture]] to develop and administer the renewable resources of timber, range, water, recreation and wildlife on the national forests for multiple use and sustained yield of the products and services.

This is the first law to have the five major uses of national forests contained in one law equally, with no use greater than any other.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, Anthony ''The Ever-Changing View-A History of the National Forests in California'' USDA Forest Service Publishers, 2005 p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, the national forests no longer held enough resources to meet the  growing needs of an increasing population and expanding economy. The [[U.S. Forest Service]] had operated within broad authorities since [[Gifford Pinchot]]'s time as Chief Forester. Now, for the first time the agency had a specific congressional directive which stipulated that timber sales were not in all cases to be the limiting factor.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, Harold K. ''The United States Forest Service, A History'' University of Washington Press 1976 pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

MUSYA defines the terms "multiple use" and "sustained yield" as follows:

* ''Multiple use'' - the "management of all the various renewable surface resources of the national forests so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the needs of the American people ...."&lt;ref&gt;Multiple-Use and Sustained Yield Act of 1960, Public Law 86-517, 86th Congress (June 12, 1960), § 4(a)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Sustained yield'' - "the achievement and maintenance in perpetuity of a high-level annual or regular periodic output of the various renewable resources of the national forests without impairment of the productivity of the land."&lt;ref&gt;Multiple-Use and Sustained Yield Act of 1960, Public Law 86-517, 86th Congress (June 12, 1960), § 4(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960 law was amended by the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ333/pdf/PLAW-104publ333.pdf |title=Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 ~ P.L. 104-333 |date=November 12, 1996 |series=110 Stat. 4093 ~ House Bill 4236 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=52239 |title=William J.

[[Image:Onionskin paper.jpg|thumb|right|Typewritten page of canary onionskin, 1912. Note the translucency in the upper right corner, where the red library stamp on the obverse is visible.]]

'''Onionskin''' or '''onion skin''' is a thin, light-weight, strong, often [[translucent]] [[paper]].  Though not made from [[onion]]s, it superficially resembles their thin, papery skins. It was usually used with [[carbon paper]] for typing duplicates in a [[typewriter]], for permanent records where low bulk was important, or for [[airmail]] correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt2375.html|title = Bookbinding and the Conservation of Books: A Dictionary of Descriptive Terminology|date = 2011-11-19|accessdate = 2014-10-16|website = CoOL: Conservation OnLine|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6TNR92eJf|archivedate = 2014-10-16|deadurl = no|publisher = Etherington &amp; Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typically 25–39&amp;nbsp;[[Grammage|g/m²]] (9-pound basis weight in US units), and may be white or canary-colored. 

In the typewriter era, onion skin often had a deeply textured [[cockle finish]] which allowed for easier erasure of typing mistakes, but other glazed and unglazed finishes were also available then and may be more common today.

Onionskin paper is relatively durable and lightweight due to its high content of cotton fibers. Because of these attributes and its crispness when folding, onionskin paper is one of the best papers to use for toy [[kite]]s and advanced [[paper airplane]]s. Paper airplanes made from onionskin paper tend to fly very well due to their low weight and high integrity once folded.

Onionskin paper has also been regularly used in traditional cel [[animation]]. Due to its translucency, it is used as a guide in drawing the frames between key-frames. This is a process that animators refer to as [[Inbetweening|"in-betweening"]]. The process of "onionskinning" is also used in digital animation where frames are represented by digital layers in a production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8310">{{POV|date=January 2013}} 
'''The Open Fuel Standard Coalition''' is a [[bipartisan]] group in the United States actively working for passage of H.R. 1687, the "[[Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011]]." The OFS Coalition views this legislation as the solution to the current [[energy crisis]] by the implementing of [[alternative energy sources]] into our fuel transportation market sector, thereby breaking our dependence on [[foreign oil]]. Specifically, by implementing H.R. 1687, the [[Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011]] all vehicles sold in the US will have to either operate on mixed fuels, containing [[E85|85 percent ethanol]], [[methanol]], [[biodiesel]], or any other alternative energy source. 

The need for an open fuel standard could not be any clearer as we have seen the rising price of oil in recent years. The continuing unrest and violence in the [[Middle East]] has caused dramatic increases in [[crude oil]] that remains strongly controlled by [[OPEC]]. Our current [[gasoline consumption]] from foreign oil is [[unsustainable]] for the future. Additionally, our oil addiction is contributing to the financial support of our enemies abroad and unquestionably aiding terrorist organizations. The promise of freeing our dependence on foreign oil has long been stated, but we can no longer kick the can further down the road. Now, both Republicans and Democrats must work together to implement a sensible bipartisan solution to reinvent and revitalize our [[Energy policy of the United States|energy policies]]. By the end of the 112th session, we hope to quickly move this legislative through congress and enforce the open fuel standard as a policy priority.

==Purpose==
The open fuel standard will create incentive to promote and invest in the emerging market of [[ethanol]], [[Methanol fuel|methanol]], [[biodiesel]], and any other alternative fuel. Vehicles with these alternative fuel engines will re-energize our economy and create new jobs here in the U.S. Comparatively, mixed fuels produce less [[carbon emissions]] as well as beating the price of oil three to one. The technology and resources are already available for flex-fuel cars, but the availability and access to pumps is scarce. By manufacturing [[flex-fuel|flex-fuel cars]], gas stations can create new revenue by adding mixed fuel pumps that offer low cost alternative to gasoline. However, the first step is allowing a demand by opening up the market to producing more [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex fuel]] and alternative fueled cars.
Our foreign competitors, including [[China]] and [[Brazil]] have already successfully implemented similar regulations on auto industries selling cars in their countries resulting in tremendous success and new manufacturing plants in both China and Brazil. The U.S. cannot stay competitive as we fall behind in the investments of alternative energy and auto industries take their business abroad.

==Goal==
The goal of the OFS coalition is to pass H.R. 1687, the "[[Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011]]" in the [[112th United States Congress]] and generate pressures on the administration and federal departments to take further action.  The OFS Coalition is assisting in providing information about the open fuel standard in an effort to educate Members of the [[United States Congress]], while successfully engaging with various groups to promote the tactical purposes of the open fuel standard and draw attention and support of key Members of Congress.

[http://www.openfuelstandard.org/ A web site] has been created by the Open Fuel Standard Coalition to help keep interested parties informed about the [[Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011|Open Fuel Standard Act]]. The purpose of [http://www.openfuelstandard.org/ OpenFuelStandard.org] is to provide information to citizens who want to help the [[Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011|Open Fuel Standard Act]] become law. 
::1. Practical actions you can take that will help pass the Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011.

==Reasons for the Open Fuel Standard==
:1. '''Save money.''' It will bring down gas prices at the pump. The main reason gas is so expensive is that [[OPEC]] deliberately lowers its production to raise the price of [[oil]], and we have no real fuel choice at the pump. It is all made of oil. So when OPEC reduces its production and makes oil more expensive, we have no other choice — we must pay it. OPEC knows this, and takes advantage of its leverage. Fuel choice at the pump will be the end of a long-running monopoly.&lt;ref name=OPEC&gt;{{cite web|last=Zubrin|first=Robert|title=Achieving Energy Victory|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/achieving-energy-victory|publisher=The New Atlantis|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2. '''Healthier.''' The fumes from burning alcohol and other alternatives are less [[toxic]] than the fumes from burning gasoline — considerably less toxic to humans and other living things.

:3. '''Better economy.''' It will generate jobs in the United States. Americans will be building fuel-processing plants, fuel stations, growing the [[raw materials]] to make methanol from [[biomass]], growing crops to make ethanol, inventing new kinds of other alternative fuels, and coming up with new ways to make fuel from [[waste products]]. American ingenuity will have a field day.

:4. '''Safer'''. Alcohol is less [[flammable]] than gasoline, and therefore less dangerous (less likely to explode). Alcohol burns cooler than gasoline, too, which also makes it less dangerous.

:5. '''Cooler'''. Alcohol fuels will put less [[carbon]] into the air. To drill for oil, you're taking carbon out from underneath the surface of the earth and burning it, adding carbon to the air that wasn't already there. But to make ethanol and methanol, you use plant material. So the plant pulls carbon out of the air, and then when it is burned as fuel, it returns the same carbon back into the air.

:6. '''Expensive'''. Manufacturing a car with flex-fuel capability adds to the price of a car. It comprises many relatively small tweaks, usually adding around one hundred dollars to the cost (not the price) of a new car.  Typically, it requires all metal components within the fuel system to be changed to stainless steel and all hoses and o-rings require the substitution of specialist ethanol and methanol-resistant fluoroelastomers&lt;ref name=Expensive&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=James|url=http://www.jameswalker.biz/system/pdf_docs/fichiers/3/original_2011_update.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:7. '''Cheaper'''. It doesn't cost the federal government any money.

:8. '''Environmentally friendly'''. An "alcohol spill" would not be a disaster like an oil spill. Alcohol dissolves in water and is readily consumed by bacteria. Within a few days of an Exxon-sized ethanol or methanol spill, the ocean would be back to normal.

:9. '''Security'''. The fuel competition at the pump will reduce the amount of money going to regimes hostile to America (and hostile to their own populations). These regimes are dangerous for the world, and their enormous revenues give them power and influence around the world. Democracies would be better off if those regimes didn't have their inexhaustible wealth to wield.&lt;ref name=Security&gt;{{cite journal|last=Korin|first=Anne|author2=Gal Luft|title=Energy Independaence Myths and Solutions|date=2011-07-07|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/56347979/Energy-Independence-Myths-and-Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:10. '''Freedom'''. The bill requires 95 percent of cars to be capable of burning any alternative fuel by 2017, leaving the choice up to the automaker. Because the Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011 does not pick a winner, every alternative fuel can compete against gasoline, thereby allowing consumer choice. Cars could be [[electric]], [[hydrogen]], [[natural gas]], bio-diesel, or any other non-gasoline alternative and qualify under the Act. This is the only '''technology-neutral bill''', meaning that it doesn't favor any particular option and allows the market to decide which innovative solution will win out.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11595">A '''Peierls transition''' or '''Peierls distortion''' is a distortion of the periodic lattice of a one-dimensional crystal.  Atomic positions oscillate, so that the perfect order of the 1-D crystal is broken.

== Peierls’ theorem ==

Peierls' theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Fowler | first=Michael | title=Electrons in One Dimension: the Peierls Transition | date=28 Feb 2007 | url=http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/752.mf1i.spring03/PeierlsTrans.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that ''a one-dimensional equally spaced chain with one electron per ion is unstable''. 
[[File:Peierls instability before.jpg|thumb|The lowest Bloch band of an undistorted 1D lattice.]]
[[File:Peierls instability after.jpg|thumb|The lowest Bloch bands of a distorted 1D lattice. Energy gaps appear in &lt;math&gt;ka=\pm \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; as a result of the Peierls' instability.]]
It was asserted in the 1930s by [[Rudolf Peierls]]. It can be proven using a simple model of the potential for an electron in a 1-D crystal with lattice spacing &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  The periodicity of the crystal creates energy [[band gap]]s in the [[Electronic band structure#Crystalline symmetry and wavevectors|&lt;math&gt;\epsilon-k&lt;/math&gt; diagram]] at the edge of the Brillouin zone &lt;math&gt;ka=\pm\pi&lt;/math&gt; (similar to the result of the [[Particle in a one-dimensional lattice (periodic potential)#Kronig–Penney model|Kronig–Penney model]], which helps to explain the origin of band gaps in semiconductors). If the ions each contribute one electron, then the band will be half-filled, up to values of &lt;math&gt;ka=\pm \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; in the ground state.
[[File:Peierl'sDistortion1-D.png|thumb|center|244px|Peierl's distortion of a 1-d periodic lattice.]]
Imagine a lattice distortion where every other ion moves closer to one neighbor and further away from the other, the unfavourable energy of the long bond between ions is outweighed by the energy gain of the short bond.  The period has just doubled from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt;.  In essence, the proof relies on the fact that doubling the period would introduce new band gaps located at multiples of &lt;math&gt;ka=\pm \pi/2&lt;/math&gt;; see the figure in the right.  This would cause small energy savings, based on the distortion of the bands in the vicinity of the new gaps.  Approaching &lt;math&gt;ka=\pm \pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, the distortion due to the introduction of the new band gap will cause the electrons to be at a lower energy than they would be in the perfect crystal.  Therefore, this lattice distortion becomes energetically favorable when the energy savings due to the new band gaps outweighs the elastic energy cost of rearranging the ions.  Of course, this effect will be noticeable only when the electrons are arranged close to their ground state – in other words, thermal excitation should be minimized.  Therefore, the Peierls transition should be seen at low temperature.  This is the basic argument for the occurrence of the Peierls transition, sometimes called dimerization.

== Historical background ==

Peierls’ discovery gained experimental backing during the effort to find new superconducting materials.  In 1964, Dr. William Little of the [[Stanford University]] Department of Physics theorized that a certain class of polymer chains may experience a high ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconducting transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = W. A. Little | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 134 | year = 1964 | pages = A1416–A1424 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.134.A1416 | title = Possibility of Synthesizing an Organic Superconductor | issue = 6A|bibcode = 1964PhRv..134.1416L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basis for his assertion was that the lattice distortions that lead to pairing of electrons in the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconductivity]] could be replaced instead by rearranging the electron density in a series of side chains.  This means that now electrons would be responsible for creating the [[Cooper pair]]s instead of ions.  Because the transition temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the charged particle responsible for the distortions, the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; should be improved by a corresponding factor:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{T}{T_i} = \sqrt{\frac{M_i}{m_e}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The subscript ''i'' represents "ion", while ''e'' represents "electron".  The predicted benefit in superconducting transition temperature was therefore a factor of about 300.

In the 1970s, various organic materials such as [[Charge-transfer complex#Electrical conductivity|TTF-TCNQ]] were synthesized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P. W. Anderson |author2=P. A. Lee |author3=M. Saitoh | journal = [[Solid State Communications]] | volume = 13 | year = 1973 | pages = 595–598 | doi = 10.1016/S0038-1098(73)80020-1 | title = Remarks on giant conductivity in TTF-TCNQ | bibcode=1973SSCom..13..595A | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What was found is that these materials underwent an insulating transition rather than a superconducting one.  Eventually it was realized that these were the first experimental observations of the Peierls transition.  With the introduction of new band gaps after the lattice becomes distorted, electrons must overcome this new energy barrier in order to become free to conduct.  The simple model of the Peierls distortion as a rearrangement of ions in a 1-D chain could describe why these materials became insulators rather than superconductors.

== Related physical consequences ==

Peierls predicted that the rearrangement of the ion cores in a Peierls transition would produce periodic fluctuations in the electron density.  These are commonly called [[charge density wave]]s, and they are an example of collective charge transport.  Several materials systems have verified the existence of these waves.  Good candidates are weakly coupled molecular chains, where electrons can move freely along the direction of the chains, but motion is restricted perpendicular to the chains.  NbSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are two examples in which charge density waves have been observed at relatively high temperatures of 145 K and 180 K respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Thorne | first=Robert | title=Charge-Density-Wave Conductors | magazine=[[Physics Today]] | date = May 1996 | url=http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~rthorne/thorne_phystod_1996.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the 1-D nature of the material causes a breakdown of the [[Fermi liquid]] theory for electron behavior.  Therefore, a 1-D conductor should behave as a [[Luttinger liquid]] instead.  A Luttinger liquid is a [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] one-dimensional metal without Landau [[quasi-particle]] excitations.

== Research topics ==

1-D metals have been the subject of much research.  Here are a few examples of both theoretical and experimental research efforts to illustrate the broad range of topics:

* Theory has shown that polymer chains that have been looped and formed into rings undergo a Peierls transition.  These rings demonstrate a persistent current, and the Peierls distortion can be modified by modulating the magnetic flux through the loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S. D. Liang |author2=Y. H. Bai |author3=B. Beng | journal = [[Physical Review B]] | volume = 74 | year = 2006 | pages = 113304 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.74.113304 | title = Peierls instability and persistent current in mesoscopic conducting polymer rings | issue = 11 |bibcode = 2006PhRvB..74k3304L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Density functional theory]] has been used to calculate the bond length alterations predicted in increasingly long chains of organic oligomers.  The selection of which hybrid functional to use is paramount in obtaining an accurate estimate of the bond length alteration caused by Peierls distortions, as some functionals have been shown to overestimate the oscillation, while others underestimate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D. Jacquemin |author2=A. Femenias |author3=H. Chermette |author4=I. Ciofini |author5=C. Adamo |author6=J. M. Andr |author7=E. A.

* Gold deposited on a stepped Si(553) surface has shown evidence of two simultaneous Peierls transitions.  The lattice period is distorted by factors of 2 and 3, and energy gaps open for nearly 1/2-filled and 1/3–1/4 filled bands.  The distortions have been studied and imaged using [[Low-energy electron diffraction|LEED]] and [[Scanning tunneling microscope|STM]], while the energy bands were studied with [[ARPES|ARP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.

* [[Luttinger liquid]]s have a power-law dependence of resistance on temperature.  This has been shown for [[Lithium molybdenum purple bronze|purple bronze]] (Li&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = C.

* The dependence of resonant tunneling through island barriers in a 1-D wire has been studied, and is also found to be a power-law dependence.

When released, the restoring force acting on the pendulum's mass causes it to [[oscillate]] about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth. The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the [[Frequency|period]]. The period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on the [[amplitude]], the width of the pendulum's swing.

From the first scientific investigations of the pendulum around 1602 by [[Galileo Galilei]], the regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping, and was the world's most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Marrison"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pendulum clock]] invented by [[Christian Huygens]] in 1658 became the world's standard timekeeper, used in homes and offices for 270 years, and achieved accuracy of about one second per year before it was superseded as a time standard by the [[quartz clock]] in the 1930s.  Pendulums are also used in [[scientific instrument]]s such as [[accelerometer]]s and [[seismometer]]s. Historically they were used as [[gravimeter]]s to measure the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]] in geophysical surveys, and even as a standard of length. The word "pendulum" is [[new Latin]], from the Latin ''pendulus'', meaning 'hanging'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

When given an initial push, it will swing back and forth at a constant [[amplitude]]. Real pendulums are subject to friction and [[air drag]], so the amplitude of their swings declines.

{{Main|Pendulum (mathematics)}}

The period of swing of a [[Pendulum (mathematics)#Simple gravity pendulum|simple gravity pendulum]] depends on its [[length]], the local [[Gravitational acceleration|strength of gravity]], and to a small extent on the maximum [[angle]] that the pendulum swings away from vertical, ''θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', called the [[amplitude]].&lt;ref name="Milham1945"&gt;{{cite book

If the amplitude is limited to small swings,&lt;ref group = Note&gt;A "small" swing is one in which the angle θ is small enough that sin(θ) can be approximated by θ when θ is measured in radians&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Frequency|period]] ''T'' of a simple pendulum, the time taken for a complete cycle, is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the local [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration of gravity]].

For small swings the period of swing is approximately the same for different size swings: that is, ''the period is independent of amplitude''. This property, called [[isochronism]], is the reason pendulums are so useful for timekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For larger [[amplitude]]s, the period increases gradually with amplitude so it is longer than given by equation (1). For example, at an amplitude of ''θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 23°  it is 1% larger than given by (1). The period increases asymptotically (to infinity) as  ''θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' approaches 180°, because the value ''θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 180° is an [[Mechanical equilibrium|unstable equilibrium point]] for the pendulum. The true period of an ideal simple gravity pendulum can be written in several different forms (see [[Pendulum (mathematics)]] ), one example being the [[infinite series]]:&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;
T = 2\pi \sqrt{L\over g} \left( 1+ \frac{1}{16}\theta_0^2 + \frac{11}{3072}\theta_0^4 + \cdots \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt; is in radians.

The difference between this true period and the period for small swings (1) above is called the ''circular error''. In the case of a typical [[grandfather clock]] whose pendulum has a swing of 6° and thus an amplitude of 3° (0.05&amp;nbsp;radians), the difference between the true period and the small angle approximation (1) amounts to about 15 seconds per day.

For small swings the pendulum approximates a [[harmonic oscillator]], and its motion as a function of time, ''t'', is approximately [[simple harmonic motion]]:&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\theta (t) = \theta_0 \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{T}\, t +\varphi \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a constant value, dependent on [[initial conditions]].

For real pendulums, the period varies slightly with factors such as the buoyancy and viscous resistance of the air, the mass of the string or rod, the size and shape of the bob and how it is attached to the string, and flexibility and stretching of the string.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deschaine | first1 = J.

(1) to give the period accurately.

== Compound pendulum ==
Any swinging [[rigid body]] free to rotate about a fixed horizontal axis is called a '''compound pendulum''' or '''physical pendulum'''. The appropriate equivalent length &lt;math&gt;L\;&lt;/math&gt; for calculating the period of any such pendulum is the distance
from the pivot to the ''[[center of percussion|center of oscillation]]''.&lt;ref name="HuygensCompound"&gt;{{cite web

pivot traditionally called the radius of oscillation, which depends on the mass distribution of the pendulum. If most of the mass is concentrated in a relatively small bob compared to the pendulum length, the center of oscillation is close to the center of mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The radius of oscillation or equivalent length &lt;math&gt;L\;&lt;/math&gt; of any physical pendulum can be shown to be
:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{I}{mR}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;I\;&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the pendulum about the pivot point,
&lt;math&gt;m\;&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum, and &lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the pivot point and the [[center of mass]].
Substituting this expression in (1) above, the period &lt;math&gt;T\;&lt;/math&gt; of a compound pendulum is given by
:&lt;math&gt;T = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{I}{mgR}&lt;/math&gt;
for sufficiently small oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For example, a rigid uniform rod of length &lt;math&gt;L\;&lt;/math&gt; pivoted about one end has moment of inertia  &lt;math&gt;I = mL^2/3\;&lt;/math&gt;.
The center of mass is located at the center of the rod, so &lt;math&gt;R = L/2\;&lt;/math&gt; Substituting these values into the above equation gives  &lt;math&gt;T = 2\pi\sqrt{2L/3g}\;&lt;/math&gt;. This shows that a rigid rod pendulum has the same period as a simple pendulum of 2/3 its length.

[[Christiaan Huygens]] proved in 1673 that the pivot point and the center of oscillation are interchangeable.&lt;ref name="HuygensReciprocity"&gt;[http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/huygenscontents.html Huygens (1673) Horologium Oscillatorium], Part 4, Proposition 20&lt;/ref&gt;  This means if any pendulum is turned upside down and swung from a pivot located at its previous center of oscillation, it will have the same period as before and the new center of oscillation will be at the old pivot point. In 1817 [[Henry Kater]] used this idea to produce a type of reversible pendulum, now known as a [[Kater pendulum]], for improved measurements of the acceleration due to gravity.

=== 1721: Temperature compensated pendulums ===
[[File:Foucault pendulum animated.gif|thumb|right|The [[Foucault pendulum]] in 1851 was the first demonstration of the Earth's rotation that did not involve celestial observations, and it created a "pendulum mania". In this animation the rate of precession is greatly exaggerated.]]

During the 18th and 19th century, the [[pendulum clock]]'s role as the most accurate timekeeper motivated much practical research into improving pendulums. It was found that a major source of error was that the pendulum rod expanded and contracted with changes in ambient temperature, changing the period of swing.&lt;ref name="Milham1945" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beckett1874"&gt;{{cite book

The accuracy of gravity measurements made with pendulums was limited by the difficulty of finding the location of their [[Center of percussion|center of oscillation]]. Huygens had discovered in 1673 that a pendulum has the same period when hung from its center of oscillation as when hung from its pivot,&lt;ref name="HuygensReciprocity" /&gt; and the distance between the two points was equal to the length of a simple gravity pendulum of the same period.&lt;ref name="HuygensCompound" /&gt;  In 1818 British Captain [[Henry Kater]] invented the reversible [[Kater's pendulum]]&lt;ref name="Kater1818"&gt;{{cite journal

=== 1851: Foucault pendulum ===
{{Main|Foucault pendulum}}
In 1851, [[Jean Bernard Léon Foucault]] showed that the plane of oscillation of a pendulum, like a [[gyroscope]], tends to stay constant regardless of the motion of the pivot, and that this could be used to demonstrate the  [[rotation of the Earth]]. He suspended a pendulum free to swing in two dimensions (later named the [[Foucault pendulum]]) from the dome of the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in Paris. The length of the cord was {{convert|67|m|abbr =on}}. Once the pendulum was set in motion, the plane of swing was observed to [[precess]] or rotate 360° clockwise in about 32 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For 300 years, from its discovery around 1582 until development of the [[quartz clock]] in the 1930s, the pendulum was the world's standard for accurate timekeeping.&lt;ref name="Marrison" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p.334&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to clock pendulums, freeswinging [[seconds pendulum]]s were widely used as precision timers in scientific experiments in the 17th and 18th centuries. Pendulums require great mechanical stability: a length change of only 0.02%, 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm in a grandfather clock pendulum, will cause an error of a minute per week.&lt;ref&gt;calculated from equation (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

In quality clocks the bob is made as heavy as the suspension can support and the movement can drive, since this improves the regulation of the clock (see [[#Accuracy of pendulums as timekeepers|Accuracy]] below). A common weight for [[seconds pendulum]] bobs is {{convert|15|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_78S_w3EBmAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=matthys+%22common+bob+size Mattheys, 2004, p. 13]&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of hanging from a [[wikt:pivot|pivot]], clock pendulums are usually supported by a short straight [[spring (device)|spring]] ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(d)&lt;/span&gt;'' of flexible metal ribbon. This avoids the friction and 'play' caused by a pivot, and the slight bending force of the spring merely adds to the pendulum's [[restoring force]]. A few precision clocks have pivots of 'knife' blades resting on agate plates. The impulses to keep the pendulum swinging are provided by an arm hanging behind the pendulum called the ''crutch'', ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(e)&lt;/span&gt;'', which ends in a ''fork'', ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(f)&lt;/span&gt;'' whose prongs embrace the pendulum rod. The crutch is pushed back and forth by the clock's [[escapement]], ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(g,h)&lt;/span&gt;''.

Each time the pendulum swings through its centre position, it releases one tooth of the ''escape wheel'' ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(g)&lt;/span&gt;''. The force of the clock's [[mainspring]] or a driving weight hanging from a pulley, transmitted through the clock's [[Wheel train (horology)|gear train]], causes the wheel to turn, and a tooth presses against one of the pallets ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(h)&lt;/span&gt;'', giving the pendulum a short push. The clock's wheels, geared to the escape wheel, move forward a fixed amount with each pendulum swing, advancing the clock's hands at a steady rate.

The pendulum always has a means of adjusting the period, usually by an adjustment nut ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(c)&lt;/span&gt;'' under the bob which moves it up or down on the rod.&lt;ref name="Milham1945" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA91 Matthys 2004], p.91-92&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving the bob up decreases the pendulum's length, causing the pendulum to swing faster and the clock to gain time. Some precision clocks have a small auxiliary adjustment weight on a threaded shaft on the bob, to allow finer adjustment. Some [[Turret clock|tower clocks]] and precision clocks use a tray attached near to the midpoint of the pendulum rod, to which small weights can be added or removed. This effectively shifts the centre of oscillation and allows the rate to be adjusted without stopping the clock.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OvQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA48 Beckett 1874], p.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The pendulum must be suspended from a rigid support.&lt;ref name="Milham1945" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OvQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA43 Beckett 1874], p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  During operation, any elasticity will allow tiny imperceptible swaying motions of the support, which disturbs the clock's period, resulting in error. Pendulum clocks should be attached firmly to a sturdy wall.

The most common pendulum length in quality clocks, which is always used in [[grandfather clock]]s, is the [[seconds pendulum]], about {{convert|1|m|in|abbr=off}} long.   In [[mantel clock]]s, half-second pendulums, {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, or shorter, are used.

=== Temperature compensation ===
[[File:Howard astronomical regulator clock.png|thumb|130px|Mercury pendulum in Howard astronomical regulator clock, 1887]]
The largest source of error in early pendulums was slight changes in length due to thermal expansion and contraction of the pendulum rod with changes in ambient temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys 2004], p.3&lt;/ref&gt;  This was discovered when people noticed that pendulum clocks ran slower in summer, by as much as a minute per week&lt;ref name="Beckett1874" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BritannicaCompensation"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Picard then mentions that temperature slightly effects the length of this pendulum:  ''"Il est vray que cette longueur ne s'est pas toûjours trouvées si précise, &amp; qu'il a semblé qu'elle devoit estre toûjours un peu accourcie en Hyver, &amp; allongée en esté; mais c'est seulement de la dixieme partie d'une ligne … "''  (It is true that this length [of the pendulum] is not always found [to be] so precise, and that it seemed that it should be always a bit shortened in winter, and lengthened in summer; but it is only by a tenth part of a line [1 ''[[ligne]]'' (line) = 2.2558 mm] … )&lt;/ref&gt;  A pendulum with a steel rod will expand by about 11.3 [[parts per million]] (ppm) with each degree Celsius increase, causing it to lose about 0.27 seconds per day for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, or 9 seconds per day for a {{convert|33|C-change|abbr=on}} change. Wood rods expand less, losing only about 6 seconds per day for a {{convert|33|C-change|abbr=on}} change, which is why quality clocks often had wooden pendulum rods. The wood had to be varnished to prevent water vapor from getting in, because changes in humidity also affected the length.

==== Mercury pendulum ====
The first device to compensate for this error was the mercury pendulum, invented by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]]&lt;ref name="Graham1726" /&gt; in 1721.&lt;ref name="Milham1945" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BritannicaCompensation" /&gt;  The liquid metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]] expands in volume with temperature. In a mercury pendulum, the pendulum's weight (bob) is a container of mercury. With a temperature rise, the pendulum rod gets longer, but the mercury also expands and its surface level rises slightly in the container, moving its [[centre of mass]] closer to the pendulum pivot. By using the correct height of mercury in the container these two effects will cancel, leaving the pendulum's centre of mass, and its period, unchanged with temperature. Its main disadvantage was that when the temperature changed, the rod would come to the new temperature quickly but the mass of mercury might take a day or two to reach the new temperature, causing the rate to deviate during that time.&lt;ref name="MatthysCompensation"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys 2004], p.7-12&lt;/ref&gt;  To improve thermal accommodation several thin containers were often used, made of metal. Mercury pendulums were the standard used in precision regulator clocks into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gridiron pendulum ====
[[Image:BanjoPendulum.png|thumb|Diagram of a gridiron pendulum&lt;br&gt;A: exterior schematic&lt;br&gt;B: normal temperature&lt;br&gt;C: higher temperature]]
{{Main|Gridiron pendulum}}
The most widely used compensated pendulum was the [[gridiron pendulum]], invented in 1726 by [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref name="Milham1945" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BritannicaCompensation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MatthysCompensation" /&gt;  This consists of alternating rods of two different metals, one with lower thermal expansion ([[Coefficient of thermal expansion|CTE]]), [[steel]], and one with higher thermal expansion, [[zinc]] or [[brass]]. The rods are connected by a frame, as shown in the drawing at the right, so that an increase in length of the zinc rods pushes the bob up, shortening the pendulum.   With a temperature increase, the low expansion steel rods make the pendulum longer, while the high expansion zinc rods make it shorter. By making the rods of the correct lengths, the greater expansion of the zinc cancels out the expansion of the steel rods which have a greater combined length, and the pendulum stays the same length with temperature.

Zinc-steel gridiron pendulums are made with 5 rods, but the thermal expansion of brass is closer to steel, so brass-steel gridirons usually require 9 rods. Gridiron pendulums adjust to temperature changes faster than mercury pendulums, but scientists found that friction of the rods sliding in their holes in the frame caused gridiron pendulums to adjust in a series of tiny jumps.&lt;ref name="MatthysCompensation" /&gt; In high precision clocks this caused the clock's rate to change suddenly with each jump. Later it was found that zinc is subject to [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. For these reasons mercury pendulums were used in the highest precision clocks, but gridirons were used in quality regulator clocks.

Gridiron pendulums became so associated with good quality that, to this day, many ordinary clock pendulums have decorative 'fake' gridirons that don't actually have any temperature compensation function.

==== Invar and fused quartz ====
Around 1900, low thermal expansion materials were developed which could be used as pendulum rods in order to make elaborate temperature compensation unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Milham1945" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BritannicaCompensation" /&gt; These were only used in a few of the highest precision clocks before the pendulum became obsolete as a time standard. In 1896 [[Charles Édouard Guillaume]] invented the [[nickel]] [[steel]] [[alloy]] [[Invar]]. This has a [[coefficient of thermal expansion|CTE]] of around 0.5 µin/(in·°F), resulting in pendulum temperature errors over 71&amp;nbsp;°F of only 1.3 seconds per day, and this residual error could be compensated to zero with a few centimeters of aluminium under the pendulum bob&lt;ref name="Marrison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MatthysCompensation" /&gt; (this can be seen in the Riefler clock image above). Invar pendulums were first used in 1898 in the [[Riefler escapement|Riefler regulator clock]]&lt;ref&gt;Milham 1945, p.331-332&lt;/ref&gt;  which achieved accuracy of 15 milliseconds per day. Suspension springs of [[Elinvar]] were used to eliminate temperature variation of the spring's [[restoring force]] on the pendulum. Later [[fused quartz]] was used which had even lower CTE. These materials are the choice for modern high accuracy pendulums.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys 2004], Part 3, p.153-179&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atmospheric pressure ===
The effect of the surrounding air on a moving pendulum is complex and requires [[fluid mechanics]] to calculate precisely, but for most purposes its influence on the period can be accounted for by three effects:&lt;ref name="BritannicaP540" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13# Poynting &amp; Thompson, 1907, p.13-14]&lt;/ref&gt;
* By [[Archimedes' principle]] the effective [[weight]] of the [[bob (physics)|bob]] is reduced by the buoyancy of the air it displaces, while the [[mass]] ([[inertia]]) remains the same, reducing the pendulum's acceleration during its swing and increasing the period. This depends on the air pressure and the density of the pendulum, but not its shape.
* The pendulum carries an amount of air with it as it swings, and the mass of this air increases the inertia of the pendulum, again reducing the acceleration and increasing the period. This depends on both its density and shape.
* Viscous [[air resistance]] slows the pendulum's velocity. This has a negligible effect on the period, but dissipates energy, reducing the amplitude. This reduces the pendulum's [[Q factor]], requiring a stronger drive force from the clock's mechanism to keep it moving, which causes increased disturbance to the period.
Increases in [[barometric pressure]] increase a pendulum's period slightly due to the first two effects, by about 0.11 seconds per day per kilopascal (0.37 seconds per day per [[inch of mercury]] or 0.015 seconds per day per [[torr]]).&lt;ref name="BritannicaP540" /&gt; Researchers using pendulums to measure the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]] had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the [[Berlin Observatory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Gravity ===
Pendulums are affected by changes in gravitational acceleration, which varies by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth, so precision pendulum clocks have to be recalibrated after a move. Even moving a pendulum clock to the top of a tall building can cause it to lose measurable time from the reduction in gravity.

== Accuracy of pendulums as timekeepers ==
The timekeeping elements in all clocks, which include pendulums, [[balance wheel]]s, the [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystals]] used in [[quartz watch]]es, and even the vibrating atoms in [[atomic clock]]s, are in physics called [[harmonic oscillator]]s. The reason harmonic oscillators are used in clocks is that they vibrate or oscillate at a specific [[resonant frequency]] or period and resist oscillating at other rates. However, the resonant frequency is not infinitely 'sharp'.   Around the resonant frequency there is a narrow natural band of [[Frequency|frequencies]] (or periods), called the [[resonance width]] or [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], where the harmonic oscillator will oscillate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== ''Q'' factor ===
[[File:Shortt Synchronome free pendulum clock.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Shortt-synchronome clock|Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock]], the most accurate pendulum clock ever made, at the [[NIST]] museum, Gaithersburg, MD, USA. It kept time with two synchronized pendulums. The master pendulum in the vacuum tank ''(left)'' swung free of virtually any disturbance, and controlled the slave pendulum in the clock case ''(right)'' which performed the impulsing and timekeeping tasks. Its accuracy was about a second per year.]]

The measure of a harmonic oscillator's resistance to disturbances to its oscillation period is a dimensionless parameter called the [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]] equal to the resonant frequency divided by the [[resonance width]].&lt;ref name="Jespersen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reciprocal of the Q is roughly proportional to the limiting accuracy achievable by a harmonic oscillator as a time standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys, 2004, p.32, fig. 7.2 and text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Q'' is related to how long it takes for the oscillations of an oscillator to die out. The [[Q factor|''Q'']] of a pendulum can be measured by counting the number of oscillations it takes for the amplitude of the pendulum's swing to decay to 1/''e'' = 36.8%  of its initial swing, and multiplying by 2''π''.

In a clock, the pendulum must receive pushes from the clock's [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] to keep it swinging, to replace the energy the pendulum loses to friction. These pushes, applied by a mechanism called the [[escapement]], are the main source of disturbance to the pendulum's motion. The ''Q'' is equal to 2''π'' times the energy stored in the pendulum, divided by the energy lost to friction during each oscillation period, which is the same as the energy added by the escapement each period. It can be seen that the smaller the fraction of the pendulum's energy that is lost to friction, the less energy needs to be added, the less the disturbance from the escapement, the more 'independent' the pendulum is of the clock's mechanism, and the more constant its period is. The ''Q'' of a pendulum is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{M \omega}{\Gamma} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the mass of the bob,  ''ω''&amp;nbsp;= 2''π''/''T'' is the pendulum's radian frequency of oscillation, and ''Γ'' is the frictional [[Damping|damping force]] on the pendulum per unit velocity.

''ω'' is fixed by the pendulum's period, and ''M'' is limited by the load capacity and rigidity of the suspension. So the ''Q'' of clock pendulums is increased by minimizing frictional losses (''Γ''). Precision pendulums are suspended on low friction pivots consisting of triangular shaped 'knife' edges resting on agate plates. Around 99% of the energy loss in a freeswinging pendulum is due to air friction, so mounting a pendulum in a vacuum tank can increase the ''Q'', and thus the accuracy, by a factor of 100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0v2dhnZo8C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;sig=yYIWqaccL-YA2Mrigw4sFw5k-tk Matthys, 2004, p.81]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Q'' of pendulums ranges from several thousand in an ordinary clock to several hundred thousand for precision regulator pendulums swinging in vacuum.&lt;ref name="Orologeria"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[Invar]] master pendulum swinging in a vacuum tank had a ''Q'' of 110,000&lt;ref name="Orologeria" /&gt; and an error rate of around a second per year.&lt;ref name="Jones2000" /&gt;

Their Q of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;  is one reason why pendulums are more accurate timekeepers than the [[balance wheel]]s in watches, with ''Q'' around 100–300, but less accurate than the [[Crystal oscillator|quartz crystals]] in [[quartz clock]]s, with ''Q'' of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Marrison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orologeria" /&gt;

=== Escapement ===
Pendulums (unlike, for example, quartz crystals) have a low enough ''Q'' that the disturbance caused by the impulses to keep them moving is generally the limiting factor on their timekeeping accuracy. Therefore, the design of the [[escapement]], the mechanism that provides these impulses, has a large effect on the accuracy of a clock pendulum. If the impulses given to the pendulum by the escapement each swing could be exactly identical, the response of the pendulum would be identical, and its period would be constant. However, this is not achievable; unavoidable random fluctuations in the force due to friction of the clock's pallets, lubrication variations, and changes in the torque provided by the clock's power source as it runs down, mean that the force of the impulse applied by the escapement varies.

If these variations in the escapement's force cause changes in the pendulum's width of swing (amplitude), this will cause corresponding slight changes in the period, since (as discussed at top) a pendulum with a finite swing is not quite isochronous. Therefore, the goal of traditional escapement design is to apply the force with the proper profile, and at the correct point in the pendulum's cycle, so force variations have no effect on the pendulum's amplitude. This is called an ''isochronous escapement''.

=== The Airy condition ===
In 1826 British astronomer [[George Airy]] proved what clockmakers had known for centuries; that the disturbing effect of a drive force on the period of a pendulum is smallest if given as a short impulse as the pendulum passes through its bottom [[Equilibrium point|equilibrium position]].&lt;ref name="Marrison" /&gt;  Specifically, he proved that if a pendulum is driven by an impulse that is [[Symmetry (mathematics)|symmetrical]] about its bottom equilibrium position, the pendulum's period will be unaffected by changes in the drive force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Gravity measurement ==
The presence of the [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration of gravity]] ''g'' in the periodicity equation (1) for a pendulum means that the local gravitational acceleration of the Earth can be calculated from the period of a pendulum.   A pendulum can therefore be used as a [[gravimeter]] to measure the local [[gravity]], which varies by over 0.5% across the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = Note&gt;The value of "g" (acceleration due to gravity) at the [[equator]] is 9.780&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and at the [[North Pole|poles]] is 9.832&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a difference of 0.53%.&lt;/ref&gt; The pendulum in a clock is disturbed by the pushes it receives from the clock movement, so freeswinging pendulums were used, and were the standard instruments of [[gravimetry]] up to the 1930s.

The difference between clock pendulums and gravimeter pendulums is that to measure gravity, the pendulum's length as well as its period has to be measured. The period of freeswinging pendulums could be found to great precision by comparing their swing with a precision clock that had been adjusted to keep correct time by the passage of stars overhead. In the early measurements, a weight on a cord was suspended in front of the clock pendulum, and its length adjusted until the two pendulums swung in exact synchronism. Then the length of the cord was measured. From the length and the period, ''g'' could be calculated from equation (1).

=== The seconds pendulum ===
[[File:Pendulum2secondclock.gif|thumb|The seconds pendulum, a pendulum with a period of two seconds so each swing takes one second]] 
The [[seconds pendulum]], a pendulum with a period of two seconds so each swing takes one second, was widely used to measure gravity, because its period could be easily measured by comparing it to precision [[regulator clock]]s, which all had seconds pendulums.   By the late 17th century, the length of the seconds pendulum became the standard measure of the strength of gravitational acceleration at a location. By 1700 its length had been measured with submillimeter accuracy at several cities in Europe. For a seconds pendulum, ''g'' is proportional to its length:
:&lt;math&gt;g \propto L. \,&lt;/math&gt;

At higher latitudes the surface was closer to the center of the Earth, so gravity increased with latitude.&lt;ref name="Lenzen1964" /&gt;  From this time on, pendulums began to be taken to distant lands to measure gravity, and tables were compiled of the length of the seconds pendulum at different locations on Earth. In 1743 [[Alexis Claude Clairaut]] created the first hydrostatic model of the Earth, [[Clairaut's theorem]],&lt;ref name="Poynting &amp; Thompson 1907, p.9" /&gt; which allowed the [[ellipticity]] of the Earth to be calculated from gravity measurements. Progressively more accurate models of the shape of the Earth followed.
* '''1687''': Newton experimented with pendulums (described in ''Principia'') and found that equal length pendulums with bobs made of different materials had the same period, proving that the gravitational force on different substances was exactly proportional to their [[mass]] (inertia).
[[File:Borda and Cassini pendulum experiment.png|thumb|190px|Borda &amp; Cassini's 1792 measurement of the length of the seconds pendulum]]
* '''1737''': French mathematician [[Pierre Bouguer]] made a sophisticated series of pendulum observations in the [[Andes]] mountains, Peru.&lt;ref name="Poynting &amp; Thompson, 1907, p.10"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 Poynting &amp; Thompson, 1907, p.10]&lt;/ref&gt;  He used a copper pendulum bob in the shape of a double pointed cone suspended by a thread; the bob could be reversed to eliminate the effects of nonuniform density. He calculated the length to the center of oscillation of thread and bob combined, instead of using the center of the bob. He corrected for thermal expansion of the measuring rod and barometric pressure, giving his results for a pendulum swinging in vacuum. Bouguer swung the same pendulum at three different elevations, from sea level to the top of the high Peruvian ''[[altiplano]]''. Gravity should fall with the inverse square of the distance from the center of the Earth. Bouguer found that it fell off slower, and correctly attributed the 'extra' gravity to the gravitational field of the huge Peruvian plateau. From the density of rock samples he calculated an estimate of the effect of the ''altiplano'' on the pendulum, and comparing this with the gravity of the Earth was able to make the first rough estimate of the [[Mass of the Earth|density of the Earth]].
* '''1747''': [[Daniel Bernoulli]] showed how to correct for the lengthening of the period due to a finite angle of swing  ''θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' by using the first order correction  ''θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/16, giving the period of a pendulum with an extremely small swing.&lt;ref name="Poynting &amp; Thompson, 1907, p.10" /&gt;
* '''1792''': To define a pendulum standard of length for use with the new [[metric system]], in 1792 [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] and [[Jean-Dominique Cassini]] made a precise measurement of the seconds pendulum at Paris. They used a {{frac|1|1|2}}-inch (14&amp;nbsp;mm) platinum ball suspended by a {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} iron wire. Their main innovation was a technique called the "''method of coincidences''" which allowed the period of pendulums to be compared with great precision.  (Bouguer had also used this method). The time interval Δ''T'' between the recurring instants when the two pendulums swung in synchronism was timed. From this the difference between the periods of the pendulums, ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', could be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{\Delta T} = \frac {1}{T_1} - \frac {1}{T_2}\,&lt;/math&gt;
* '''1821''': [[Francesco Carlini]] made pendulum observations on top of Mount Cenis, Italy, from which, using methods similar to Bouguer's, he calculated the density of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Modeling the mountain as a segment of a sphere {{convert|11|mi}} in diameter and {{convert|1|mi}} high, from rock samples he calculated its gravitational field, and estimated the density of the Earth at 4.39 times that of water. Later recalculations by others gave values of 4.77 and 4.95, illustrating the uncertainties in these geographical methods.

The precision of the early gravity measurements above was limited by the difficulty of measuring the length of the pendulum, ''L'' .  ''L'' was the length of an idealized simple gravity pendulum (described at top), which has all its mass concentrated in a point at the end of the cord. In 1673 Huygens had shown that the period of a rigid bar pendulum (called a ''compound pendulum'') was equal to the period of a simple pendulum with a length equal to the distance between the [[wikt:pivot|pivot]] point and a point called the [[Center of percussion|center of oscillation]], located under the [[center of gravity]], that depends on the mass distribution along the pendulum. But there was no accurate way of determining the center of oscillation in a real pendulum.

To get around this problem, the early researchers above approximated an ideal simple pendulum as closely as possible by using a metal sphere suspended by a light wire or cord. If the wire was light enough, the center of oscillation was close to the center of gravity of the ball, at its geometric center. This "ball and wire" type of pendulum wasn't very accurate, because it didn't swing as a rigid body, and the elasticity of the wire caused its length to change slightly as the pendulum swung.

However Huygens had also proved that in any pendulum, the pivot point and the center of oscillation were interchangeable.&lt;ref name="HuygensReciprocity" /&gt;  That is, if a pendulum were turned upside down and hung from its center of oscillation, it would have the same period as it did in the previous position, and the old pivot point would be the new center of oscillation.

British physicist and army captain [[Henry Kater]] in 1817 realized that Huygens' principle could be used to find the length of a simple pendulum with the same period as a real pendulum.&lt;ref name="Kater1818" /&gt;  If a pendulum was built with a second adjustable pivot point near the bottom so it could be hung upside down, and the second pivot was adjusted until the periods when hung from both pivots were the same, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the distance between the two pivots would be the length ''L'' of a simple pendulum with the same period.

Kater built a reversible pendulum (shown at right) consisting of a brass bar with two opposing pivots made of short triangular "knife" blades ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(a)&lt;/span&gt;'' near either end. It could be swung from either pivot, with the knife blades supported on agate plates. Rather than make one pivot adjustable, he attached the pivots a meter apart and instead adjusted the periods with a moveable weight on the pendulum rod ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(b,c)&lt;/span&gt;''. In operation, the pendulum is hung in front of a precision clock, and the period timed, then turned upside down and the period timed again. The weight is adjusted with the adjustment screw until the periods are equal. Then putting this period and the distance between the pivots into equation (1) gives the gravitational acceleration ''g'' very accurately.

Kater timed the swing of his pendulum using the "''method of coincidences''" and measured the distance between the two pivots with a micrometer. After applying corrections for the finite amplitude of swing, the buoyancy of the bob, the barometric pressure and altitude, and temperature, he obtained a value of 39.13929&amp;nbsp;inches for the seconds pendulum at London, in vacuum, at sea level, at 62&amp;nbsp;°F. The largest variation from the mean of his 12 observations was 0.00028 in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Reversible pendulums (known technically as "convertible" pendulums) employing Kater's principle were used for absolute gravity measurements into the 1930s.

=== Later pendulum gravimeters ===
The increased accuracy made possible by Kater's pendulum helped make [[gravimetry]] a standard part of [[geodesy]]. Since the exact location (latitude and longitude) of the 'station' where the gravity measurement was made was necessary, gravity measurements became part of [[surveying]], and pendulums were taken on the great [[geodetic surveying|geodetic surveys]] of the 18th century, particularly the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India.

[[File:Using Kater pendulum in India.png|thumb|250px|Measuring gravity with an invariable pendulum, Madras, India, 1821]]
* '''Invariable pendulums:'''  Kater introduced the idea of ''relative'' gravity measurements, to supplement the ''absolute'' measurements made by a Kater's pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23 Poynting &amp; Thomson 1904, p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparing the gravity at two different points was an easier process than measuring it absolutely by the Kater method. All that was necessary was to time the period of an ordinary (single pivot) pendulum at the first point, then transport the pendulum to the other point and time its period there. Since the pendulum's length was constant, from (1) the ratio of the gravitational accelerations was equal to the inverse of the ratio of the periods squared, and no precision length measurements were necessary. So once the gravity had been measured absolutely at some central station, by the Kater or other accurate method, the gravity at other points could be found by swinging pendulums at the central station and then taking them to the other location and timing their swing there. Kater made up a set of "invariable" pendulums, with only one knife edge pivot, which were taken to many countries after first being swung at a central station at [[Kew Observatory]], UK.
* '''Airy's coal pit experiments''': Starting in 1826, using methods similar to Bouguer, British astronomer [[George Airy]] attempted to determine the density of the Earth by pendulum gravity measurements at the top and bottom of a coal mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The 1826 experiment was aborted by the flooding of the mine, but in 1854 he conducted an improved experiment at the Harton coal mine, using seconds pendulums swinging on agate plates, timed by precision chronometers synchronized by an electrical circuit. He found the lower pendulum was slower by 2.24 seconds per day. This meant that the gravitational acceleration at the bottom of the mine, 1250&amp;nbsp;ft below the surface, was 1/14,000 less than it should have been from the inverse square law; that is the attraction of the spherical shell was 1/14,000 of the attraction of the Earth. From samples of surface rock he estimated the mass of the spherical shell of crust, and from this estimated that the density of the Earth was 6.565 times that of water. Von Sterneck attempted to repeat the experiment in 1882 but found inconsistent results.

[[File:Repsold pendulum.png|thumb|left|65px|Repsold pendulum, 1864]]
* '''Repsold-Bessel pendulum:''' It was time-consuming and error-prone to repeatedly swing the Kater's pendulum and adjust the weights until the periods were equal.  [[Friedrich Bessel]] showed in 1835 that this was unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A1IqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA320 Lenzen &amp; Multauf 1964, p.320]&lt;/ref&gt;  As long as the periods were close together, the gravity could be calculated from the two periods and the center of gravity of the pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TL4KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 Poynting &amp; Thompson 1907, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;  So the reversible pendulum didn't need to be adjustable, it could just be a bar with two pivots. Bessel also showed that if the pendulum was made symmetrical in form about its center, but was weighted internally at one end, the errors due to air drag would cancel out. Further, another error due to the finite diameter of the knife edges could be made to cancel out if they were interchanged between measurements. Bessel didn't construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract by the Swiss Geodetic Commission made a pendulum along these lines.   The Repsold pendulum was about 56&amp;nbsp;cm long and had a period of about {{frac|3|4}} second. It was used extensively by European geodetic agencies, and with the Kater pendulum in the Survey of India. Similar pendulums of this type were designed by Charles Pierce and C. Defforges.

[[File:Mendenhall gravimeter pendulums.jpg|thumb|250px|Pendulums used in Mendenhall gravimeter, 1890]]
* '''Von Sterneck and Mendenhall gravimeters:''' In 1887 Austro-Hungarian scientist Robert von Sterneck developed a small gravimeter pendulum mounted in a temperature-controlled vacuum tank to eliminate the effects of temperature and air pressure. It used a "half-second pendulum," having a period close to one second, about 25&amp;nbsp;cm long.  The pendulum was nonreversible, so the instrument was used for relative gravity measurements, but their small size made them small and portable. The period of the pendulum was picked off by reflecting the image of an [[electric spark]] created by a precision chronometer off a mirror mounted at the top of the pendulum rod. The Von Sterneck instrument, and a similar instrument developed by Thomas C. Mendenhall of the [[US Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1890,&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web

:The Mendenhall pendulum was actually a more accurate timekeeper than the highest precision clocks of the time, and as the 'world's best clock' it was used by [[Albert A. Michelson]] in his 1924 measurements of the [[speed of light]] on Mt. Wilson, California.&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt;
* '''Double pendulum gravimeters:''' Starting in 1875, the increasing accuracy of pendulum measurements revealed another source of error in existing instruments: the swing of the pendulum caused a slight swaying of the tripod stand used to support portable pendulums, introducing error. In 1875 Charles S Peirce calculated that measurements of the length of the seconds pendulum made with the Repsold instrument required a correction of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm due to this error.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A1IqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA324 Lenzen &amp; Multauf 1964, p.324]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1880 C. Defforges used a [[Michelson interferometer]] to measure the sway of the stand dynamically, and interferometers were added to the standard Mendenhall apparatus to calculate sway corrections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A1IqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA329 Lenzen &amp; Multauf 1964, p.329]&lt;/ref&gt;  A method of preventing this error was first suggested in 1877 by Hervé Faye and advocated by Peirce, Cellérier and Furtwangler: mount two identical pendulums on the same support, swinging with the same amplitude, 180° out of phase. The opposite motion of the pendulums would cancel out any sideways forces on the support. The idea was opposed due to its complexity, but by the start of the 20th century the Von Sterneck device and other instruments were modified to swing multiple pendulums simultaneously.

They were mounted in a permanently sealed temperature and humidity controlled vacuum chamber. Stray electrostatic charges on the quartz pendulums had to be discharged by exposing them to a radioactive salt before use. The period was detected by reflecting a light beam from a mirror at the top of the pendulum, recorded by a chart recorder and compared to a precision [[crystal oscillator]] calibrated against the [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]] radio time signal. This instrument was accurate to within (0.3–0.5)×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; (30–50 [[microgal]]s or 3–5&amp;nbsp;nm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Woolard" /&gt; It was used into the 1960s.

Relative pendulum gravimeters were superseded by the simpler LaCoste zero-length spring gravimeter, invented in 1934 by Lucien LaCoste.&lt;ref name="NOAA" /&gt;  Absolute (reversible) pendulum gravimeters were replaced in the 1950s by free fall gravimeters, in which a weight is allowed to fall in a vacuum tank and its acceleration is measured by an optical [[interferometer]].&lt;ref name="Torge" /&gt;

== Standard of length ==
Because the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]] is constant at a given point on Earth, the period of a simple pendulum at a given location depends only on its length. Additionally, gravity varies only slightly at different locations. Almost from the pendulum's discovery until the early 19th century, this property led scientists to suggest using a pendulum of a given [[Frequency|period]] as a [[Unit of length|standard of length]].

Until the 19th century, countries based their systems of length measurement on prototypes, metal bar [[primary standard]]s, such as the standard [[yard]] in Britain kept at the Houses of Parliament, and the standard ''[[toise]]'' in France, kept at Paris. These were vulnerable to damage or destruction over the years, and because of the difficulty of comparing prototypes, the same unit often had different lengths in distant towns, creating opportunities for fraud.&lt;ref name="Matthews2001"&gt;{{cite conference

The period of pendulums could be measured very precisely by timing them with clocks that were set by the stars. A pendulum standard amounted to defining the unit of length by the gravitational force of the Earth, for all intents constant, and the second, which was defined by the [[Rotation of the Earth|rotation rate of the Earth]], also constant. The idea was that anyone, anywhere on Earth, could recreate the standard by constructing a pendulum that swung with the defined period and measuring its length.

Virtually all proposals were based on the [[seconds pendulum]], in which each swing (a half [[Frequency|period]]) takes one second, which is about a meter (39&amp;nbsp;inches) long, because by the late 17th century it had become a standard for measuring gravity (see previous section). By the 18th century its length had been measured with sub-millimeter accuracy at a number of cities in Europe and around the world.

The initial attraction of the pendulum length standard was that it was believed (by early scientists such as Huygens and Wren) that gravity was constant over the Earth's surface, so a given pendulum had the same period at any point on Earth.&lt;ref name="Matthews2001" /&gt;  So the length of the standard pendulum could be measured at any location, and would not be tied to any given nation or region; it would be a truly democratic, worldwide standard. Although Richer found in 1672 that gravity varies at different points on the globe, the idea of a pendulum length standard remained popular, because it was found that gravity only varies with [[latitude]]. Gravitational acceleration increases smoothly from the [[equator]] to the [[Geographical pole|poles]], due to the [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] shape of the Earth, so at any given latitude (east-west line), gravity was constant enough that the length of a seconds pendulum was the same within the measurement capability of the 18th century. Thus the unit of length could be defined at a given latitude and measured at any point along that latitude. For example, a pendulum standard defined at 45° north latitude, a popular choice, could be measured in parts of France, Italy, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, the United States and Canada. In addition, it could be recreated at any location at which the gravitational acceleration had been accurately measured.

By the mid 19th century, increasingly accurate pendulum measurements by [[Edward Sabine]] and [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] revealed that gravity, and thus the length of any pendulum standard, varied measurably with local geologic features such as mountains and dense subsurface rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Christopher Wren]] was another early supporter. The idea of a pendulum standard of length must have been familiar to people as early as 1663, because [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] satirizes it in ''[[Hudibras]]'':&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{cite journal

:Upon the bench I will so handle ‘em
:That the vibration of this pendulum
:Shall make all taylors’ yards of one
:Unanimous opinion
In 1671 [[Jean Picard]] proposed a pendulum-defined 'universal foot' in his influential ''Mesure de la Terre''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=twUNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1 Zupko, 1990, p.131]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gabriel Mouton]] around 1670 suggested defining the ''[[toise]]'' either by a seconds pendulum or a minute of terrestrial degree. A plan for a complete system of units based on the pendulum was advanced in 1675 by Italian polymath Tito Livio Burratini. In France in 1747, geographer [[Charles Marie de la Condamine]] proposed defining length by a seconds pendulum at the equator; since at this location a pendulum's swing wouldn't be distorted by the Earth's rotation. [[James Steuart (economist)|James Steuart]] (1780) and [[George Skene Keith]] were also supporters.

By the end of the 18th century, when many nations were reforming their [[Weights and measures|weight and measure systems]], the [[seconds pendulum]] was the leading choice for a new definition of length, advocated by prominent scientists in several major nations. In 1790, then US Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to Congress a comprehensive decimalized US 'metric system' based on the seconds pendulum at 38° North latitude, the mean latitude of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=twUNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1 Zupko, 1990, p.140-141]&lt;/ref&gt;  No action was taken on this proposal. In Britain the leading advocate of the pendulum was politician [[John Riggs Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=twUNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1 Zupko, 1990, p.93]&lt;/ref&gt;  When his efforts to promote a joint British–French–American metric system fell through in 1790, he proposed a British system based on the length of the seconds pendulum at London. This standard was adopted in 1824 (below).

=== The metre ===
In the discussions leading up to the French adoption of the [[metric system]] in 1791, the leading candidate for the definition of the new unit of length, the [[metre]], was the seconds pendulum at 45° North latitude. It was advocated by a group led by French politician [[Talleyrand]] and mathematician [[Marquis de Condorcet|Antoine Nicolas Caritat de Condorcet]]. This was one of the three final options considered by the [[French Academy of Sciences]] committee. However, on March 19, 1791 the committee instead chose to base the metre on the length of the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] through Paris. A pendulum definition was rejected because of its variability at different locations, and because it defined length by a unit of time. (However, since 1983 the metre has been officially defined in terms of the length of the second and the speed of light.) A possible additional reason is that the radical French Academy didn't want to base their new system on the second, a traditional and nondecimal unit from the ''[[ancien regime]]''.

Although not defined by the pendulum, the final length chosen for the metre, 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; of the pole-to-equator [[meridian arc]], was very close to the length of the seconds pendulum (0.9937 m), within 0.63%. Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate the use of the seconds pendulum as a secondary standard, as was proposed in the official document. So the modern world's standard unit of length is certainly closely linked historically with the seconds pendulum.

=== Britain and Denmark ===
Britain and Denmark appear to be the only nations that (for a short time) based their units of length on the pendulum. In 1821 the Danish inch was defined as 1/38 of the length of the mean solar seconds pendulum at 45° latitude at the meridian of [[Skagen]], at sea level, in vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However, when the prototype yard was lost in the [[Burning of Parliament|1834 Houses of Parliament fire]], it proved impossible to recreate it accurately from the pendulum definition, and in 1855 Britain repealed the pendulum standard and returned to prototype standards.

== Other uses ==

=== Seismometers ===
A pendulum in which the rod is not vertical but almost horizontal was used in early [[seismometers]] for measuring earth tremors. The bob of the pendulum does not move when its mounting does, and the difference in the movements is recorded on a drum chart.

=== Schuler tuning ===
{{Main|Schuler tuning}}
As first explained by [[Max Schuler|Maximilian Schuler]] in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital period of a hypothetical satellite orbiting just above the surface of the earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called [[Schuler tuning]], is used in [[inertial guidance system]]s in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the [[control system]] that keeps the [[inertial platform]] containing the [[gyroscope]]s stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.

=== Coupled pendulums ===
[[File:Coupled oscillators.gif|frame|Two pendulums with the same period coupled by suspending them from a common support string. The oscillation alternates between the two.]]
[[File:Huygens synchronization of two clocks (Experiment).jpg|thumbnail|left|100px|Repetition of Huygens experiment showing synchronization of two clocks]]
In 1665 Huygens made a curious observation about pendulum clocks. Two clocks had been placed on his [[mantlepiece]], and he noted that they had acquired an opposing motion. That is, their pendulums were beating in unison but in the opposite direction; 180° [[out of phase]]. Regardless of how the two clocks were started, he found that they would eventually return to this state, thus making the first recorded observation of a [[Coupled oscillation|coupled oscillator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title=Out of Time: Researchers Recreate 1665 Clock Experiment to Gain Insights into Modern Synchronized Oscillators
 | publisher=Georgia Tech | accessdate=2007-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of this behavior was that the two pendulums were affecting each other through slight motions of the supporting mantlepiece. This process is called [[entrainment (physics)|entrainment]] or [[mode locking]] in physics and is observed in other coupled oscillators. Synchronized pendulums have been used in clocks and were widely used in [[gravimeter]]s in the early 20th century. Although Huygens only observed out-of-phase synchronization, recent investigations have shown the existence of in-phase synchronization, as well as "death" states wherein one or both clocks stops.&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Fradkov and B. Andrievsky, "Synchronization and phase relations in the motion of two-pendulum system", International Journal of Non-linear Mechanics, vol. 42 (2007), pp. 895–901.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.I. Blekhman, "Synchronization in science and technology", ASME Press, New York, 1988, (Translated from Russian into English)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious practice ===
[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, México D.F., México, 2013-10-16, DD 89.JPG|thumb|Pendulum in the Metropolitan Cathedral, Mexico City.]]
Pendulum motion appears in religious ceremonies as well. The swinging [[incense]] burner called a [[censer]], also known as a [[thurible]], is an example of a pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;An interesting simulation of thurible motion can be found at [http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/physique/perso/gtulloue/Meca/Oscillateurs/botafumeiro.html#manip this site].&lt;/ref&gt;  Pendulums are also seen at many gatherings in eastern Mexico where they mark the turning of the tides on the day which the tides are at their highest point. See also [[pendulums for divination and dowsing]].

=== Education ===

Pendulums are widely used in [[science education]] as an example of a [[harmonic oscillator]], to teach [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[oscillatory motion]].  One use is to demonstrate the law of [[conservation of energy]].&lt;ref name=Hart&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hart|first1=Matthew|title=Physics Risks Death by Wrecking Ball for Science|url=http://nerdist.com/physics-risks-death-by-wrecking-ball-for-science/|website=Nerdist|accessdate=14 March 2017|language=en|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorenson|first1=Roy|editor1-last=Booth|editor1-first=Anthony Robert|editor2-last=Rowbottom|editor2-first=Darrell P.|title=Intuitions|date=2014|publisher=Oxford Univ Pr|isbn=9780199609192|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttX1AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=bowling%20ball%20pendulum%20experiment&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q=bowling%20ball%20pendulum%20experiment&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 March 2017|chapter=Novice Thought Experiments}}&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy object such as a [[bowling ball]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowling Ball Pendulum|url=http://wonders.physics.wisc.edu/bowling-ball-pendulum.htm|website=The Wonders of Physics|publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison|accessdate=14 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[wrecking ball]]&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt; is attached to a string. The weight is then moved to within a few inches of a volunteer's face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. In most instances, the weight reverses direction and then returns to (almost) the same position as the original release location — ''i.e.'' a small distance from the volunteer's face — thus leaving the volunteer unharmed. On occasion the volunteer is injured if either the volunteer does not stand still&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=weknowmemes|title=Physics Ball Test Gone Wrong|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqsNtYbJAY|website=YouTube|accessdate=14 March 2017|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the pendulum is initially released with a push (so that when it returns it surpasses the release position).

Modern sources point out that due to Jesus' admonition against bloodshed, Inquisitors were only allowed to use torture methods which did not spill blood, and the pendulum method would have violated this stricture.  One theory is that Llorente misunderstood the account he heard; the prisoner was actually referring to another common Inquisition torture, the ''[[strappado]]'' (garrucha), in which the prisoner has his hands tied behind his back and is hoisted off the floor by a rope tied to his hands.&lt;ref name="Pavlac" /&gt; This method was also known as the "pendulum".  Poe's popular horror tale, and public awareness of the Inquisition's other brutal methods, has kept the myth of this elaborate torture method alive.

== Notes ==
{{Reflist|group=Note}}
The value of g reflected by the period of a pendulum varies from place to place. The gravitational force varies with distance from the center of the Earth, i.e. with altitude - or because the Earth's shape is oblate, g varies  with latitude.
A more important cause of this reduction in g at the equator is because the equator is spinning at one revolution per day, reducing the gravitational force there.

Pentamethylbismuth is produced in a two step process.

At -110 &amp;deg;C, Bi(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is a blue-violet solid. The methyl groups are arranged in a trigonal bipyramid, and the bond-lengths of methyl with bismuth are all the same. However, the molecule is not rigid, as can be determined from the [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectrum that shows all methyl groups are equivalent.&lt;ref name=wall/&gt; It is stable as a solid, but in the gas phase, when heated or in solution decomposes to [[trimethylbismuth]].&lt;ref name=greene/&gt;&lt;ref name=wall/&gt;
The colour is unusual for bismuth or other hypervalent [[Pnictogen#Compounds|pnictide]] compounds, which are colourless. Calculations show that the colour is due to [[HOMO]]-LUMO transition. The HOMO is ligand based, whereas the LUMO is modified by relativistically stabilised bismuth 6s orbitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conradie|first1=Jeanet|last2=Ghosh|first2=Abhik|title=The Blue-Violet Color of Pentamethylbismuth: A Visible Spin-Orbit Effect|journal=ChemistryOpen|date=February 2017|volume=6|issue=1|pages=15–17|doi=10.1002/open.201600131|pmid=28168144}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pentode''' is an electronic device having five active [[electrode]]s. The term most commonly applies to a three-grid amplifying [[vacuum tube]] (thermionic valve), which was invented by [[Gilles Holst]] and [[Bernard Tellegen|Bernhard D.H. Tellegen]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;G. Holst and B.D.H. Tellegen, "Means for amplifying electrical oscillations", US Patent 1945040, January 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pentode consists of an evacuated glass envelope containing five electrodes in this order: a [[cathode]] heated by a [[electrical filament|filament]], a [[control grid]], a [[screen grid]], a [[suppressor grid]], and a [[plate electrode|plate]] ([[anode]]). The pentode (called a "triple-grid amplifier" in some early literature&lt;ref&gt;"RCA Receiving Tube Manual, 1940"; p118&lt;/ref&gt;) was developed from the [[tetrode]] tube by the addition of a third grid, the suppressor grid. This served to prevent [[secondary emission]] electrons emitted&lt;ref name="NEET"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the plate from reaching the screen grid, which caused instability and [[parasitic oscillation]]s in the tetrode.  The pentode is closely related to the [[beam tetrode]].  Pentodes were widely used in industrial and consumer electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s, when they were replaced by transistors.  Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters. The obsolete consumer tubes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio devices.

== Types of pentodes ==
* '''Variable transconductance''' ("'''variable-mu'''", "'''remote-cutoff'''" or "'''super-control'''") tubes in general are those with a non-uniform grid wire spacing to allow them to handle a wide range of input signal levels without excessive cross-modulation [[distortion]], and so useful in [[radio frequency]] stages where [[automatic gain control]] is applied to the pentode. The first commercial variable-mu tubes were the 550 and 551 developed by Stuart and Snow around 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, B &amp; Snow, H. A. (1930). Reduction of Distortion and Cross-Talk in Radio Receivers by Mean of Variable-Mu Tetrodes. Proc IRE, Vol 18, Issue 12, pp2102 - 2127&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples include: [[EF50]], 1T4, 6K7, 6BA6, and the EF83 (while perhaps the EF85/6BY7, and certainly the 6JH6, could be described as "'''semiremote-cutoff'''" pentodes).&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grayson Evans|title=Hollow-State Design 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Iv9UBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=semi+remote+cutoff+pentode&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3tu_poMLMAhUHCBoKHYuUCsgQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=semi%20remote%20cutoff%20pentode&amp;f=false|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-300-96521-3|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sharp-cutoff''' ("high slope" or ordinary) pentodes have the more ordinary uniform spacing of grid wires, and so mutual conductance decreases in an essentially uniform manner with increasing negative bias, and has a more abrupt cutoff. These pentodes are more suitable for audio amplifiers. Examples include: EF37A, [[EF86]]/6267, 1N5GT, 6AU6A, 6J7GT. Often, but not always, in the [[Mullard–Philips tube designation|European valve naming scheme]] for pentodes an even number indicated a sharp-cutoff device while odd indicated remote-cutoff; the EF37 was an exception to this general trend, perhaps due to its history as an update to the EF36 ([http://www.r-type.org/addtext/add008.htm "The Mullard EF36, EF37 and EF37A" at the National Valve Museum]).
* '''Power output pentodes''', The [[EL34]], [[EL84]], 6CL6, 6F6, 6G6, [[SY4307A]] and 6K6GT are some examples of true pentodes used for power amplification, using a suppressor grid rather than the higher efficiency beam-forming plates used in beam tetrodes. (Beam tetrodes were also sometimes referred to as "beam pentodes",&lt;ref&gt;"Sylvania Receiving Tubes Technical Manual, 14th Edition" p 143&lt;/ref&gt; and include the Sylvania (and possibly GE) 6CA7 version of EL34, 6V6GT and the GEC KT66 and KT88. Other sources preferred names such as "beam power amplifier" or "beam power tube", possibly due to caution regarding the [[Philips]] pentode patent). Power output pentodes for specific television requirements, efficient for their job but possibly not linear enough for audio, were named:
** '''video output''' pentodes, e.g. 15A6/PL83, PL802
** '''frame output''' or '''vertical deflection''' pentodes, such as the [[EL84#PL84, UL84 and EL86|PL84]] and the pentode sections of the 18GV8/PCL85.
** '''line output''' or '''horizontal deflection''' pentodes, such as the PL36, 27GB5/PL500, PL505 etc.
* A "triode-pentode" is a single envelope containing both a triode and a pentode, such as an ECF80 or ECL86.

== Advantages over the tetrode ==
The simple [[tetrode]] or ''screen-grid tube'' offered a larger amplification factor, more power and a higher frequency capability than the earlier [[triode]].  However, in the tetrode  ''secondary electrons'' knocked out of the anode (plate) by the electrons from the cathode striking it (a process called [[secondary emission]]) can flow to the screen grid  due to its relatively high potential. This current of electrons leaving the anode reduces the net anode current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.  As the anode voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is increased, the electrons from the cathode hit the anode with more energy, knocking out more secondary electrons, increasing this current of electrons leaving the anode. The result is that in the tetrode the anode current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is found to ''decrease'' with increasing anode voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, over part of the [[Current-voltage characteristic|characteristic curve]].  This property (Δ''V''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/Δ''I''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0) is called [[negative resistance]].  It can cause the tetrode to become unstable, leading to [[parasitic oscillation]]s in the output, called [[Dynatron oscillator|dynatron oscillations]] in some circumstances.

The pentode, as introduced by [[Bernard D. H. Tellegen|Tellegen]], has an additional electrode, or third grid, called the [[suppressor grid]], located between the screen grid and the anode, which solves the problem of secondary emission.   The suppressor grid is given a low potential, it is usually either grounded or connected to the cathode.  Secondary emission electrons from the anode are repelled by the negative potential on the suppressor grid, so they can't reach the screen grid but return to the anode.  The primary electrons from the cathode have a higher kinetic energy, so they can still pass through the suppressor grid and reach the anode.

Pentodes, therefore, can have higher current outputs and a wider output voltage swing; the anode/plate can even be at a lower voltage than the screen grid yet still amplify well.&lt;ref&gt;"RCA Receiving Tube Manual, 1940"; p8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons with the triode ==
* Pentodes (and tetrodes) tend to have a much lower feedback capacitance, due to the screening effect of the second grid.  
* Pentodes tend to have a higher noise (''partition noise''), 
* Triodes have a lower internal anode resistance, and hence higher damping factor when used in audio output circuits, compared with pentodes, when [[negative feedback]] is absent.  That also reduces the potential voltage amplification obtainable from a triode compared with a pentode of the same transconductance, and usually means a more efficient output stage can be made using pentodes, with a lower power drive signal.
* Pentodes are almost unaffected by changes in supply voltage, and can thus operate with more poorly stabilized supplies than triodes. 
* Pentodes and triodes (and tetrodes) do have essentially similar relationships between grid (one) input voltage and anode output current when the anode voltage is held constant, i.e. close to a [[Power-law#square-law|square-law]] relationship.

== Usage ==
[[Image:12AE10CompactronTube.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[General Electric]] 12AE10 double pentode]]
Pentode tubes were first used in consumer-type radio receivers. A well-known pentode type, the [[EF50]], was designed before the start of World War II, and was extensively used in [[radar]] sets and other military electronic equipment. The pentode contributed to the electronic preponderance of the Allies.

The [[Colossus computer]] and the [[Manchester Baby]] used large numbers of EF36 pentode tubes.&lt;ref&gt;

Sylvania. [http://www.nj7p.org/Tubes/PDFs/Frank/137-Sylvania/7AK7.pdf Engineering Data Service. 7AK7]. July 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, pentodes were widely used in TV receivers, particularly the successor to the EF50, the EF80. Vacuum tubes were replaced by transistors during the 1960s. However, they continue to be used in certain applications, including high-power radio transmitters and (because of their well-known [[valve sound]]) in [[high-end audio|high-end]] and [[professional audio]] applications, microphone [[preamplifier]]s and electric [[guitar amplifier]]s. Large stockpiles in countries of the former Soviet Union have provided a continuing supply of such devices, some designed for other purposes but adapted to audio use, such as the [[GU-50]] transmitter tube.

== Triode-strapped pentode circuits ==
A pentode can have its screen grid (grid 2) connected to the anode (plate), in which case it reverts to an ordinary triode with commensurate characteristics (lower anode resistance, lower mu, lower noise, more drive voltage required). The device is then said to be "triode-strapped" or "triode-connected". This is sometimes provided as an option in [[audiophile]] pentode amplifier circuits, to give the sought-after "sonic qualities" of a triode power amplifier.  A resistor may be included in series with the screen grid to avoid exceeding the screen grid's power or voltage rating, and to prevent local oscillation. Triode-connection is a useful option for audiophiles who wish to avoid the expense of 'true' power triodes.

[[File:Barong Up Close.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a [[Barong Tagalog]] made with piña fiber.]]
'''Piña''' is a fiber made from the leaves of a [[pineapple]] plant and is commonly used in the [[Philippines]] (also known as nanas or nenas in Tagalog). It is sometimes combined with [[silk]] or [[polyester]] to create a [[textile]] fabric. Piña's name comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''piña'' which means pineapple.

== Production methods ==
[[Image:Pineapple-fiber-extraction.jpg|thumb|Scraping a pineapple leaf to reveal the fibers.]]

Since piña is from a leaf, the leaf has to be cut first from the plant.  Then the fiber is pulled or split away from the leaf. Most leaf fibers are long and somewhat stiff. Each strand of the piña fiber is hand scraped and is knotted one by one to form a continuous filament to be handwoven and then made into a piña cloth.

== Producers ==
[[Kalibo]], [[Aklan]], is the main and the oldest manufacturer/weaver of piña cloth in the Philippines which are being exported to various parts of the world most particularly North America, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.asianjournal.com/aj-magazine/red-carpet/5608-aklans-pina-looms-start-weaving-again-.html |title= Aklan’s piña looms start weaving again |author= Nestor Burgos |date= 28 May 2010 |work= Inquirer.net |publisher= Asian Journal |accessdate= 3 December 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120609193110/http://www.asianjournal.com/aj-magazine/red-carpet/5608-aklans-pina-looms-start-weaving-again-.html |archivedate= 9 June 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Piña weaving is an age-old tradition which was recently revived in the past 20 years. 

Pineapple silk was considered the queen of Philippine fabrics and is considered the fabric of choice of the Philippine elite. During the 1996 [[APEC]] summit held in the Philippines, world leaders donned [[Barong Tagalog]] made of piña sourced from [[Kalibo]] during the group photo.

Producers include La Herminia Piña Weaving Industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laherminiaweaving.com.ph/|title=La Herminia - Piña Weaving Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malabon Pina Producers and Weavers Association, Reycon's Piña Cloth and Industry, and Rurungan sa Tubod Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.philstar.com/youngstar/ysarticle.aspx?articleid=614742&amp;publicationsubcategoryid=84 |title= Rambie Lim: Rurungan sa Tubod Foundation marketing specialist, 'Pipiña' Pioneer, 31 |author=  |date= 24 September 2010 |work= The Philippine Star |publisher= Young Star |accessdate=3 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

A major use for piña fabric is in the creation of the [[Barong Tagalog]] and other formal wear in the [[Philippines]].  It is also used for other table linens, bags, mats and other clothing items, or anytime that a lightweight, but stiff and sheer fabric is needed.

[[Image:PounceSprinkler.JPG|thumb|220px|A ''Pounce pot'' (or sprinkler) at the [[London Science Museum]]]]
'''Pounce''' is a fine powder, most often made from powdered [[cuttlefish bone]], that was used both to dry ink and to sprinkle on a rough writing surface to make it smooth enough for writing. This last was certainly needed if the paper came "[[Sizing|unsized]]", that is, lacking the thin gelatinous material used to fill the surface of the paper and make it smooth enough for writing with a [[quill]] or a [[nib (pen)|steel nib]]. It was also used to prepare the surface when [[Technical drawing|drafting]] with [[Technical pen|Rapidiograph pens]] on mylar, a common drafting medium in the late twentieth century. 

Although some people claim that pounce was never added afterwards to dry ink, this probably represents confusion between the two processes of preparing paper and drying the ink after writing. Experiment shows that using pounce does indeed smooth "unsized" paper but then does little or nothing to dry the ink after you have written on that prepared paper, and it is clearly the case that pouncing or sanding continued long after properly "sized" writing paper came into general use during the nineteenth century. 

The pounce or sand is gently sprinkled all over the writing on the paper. When using a quill or a steel nib, and with inks that are made up to match those typically in use during the 18th or 19th centuries, and provided the pen has been used with the fine strokes typical of handwriting of that period, the handwriting will be sufficiently dry within 10 seconds to allow the paper to be folded without blotting. Gently vibrating the paper whilst the pounce or sand is on it ensures that little or no pounce or sand sticks to the handwriting and excess sand or pounce is shaken off before folding the paper. 

In the 19th century the pounce pots or sanders often had a shallow dish round the top so that pounce or sand could be returned to the pot and reused. The process is very effective for quickly drying ink, and although [[blotting paper]] has been available since Tudor times, pounce or sand continued to be used throughout the nineteenth century because it was often cheaper.

A '''rotary converter''' is a type of [[electrical machine]] which acts as a mechanical [[rectifier]], [[Power inverter|inverter]] or [[frequency converter]]. 

Rotary converters were used to convert [[alternating current]] (AC) to [[direct current]] (DC), or DC to AC power, before the advent of chemical or [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] power rectification and inverting. They were commonly used to provide DC power for commercial, industrial and railway electrification from an AC power source.

Rotary converters are still used as frequency converters.

==Principles of operation==

[[Image:Rotary Converter - Single Phase to DC.png|thumb|400px|Wiring schematic for a simplified [[bipolar field]] [[Gramme ring]] [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] to [[direct current]] rotary converter. (In actual use, the converter is [[drum-wound]] and uses a [[multipolar field]].)&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins Electrical Guide, 2nd Ed. 1917, p. 1459, fig. 2034&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Image:Rotary Converter - Two Phase to DC.png|thumb|400px|Wiring schematic for a simpllfied [[Two-phase electric power|two-phase]] to [[direct current]] rotary converter, with the second phase connected at right angles to the first.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins Electrical Guide, 2nd Ed. 1917, p. 1460, fig. 2035&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Image:Rotary Converter - Three Phase to DC.png|thumb|400px|Wiring schematic for a simpllfied [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] to [[direct current]] rotary converter, with the phases separated by 120 degrees on the commutator.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins Electrical Guide, 2nd Ed. 1917, p. 1461, fig. 2036&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The rotary converter can be thought of as a [[motor-generator]], where the two machines share a single rotating [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] and set of [[field coil]]s. The basic construction of the rotary converter consists of a DC generator (dynamo) with a set of [[slip ring]]s tapped into its rotor windings at evenly spaced intervals. When a dynamo is spun the electric currents in its rotor windings alternate as it rotates in the magnetic field of the stationary field windings. This alternating current is rectified by means of a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] which allows [[DC current]] to be extracted from the rotor. This principle is taken advantage of by energizing the same rotor windings with AC power which causes the machine to act as a synchronous AC motor. The rotation of the energized coils excites the stationary field windings producing part of the DC current. The other part is AC current from the [[slip ring]]s which is directly rectified into DC by the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]]. This makes the rotary converter a hybrid dynamo and mechanical rectifier. When used in this way it is referred to as a synchronous rotary converter or simply a [[synchronous converter]]. The AC slip rings also allow the machine to act as an alternator. 

The device can be reversed and DC applied to the field and commutator windings to spin the machine and produce AC power. When operated as a DC to AC machine it is referred to as an '''inverted rotary converter'''.

One way to envision what is happening in an AC-to-DC rotary converter is to imagine a rotary reversing switch that is being driven at a speed that is synchronous with the power line. Such a switch could [[Rectifier|rectify]] the AC input waveform with no magnetic components at all save those driving the switch.  The rotary converter is somewhat more complex than this trivial case because it delivers near-DC rather than the pulsating DC that would result from just the reversing switch, but the analogy may be helpful in understanding how the rotary converter avoids transforming all of the energy from electrical to mechanical and back to electrical.

The advantage of the rotary converter over the discrete motor-generator set is that the rotary converter avoids converting all of the power flow into mechanical energy and then back into electrical energy; some of the electrical energy instead flows directly from input to output, allowing  the rotary converter to be much smaller and lighter than a motor-generator set of an equivalent power-handling capability.  The advantages of a motor-generator set include adjustable [[voltage regulation]] which can compensate for [[voltage drop]] in the supply network; it also provided complete [[power isolation]], harmonics isolation, greater surge and transient protection, and [[voltage sag|sag (brownout)]] protection through increased momentum.

In this first illustration of a single-phase to direct-current rotary converter, it may be used five different ways:&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins Electrical Guide, 2nd Ed. 1917, p. 1461&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the coil is rotated, alternating currents can be taken from the collector rings, and it is called an [[alternator]].
* if the coil is rotated, direct current can be taken from the commutator, and it is called a [[dynamo]].
* If the coil is rotated, two separate currents can be taken from the armature, one providing direct current and the other providing alternating current. Such a machine is called a ''double current generator''.
* If a direct current is applied to the commutator, the coil will begin to rotate as a [[Brushed DC electric motor|commutated electric motor]] and an alternating current can be taken out of the collector rings. This is called an ''inverted rotary converter'' (see [[Inverter (electrical)|Inverter]]).
* If the machine is brought up to synchronous speed by external means and if the direction of the current through the armature has the correct relationship to the field coils, then the coil will continue to rotate in sychronism with the alternating current as a [[synchronous motor]]. A direct current can be taken from the commutator. When used this way, it is called a ''rotary converter''.

==Applications==
[[Image:Rotary-Converter.jpg|thumb|Railroad Rotary Converter from [[Illinois Railway Museum]]]]
A typical use for an AC/DC converter was for [[Railway electrification system|railway electrification]], where utility power was supplied as alternating current but the trains were designed to work on direct current. Before the invention of [[mercury arc rectifier]]s and high-power [[semiconductor]] [[rectifier]]s, this conversion could only be accomplished using [[motor-generator]]s or rotary converters.

Around 1900 most machinery and appliances were operated by DC power which was provided by rotary converter substations for residential, commercial and industrial consumption. Rotary converters provided high current DC power for industrial [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] processes such as [[electroplating]]. [[Steel mill]]s needed large amounts of on-site DC power for their main roll drive motors. Similarly, [[paper mill]]s and [[printing press]]es required direct current to start and stop their motors in perfect synchronization to prevent tearing the sheet.

==Obsolescence==
AC to DC synchronous rotary converters were made obsolete by [[mercury arc rectifier]]s in the 1930s and later on by semiconductor rectifiers in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Christopher |authorlink= |title=New York's Forgotten Substations: The Power Behind the Subway |url= |accessdate= |year=2002 |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |location= |isbn=978-1568983554}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} Some of the original [[New York City Subway]] substations using synchronous rotary converters operated until 1999.&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt;{{rp|12}} Compared to the rotary converter, the mercury arc and semiconductor rectifiers did not need daily maintenance, manual synchronizing for parallel operation, nor skilled personnel, and they provided clean DC power. This enabled the new substations to be unmanned, only requiring periodic visits from a technician for inspection and maintenance. 

AC replaced DC in most applications and eventually the need for local DC substations diminished along with the need for rotary converters. Many DC customers converted to AC power, and on-site solid-state DC rectifiers were used to power the remaining DC equipment from the AC supply.

==Self-balancing dynamo==
The self-balancing dynamo is of similar construction to the single- and two-phase rotary converter. It was commonly used to create a completely balanced three-wire 120/240-volt DC electrical supply. The AC extracted from the slip rings was fed into a transformer with a single center-tapped winding. The center-tapped winding forms the DC neutral wire. It needed to be driven by a mechanical power source, such as a steam engine, diesel engine, or electric motor. It could be considered a rotary converter used as a double current generator; the AC current was used to balance the DC neutral wire.

'''Slow flight''' is a portion of an [[airplane]]'s [[performance envelope]] above the speed at which the plane will [[Stall (flight)|stall]], but below the aircraft's endurance speed. This part of the performance chart is also known as "the back side of the power curve" because when flying in this area, ''more power is required to fly at a speed lower than the minimum drag speed'' and still maintain straight and level [[flight]]. A large [[angle of attack]] is required in order to maintain the altitude of the aircraft.

At such low speeds, aircraft flight control surfaces begin to lose their effectiveness. [[Aileron]]s, in particular, are susceptible. The [[rudder]] remains the most efficient flight surface and the adverse effect of yaw which alters bank angle is useful for altering the direction of the aircraft without the need for aileron inputs. If the ailerons are used excessively it is probable that one wing will stall (due to the increased angle of attack of the wing with the downward aileron) and send the aircraft into a [[Spin (flight)|spin]]. In modern aircraft, [[flight envelope protection]] in the [[aircraft flight control systems|aircraft flight control system]] prevents a pilot from controlling their aircraft into doing this.

'''Sodium ethyl xanthate''' ('''SEX''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Caroline Cooper|title=Organic Chemist's Desk Reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahbUc5M0I5AC&amp;pg=PA123|accessdate=22 February 2011|date=23 July 2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-1164-1|pages=123 (Acronyms and Miscellaneous Terms used in Describing Organic Molecules)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[organosulfur compound]] with the chemical formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na. It is a pale yellow powder, which is usually obtained as the dihydrate.  Sodium ethyl xanthate is used in the mining industry as a [[Froth flotation|flotation agent]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Kathrin-Maria Roy|title=Xanthates|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher= Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a28_423}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A closely related potassium ethyl xanthate (KEX) is obtained as the anhydrous salt.

==Production==
As with most [[xanthate]]s, sodium ethyl xanthate can be prepared by treating [[sodium ethoxide]] with [[carbon disulfide]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ingram, G.; Toms, B. A.|title=The reactions of sodium ethyl xanthate with ethanol and with water. |journal=Journal of the Chemical Society (Resumed)|year=1961|pages=117-127|doi=10.1039/JR9610000117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONa  +  CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na

==Properties==
Sodium ethyl xanthate is a pale yellow powder. It is relatively stable in water at high pH if not heated. It rapidly hydrolyses at pH &lt;9 at 25 °C. It is the conjugate base of the unknown strong acid with p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.6 and p''K''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; estimated as 12.4 for the [[Conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. Sodium ethyl xanthate easily adsorbs on the surface of solid sulfides.&lt;ref name=r5p6&gt;Report 5 (1995) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Decomposition in water===
Xanthate are susceptible to hydrolysis and oxidation:&lt;ref name=r5p14&gt;Report 5 (1995) pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hydrolysis at low pH:
:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  → C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH  + CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxidation by oxygen:
:2 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 1/2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

These reactions require acidic conditions.

==Detection==
Sodium ethyl xanthate can be identified through optical absorption peaks in the infrared (1179, 1160, 1115, 1085 cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ultraviolet (300 nm) ranges. There are at least six chemical detection methods: 

#''Iodometric method '' relies on oxidation to dixanthogen by iodine, with the product detected with a starch indicator. This method is however is not selective and suffers from interferences with other sulfur-containing chemicals.&lt;ref name=r5p8&gt;Report 5 (1995) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Xanthate can be reacted with a [[copper sulfate]] or [[copper tartrate]] resulting in a copper xanthate residue which is detected with iodine. This method has an advantage of being is insensitive to sulfite, thiosulfate and carbonate impurities.&lt;ref name=r5p9/&gt;
#In the ''acid-base detection method'', a dilute aqueous xanthate solution is reacted with a copious amount of 0.01 M [[hydrochloric acid]] yielding carbon disulfide and alcohol, which are evaluated. The excess acid and impurities are removed through filtering and titration.&lt;ref name=r5p9&gt;Report 5 (1995) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
#In the ''argentometric method'', sodium ethyl xanthate is reacted with [[silver nitrate]] in a dilute solution. The resulted silver xanthate is detected with 10% aqueous solution of [[iron nitrate]]. The drawbacks of this method are high cost of silver and blackening of silver xanthate by silver nitrate that reduces the detection accuracy.&lt;ref name=r5p9/&gt;
#In the ''mercurimetric method'', xanthate is dissolved in 40% aqueous solution of dimethylamine, followed by heating and titration with ''O''-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The product is detected with [[thiofluorescein]].&lt;ref name=r5p9/&gt;
#''Perchloric acid method'' involves dissolution of xanthate in water-free [[acetic acid]]. The product is titrated with [[perchloric acid]] and detected with [[crystal violet]].&lt;ref name=r5p9/&gt;

Sodium ethyl xanthate can also be quantified using [[Gravimetric analysis|gravimetry]], by weighing the lead xanthate residue obtained after reacting SEX with 10% solution of [[lead nitrate]]. There are also several [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] detection methods, which can be combined with some of the above chemical techniques.&lt;ref name=r5p9/&gt;

==Applications==
Sodium ethyl xanthate is predominantly used in the mining industry as [[Froth flotation|flotation agent]] for recovery of metals, such as copper, nickel, silver or gold, as well as solid metal sulfides or oxides from ore [[slurry|slurries]]. This application was introduced by Cornelius H. Keller in 1925. Other applications include [[defoliant]], [[herbicide]] and an additive to rubber to protect it against oxygen and ozone.&lt;ref name=r5p2&gt;Report 5 (1995), p. 2, citing Rao, R.S., “Xanthates and Related Compounds”, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1971 {{ISBN|0-8247-1563-2}} and Keller, C.H. (1925) {{US Patent|1554216}} "Concentration of gold, sulphide minerals and uranium oxide minerals by flotation from ores and metallurgical plant products"&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism of flotation enhancement is as follows. The polar part of xanthate molecule attaches to the ore particles with the non-polar hydrocarbon part sticking out and forming a hydrophobic layer. Then the particles are brought to the water surface by air bubbles. Only a small amount of about 300 g/tonne of ore is required for efficient separation. The efficiency of the hydrophobic action increases, but the selectivity to ore type decreases with increasing length of the hydrocarbon chain in xanthates. The chain is shortest in sodium ethyl xanthate that makes it highly selective to copper, nickel, lead, gold and zinc ores. Aqueous solutions (10%) with pH=7–11 are normally used in the process.&lt;ref name=r5p13&gt;Report 5 (1995) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Australia produced up to 10,000 [[tonne]]s of sodium ethyl xanthate and imported about 6,000 tonnes, mostly from China.&lt;ref&gt;Report 5s (2000) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The material produced in Australia is the so-called 'liquid sodium ethyl xanthate' that refers to a 40% aqueous solution of the solid.&lt;ref&gt;Report 5s (2000) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It is obtained by reacting carbon disulfide with sodium hydroxide and ethanol in a closed process.&lt;ref name=5spv/&gt; Its density is 1.2 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the freezing point is −6 °C.&lt;ref&gt;Report 5s (2000) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Sodium ethyl xanthate has moderate oral and dermal toxicity in animals and is irritating to eyes and skin.&lt;ref name=5spv&gt;Report 5s (2000) p. v&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially toxic to aquatic life and therefore its disposal is strictly controlled.&lt;ref name=r5p43&gt;Report 5 (1995) pp. 43–45&lt;/ref&gt; Median lethal dose for (male albino mice, oral, 10% solution at pH~11) is 730 mg/kg of body weight, with most deaths occurring in the first day. The most affected organs were the central nervous system, liver and [[spleen]].&lt;ref name=r5p17&gt;Report 5 (1995) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1993, sodium ethyl xanthate is classified as a Priority Existing Chemical in Australia, meaning that its manufacture, handling, storage, use or disposal may result in adverse health or environment effects. This decision was justified by the widespread use of the chemical in industry and its decomposition to the toxic and flammable carbon disulfide gas. From two examples of sodium ethyl xanthate spillage in Australia, one resulted in evacuation of 100 people and hospitalization of 6 workers who were exposed to the fumes. In another accident, residents of the spillage area complained of headache, dizziness and nausea.&lt;ref name=r5p1&gt;Report 5 (1995) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, during high-risk sodium ethyl xanthate handling operations, workers are required by the Australian regulations to be equipped with protective clothing, anti-static gloves, boots and full-face [[respirator]]s or [[self-contained breathing apparatus]].&lt;ref&gt;Report 5s (2000) p. vi&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strip-built''' is a method of [[boat building]] commonly used for [[canoe]]s and [[kayak]]s, but also suitable for larger [[boat]]s. The process involves securing narrow, flexible strips of wood edge-to-edge around temporary forms.

These are the most popular among boatbuilders. Some professional builders also offer both kits and finished boats. The canoes are constructed by gluing together 1/4" x 3/4" strips of wood over a building jig consisting of station molds that define the shape of the hull. The forms are cut as a series of cross-sections of the final design and set up along a "strong back" or other solid base.[[Image:strip-built-canoe-hull.jpg|thumb|right|Cedar-strip canoe hull fabrication in process]] The strips are shaped with bead and cove router bits. Stripping begins at the sheer line and finishes with "the football". The strips are edge-glued to each other, being held in place with nails, staples, or simply clamped to the forms. Once the strips are glued together, and the staples/nails removed, the inside and outside are sanded fair. Fiberglass and epoxy is applied to the canoe inside and out. The fiberglass covering is transparent, waterproof, and allowing the wood strips to be seen. The strips are usually cedar, but can be any type of wood. Contrasting woods are sometimes used as accent strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compumarine.com/how.htm |title=How to build a cedar strip canoe |publisher=Compumarine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last steps in construction is to install the seats, thwarts, and gunwales. Finally a coat of marine grade polyurethane is applied to protect the wood and epoxy from ultraviolet light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Canoecraft: An Illustrated Guide to Fine Woodstrip Construction|last = Moores|first = Ted|publisher = Firefly Books; Revised &amp; enlarged edition|year = 2007|isbn = 1552093425|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, this process for building canoes was adapted from ship/boat building techniques, and refined by a group of Minnesota canoe racers; primarily Eugene Jensen, Irwin C.(Buzzy) Peterson, and Karl Ketter.This process is similarly suited to building kayaks.

== Description ==
The name of the 1955 [[General Motors Motorama]] car show where Cobb's model car was shown was [https://web.archive.org/web/20110816012239/http://viewlinerltd.blogspot.com/2008/12/1955-general-motors-powerama-exhibit.html General Motors Powerama].&lt;ref name="History.com"/&gt; General Motors at the time said the car that showed futuristic capabilities was not practical because even if the [[solar cells]] ran at 100% efficiency they would only produce 12 horse-power, not enough to propel an average automobile of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Popular Science]], October 1955, Vol. 167, No. 4, ISSN 0161-7370, Published by Bonnier Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobb showed and introduced the field of [[photovoltaics]] to a car show that had over 2,000,000 visitors. At the time all automobiles were run by gasoline engines. Cobb's Sunmobile model had 12 selenium photoelectric cells on top of a [[balsa wood]] body. These [[solar cells]] were connected in series-parallel and converted the sun light directly into electricity, which in turn ran a small low-inertia electric motor. The motor rotated at 2000 r.p.m. and ran on 1.5 volts. The motor's energy in turn was transferred to the  model car's [[drive shaft]], which then in turn transferred the energy through its rear axle by a [[pulley]] to the car's wheels which moved the car forward.&lt;ref name="Feb1957"&gt;Popular Mechanics, Feb 1957, Vol. 107, No. 2, p. 233, Published by Hearst Magazines, ISSN 0032-4558&lt;/ref&gt;

The model car balsa wood body was in five sections. It had two center sections that were hollowed out to receive a pine chassis, the electric motor, and the drive mechanism. There were precision gears from the electric motor to the wheels. They had a 3 to 1 ratio, with the smallest gear on the motor and the larger gear on the drive mechanism that propelled the rear wheels. These gears were connected with a ladder-type chain connected to their sprockets. The rubber tires, obtained at a hobby shop, were one and a half inches in diameter. The rear axle was one-eighth inch in diameter. The wiring for the solar cells to the electric motor was by standard No. 20 insulated stranded copper wire.&lt;ref name="Feb1957"/&gt;

A '''tactile transducer''' or "'''bass shaker'''" is a device which is made on the principle that low [[bassline|bass]] frequencies can be felt as well as heard. They can be compared with a common loudspeaker, just that the diaphragm is missing. Instead, another object is used as a diaphragm. A shaker transmits low-frequency vibrations into various surfaces so that they can be felt by people. This is called tactile sound. Tactile transducers may augment or in some cases substitute for a [[subwoofer]]. One benefit of tactile transducers is they produce little or no noise, if properly installed, as compared with a subwoofer speaker enclosure.

==Applications==
A bass-shaker is meant to be firmly attached to some surface such as a seat, couch or floor. The shaker houses a small weight which is driven by a [[voice coil]] similar to those found in dynamic loudspeakers. The voice-coil is driven by a low-frequency audio signal from an [[amplifier]]; common shakers typically handle 25 to 50 [[watt]]s of amplifier power. The voice coil exerts force on both the weight and the body of the shaker, with the latter forces being transmitted into the mounting surface. Tactile transducers may be used in a [[home cinema|home theater]], a video gaming chair or controller, a commercial movie theater, or for special effects in an [[arcade game]], [[amusement park]] ride or other application.

Related to bass shakers are a newer type of transducer referred to as [[linear actuator]]s. These piston-like electromagnetic devices transmit motion in a direct fashion by lifting home theater seating in the vertical plane rather than transferring vibrations (by mounting within a seat, platform or floor). This technology is said to transmit a high-fidelity sound-motion augmentation, whereas "Shakers" may require heavy equalization and/or multiple units to approach a realistic effect. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Virtual reality===
There are other products which employ hydraulic (long-throw) linear actuators and outboard motion processors for home applications as popularized in "virtual reality" rides. These products differ radically from tactile transducers in that they require the manual composition and synchronized playback of motion signals, in addition to the standard soundtrack that the motion is meant to accompany.

==Designs==
Various designs for tactile transducers have been presented since the 1960s, most of which fall under the "shaker" category. Shakers create a vigorous vibration by moving a mass (usually a magnet) which is bolted to a final mass (like a chair or couch). A simple example of this is the vibration available on a common cellphone. Another way of producing tactile sound uses "linear actuators", which move furniture (usually up and down), rather than shaking it. The main advantage of linear actuators is that they deliver actual motion (ground excursion), not just vibration.

In the 2010s, tactile sound transducers have evolved to include higher frequencies and produce higher fidelity.  The human tactile frequency range is from 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, very low frequency such as earthquakes, up to 5&amp;nbsp;kHz in some hearing impaired individuals. For most individuals 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;kHz is the upper threshold for tactile reception.  These 2010s-era devices must have higher resolution than previous "shakers" to produce these frequencies. Most humans have tactile resolution to 2&amp;nbsp;Hz which is the smallest change in frequency that can be perceived. The primary use for this extended bandwidth is to reproduce the vibratory signature for musical instruments such as violins, guitars, the human voice or sound effects in movies (for example, the speeders in ''[[Star Wars]]''). Also higher frequencies may be used to augment hearing through bone conduction, a consideration for people who have compromised their hearing from exposure to loud music.

Tactile sound is often used to increase the realism of an artificial environment. For example, mounting a tactile sound transducer in a chair or couch in a [[home cinema]] or video game setup can give more of a sense of "being there". For such use, the transducer is often connected to the [[Low-frequency effects|LFE]] channel of an A/V receiver.  Tactile sound is often used in combination with a [[subwoofer]] so that low frequencies can be both felt and heard.  To facilitate broadband tactile sound, all channels are summed to provide a full range signal to the transducer amplifier. Graphic equalizers can also be used to further modify the effect.

==In music==
For musical performance, drummers will often use a tactile sound transducer mounted on their drum stool so they can "feel" themselves playing, rather than using a more conventional stage [[Loudspeaker|monitor]]. The size and power of a stage monitor required to adequately reproduce low frequency drum sounds would be expensive and hard to transport, while a tactile sound transducer can be rather small and require much less power to get the job done. As well, sound engineers may prefer a tactile transducer over a loud, powerful subwoofer monitor cabinet, because a monitor speaker may produce a lot of stage volume.

[[Nicolas Collins]] describes several tactile transducers, including some wide-range drivers, which are able to transmit a broader frequency spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/255142630|title=Handmade electronic music : the art of hardware hacking|last=Nicolas.|first=Collins,|isbn=9780415998734|edition= Second |location=New York|oclc=255142630}} 51 - 53&lt;/ref&gt; The composer [[David Tudor]] used tactile transducers in his work ''Rainforest'' (1968). He used "Rolen-Star" wide-range drivers to create all kinds of different loudspeaker sculptures. The tactile transducers are attached to large objects such as metal buckets and bring these objects in vibration. The vibrations of these sculptures are then picked up by contact microphones and amplified through a common loudspeaker system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Driscoll|first=John|last2=Rogalsky|first2=Matt|date=2004|title=David Tudor’s "Rainforest": An Evolving Exploration of Resonance|url=|journal=Leonardo Music Journal|volume=14|pages=25–30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent examples can be found in the work of Sabrina Schroeder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956959221|title=Between air and electricity : microphones and loudspeakers as musical instruments|last=van,|first=Eck, Cathy|isbn=9781501327605|location=New York|oclc=956959221}} 116 - 117&lt;/ref&gt; who places tactile transducers on bass drums.

[[Image:Flory och Elin.jpg|thumb|Tandem bicycle]]
'''Tandem''', or '''in tandem''', is an arrangement in which a team of machines, animals or people are lined up one behind another, all facing in the same direction.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|Tandem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original use of the term in [[English language|English]] was in ''tandem harness'',{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} which is used for two or more [[draft horse]]s, or other [[Working animal|draft animal]]s, harnessed in a single line one behind another, as opposed to a pair, harnessed side by side, or a team of several pairs.  The tandem harness allows additional animals to provide pulling power for a vehicle designed for a single animal.

The English word ''tandem'' derives with a [[word play]] from the [[Latin]] [[adverb]] {{Lang|la|tandem}}, meaning ''at length'' or ''finally''.&lt;ref name=Wordinfo.com&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/2083 | title = Tandem | publisher = Wordinfo.com | accessdate = 2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tandem seating may be used on a [[tandem bicycle]] where it is alternative to [[sociable]] seating.  ''Tandem'' can also be used more generally to refer to any group of persons or objects working together, not necessarily in line.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;

==Automobiles==
[[File:Messerschmitt Kabinenroller Microcar.jpg|thumb|left|Messerschmitt KR200 Kabrio; the folding top replaces the bubble in this version.]]
The [[Messerschmitt KR200]] was an example of a very small automobile that used tandem seating. A tandem arrangement may also be used for cars [[Parking#Modes of parking|parked]] in a [[Garage (residential)|residential garage]].

==Trucks==
In heavy trucks tandem refers to two closely spaced axles. Legally defined by the distance between the axles (up to {{convert|2.5|m|ftin|frac=8|abbr=on}} in the European Union, {{convert|40|–|96|in|m|2}}&lt;!-- lower limit questionable --&gt; in the United States), mechanically there are many configurations. Either or both axles may be powered, and often interact with each other. In the United States both axles are typically powered and equalized, in the European Union one axle is typically unpowered, and can often be adjusted to load, and even raised off the ground, turning a tandem into a single-[[axle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Vehicle%20Std%20Leg/Vehicle%20regs/Weights_Dimensions_Leaflet.pdf|title=Guidelines on Maximum Weights…Criteria|publisher=Road Safety Authority|date=2013|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/publications/brdg_frm_wghts/index.htm|title=Freight Management and Operations: Bridge Formula Weights|last=Federal Highway Administration|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation |date=2006|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Navy 061017-N-7130B-030 An instructor pilot is joined by his student in the cockpit of a T-45A Goshawk on the flight deck aboard the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|Instructor and student pilots in a [[McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk]] aircraft]]
The two seating configurations for trainer, night and all-weather interceptor or attack aircraft are pilot and instructor side by side or in tandem. Usually, the pilot is in front and the instructor behind. In attack helicopters, sometimes the pilot sits in back with the weapons operator in front for better view to aim weapons, as the [[Bell AH-1 Cobra]] was a tandem cockpit redesign which produced a much slimmer profile than the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] on which it was based. Attack aircraft and all-weather interceptors often use a second crew member to operate avionics such as radar, or as a second pilot. Bombers such as the [[Convair B-58 Hustler]] seated three crew members in tandem. A common engineering adaptation is to lengthen the cockpit or fuselage to create a trainer with tandem seating from a single-seater aircraft.

=== {{Visible anchor|Side-by-side seating}} ===&lt;!-- Other articles link here. --&gt;
[[File:Hunter and meteor at kemble arp.jpg|thumb|Tandem seat [[Gloster Meteor]] and side-by-side seat [[Hawker Hunter]] (trainer)]]
An alternative configuration is side-by-side seating, which is common in civil aircraft of all sizes, [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainers]] and large military aircraft, but less so in high performance jets and [[glider (sailplane)|gliders]] where drag reduction is paramount. The [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] and [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress#Design effort|Boeing XB-52]] bombers used fighter-style tandem seating, but the final [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bomber series used a conventional side-by-side cockpit. The [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]], [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]], [[Sukhoi Su-24]] or the [[Sukhoi Su-34]] are examples of combat aircraft that use this configuration. For training aircraft, it has the advantage that pilot and instructor can see each other's actions, allowing the pilot to learn from the instructor and the instructor to correct the student pilot. The tandem configuration has the advantage of being closer to the normal working environment that a fast jet pilot is likely to encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://testrakeaviation.editme.com/tandem-seat |title=Why Tandem Seating in the SGT-300? |date=2010-03-15   |accessdate= |work=testrakeaviation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, such as the [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler]], a two-place aircraft can be lengthened into a four-place aircraft. Also, a single seat cockpit can be redesigned into a side-by-side arrangement in the case of the [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider]], [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|TF-102]] trainer or the [[Hawker Hunter]] training versions.

'''The Energy and Resources Institute''' (TERI) is a [[research institute]] based in [[New Delhi]] that conducts research work in the fields of energy, environment and sustainable development. Established in 1974, it was formerly known as Tata Energy and Research Institute.  As the scope of its activities widened, it was renamed The Energy and Resources Institute in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/teri-stays-teri-but-says-ta-ta-to-tata/70815/|title=Teri Stays Teri, But Says Ta-Ta To Tata|date=|publisher=Financialexpress.com|accessdate=2003-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bombay House, Tata Group Headquarters in Mumbai.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bombay House]] the head office of Tata Group from where TERI started operations]]

The origins of TERI lie in [[Mithapur]], a remote town in [[Gujarat]], where a TATA engineer, Darbari Seth, was concerned about the enormous quantities of energy his factory spent on [[desalination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/teri-championing-the-green-alternative/articleshow/5420185.cms?from=mdr |title=Championing the green alternative |publisher=Economic Times |date=2 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the idea of a research institute to tackle the depletion of natural resources and energy scarcity. [[J. R. D. Tata]], chairman of the [[Tata Group|TATA Group]], liked the idea and accepted the proposal. TERI was set up with a modest corpus of 35 million rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.teriin.org/themes/teriday/pdf/5-DSMLecture2006Fifth.pdf |title=Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture 2006 | date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the invitation of the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], TERI was registered in Delhi in 1974 as the Tata Energy Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://envfor.nic.in/envis/compendium/21-teri.pdf |title=ENVIS Centre on Renewable Energy and Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
TERI initially began its operations in the [[Bombay House]], Mumbai, headquarters  of [[Tata Group|Tata]]. In 1984, it moved to Delhi where it continued to operate out on the rented premises (which included the [[India International Centre]] ) for almost a decade. In 1993, the organization set up its permanent base in Darbari Seth Block, named after its founder, in the [[India Habitat Centre]] complex located at Lodhi Road, New Delhi. Today TERI has a global presence with many centres in India and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teriin.org/network-linkages | title=Location and Linkages - TERI | date=15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''trihydrogen cation''', also known as '''protonated molecular hydrogen''' or '''{{chem|H|3|+}}''', is one of the most abundant [[ion]]s in the universe. It is stable in the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) due to the low temperature and low density of interstellar space. The role that {{chem|H|3|+}} plays in the gas-phase chemistry of the ISM is unparalleled by any other molecular ion. The [[cation]] is also the simplest triatomic [[molecule]], since its two electrons are the only valence electrons in the system. It is also the simplest example of a [[three-center two-electron bond]] system.

==History==
{{chem|H|3|+}} was first discovered by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="elecrays"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=J. J. |date=1913 |title=Rays of Positive Electricity |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=89 |issue=607 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1913.0057 |bibcode = 1913RSPSA..89....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying the resultant species of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] discharges, he discovered something very odd. Using an early form of [[mass spectrometry]], he discovered a large abundance of a [[molecular]] ion with a [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of 3. He stated that the only two possibilities were C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; or {{chem|H|3|+}}. Since C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; would be very unlikely and the signal grew stronger in pure [[hydrogen]] gas, he correctly assigned the species as {{chem|H|3|+}}.

The formation pathway was discovered by Hogness &amp; Lunn in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogness |first=T. R. |author2=Lunn, E. G. |date=1925 |title=The Ionization of Hydrogen by Electron Impact as Interpreted by Positive Ray Analysis |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=44–55 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.26.44 |bibcode = 1925PhRv...26...44H }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also used an early form of mass spectrometry to study hydrogen discharges. They found that as the pressure of hydrogen increased, the amount of {{chem|H|3|+}} increased linearly and the amount of {{chem|H|2|+}} decreased linearly. In addition, there was little H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at any pressure. This data suggested the [[proton]] exchange formation pathway discussed below.

In 1961, Martin ''et al.'' first suggested that {{chem|H|3|+}} may be present in interstellar space given the large amount of hydrogen in interstellar space and its reaction pathway was [[exothermic]] (~1.5&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]]).&lt;ref name="occurrence"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=D. W. |author2=McDaniel, E. W. |author3=Meeks, M. L. |date=1961 |title=On the Possible Occurrence of {{chem|H|3|+}} in Interstellar Space |journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=134 |page=1012 |doi= 10.1086/147232|bibcode=1961ApJ...134.1012M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the suggestion of Watson and Herbst &amp; Klemperer in 1973 that {{chem|H|3|+}} is responsible for the formation of many observed molecular ions.&lt;ref name="Watson1973"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=W. D. |date=1973 |title=The Rate of Formation of Interstellar Molecules by Ion-Molecule Reactions |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=183 |issue=2 |pages=L17 |doi=10.1086/181242 |bibcode=1973ApJ...183L..17W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herbst |first=E. |author2=Klemperer, W. |date=1973 |title=The Formation and Depletion of Molecules in Dense Interstellar Clouds |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=185 |page=505 |doi=10.1086/152436 |bibcode=1973ApJ...185..505H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1980 that the first spectrum of {{chem|H|3|+}} was discovered by Takeshi Oka,&lt;ref name="Oka1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oka |first=T. |date=1980 |title=Observation of the Infrared Spectrum of {{chem|H|3|+}} |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=45 |issue= 7|pages=531–534 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.531 |bibcode=1980PhRvL..45..531O}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was of the ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fundamental band using a technique called [[frequency modulation]] detection. This started the search for interstellar {{chem|H|3|+}}. [[Emission line]]s were detected in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the [[ionosphere]]s of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and [[Uranus]].&lt;ref name="Drossart1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drossart |first=P. |display-authors=etal |date=1989 |title=Detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} on Jupiter |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=340 |issue=6234 |page=539 |doi=10.1038/340539a0 |bibcode = 1989Natur.340..539D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geballe1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geballe |first=T.

In 1996, {{chem|H|3|+}} was finally detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) by Geballe &amp; Oka in two molecular [[interstellar clouds]] in the sightlines GL2136 and W33A.&lt;ref name="Geballe1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geballe |first=T.

== Structure ==
[[File:H3cation struct.png|thumb|right|150px|The structure of {{chem|H|3|+}}]]
[[File:Trihydrogen-cation-MO-diagram.svg|thumb|380px|The [[MO diagram]] of the trihydrogen cation.]]
The three hydrogen atoms in the molecule form an [[equilateral triangle]], with a [[bond length]] of 0.90&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] on each side. The bonding among the atoms is a [[three-center two-electron bond|three-centre two-electron bond]], a [[delocalized]] resonance hybrid type of structure. The strength of the bond has been calculated to be around 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] (104&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCall |first=B. J. |display-authors=etal |date=2004 |title=Dissociative Recombination of Rotationally Cold {{chem|H|3|+}} |journal=Physical Review A |volume=70 |issue=5 |page=052716 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.70.052716 |bibcode = 2004PhRvA..70e2716M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
&lt;!--The information for this section was from a paper by Eric Herbst.--&gt;The main pathway for the production of {{chem|H|3|+}} is by the reaction of [[Dihydrogen cation|{{chem|H|2|+}}]] and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herbst |first=E. |date=2000 |title=The Astrochemistry of {{chem|H|3|+}} |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]]|volume=358 |issue=1774 |pages=2523–2534 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2000.0665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{chem|H|2|+}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|H|3|+}} + H

The concentration of {{chem|H|2|+}} is what limits the rate of this reaction in nature: the only known natural source of it is via ionization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by a [[cosmic ray]] in interstellar space by the ionization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + cosmic ray → {{chem|H|2|+}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + cosmic ray

The cosmic ray has so much energy, it is almost unaffected by the relatively small energy transferred to the hydrogen when ionizing an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule. In interstellar clouds, cosmic rays leave behind a trail of {{chem|H|2|+}}, and therefore {{chem|H|3|+}}. In laboratories, {{chem|H|3|+}} is produced by the same mechanism in plasma discharge cells, with the discharge potential providing the energy to ionize the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Destruction==
The information for this section was also from a paper by Eric Herbst.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro" /&gt; There are many destruction reactions for {{chem|H|3|+}}. The dominant destruction pathway in dense interstellar clouds is by proton transfer with a neutral collision partner. The most likely candidate for a destructive collision partner is the second most abundant molecule in space, [[carbon monoxide|CO]].

:{{chem|H|3|+}} + CO → HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The significant product of this reaction is HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, an important molecule for interstellar chemistry. Its strong [[dipole]] and high abundance make it easily detectable by [[radioastronomy]]. {{chem|H|3|+}} can also react with atomic [[oxygen]] to form OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

:{{chem|H|3|+}} + O → OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; then usually reacts with more H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create further [[hydrogenate]]d molecules.

:OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|OH|2|+}} + H
:{{chem|OH|2|+}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Hydronium|{{chem|OH|3|+}}]] + H

At this point, the reaction between {{chem|OH|3|+}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is no longer exothermic in interstellar clouds. The most common destruction pathway for {{chem|OH|3|+}} is [[dissociative recombination]], yielding four possible sets of products: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H, OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, OH + 2H, and O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H. While [[water]] is a possible product of this reaction, it is not a very efficient product. Different experiments have suggested that water is created anywhere from 5–33% of the time. Water formation on [[cosmic dust|grains]] is still considered the primary source of water in the interstellar medium.

The most common destruction pathway of {{chem|H|3|+}} in diffuse interstellar clouds is dissociative recombination. This reaction has multiple products. The major product is dissociation into three hydrogen atoms, which occurs roughly 75% of the time. The minor product is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H, which occurs roughly 25% of the time.

==Ortho/Para-H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;==
[[Image:H3+&amp;H2.svg|thumb|350px|A collision of ortho-{{chem|H|3|+}} and para-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
The most abundant molecule in dense interstellar clouds is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When a {{chem|H|3|+}} molecule collides with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, stoichiometrically there is no net yield. However, a proton transfer still can take place, which can potentially change the total [[spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] of the two molecules depending on the nuclear spins of the protons. Two different spin configurations for {{chem|H|3|+}} are possible, called ortho and para. Ortho-{{chem|H|3|+}} has all three proton spins parallel, yielding a total nuclear spin of {{sfrac|3|2}}. Para-{{chem|H|3|+}} has two proton spins parallel while the other is anti-parallel, yielding a total nuclear spin of {{sfrac|1|2}}. Similarly, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also has [[Spin isomers of hydrogen|ortho and para states]], with ortho-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; having a total nuclear spin 1 and para-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; having a total nuclear spin of 0. When an ortho-{{chem|H|3|+}} and a para-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; collide, the transferred proton changes the total spins of the molecules, yielding instead a para-{{chem|H|3|+}} and an ortho-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro" /&gt;

==Spectroscopy==
The [[spectroscopy]] of {{chem|H|3|+}} is challenging. The pure rotational spectrum is exceedingly weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.K.G | year = 1971 | title = Forbidden rotational spectra of polyatomic molecules | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 546–544 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(71)90255-4 | bibcode = 1971JMoSp..40..536W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultraviolet light is too energetic and would dissociate the molecule. [[Rovibronic excitation|Rovibronic]] (Infrared) spectroscopy provides the ability to observe {{chem|H|3|+}}. Rovibronic spectroscopy is possible with {{chem|H|3|+}} because one of the [[normal mode|vibrational modes]] of {{chem|H|3|+}}, the ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; asymmetric bend mode, has a weak transition dipole moment. Since Oka's initial spectrum,&lt;ref name="Oka1980" /&gt; over 900 [[Absorption spectroscopy|absorption]] lines have been detected in the infrared region. {{chem|H|3|+}} emission lines have also been found by observing the atmospheres of the Jovian planets. {{chem|H|3|+}} emission lines are found by observing molecular hydrogen and finding a line that cannot be attributed to molecular hydrogen.

==Astronomical detection==
{{chem|H|3|+}} has been detected in two types of celestial environments: Jovian planets and interstellar clouds. In Jovian planets, it has been detected in the planet's ionospheres, the region where the Sun's high energy radiation ionizes the particles in the atmosphere. Since there is a high level of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in these atmospheres, this radiation can produce a significant amount of {{chem|H|3|+}}. Also, with a broadband source like the Sun, there is plenty of radiation to pump the {{chem|H|3|+}} to higher energy states from which it can relax by stimulated and spontaneous emission.

===Planetary atmospheres===
The detection of the first {{chem|H|3|+}} emission lines was reported in 1989 by Drossart ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="Drossart1989" /&gt; found in the ionosphere of Jupiter. Drossart found a total of 23 {{chem|H|3|+}} lines with a column density of 1.39{{e|9}}/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Using these lines, they were able to assign a temperature to the {{chem|H|3|+}} of around {{convert|1100|K|°C|abbr=on}}, which is comparable to temperatures determined from emission lines of other species like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In 1993, {{chem|H|3|+}} was found in Saturn by Geballe ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Geballe1993" /&gt; and in Uranus by Trafton ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Trafton1993" /&gt;

===Molecular interstellar clouds===
{{chem|H|3|+}} was not detected in the interstellar medium until 1996, when Geballe &amp; Oka reported the detection of {{chem|H|3|+}} in two molecular cloud sightlines, GL2136 and W33A.&lt;ref name="Geballe1996" /&gt; Both sources had temperatures of {{chem|H|3|+}} of about {{convert|35|K|°C|0|abbr=on}} and column densities of about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since then, {{chem|H|3|+}} has been detected in numerous other molecular cloud sightlines, such as AFGL 2136,&lt;ref name="McCall1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCall|first=B. J.|display-authors=etal |date=1999|title=Observations of {{chem|H|3|+}} in Dense Molecular Clouds|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=522|issue=1|pages=338–348|doi=10.1086/307637|bibcode=1999ApJ...522..338M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mon R2 IRS 3,&lt;ref name="McCall1999" /&gt; GCS 3-2,&lt;ref name="mgoto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goto|first=M.|display-authors=etal |date=2002|title=Absorption Line Survey of {{chem|H|3|+}} toward the Galactic Center Sources I. GCS 3-2 and GC IRS3|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan|volume=54Àissue=6|page=951}}&lt;/ref&gt; GC IRS 3,&lt;ref name="mgoto" /&gt; and LkHα 101.&lt;ref name="Brittain2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brittain|first=S.

===Diffuse interstellar clouds===
Unexpectedly, three {{chem|H|3|+}} lines were detected in 1998 by McCall ''et al.'' in the diffuse cloud sightline of Cyg OB2 No. 12.&lt;ref name="McCall1998" /&gt; Before 1998, the density of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was thought to be too low to produce a detectable amount of {{chem|H|3|+}}. McCall detected a temperature of ~{{convert|27|K|°C|0|abbr=on}} and a column density of ~10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the same column density as Geballe &amp; Oka. Since then, {{chem|H|3|+}} has been detected in many other diffuse cloud sightlines, such as GCS 3-2,&lt;ref name="mgoto" /&gt; GC IRS 3,&lt;ref name="mgoto" /&gt; and ζ Persei.&lt;ref name="McCall2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCall|first=B. J.|display-authors=etal |date=2003|title=An Enhanced Cosmic-ray Flux towards ζ Persei Inferred from a Laboratory Study of the {{chem|H|3|+}}-e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Recombination Rate|journal=Nature|volume=422|issue=6931|doi=10.1038/nature01498|pmid=12673244|arxiv = astro-ph/0302106 |bibcode = 2003Natur.422..500M|pages=500–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steady-state model predictions===
To approximate the pathlength of {{chem|H|3|+}} in these clouds, Oka&lt;ref name="Oka2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oka|first=T.|date=2006|title=Interstellar H3+|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]|volume=103|issue=33|pages=12235–12242|doi=10.1073/pnas.0601242103|pmid=16894171|pmc=1567864|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10312235O }}&lt;/ref&gt; used the steady-state model to determine the predicted number densities in diffuse and dense clouds. As explained above, both diffuse and dense clouds have the same formation mechanism for {{chem|H|3|+}}, but different dominating destruction mechanisms. In dense clouds, proton transfer with CO is the dominating destruction mechanism. This corresponds to a predicted number density of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in dense clouds.
:''n''({{chem|H|3|+}}) = (''ζ'' / ''k''&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;)[''n''(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''n''(CO)] ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:''n''({{chem|H|3|+}}) = (''ζ'' / ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;)[''n''(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''n''(C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)] ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
In diffuse clouds, the dominating destruction mechanism is dissociative recombination. This corresponds to a predicted number density of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in diffuse clouds. Therefore, since column densities for diffuse and dense clouds are roughly the same order of magnitude, diffuse clouds must have a pathlength 100 times greater than that for dense clouds. Therefore, by using {{chem|H|3|+}} as a probe of these clouds, their relative sizes can be determined.

==Location==

Tullygarran Ogham Stones are located {{Convert|4.2|km}} east of [[Tralee]], near to Chute Hall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.megalithicireland.com/Tullygarran%20Ogham%20Stones%20Kerry.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landedestates.nuigalway.ie/LandedEstates/jsp/property-show.jsp?id=1918|title=Chute Hall|website=landedestates.nuigalway.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The stones were discovered in 1848 after a storm uncovered an ancient burial ground overlooking [[Smerwick]] Bay. [[Dayrolles Eveleigh-de-Moleyns, 4th Baron Ventry]] moved them to his home at Chute Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=AMTUAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Tullygarran+ogham&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Tullygarran|title=The national monuments of the Irish Free State|first=Irish Free|last=State|date=9 September 2017|publisher=Stationery Office|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wicker''' is a technique for making products woven from any one of a variety of cane-like materials, a generic name for the materials used in such manufacture, and a term for the items so produced. The word ''wicker'' is believed to be of Scandinavian origin: ''vika'' which means to bend in Swedish, and ''vikker'' meaning willow.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{Citation |title=The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wicker |year=2009 |contribution=Wicker |edition=Fourth |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wicker is traditionally made of material of [[plant]] origin, such as [[rattan]], [[willow]], [[reed (plant)|reed]], and [[bamboo]], but [[synthetic fibers]] are now also used.

==History==
Wicker has been documented as far back as [[ancient Egypt]], made from indigenous "reed and swamp grasses."&lt;ref name=randomhistory&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/005furniture.html | title = From Egypt to the American Patio: The History of Wicker Furniture | publisher = Random History | date= 4 May 2007 | accessdate = 11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle-class families could only afford a few pieces, such as small tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Egypt/egyptian_social.html |title=Ancient Egyptian Social Life: Professions |first=Lisa |last=Kremen |date=29 April 1997 |accessdate=11 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527133903/http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Egypt/egyptian_social.html |archivedate=May 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeologists working on the tombs of the wealthy [[pharaoh]]s have uncovered a wider variety of wicker items,&lt;ref name=saunders&gt;{{cite book | last=Saunders | first=Richard | year=1990 |title = Wicker Furniture: A Guide to Restoring and Collecting | publisher=Random House, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "chests, baskets, wig boxes, and chairs".&lt;ref name=randomhistory/&gt;  Wicker even found use in the [[Achaemenid Empire]] on the battlefield, in [[shield]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.7.vii.html |title=The History of Herodotus |last=Herodotus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of wicker passed from ancient Egypt and [[Persia]] to [[ancient Rome]]. Wicker baskets were used to carry items in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4695097.stm | date = 18 July 2005 | title = Rare Pompeii dinner set unveiled | first = David | last = Willey | publisher = BBC News | location = Rome | accessdate = 11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furniture was manufactured out of wicker in the Roman style.&lt;ref name=randomhistory/&gt;  It has been proposed that the extensive use of wicker in the [[Iron Age]] (1200 BC – 400 AD in Europe) may have influenced the development of the woven patterns used in [[Celtic art]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} By the 16th and 17th centuries, wicker was "quite common"&lt;ref name=randomhistory/&gt; in European countries like [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and England.

Wicker received a boost during the [[Age of Exploration]], when international sea traders returned from [[southeast Asia]] with a species of [[palm tree|palm]] called [[rattan]]. Rattan is stronger than traditional European wicker materials,&lt;ref name=saunders/&gt; although the rattan stem can be separated so the softer inner core can be used for wicker.

The 19th century brought immense popularity for wicker in Europe, England, and North America.&lt;ref name=randomhistory/&gt; It was used outdoors as well as indoors. People in the [[Victorian Era]] believed it to be more sanitary than upholstered furniture.&lt;ref name=randomhistory/&gt; It was inexpensive,&lt;ref name=aiasf&gt;{{cite web | author = American Institute of Architects, San Francisco | title = Victorian Cottage &amp; Wicker Furniture | year = 2012 | url = http://aiasf.org/event/2012/09/11/victorian-cottage-wicker-furniture/ | quote = Wicker, another form of low-priced furniture, attracted even greater interest beginning in the 1850s and soon became a fixture in almost every American setting.

In the United States, [[Cyrus Wakefield]] began constructing rattan furniture in the 1850s. He first used rattan that had been offloaded from ships, where it was used as ballast,&lt;ref name="saunders" /&gt; but as his designs became well-known, he began importing the material himself.&lt;ref name="randomhistory" /&gt; Wakefield's company became one of the leading industries in wicker furniture;&lt;ref name="randomhistory" /&gt; it later merged with the Heywood Chair Manufacturing Company (a wooden chair company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.woodysantiques.com/aboutheywoodwakefield/index.asp | title = From Country Store to Modern Furniture: 100 Years of Progress | year = 2008 | accessdate = 11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had invented a mechanical process for weaving wicker seats&lt;ref name="randomhistory" /&gt;) to form the [[Heywood-Wakefield Company|Heywood-Wakefield]] of [[Gardner, Massachusetts]], one of the oldest and most prominent North American wicker manufacturers.&lt;ref name="randomhistory" /&gt;

In recent times, its aesthetic was influenced heavily by the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] at the turn of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Wicker is still a popular material. Antique wicker products are highly sought after by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dovetailantiquewicker.com/ |title=Fine American Wicker Furniture |year=2008 |website=Dovetail Antiques |access-date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductions of furniture and accent pieces are also sold for indoor and outdoor use.&lt;ref name="alfresia1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wickerhomepatiofurniture.com/victorian-wicker-furniture.html |title=Victorian Wicker Furniture |website=Wicker Home &amp; Patio Furniture |access-date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In North America today, "rattan" and "wicker" are frequently used interchangeably.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wicker-rattanfurniture.com/ |title=Rattan Wicker Furniture Company |publisher=Healthy Lifestyles Inc |access-date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wickerwork is an important industry in [[Poland]], employing hundreds of skilled workers to create goods for export to western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Poland revives wicker tradition | first=Adam |last=Easton | publisher = BBC News | location=Rudnik-on-San, [[Poland]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4739481.stm | accessdate = 11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
Natural wicker is well known for its strength and durability, as well as the high level of beauty and comfort that an expert craftsperson can create. Materials used can be any part of a plant, such as the cores of [[Arundo|cane]] or [[rattan]] stalks, or whole thicknesses of plants, as with [[willow]] switches. Other popular materials include [[Phragmites|reed]] and [[bamboo]]. Natural wicker requires maintenance to keep it in good shape.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Wicker can also be made from synthetic materials, or a combination. In furniture, such as benches, chairs, stools and other seating devices, a frame is typically made of stiffer materials, after which more pliant material is woven into the frame to fill it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.latour-lith.nl/tuinmeubel-blog/wat-is-wicker.html |title=What is wicker? |website=LatourTuinmeubelen |language=Dutch |access-date=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a smaller piece such as a basket, a strengthening frame is not needed so the entire piece is woven from the wicker material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How to Weave a Wicker Basket: A practical guide | first = Jonathan | last = Ridgeon| url = http://www.bushcraft.ridgeonnet.com/basicbasket.htm |accessdate = 11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic types include paper-wrapped high tensile wire (using the [[Lloyd Loom]] process patented in the early 20th century), and [[plastic]] or [[Resin#Synthetic resins|resin]]. The synthetic wickers are often preferred for outdoor use ("all-weather wicker"). The frame material used in these more recent versions includes aluminum.&lt;ref name="alfresia1" /&gt;

==Etymology==
{{expand section|date=April 2018}}
The word wicker is from the [[Middle English]] ''wiker'', of [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] origin.&lt;ref name=dictionary/&gt;

The '''Z-tube''' is an experimental [[Tool|apparatus]] for measuring the [[tensile strength]] of a [[liquid]].

It consists of a Z-shaped tube with open ends, filled with a liquid, and set on top of a spinning table. If the tube were straight, the liquid would immediately fly out one end or the other of the tube as it began to spin. By bending the ends of the tube back towards the center of [[rotation]], a shift of the liquid away from center will result in the [[water level]] in one end of the tube rising and thus increasing the [[pressure]] in that end of the tube, and consequently returning the liquid to the center of the tube. By measuring the [[rotational speed]] and the distance from the center of rotation to the liquid level in the bent ends of the tube, the pressure reduction inside the tube can be calculated.

[[Pressure#Negative pressures|Negative pressures]], (i.e. less than zero absolute pressure, or in other words, [[tension (physics)|tension]]) have been reported using water processed to remove dissolved [[gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Andrew M.

Biol.'', 157, 257-271, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensile strengths up to 280 atmospheres have been reported for water in glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjNS6v7q130C&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;ots=sGiBMDOEe6&amp;dq=spinning+z+tube+cohesion+water | title= Air and water: the biology and physics of life's media}}&lt;/ref&gt;
