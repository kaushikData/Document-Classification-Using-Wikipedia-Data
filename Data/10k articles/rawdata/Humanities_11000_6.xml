'''''A Walk Along the Ganges''''' (1986) is a travelogue written by [[Dennison Berwick]]. In this book, author tells about journey, a 2000 miles along the [[Ganges]], the Indian river.&lt;ref name="Berwick1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennison Berwick|title=A Walk Along The Ganges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTJszmJc2oUC|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=1986|publisher=Dennison Berwick|isbn=978-0-7137-1968-0|page=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Walk Alone The Ganges (details)"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Walk Alone The Ganges (details)|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/13166299?selectedversion=NBD4270890|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The idea of walking along the river came to Berwick's mind, when he was "gazing over" [[Nile]]. In introduction of the book he wrote, from his childhood he had a wish to come to India and explore the India. Through this 2000 miles journey he attempted to explore the country.&lt;ref name="Official website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Note on the book |url=http://www.dennisonberwick.info/books/a-walk-along-the-ganges/ |accessdate=2 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114011306/http://www.dennisonberwick.info/books/a-walk-along-the-ganges/ |archivedate=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The book was divided into several chapters. He started with giving acknowledgement to those people from who got assistance throughout his journey and an author's note where he discussed how and when the idea of travelling the length of the river struck his mind and how he prepared for it. Then he divided the book in fourteen chapters, in which he narrated different experienced which he gathered during the journey.

'''Andrey Anatolyevich Zaliznyak''' ({{lang-rus|Андре́й Анато́льевич Зализня́к|p=zəlʲɪˈzʲnʲak}}; 29 April 1935 – 24 December 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2017/12/24/zaliznyak/|title=Умер лингвист Андрей Зализняк|date=24 December 2017|publisher=lenta.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Russia]]n [[linguist]], an expert in [[historical linguistics]], [[dialectology]] and grammar. In recent years he paid much attention to the popularizing of linguistics and to the struggle against [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gramota.ru/lenta/news/8_2533 "К юбилею Андрея Анатольевича Зализняка"],&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Zaliznyak was born in [[Moscow]] and studied in the [[Moscow University]] before moving to the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] to further his studies with [[André Martinet]]. He was admitted into the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] as a [[corresponding member]] in 1987. Ten years later, he was elected a full [[academician]].

Zaliznyak's first monograph, ''Russian Nominal Inflection'' (1967), remains a definitive study in the field. Ten years later, he published a highly authoritative ''Russian Grammar Dictionary'', which went through several reprints and provided a basis for Russian grammar software.

In 1982, Zaliznyak turned his interests towards the [[Birch bark manuscript|birch bark scrolls]] which have been unearthed in [[Novgorod]] since the 1950s. He has co-edited all publications of newly discovered birch scrolls since 1986. As the number of these ancient documents exceeded 700, Zaliznyak summed up his findings in the monograph ''[[Old Novgorod dialect]]'' (1995), which comprised the texts and comments of every birch scroll discovered. In particular, he demonstrated how the [[phonetics]] of the Old Novgorod dialect can be reconstructed from the typos in the birch scrolls.

In 2003, Zaliznyak published the first comprehensive study of the [[Novgorod Codex]], the earliest extant East Slavic book, which had been sensationally discovered three years earlier.

In 2004, he published a study of [[the Tale of Igor's Campaign]] which examined all the significant linguistic arguments concernings its authenticity. Zaliznyak contends that no 20th-century (let alone 18th-century) forger could have reproduced the grammatical subtleties of the 12th-century [[Old East Slavic]] language.

Zaliznyak lectured in the [[Moscow University]], [[University of Geneva]], and [[University of Paris]]. For more data on his work, see [[Old Novgorod dialect]], [[Novgorod Codex]], and [[the Tale of Igor's Campaign]].

The '''Asiatic Exclusion League''', often abbreviated '''AEL''', was an organization formed in the early twentieth century in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] that aimed to prevent immigration of people of [[Asian people|Asian]] origin.

==United States==
In May 1905, a mass meeting was held in [[San Francisco, California]] to launch the '''Japanese and Korean Exclusion League'''.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, R. L. (4) (1992) The Development of the Anti-Japanese Agitation in the United States (p. 605-638) (Vol. 37). New York, NY: The Academy of Political Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those attending the first meeting were labor leaders and [[European American|European immigrants]], [[Patrick Henry McCarthy]] of the [[Building Trades Council]] of San Francisco, [[Andrew Furuseth]], and [[Walter McCarthy]] of the [[International Seamen's Union]]. Following the first meeting, the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] published a picture of laborers who collected at the meeting saying: "Some present owned their own little homes; while a majority know what it is to sit with the good wife of an evening, figure on approaching rent day and make up the cash on hand to see if there is enough to carry the family over to the next day." The [[San Francisco Chronicle]] also mentioned of resilience coming from the men attending the meeting, angrily ranting against the foreign men who were preventing them from owning homes and achieving a middle class life.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, R. L. (4) (1992) The Development of the Anti- Japanese Agitation in the United States (p. 605-638) (Vol. 37). New York, NY: The Academy of Political Science.&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 1907, the organization was renamed the '''Asiatic Exclusion League''' to include the exclusion of [[South Asian Americans|South Asians]] and [[Chinese Americans|Chinese immigrants]] in their agenda. Advocating for the "white man's country" and the prohibition of Asian labor immigration, the AEL set up branches across the [[Pacific coast]] of North America, achieving transnational status and cross-border labor organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = American Crossroads : Pacific Connections : The Making of the U.S.-Canadian Borderlands|last = Chang|first = Kornel|publisher = University of California Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780520951549|location = California|pages = 106|via = ProQuest Ebrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once the league was started they immediately began working to prevent any increase of Asians along the Western coastlines. The league used strong-arm methods and violence against Asians to try to ensure the rigorous enforcement of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and expand its provisions to other Asian immigrants. They moved quickly to broaden their goals and aimed to prevent immigration of all people of [[Eastern Asian]] origin. Their collective aims were to spread false anti-Asian information and to sway legislation towards restricting immigration. In response to their efforts [[General Ulysses S. Webb]], Attorney General for the state of California began to apply a markedly greater effort into enforcing laws that prohibited Asian ownership of property.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, K. R. (2011) Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia. (p. 48-52). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
AEL framed a campaign geared towards the [[San Francisco Board of Education]] to exclude Japanese and Koreans from public schools. The San Francisco school board ruled in October 1906, that all Japanese and Korean students would be forced to join their Chinese counterparts at the segregated Oriental School which was established some two decades earlier in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, K. R. (2011) Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia. (p. 48-52). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Japanese Americans challenged the school board's ruling by stating that the segregation of schools went against the [[Treaty of 1894]]. The Treaty did not address education; however, it did guarantee that equal rights be given to Japanese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Buell Johnson, ''Discrimination against the Japanese in California: a Review of the Real Situation'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=w0BDAAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=farncisco+japanese+1907&amp;ots=k3wvDYHJ-X&amp;sig=oBqfzCaNhRJk172ZgDgAz7a1qrc online]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Japanese Americans' challenge, they secured the right to attend San Francisco public schools, but as part of the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]], the Japanese government agreed to stop issuing passports to Japanese laborers.

===Government===
Applying active pressure on Congress, in March 1907, Congress approved amending existing immigration legislation, thereby allowing President Theodore Roosevelt to issue an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] that ended of all migration by Japanese laborers from both [[Hawaii]] and [[Mexico]]. This was taken together with the Gentlemen's Agreement(1907-1908) with [[Japan]], in which the Japanese government agreed not to issue passports for those laborers seeking work in the United States. This ended the immigration of much-maligned Japanese laborers. By 1908, 195 of the 231 organizations claimed affiliation with the AEL, surprisingly they were not all labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, K. R. (2011) Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia. (p. 48-52). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The league enhanced its activities by recruiting members, pledging political candidates to an exclusion law and by attempting to organize all of the western states in a concerted movement that would force Congress to grant their aspirations. For the forces against congress the AEL created a platform of five planks to bring forth to Congress:

"(1) Extending Chinese Exclusion Laws to exclude Japanese and Koreans, except those exempt by the terms of the Chinese Exclusion Act, from the United States and its territories; (2) the members are to pledge not to employ or patronize Japanese or to patronize any person or form employing Japanese or dealing with products coming from such firms; (3) actions of the School Board to adopt a policy segregating Japanese from white children be approved; (4)a campaign calling the attention of the President and Congress to this "menace", be taken over; (5) all labor and civic organizations in the state California are asked to contribute a fixed assessment to the cause."&lt;ref&gt;Buell, R. L. (4) (1992) The Development of the Anti- Japanese Agitation in the United States (p. 605-638) (Vol. 37). New York, NY: The Academy of Political Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 1913 [[Governor Hiram Johnson]] sighed the [[Webb-Hartley Law]], commonly recognized as [[Alien Land Law of 1913]]. These laws limited land leases by "aliens ineligible to citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buell, R. L. (4) (1992) The Development of the Anti-Japanese Agitation in the United States (p. 605-638) (Vol. 37). New York, NY: The Academy of Political Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Consecutive amendments followed Webb-Hartley, passed in 1919 and again in 1920, only further restricted the leasing of land. The latter amendment, represented the most demanding measures this far and was praised to close one and for all any and all loopholes that allowed for Asians to gain ownership. It passed overwhelmingly as a ballot initiative and went into effect on December 9, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, R. L.

[[File:Damage done by the Asiatic Exclusion League.jpg|thumb|Damage after the September 1907 riot in Vancouver]]
A sister organization with the same name was formed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] on 12 August 1907 under the auspices of the Trades and Labour Council. Its stated aim was "to keep Oriental immigrants out of British Columbia."&lt;ref&gt;''Vancouver News-Advertiser'', 7 September 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September, [[Anti-Oriental Riots (Vancouver)|riots erupted in Vancouver]] when League members besieged [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]] after listening to inflammatory racist speeches at [[Vancouver City Hall|City Hall]] (then on [[Main Street (Vancouver)|Main Street]] near [[Georgia Street (Vancouver)|Georgia Street]]). 4,000 people shouting racist slogans, by the time the riot reached City Hall, it had reached 8,000 people. The crowd marched into Chinatown, vandalizing and causing thousands of dollars' worth of damage. The mob then rampaged through [[Japantown, Vancouver|Japantown]], where they were confronted by residents armed with clubs and bottles with which they fought back. The organization flourished immediately following the riots, but began to dwindle by the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward, ''White Canada Forever: Popular Attitudes and Public Policy Toward Orientals in British Columbia''. 3rd ed. Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2002, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The AEL resurfaced in the early 1920s, this time claiming a membership of 40,000 in the province in the period leading up to the passage of the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923]], which ended virtually all [[Chinese immigration to Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Kay J. Anderson, ''Vancouver's Chinatown: Racial Discourse in Canada, 1875-1980.'' Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1995, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1921, there was a meeting held by the AEL bringing together church leaders, businessmen and veterans from [[World War One]] as well as representatives from six trade unions and the [[Vancouver Trades and Labor Council]]. During this meeting the League issued a program that called for the abolition of all Oriental immigration which later led to a campaign resulting in the [[Oriental Exclusion Act of 1923]].&lt;ref&gt;Willmott, W. E. (4) (1970) Approaches to the Study of the Chinese in British Columbia. BC Studies. Vancouver, BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important, albeit indirect, consequence of AEL activity was that the [[1907 Vancouver riots]] led to the first drug law in Canada. The [[Minister of Labour (Canada)|Minister of Labour]] (and future Prime Minister), [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], was sent to investigate the riots as well as victim claims for compensation. One claim was submitted by [[opium]] manufacturers, which sparked an investigation into the local drug scene by King. Particularly alarming to the minister was that opium consumption was apparently spreading to young white women. A federal law was soon passed "prohibiting the manufacture, sale and importation of opium for other than medicinal purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Carstairs, [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp03/NQ53757.pdf "‘Hop Heads’ and ‘Hypes’: Drug Use, Regulation and Resistance in Canada, 1920-1961,"] PhD thesis, University of Toronto, 2000, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Asiatic Exclusion Leagues were the product of an overall atmosphere of white racism against Asians that prevailed in Canada and the United States from the 1800s on, culminating in the imposition of a [[tax per head|head tax]] and other immigration policies designed to exclude Asians from Canada, as well as [[Japanese American internment]] and [[Japanese Canadian internment]] during [[World War II]].

In [[French orthography|French spelling]], '''aspirated "h"''' ([[French language|French]]: ''"h" aspiré'') is an initial [[silent letter]] that represents a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] at a [[word#Word boundaries|word boundary]], between the word's first [[vowel]] and the preceding word's last vowel. At the same time, the aspirated ''h'' stops the normal processes of [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] and [[liaison (French)|liaison]] from occurring.&lt;ref name=fagyal2006&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagyal|first=Zsuzsanna|title=French: A Linguistic Introduction|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-52896-8|pages=65–66, 224, 275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the now-silent ''h'' refers not to [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] but to its former pronunciation as the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] [h] in [[Old French]] and in [[Middle French]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== List of French words which begin with an aspirated ''h''==
{{copy to Wiktionary}}
The following list contains only the dictionary head entries and not all the forms that can be derived from them. For example, it does not contain past participles or transitive verbs when used as adjectives or nouns. It does not include composite words unless the omission might cause confusion among homonyms distinguished only by diacritic signs.

* In all French words that begin with ''h'', the following letter is a vowel.
* Most aspirated-''h'' words are derived from [[Germanic languages]].&lt;ref name=fagyal2006 /&gt; 
* The ''h'' is generally not aspirated in words of Latin and Greek origin.&lt;ref name=southworth1970&gt;{{cite journal|last=Southworth|first=Marie-José|title=French Words in H-|journal=The French Review|date=October 1970|volume=44|issue=1|pages=63–71|jstor=385928}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* None of the rare words with a ''y'' after an initial ''h'' has an aspirated ''h''. In addition, ''h'' is rarely aspirated before an ''i''.
* Before other vowels, the ''h'' is often aspirated, except for those coming from the oldest [[Greek language|Greek]] roots.
* The ''h'' is aspirated in [[onomatopoeia]].
* There are numerous exceptions, and etymology often cannot explain them satisfactorily.&lt;ref name=southworth1970 /&gt;

In French dictionaries, words with an initial aspirated ''h'' are traditionally prefixed with an [[asterisk]] but with no effect on their alphabetical arrangement. The following list is compiled from the ''Dictionnaire du Trésor de la langue française'' and the ''Dictionnaire de l'Académie française''. It lacks many proper names and recent borrowings. In general, if a borrowed word is pronounced with an {{IPA|[h]}} in its language of origin, the ''h'' will be conserved in French orthography and be aspirated.

==== Hélas ====
''Hélas'' is not aspirated in classical poetry.
* ''Hélas ! Que cet hélas a de peine à sortir'' ([[Pierre Corneille]]).
That is indicated here by the use of ''cet'' rather than ''ce''.

=== Words beginning with ''hi'' ===
The aspiration of ''h'' is often optional in words beginning with ''hi'', and the liaison (with a mute ''h'') is generally accepted, except in recent anglicisms of current usage, interjections or homophones with another word. Beside the very productive and learned Greek root ''hiéro-'', most words are quite recent and of Germanic origin ([[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Modern English), or the ''h'' is lightly pronounced.

=== Words beginning with ''ho''===
Most have an aspirated ''h''. The exceptions are mostly Latin roots that are most widely used in which the ''h'' has lost its voicing through assimilation to common language (in ''hôte'', ''hospice'' or ''hôpital'' all derived from ''hospes''/''hospitis''. Also if the ''h'' has been assimilated to the following ⟨s⟩ ''heure''/''horo-'', taken from ''hora'' in which the ''h'' has been assimilated to the preceding adjectives, make the ''h'' mute.

Almost all words beginning with ''hu'' have an aspirated ''h'' The exceptions are some terms for which the ''h'' is not etymological but was introduced for orthographic reasons with the purpose of distinguishing different roots that begin with a ''u'' or a ''v''  but were homographs in Latin writing (therefore, ''huile'', ''huis'', or ''huître'' are not aspirated).

==Examples==
:a) nos héros /noeʀo/ ''our heroes''

:b) *nos héros /nozeʀo/ ''our heroes''&lt;ref name=fagyal2006 /&gt;

That example illustrates how the aspirated ''h''-word ''héros'' prevents the liaison, and the otherwise-silent word-final consonant is pronounced before the first vowel of the following word. Because the ''h'' is aspirated, the second entry is incorrect, as the hiatus prevents the final /z/ from being phonetically realised.

:a) le hibou /ləibu/ 'the owl'

:b) *l'hibou /libu/ 'the owl' &lt;ref name=fagyal2006 /&gt;

That example illustrates how the aspirated-''h'' word ''hibou'' has no elision, and the vowel of the ''le'' is dropped.&lt;ref name=fagyal2006 /&gt; The second entry is incorrect because elision is not allowed in the word ''hibou'' because of the hiatus imposed by its aspirated ''h''.

==Historical and sociolinguistic aspects==
One part of the major phonological changes between Latin and Early Old French was the loss of the consonant /h/, which would later return with the introduction of Germanic words into the language.&lt;ref name=fagyal2006 /&gt; The aspirate ''h'' ceased to be pronounced once more in either the 16th or the 17th century, but some grammarians kept insisting for it be pronounced into the early part of the twentieth century. Since the phonological behavior of aspirate ''h'' words cannot be predicted through spelling, usage requires a considerable amount of memorisation. It is often used to demonstrate one's education and social status. As early as the 17th century, noted grammarian 
[[Claude Favre de Vaugelas]] described the incorrect pronunciation of aspirated ''h'' words as typical of French spoken on the southern side of the [[Loire]]. Further discussion of the phenomenon is found in almost every collection of remarks on language to the present day, with mistakes generally being ascribed to class differences or inattention.

In modern usage, the blocking of liaison and [[elision]] with aspirated ''h'' words appears to be gaining ground in formal French but is losing ground in less guarded speech.&lt;ref name=fagyal2006 /&gt;

[[Image:AutographBook 2pages.png|thumb|right|250px|1888 autograph book]]
An '''autograph book''' is a [[book]] for collecting the [[autograph]]s of others.  Traditionally they were exchanged among friends, colleagues, and classmates to fill with [[poem]]s, drawings, personal messages, small pieces of verse, and other [[souvenir|mementos]].  Their modern derivations include [[yearbook]]s, [[friendship book]]s, and [[guest book]]s.  They were popular among [[university]] students from the 15th century until the mid-19th century, after which their popularity began to wane as they were gradually replaced by yearbooks.  

==History==

===Origin===
[[Image:Stammbuch1.jpg|thumb|This page from the autograph book of Simon Haendel (compiled in the 1590s) features a personal greeting, written in Latin adde]]

By the beginning of the [[early modern period]], there was a trend among graduating university students of central Europe to have their personal bibles signed by classmates and instructors.  Gradually these expanded from mere signatures to include poetry and sketches, and publication companies responded to this trend by appending blank pages to bibles.  Eventually they began offering small, decorated books with only blank pages.&lt;ref name="mki"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://mki.wisc.edu/virtualex/Stammbuecher/Stammbuecher.htm| title= Dies schrieb Dir zur Erinnerung...: From Album Amicorum to Autograph Book| accessdate= 9 February 2009| last= Petty| first= Antje| publisher= Max Kade Institute for German-American Studies| location= Madison, Wisconsin, United States| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090207045136/http://mki.wisc.edu/virtualex/Stammbuecher/Stammbuecher.htm| archivedate= 7 February 2009| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other traditions dating back to the [[Middle Ages]] played into the development of the autograph book.&lt;ref name="artdir"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[genealogy|Genealogical]] tables and guides circulated within aristocratic families, with each person adding his or her own information.  Similarly, tournament participators would record their names, [[coat of arms|coats-of-arms]], and possibly [[motto]]es into tournament books.&lt;ref name="ket"&gt;{{cite web

The first true autograph books appeared in German and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] linguistic regions (possibly originating in [[Wittenberg]]) by the mid-16th century.&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mun"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Known as an ''album amicorum'' ("book of friends") or ''stammbuch'' ("friendship book"), the oldest on record is that of Claude de Senarclens, an associate of [[John Calvin]], and dates back to 1545.&lt;ref name="artdir"/&gt;  By the end of the century, they were common throughout Germany among students and scholars.&lt;ref name="ket"/&gt;  Academics tended to retain their autograph books for many years and gather the correspondence of fellow intellectuals with whom they associated; therefore the books began to function not only as sentimental artifacts but also as a crude form of scholarly credentials, a precursor to the modern "list of references".&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;

===Evolution===
The popularity of autograph books was generally confined to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] cultures, and they appeared only sporadically in other countries.&lt;ref name="mun"/&gt;  They began to fall out of favor in the academic community by the late 17th century, but rebounded a century later as they came into use among [[fraternity|fraternity students]] and members of the burgeoning [[middle class]].  This new wave of autograph curators included women as well as men.&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;

German immigrants transported the tradition to American culture in the late 18th century, where their popularity peaked around the time of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]].  Thereafter the use of autograph books declined sharply in both cultures as they were replaced by school yearbooks,&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=AC040&amp;kw=

}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they remained a lingering fad among young women for some time.

Autograph books in their classic form eventually disappeared from the landscape of American culture, but their usage endures among German schoolgirls, who know them as ''poesiealben''.&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;

==Function==
[[File:Album russia.jpg|thumb|Small album, Russia, 1820-30s. [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]
When they first emerged in the 1500s, autograph books were used for collecting signatures at graduation and kept as a sentimental memento of college life. Eventually it became popular to use them well after graduation, and scholars would carry the books on their travels (particularly between various universities) to record the well-wishes of colleagues and noteworthy acquaintances.&lt;ref name="mun"/&gt;  The books therefore conveyed a form of academic credentials, dependent upon who had signed them and what had been written.&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;

Additionally, an autograph book may have been used as a crude [[address book]] to maintain correspondence to past and distant friends.&lt;ref name="ket"/&gt;

Recently, researchers have come to see the historical value of these books in assessing the biographical data of those who composed them and the cultural backdrop in which they wrote. The autograph books of Ludwig van Beethoven and Babette Koch are among the most famous.&lt;ref name="artdir"/&gt;

==Design and format==

===Books===
Until the late 18th century, German autograph albums generally consisted of loose sheets of paper or sometimes [[vellum]] bound in an elongated [[octavo]] format; later, they became available in the horizontal format.  The binding material varied dramatically, from cardboard to gold-tooled leather.&lt;ref name="ket"/&gt;

A different type of album contained unbound pages in cassettes or folders, which could be passed out and collected individually and later arranged in any order.&lt;ref name="artdir"/&gt;

===Autographs===
A typical page contained a set of verses in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew at the top, and a formal greeting to the album's owner below, sometimes including a heraldic shield or emblematic picture of the signator.&lt;ref name="mun"/&gt;  More artistic autographers sketched full-page drawings, and less conventional entries included [[engraving]]s, [[embroidery]], paper silhouettes, [[lock of hair|locks of hair]], or [[pressed flower craft|pressed flowers]].&lt;ref name="ket"/&gt;  The high quality of some illustrations suggests that the books must have been kept by the autographer for some length of time to work on the composition.&lt;ref name="mun"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2013">'''Birtha''' ({{lang-el|Βίρθα}})&lt;ref&gt;Ptol. v. 18; '''Virta''', Amm. Marc. xx. 7. § 17.&lt;/ref&gt; was an ancient fortress on the river [[Tigris]], which was said to have been built by [[Alexander the Great]]. It would seem, from the description of Ammianus,&lt;ref&gt;''l. c.''&lt;/ref&gt; to have resembled a modern fortification, flanked by bastions, and with its approaches defended by out-works. [[Shapur II]] here closed his campaign in 360, and was compelled to retire with considerable loss. [[D'Anville]]&lt;ref&gt;''Geog. Anc.'' vol. ii. p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward Gibbon]]&lt;ref&gt;vol. iii. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; both identify Birtha as modern-day [[Tikrit]], [[Iraq]].

The word "Birtha" in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] means a castle or fortress, and might be applied to many places. From the known position of [[Dura-Europos|Dura]], it has been inferred that the remarkable passage of the Tigris by [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] in 363 took place near Tikrit.&lt;ref&gt;Amm. Marc. xxv. 6. § 12; Zosim. iii. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 14th century, this impregnable fortress was stormed by [[Timur]]. The ruins of the castle are on a perpendicular cliff over the Tigris, about 200 feet (65 m) high. This insulated cliff is separated from the town by a broad and deep ditch, which was no doubt filled by the Tigris. At the foot of the castle is a large gate of brick-work, which is all that remains standing; but round the summit of the cliff the walls, buttresses, and bastions are quite traceable. There are the ruins of a vaulted secret staircase, leading down from the heart of the citadel to the water's edge.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, ''Kurdistan'', vol. ii. p. 147; ''comp.'' ''Journ. Geog. Soc.'' vol. ix. p. 448; Chesney, ''Exped. Euphrat.'' vol. i. pp. 26, 27; [[Carl Ritter]], ''Erdkunde'', vol. x. p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan''' is a department forming an historic part of the [[British Museum]], housing the world's largest{{Ref label|H|h|none}} and most comprehensive collection of [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquities]] (with over 100,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/ancient_egypt_and_sudan/history_of_the_collection/development_of_the_collection/development_since_world_war_ii.aspx |title=Development since World War II (1945 – )|work=British Museum |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; pieces) outside the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. 

==History==

[[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquities]] have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects&lt;ref&gt;Reported in the list of Sloane's collection given to his executors in 1753. Reproduced in MacGregor (1994a:29)&lt;/ref&gt; from Sir [[Hans Sloane]]. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French]] forces under [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the [[British army]] and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed [[Rosetta Stone]], were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the Museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] as [[Consul general|consul]] in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Giovanni Belzoni]]. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the [[Musée du Louvre]].

By 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] under the efforts of [[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]]. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from [[Amarna]], [[Bubastis]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]]. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including [[Flinders Petrie]]'s Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the [[Oxford University]] Expedition to [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] and [[Faras]] in Sudan.

Active support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including [[Asyut]] (1907), [[El-Badari|Mostagedda]] and [[El-Badari|Matmar]] (1920s), [[Ashmunein]] (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as [[Soba (city)|Soba]], Kawa and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s). The size of the Egyptian collections now stand at over 110,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/spencer.htm |title=A British Museum Egyptologist's View: The Return of Egyptian Antiquities is Not an Issue |publisher=Touregypt |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 2001 the eight million objects forming the Museum's permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six million objects from the Wendorf Collection of [[Predynastic Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[History of Sudan|Sudanese]] [[Prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/aes/aesnot.html |title=Ancient Egypt and Sudan |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206000328/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/aes/aesnot.html |archivedate=6 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were donated by Professor [[Fred Wendorf]] of [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Texas]], and comprise the entire collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations at Prehistoric sites in the [[Sahara Desert]] between 1963 and 1997. Other fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie Klemm ([[University of Munich]]) and William Adams ([[University of Kentucky]]).

The seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of 140 [[Mummy|mummies]] and coffins, the largest outside [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo]]. A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought after exhibits by visitors to the museum.

'''Chicanná''' was a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] town that was built during the Classic period (600 A.D. to 830 A.D.). The site was named after its most famous building, Structure II, which means "House of the Serpent Mouth" in Mayan. In the Mayan language ''chi'' means "mouth", ''can'' means "serpent" and ''na'' means "house". The site is located two kilometers west of [[Becán]] in the Mexican state of [[Campeche]] on the [[Yucatán peninsula]]. It is one of 45 other ruin sites located within that area.

{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}Chicanná was inhabited from 300 B.C. to 1100 A.D., but was thought to have reached its peak from 300 B.C. to 250 A.D. There is evidence that Chicanná may have been dependent on Becán for much of its existence, since Becán was self-sufficient.  Chicanná is one of the most striking examples in the region of the mixing of architectural styles with its stunning detailed buildings. Its buildings have features of the [[Río Bec]], [[Chenes (Mayan city)]] and even the [[Puuc]] style from the north.  It does not have large pyramids, but relatively small buildings with an ornateness and quality of decoration that suggests that it was a center for the region's most elite.

The city of Chicanná is widely known for one of its well-preserved doorways with interesting detail; the city reached its prime during the late classical period. The city of Chicanná is small. However, it is considered to be home for the elites and rulers of Becán. After continuous research on Chicanná site, knowledge grew which eventually led to the questioning of previous ideas associated with the style of sculptures in central Yucatán. Jack D. Eaton rediscovered Chicanná in 1966 during his exploration of the Yucatán. Chicanná is a site that takes advantage of the natural elevation found in the region so structures seem higher and, for the Maya, closer to the god. This settlement was most used for important spiritual ceremonies and rituals for the Mayans.

== Discovery ==
Chicanná is located in the state of Campeche, and is part of the ancient Maya Rio Bec region.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Taladoire, E., Dzul, S., Nondédéo, P., &amp; Forné, M. (2013). CHRONOLOGY OF THE RÍO BEC SETTLEMENT AND ARCHITECTURE. 24(2), 353-372.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Doménech-Carbó, María Teresa, Osete-Cortina, Laura, Doménech-Carbó, Antonio, Vázquez de Agredos-Pascual, María Luisa, &amp; Vidal-Lorenzo, Cristina. (2014). Identification of indigoid compounds present in archaeological Maya blue by pyrolysis-silylation-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 105, 355-362.''&lt;/ref&gt; The site was first studied by Jack Eaton in 1966 while exploring the Yucatán.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Potter, D. (1973). ''MAYA ARCHITECTURAL STYLE IN CENTRAL YUCATAN.,'' ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/docview/302685108?pq-origsite=primo&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous building at the site, Structure II, was studied later during excavations in 1970.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The core of Chicanná consists of seven buildings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Structure I, II, and III make up the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Four outlying structures surround the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most well-known structures at Chicanná are Structures I and II. Structures I and II are both temples situated within the main plaza and have been interpreted to be aligned with solar movements for calendar-keeping purposes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Šprajc, Ivan. (2004). Astronomical Alignments in Río Bec Architecture. Archaeoastronomy,18, 98-107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Based on radiocarbon dating of charcoal and other organic materials at the site, both Structures I and II are dated to the Late Classic period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Chicanná was built in multiple phases. Structure XI, positioned adjacent to Structure X, was assembled first based on the ceramic sequence of materials found.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ceramic analysis also supports the radiocarbon data that suggests Structures I and II were built sometime later during the Late Maya Classic Period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Specific Structures ==
Structure I is a temple located in the main plaza characterized by four relief panels constructed in the Rio Bec style.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Rio Bec style is defined as a temple pyramid built in the central Maya lowlands.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Unlike other architectural styles in the Maya Lowlands, Rio Bec architecture style is characterized by structures positioned at greater distance from one another, resulting in a less dense site layout.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Other sites with the Rio Bec architectural style include Becan and Xpuhil, both located within 3&amp;nbsp;km from Chicanná.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Due to their location and similar architectural style, Becan and Xpuhil are believed to have interacted with and were connected to Chicanná.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Structure I consists of six total rooms and with five risers facing inward towards the plaza.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Also, part of the main plaza is Structure II.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Structure II is a smaller building and the most well-known building at the site.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Structure II contains a well-preserved relief sculpture of a serpent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The name of the site, Chicanná, was derived and influenced from the serpent relief sculpture on this structure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Structure II is composed of eight total rooms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Plaster walls within the interior of each room contain images depicting animals, monsters, clothes, and other structures on the plaster walls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Chinese Cubans''' ({{lang-es|sino-cubano}}) are [[Cubans]] of full or mixed [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] ancestry who were born in or have immigrated to [[Cuba]]. They are part of the ethnic Chinese diaspora (or [[Overseas Chinese]]).

==History==
[[File:Puerta de los Dragones - Barrio Chino de La Habana.JPG|thumb|left|The [[paifang]] at the entrance of Havana's Chinatown]]
Chinese [[immigration]] to Cuba started in 1857 when Chinese ([[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]]) contract workers were brought to work in the sugar fields, bringing the religion of [[Buddhism]] with them. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers were brought in from [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]] during the following decades to replace and/or work alongside African [[slavery|slaves]]. After completing eight-year contracts or otherwise obtaining their freedom, some Chinese immigrants  settled permanently in Cuba, although most longed for repatriation to their homeland. [[Havana]]'s [[Chinatown]] (known as ''Barrio Chino de La Habana'') is one of the oldest and largest Chinatowns in [[Latin America]]. Some 5,000 immigrants from the U.S. came to Cuba during the late 19th century to escape the discrimination present at the time. Another, albeit smaller wave of Chinese immigrants, also arrived during the 20th century, some as supporters of the communist cause during the Cuban revolution, and others as dissidents escaping the authorities in China.

There were almost no women among the nearly entirely male Chinese coolie population that migrated to Cuba(1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=143|pages=|year=2010|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9004182136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=47|edition=illustrated|pages=|year=2001|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|volume=|author=Adam McKeown|author-link=Adam McKeown|quote=|location=|title=Chinese Migrant Networks and Cultural Change: Peru, Chicago, and Hawaii 1900-1936|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vix_3doZkH0C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=chinese+peru+women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PgyUVfbmOoawsAXT3rb4DA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20peru%20women&amp;f=false|isbn=0226560252}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cuba some Indian (Native American), mulatto, black, and white women engaged in carnal relations or marriages with Chinese men, with marriages of mulatto, black, and white women being reported by the Cuba Commission Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=82|edition=illustrated|pages=|year=2014|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=UNC Press Books|volume=Volume 4 of Wiley Blackwell Concise History of the Modern World|author=Elliott Young|quote=|location=|title=Alien Nation: Chinese Migration in the Americas from the Coolie Era Through World War II|series=The David J.

120,000 Cantonese 'coolies' (all males) entered [[Cuba]] under contract for 8 years. Most of these men did not marry, but Hung Hui (1975:80) cites there was a frequency of sexual activity between black women and these Asian immigrants. According to Osberg (1965:69) the free Chinese practice of buying slave women and then freeing them expressly for marriage was utilized at length. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Chinese men (Cantonese) engaged in sexual activity with black Cuban women, and from such relations many children were born.&lt;ref name="RaceGenderSexuality"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/idis/violence-center/documents/LAP_essay_on_sino-cubans__.race_gender__sexuality_as_discour.pdf|title=Sino-Cubans: Race, gender and sexuality as discourse|accessdate=December 31, 2011|postscript=: (For a British Caribbean model of Chinese cultural retention through procreation with black women, see Patterson, 322-31).}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, an additional 30,000 Cantonese and small groups of Japanese also arrived; both immigrations were exclusively male, and there was rapid intermarriage with white, black, and mulato populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9HpqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=30,000+cantonese+immigrants+cuba&amp;dq=30,000+cantonese+immigrants+cuba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nIP_Tq1B06LyA9-yub0B&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg|title=Cuba: a Lonely Planet travel survival kit|publisher=Lonely Planet }}&lt;/ref&gt; CIA World Factbook.

In the study of genetic origin, admixture, and asymmetry in maternal and paternal human lineages in Cuba, thirty-five Y-chromosome SNPs were typed in the 132 male individuals of the Cuban sample. The study does not include any people with some Chinese ancestry. All the samples were white Cubans and black Cubans. Two out of 132 male sample belong to East Asian Haplogroup O2 which is found in significant frequencies among Cantonese people is found in 1.5% of Cuban population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetic origin, admixture, and asymmetry in maternal and paternal human lineages in Cuba | pmc=2492877 | pmid=18644108 | doi=10.1186/1471-2148-8-213 | volume=8 | year=2008 | journal=BMC Evol.

Two thousand Chinese, consisting of Cantonese and Hakkas, fought with the rebels in Cuba's [[Ten Years' War]]. A monument in Havana honours the Cuban Chinese who fell in the war,  on which is inscribed: "There was not one Cuban Chinese deserter, not one Cuban Chinese traitor."&lt;ref&gt;Westad, Odd Aren (2012) ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750''. (New York: Basic Books), pp.227–28. {{ISBN|978-0465019335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese Cubans, including some Chinese-Americans from California, joined the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898 to achieve independence from [[Spain]], but a few Chinese, who were loyal to Spain, left Cuba and went to Spain. Racial acceptance and assimilation would come much later.

When the new [[Cuban Revolution|revolutionary government]] led by [[Fidel Castro]] came to power in 1959, the economic and political situation changed. Many Chinese grocery store owners, having had their properties [[expropriated]] by the new government, left Cuba. Most of these settled in the [[United States]], particularly nearby [[Florida]], where they and their US-born children are called Chinese-Americans or [[Cuban-American]]s of Chinese descent, while a relatively few fled to the nearby [[Dominican Republic]] and other [[Latin America]]n countries, and also to the US territory of [[Puerto Rico]], where they are called [[Chinese Puerto Rican]]s, Cuban-Puerto Ricans of Chinese descent, or Cuban-Americans of Chinese descent. Chinese refugees to United States include people whose ancestors came to Cuba 10 years before the [[Cuban Revolution]] and those from the United States. These Chinese American refugees, whose ancestors had come from California, were happy to be back in the United States. As a result of this exodus, the number of pure Chinese dropped sharply in Havana’s ''Barrio Chino''. The places to which they migrated had a unique Chinese culture and a popularity of Chinese Cuban restaurants.

The Chinese Cubans fought in the Cuban war of independence on the side of those seeking independence from Spain. A memorial consisting of a broken column memorializes Chinese participation in the war of independence at the corners of L and Linea in Havana. While many fled, some Chinese stayed after the start of Fidel Castro's rule in 1961. Younger generations are working in a wider variety of jobs than the previous generation. Many are entering show-business as song composers, actors, actresses, singers, and models.

The ''Barrio Chino de La Habana'' is no longer among the largest [[Chinatowns in Latin America]]. Most Chinese Cubans live outside ''Barrio Chino''.

Several community groups, especially [[Chinatown]] Promotional Group (Spanish: ''Grupo Promotor del Barrio Chino''), worked to revive ''Barrio Chino'' and the faded [[Chinese culture]]. Chinese Language and Arts School (''Escuela de la Lengua y Artes China'') opened in 1993 and has grown since then, helping Chinese Cubans to strengthen their knowledge of the Chinese language. Today, Chinese Cubans tend to speak [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], Hakka, and a mixture of Chinese and Spanish, in addition to Spanish and English. They also promoted small businesses, like beauty parlors, mechanical shops, restaurants, and small groceries, provided to them to create a view of ''Barrio Chino''. Havana’s ''Barrio Chino'' also experienced buildings of Chinese architecture and museum with backgrounds about China. As a result, the Chinese Cuban community has gained visibility.

== In literature ==
* The influence of the Chinese migration to Cuba is thoroughly reflected in the novel ''[[The Island of Eternal Love]]'' &lt;ref&gt;(Riverhead Books, June 2008),&lt;/ref&gt; by Cuban-American author [[Daína Chaviano]]. Originally published in Spain as ''La isla de los amores infinitos'',&lt;ref&gt;(Grijalbo-Random House 2006),&lt;/ref&gt; it has been translated into 25 languages. The plot covers 150 years, from the 1840s through the 1990s.
* A Cuban-Chinese family engaged in international intrigue appears in [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Spook Country]]'' (2007).

== Notable Chinese Cubans ==
*[[Alfredo Abon Lee]], commander of the pro-government forces during the [[Battle of Yaguajay]]
*[[Wifredo Lam]], a painter of the Surrealist school
*[[Maikel Chang]], professional [[association football|association football (soccer)]] player
*[[Yat-Sen Chang]], ballet dancer

Several old chocolate boxes and postcards depict this particular building, calling it variously the Hall House and an "Old [[Cottage]]".]]
'''Chocolate box art''' originally referred literally to [[Decorative arts|decorations]] on [[chocolate]] boxes. Over the years, however, the terminology has changed; it is now applied broadly as an often pejorative term to describe [[painting]]s and [[design]]s that are overly idealistic and sentimental.

Using his own paintings of children, flowers and holiday scenes [[Richard Cadbury]], the son of the founder of [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury's]], introduced such designs to his chocolate boxes in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadbury.co.uk/cadburyandchocolate/ourstory/packaging/Pages/richardcadbury.aspx "Cadbury chocolate box"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520074709/http://www.cadbury.co.uk/cadburyandchocolate/ourstory/packaging/Pages/richardcadbury.aspx |date=2009-05-20 }}. [[Cadbury]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]'s paintings have been described as "chocolate box" and have been derided by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] for being happy, inoffensive scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jonathan (12 February 2007). [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/feb/12/art.features11 "Angry young man"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Constable|Constable]]'s landscapes have also been so described.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/archives/2006/05/25/lanscapes_of_gl.html "Landscapes of gloom"]. ''The Guardian''. 25 May 2006  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031837/http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/archives/2006/05/25/lanscapes_of_gl.html |date=15 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aelbert Cuyp]]'s ''[[Media:Aelbert Cuyp River Landscape.jpg|River Landscape]]'' (1660), despite being widely regarded as his best work, has been criticised as having "chocolate box blandness".&lt;ref&gt;Denny, Ned (18 March 2002). [http://www.newstatesman.com/200203180037 "Cuyp cake"]. ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Swan]] is a modern-day proponent of chocolate box paintings as, to his detractors, was [[Thomas Kinkade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kinkade-king-of-kitsch-coming-to--a-home-near-you-683724.html| title=Kinkade, king of kitsch, coming to a home near you

The term has also been applied to [[sculpture]]. A young couple standing locked in an embrace forms the centrepiece for the new £800m [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras International]] station in [[central London]]. Entitled ''The Meeting Place'', the £1m sculpture is by [[British people|Briton]] [[Paul Day (sculptor)|Paul Day]] who admitted, "Some will say it is a chocolate box sculpture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/art-that-embraces-a-new-future-for-st-pancras-436300.html |title=Art that embraces a new future for St Pancras |first=Cahal |last=Milmo |newspaper=The Independent|date=14 February 2007 |accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2759">'''Componential analysis''' ('''feature analysis''' or '''contrast analysis''') is the analysis of words through structured sets of [[Semantic feature|semantic features]], which are given as "present", "absent" or "indifferent with reference to feature". The method thus departs from the [[principle of compositionality]]. Componential analysis is a method typical of [[structural semantics]] which analyzes the components of a word's meaning. Thus, it reveals the culturally important features by which speakers of the language distinguish different words in a [[semantic field]] or domain (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;20). This is a highly valuable approach to learning another language and understanding a specific semantic domain of an [[Ethnography]].

==Examples==
''man'' = [+ MALE], [+ MATURE] or ''woman'' = [– MALE], [+ MATURE] or ''boy'' = [+ MALE], [– MATURE] or ''girl'' = [– MALE] [– MATURE] or ''child'' = [+/– MALE] [– MATURE]. In other words, the word ''girl'' can have three basic factors (or [[semantic properties]]): [[human]], [[wikt:young|young]], and [[female]]. Another example, being [[Eating|edible]] is an important factor by which plants may be distinguished from one another (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;20). To summarize, one word can have basic underlying meanings that are well established depending on the cultural context. It is crucial to understand these underlying meanings in order to fully understand any language and culture.

==Historical background==
Structural semantics and the componential analysis were patterned on the phonological methods of the [[Prague School]], which described sounds by determining the absence and presence of features.  On one hand, componential analysis gave birth to various models in [[generative semantics]], [[lexical field theory]] and [[transformational grammar]]. On the other hand, its shortcoming were also visible:
* The discovery procedures for semantic features are not clearly objectifiable.
* Only part of the vocabulary can be described through more or less structured sets of features.
* Metalinguistic features are expressed through language again.
* Features used may not have clear definitions.
* Limited in focus and mechanical in style.
As a consequence, entirely different ways to describe meaning were developed, such as [[prototype theory|prototype semantics]].

'''David Sloan Wilson''' (born 1949) is an [[Americans|American]] [[evolutionary biologist]] and a Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences and Anthropology at [[Binghamton University]]. He is a son of the author [[Sloan Wilson]] and co-founder of the [[Evolution Institute]].

==Academic career==

Wilson graduated with a B.A. with high honors in 1971 from the [[University of Rochester]]. He then completed his Ph.D. in 1975 at [[Michigan State University]]. He then worked as a Research Fellow in the Biological Laboratories at [[Harvard University]] from 1974-1975. He then held a dual position as a Research Associate in Zoology at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] and the [[University of Washington]] from 1975 to 1976. After this he was a Senior Research Officer at the [[South Africa]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n National Research Institute for the Mathematical Sciences from 1976 to 1977.

Wilson moved back to the United States and held an Assistant Professorship in the Division of Environmental Studies at the [[University of California, Davis]], from 1977 to 1980. He then served as an Assistant and then Associate Professor at the [[Kellogg Biological Station]] and Department of Zoology of [[Michigan State University]] from 1980 to 1988. Wilson was then promoted to full Professor of Biological Sciences at the State University of New York, Binghamton, in 1988. He was then given a joint appointment as Professor of Anthropology in 2001.

Wilson started the Evolutionary Studies (EvoS) program at Binghamton University to provide a program that unifies diverse disciplines under the theory of evolution. Students in the program take evolution-themed courses in a variety of disciplines including biology, anthropology, psychology, bioengineering, philosophy, [[evolutionary origin of religions|religion]] and the [[evolutionary psychology of religion|psychology of religion]]. There is also a required course called "Current Topics in Evolutionary Studies", where students attend weekly seminars with a discussion followed afterward. [[SUNY New Paltz]] has started a similar program.

==Research==

Wilson is a prominent proponent of the concept of [[group selection]] (also known as multi-level selection) in evolution. He and [[Elliott Sober]] proposed a framework called [[group selection#Multilevel selection theory|multilevel selection theory]], which incorporates the more orthodox approach of gene-level selection and individual selection, in their book ''Unto Others''. This framework argues that while genes serve as the means by which organisms' designs are transmitted across generations, individuals and groups are vehicles for those genes and both are arenas for genes to act on. Indeed, genes themselves can be affected by selection, not just because of their effects on the design of their vehicle (the organism) but also because of their effect on the functioning of the DNA on which they reside. Hence the notion of multilevel selection. Wilson has also coined the concept of a [[trait-group]], a group of organisms linked not permanently as a group but having a shared fate due to interactions that they have.

Wilson has described himself as an "enthusiastic proponent" of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://thebestschools.org/dialogues/evolution-david-sloan-wilson-interview/ "David Sloan Wilson Interview"]. Retrieved July 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
* Unto Others (1998) co-edited with Elliott Sober. (Proposition of a framework called multilevel selection theory, which incorporates the more orthodox approach of gene-level selection and individual selection).
* [[Darwin's Cathedral]] (2002) (Religion as a multi-level adaptation).
* Rethinking the Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology (2006) co-edited with E. O. Wilson
* Evolution for Everyone: How Darwin's Theory Can Change the Way We Think About Our Lives (2007)
* The Neighborhood Project: Using Evolution to Improve My City, One Block at a Time (2011)
* Pathological Altruism (2011) co-edited with Barbara Oakley, Ariel Knafo, and Guruprasad Madhavan.
* Does Altruism Exist?: Culture, Genes, and the Welfare of Others (2015)
* The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative (2005) co-edited with Jonathan Gottschall

Wilson's book ''[[Darwin's Cathedral]]'' proposes that religion is a multi-level adaptation, a product of cultural evolution developed through a process of [[multi-level selection]] for more cooperative and cohesive groups. His book ''Evolution for Everyone: How Darwin's Theory Can Change the Way We Think About Our Lives'' attempts to give an introduction to evolution for a broad audience, detailing the various ways in which evolution can be applied to everyday affairs. There is also a class at Binghamton University that is called "Evolution for Everyone", and students are required to read the book as part of the class.

Wilson's latest book for a general audience is ''The Neighborhood Project: Using Evolution to Improve My City, One Block at a Time'', published in August 2011. Wilson also co-edited ''Pathological Altruism'' published by [[Oxford University Press]] in November 2011 with Barbara Oakley, Ariel Knafo, and Guruprasad Madhavan.

Wilson and his co-author [[E.O. Wilson|E. O. Wilson]] have become well known{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} for the quote, "Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups. Everything else is commentary". This quotation appeared in their paper, "Rethinking the Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology".

Wilson is a blogger for the [[ScienceBlogs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/evolution/|title=David Sloan Wilson's blog at ScienceBlogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he extensively discusses and defends both the theory of evolution and his multilevel selection model.

'''Dictation''' is the transcription of spoken text: one person who is "dictating" speaks and another who is "taking dictation" writes down the words as they are spoken. Among speakers of several languages, dictation is used as a test of [[language skill]], similar to [[spelling bee]]s in the English-speaking world. Secondary to teaching language skills, the exercise of dictation has also been used to introduce students to literary works, and to instill morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldrich|first1=Leon W.|last2=Jones|first2=Olivia Mary|title=School Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8EBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|year=1904|publisher=Editors of School Work|pages=62–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first known written use of the word was in 1581. It derives from Latin, ''dictare'' (to assert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictated?show=0&amp;t=1341690020|title=Dictaphone|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

The exercise requires at least two persons: a reciter and a recorder. The reciter reads a selected text, evenly and clearly and at audible volume, by snippets of multiple words (three to ten or as need be). The text is transcribed by the recorders, as the reciter proceeds. Each snippet is read by the reciter at first slowly, then repeated once or twice at a normal pace. Once the selection has been read to the end in this way, the reciter reads the text once again from start to finish at a normal pace.  The recorders then have time to re-read their work, and edit where necessary. The exercise in [[Bloom's taxonomy#Cognitive|knowledge, comprehension and application]] comes to a close.

The [[Bloom's taxonomy|analysis and evaluation]] step now proceeds as follows, upon the revelation of the selected text. The process requires a red pen, and can be varied according to the maturity of the recorders, or as to taste:
* the reciter gathers the written work of the recorders and evaluates it;
* the recorders are given the selection and expected to grade themselves.
The latter auto-evaluation process is quicker, but is sometimes trickier for two reasons: one, the handwriting of the recorder is indistinguishable from that of the evaluator; and two, the severity of the evaluator may be in question as the same person (or class of persons) is employed.

The selected texts are often taken from a sentence, a paragraph or a page of a published book, and may include an homily in morals, honesty or nobility.  Biblical passages or pages from the [[La Fontaine's Fables|''Fables'' of La Fontaine]] have been employed with success throughout the ages.

==Dictation in different languages==

===French===

For speakers of [[French language|French]], ''la dictée'' is a school exercise that aims at testing the mastery of [[orthography]] and [[grammar]]. Since many features of [[French grammar]] are distinguished in writing but not in speech, this can be a challenging task.

Some ''dictées'' became famous for their difficulty or their interest, like those of [[Prosper Mérimée]] and [[Bernard Pivot]]. In several countries of the world (including [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Poland]], and [[Canada]]), the dictations are the subject of structured championships, similar to English [[spelling bee]]s.

===Korean===

In [[South Korea]], ''badasseugi'' ([[Hangul]]: 받아쓰기) is a school exercise for children in the lower grades of [[Primary education|elementary school]]s. The [[Korean language]] is written using [[hangul]], which is basically a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] alphabet; however, Hangul writing is also [[morphophonemic]], so [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] knowledge (in addition to familiarity with hangul) is necessary for correct dictation. Also, [[Phonology|phonological]] rules such as [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], and deletion can cause pronunciation to be different from what the written form may suggest. ''Badasseugi'' may take form of a word, a phrase, or a sentence, and is similar to spelling tests.

===Chinese===

Dictation in Chinese ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 听写 [[Pinyin]]: ''tīng xiě'', literally means 'listen and write') is a vital part of Chinese primary school education curriculum.  [[Chinese characters]] are unique because a single syllable can have different corresponding characters.  Since Chinese dictation is usually done in phrases (i.e. words are made up of more than one characters), this can help the person taking dictation to determine the proper character through phrases. Dictation also increases students' ability to write characters properly.

'''Douglas Ross Hyde''' ({{lang-ga|Dubhghlas de hÍde}}; 17 January 1860 – 12 July 1949), known as '''''An Craoibhín Aoibhinn''''' (lit. "the pleasant little branch"), was an Irish academic, linguist, scholar of the Irish language, politician and diplomat who served as the [[President of Ireland#List of Presidents of Ireland|first President of Ireland]] from June 1938 to June 1945. He was a leading figure in the [[Gaelic revival]], and first President of [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]], one of the most influential cultural organisations in Ireland at the time.

==Background==
Hyde was born at Longford House in Castlerea, County Roscommon, while his mother, Elizabeth [[married and maiden names|née]] Oldfield (1834–1886) was on a short visit there. His father, Arthur Hyde, whose family were originally from Castlehyde, [[Fermoy]], [[County Cork]], was [[Church of Ireland]] [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Kilmactranny, [[County Sligo]] from 1852 to 1867, and it was here that Hyde spent his early years. Arthur Hyde and Elizabeth Oldfield married in [[County Roscommon]], in 1852, and had three other children, Arthur (1853–79 in [[County Leitrim]]), John Oldfield (1854–96 in [[County Dublin]]), and Hugh (1856) Hyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McTernan|first=John C.|title=Worthies of Sligo, Profiles of Eminent Sligonians of Other Days|year=1994|publisher=Avena Publications|location=Sligo|isbn=0-85342-503-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, his father was appointed [[prebendary]] and rector of Tibohine, and the family moved to neighbouring [[Frenchpark]], in County Roscommon. He was home schooled by his father and his aunt due to a childhood illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Douglas_Hyde3344120424 |title=Multitext Project in Irish History--Douglas Hyde |accessdate=31 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001215611/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Douglas_Hyde3344120424 |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a young man, he became fascinated with hearing the old people in the locality speak the [[Irish language]]. He was influenced in particular by the gamekeeper Seamus Hart and his friend's wife, Mrs. Connolly. He was devastated when Hart died (Hyde was 14) and his interest in the Irish language, which was the first language he began to study in any detail, as his own undertaking, flagged for a while. However, he visited Dublin a number of times and realised that there were groups of people, just like him, interested in Irish, a language looked down on at the time by many and seen as backward and old-fashioned.

Rejecting family pressure that, like past generations of Hydes, he would follow a career in the Church, Hyde instead became an academic. He entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he became fluent in French, [[Latin]], German, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], graduating in 1884 as a moderator in modern literature. A medallist of the [[College Historical Society]], he was elected its President in 1931.&lt;ref name="Dunleavy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunleavy|first=Janet &amp; Gareth|title=Douglas Hyde - A Maker of Modern Ireland|year=1991|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0-520-06684-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His passion for Irish, already a language in severe decline, led him to help found [[Conradh na Gaeilge|the Gaelic League]], or in Irish, ''Conradh na Gaeilge'', in 1893.

Hyde married German-born but English-raised [[Lucy Kurtz]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.poemhunter.com/douglas-hyde/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; in 1893 and had two daughters, Nuala and Úna.&lt;ref&gt;The Trustees of FreeBMD (2005). [http://freebmd.rootsweb.com FreeBMD]. Retrieved 12 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conradh na Gaeilge/Gaelic League==
{{main|Conradh na Gaeilge}}
Hyde joined the ''[[Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language]]'' around 1880, and between 1879 and 1884 he published more than a hundred pieces of Irish verse under the [[pen name]] "An Craoibhín Aoibhinn" ("The Pleasant Little Branch").&lt;ref name="OCor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Douglas_Hyde3344120424 |title=Douglas Hyde |last=Ó Corráin |first=Donnchadh |publisher=University College Cork, Multitext Project in Irish History |accessdate=10 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001215611/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Douglas_Hyde3344120424 |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially derided, the Irish language movement gained a mass following. Hyde helped establish the ''[[Gaelic Journal]]'' in 1892; in November, he wrote a manifesto called ''The necessity for de-anglicising the Irish nation'',&lt;ref name="OCor"/&gt; arguing that Ireland should follow their own traditions in language, literature and dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyde|first1=Douglas|title=The necessity for de-anglicizing the Irish nation|url=http://www.gaeilge.org/deanglicising.html|website=gaeilge.org|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, he helped found [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] (the Gaelic League) to encourage the preservation of Irish culture, music, dance and language. A new generation of Irish republicans (including [[Patrick Pearse]], [[Éamon de Valera]], [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] and [[Ernest Blythe]]), became politicised through their involvement in Conradh na Gaeilge. Hyde filled out the 1911 census form in Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000186386/|title=Census of Ireland 1911 - de hÍde|publisher=National Archives of Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DouglasHydepresident.jpg|thumb|Hyde as a young man]]
Uncomfortable at the growing politicisation of the movement, Hyde resigned the presidency in 1915. He was succeeded by the League's co-founder, [[Eoin MacNeill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=John|date=December 1945|title=Eoin Mac Neill 1867–1945|journal=Irish Province of the Society of Jesus|publisher=Irish Province of the Society of Jesus|volume=34|issue=136|pages=433–448|jstor=30100064}}, pp. 439–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grote|first=Georg|title=Torn Between Politics and Culture: the Gaelic League, 1893–1993|location=Münster|publisher=Waxman|year=1994|page=120|isbn=3-89325-243-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senator==
Hyde had no association with [[Sinn Féin]] and the Independence movement. He was elected to [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad Éireann]], the upper house of the [[Irish Free State]]'s [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]] (parliament), at a by-election on 4 February 1925, replacing [[Hutcheson Poë|Sir Hutcheson Poë]].&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;HouseNum=1922&amp;MemberID=1393&amp;ConstID=215|title=Dr. Douglas Hyde|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Irish Seanad election, 1925|1925 Seanad election]], Hyde was eliminated 28th of the 78 candidates, with 19 seats available. The [[Catholic Truth Society]] opposed him for his [[Protestantism]] and publicised his supposed support for divorce. Historians have suggested that the CTS campaign was ineffective,&lt;ref name="sullivan1940"&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Donal |title=The Irish Free State and its Senate: A Study in Contemporary Politics |publisher=[[Faber &amp; Faber]] |location=London |year=1940 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Irish-language advocates performed poorly, with all those endorsed by the Gaelic League losing.&lt;ref name="sullivan1940"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ireland's Unique Electoral Experiment: The Senate Election of 1925 |doi=10.1080/07907180500359327 |first=John |last=Coakley |journal=Irish Political Studies |date = September 2005|volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=231–269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to academia, as Professor of Irish at [[University College Dublin]], where one of his students was future [[Attorney General of Ireland]], [[Chief Justice of Ireland]] and [[President of Ireland]] [[Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh]].

==President of Ireland==
[[File:CBI - SERIES C - FIFTY POUND NOTE.PNG|right|300px|thumb|Hyde is notable in that he was the only leader of independent Ireland to be featured on its banknotes, here on a [[Series C Banknotes (Ireland)|Series C Banknote]] of IR£50.]]

===Nomination===
In April 1938, by now retired from academia, was plucked from retirement by [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] and again appointed to [[Seanad Éireann]]. Again his tenure proved short, even shorter than before. But this time it was because, on the suggestion of [[Fine Gael]], Hyde was chosen after inter-party negotiations as the first [[President of Ireland]], to which he was elected unopposed. He was selected for a number of reasons:

*Both the Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, and the Leader of the Opposition, [[W. T. Cosgrave]], admired him;
*Both wanted a President with universal prestige to lend credibility to the new office, especially since the new 1937 Constitution made it unclear whether the President or the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] was the official head of state;
*Both wanted to purge the humiliation that had occurred when he had lost his Senate seat in 1925;
*Both wanted a President who would prove that there was no danger that the new President would become an authoritarian dictator in Ireland, a widespread fear when the new constitution was being discussed in 1937;
*Both wanted to pay tribute to Hyde's role in promoting the Irish language.
*Both wanted to choose a non-Catholic to disprove the assertion that the State was a "[[confessional state]]".

===Inauguration===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:First-president-25-6-38-3 2.jpg|left|thumb|The inauguration of Douglas Hyde at Dublin Castle.]] --&gt;
Hyde was inaugurated as the first President of Ireland, on 26 June 1938. ''The Irish Times'' reported it as follows:

{{quote|In the morning [Dr Hyde] attended a service in St. Patrick's Cathedral presided over by the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. [[John Gregg (archbishop of Armagh)|Gregg]]. Mr. de Valera and his Ministerial colleagues attended a solemn Votive Mass in the Pro-Cathedral, and there were services in the principal Presbyterian and Methodist churches, as well as in the synagogue. Dr. Hyde was installed formally in Dublin Castle, where the seals of office were handed over by the Chief Justice. Some 200 persons were present, including the heads of the Judiciary and the chief dignitaries of the Churches. After the ceremony President Hyde drove in procession through the beflagged streets. The procession halted for two minutes outside the General Post Office to pay homage to the memory of the men who fell in the Easter Week rebellion of 1916. Large crowds lined the streets from the Castle to the Vice-Regal Lodge and the President was welcomed with bursts of cheering. He wore morning dress, but Mr. de Valera and Mr. [[Sean T. O'Kelly]], who followed Dr. Hyde in the next motor-car, wore black clothes with felt hats.

In the evening there was a ceremony in Dublin Castle which was without precedent in Irish history. Mr. and Mrs. de Valera received about 1,500 guests at a reception in honour of the President. The reception was held in St. Patrick's Hall, where the banners of the Knights of St. Patrick are still hung. The attendance included all the members of the Dail and Senate with their ladies, members of the Judiciary and the chiefs of the Civil Service, Dr. [[Paschal Robinson]], the Papal Nuncio at the head of the Diplomatic Corps, several Roman Catholic Bishops, the Primate of All Ireland, the Archbishop of Dublin, the Bishop of Killaloe, the heads of the Presbyterian and Methodist congregations, the Provost and Vice Provost of Trinity College, and the President of the National University. It was the most colourful event that has been held in Dublin since the inauguration of the new order in Ireland, and the gathering, representing as it did every shade of political, religious, and social opinion in Eire [Ireland], might be regarded as a microcosm of the new Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', 27 June 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hyde set a precedent by reciting the Presidential Declaration of Office in Irish. His recitation, in Roscommon Irish, is one of a few recordings of a dialect of which Hyde was one of the last speakers. Upon inauguration, he moved into the long vacant ''Viceregal Lodge'' in [[Phoenix Park]], since known as [[Áras an Uachtaráin]].

Hyde's selection and inauguration received worldwide media attention and was covered by newspapers in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and even Egypt.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brian Murphy in the Irish Independent; 1 October 2016 ''Hyde, Hitler and why our first president fascinated press around the world''&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler "ordered" the Berlin newspapers "to splash" on the Irish presidential installation ceremony.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, the British government ignored the event.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Northern Ireland Finance Minister, John Miller Andrews, described Hyde's inauguration as a "slight on the King" and "a deplorable tragedy."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Presidency===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Despite being placed in a position to shape the office of the presidency via precedent, Hyde by and large opted for a quiet, conservative interpretation of the office. His age and health obligated him to schedule periods of rest throughout his days, and his lack of political experience caused him to defer to his advisers on questions of policy and discretionary powers, especially to his Secretary, Michael McDunphy. On 13 November 1938, just months after Hyde's inauguration, Hyde attended an international soccer match between Ireland and Poland at Dalymount Park in Dublin. This was seen as breaching the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]]'s ban on 'foreign games' and he was subsequently removed as patron of the GAA, an honour he had held since 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinspress.ie/the-gaa-v-douglas-hyde.html|title=The GAA v Douglas Hyde|author=Cormac Moore|publisher=Collins Press|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after a massive stroke in April 1940, plans were made for his lying-in-state and state funeral. However, Hyde survived, albeit paralysed and having to use a wheelchair.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Although the role of President of Ireland was largely ceremonial, Hyde did make important decisions during his presidency. He was confronted with a crisis in 1944, when de Valera's government unexpectedly collapsed in a vote on the ''Transport Bill'' and the President had to decide whether or not to grant an election to de Valera. Under the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] the President of Ireland may grant or refuse a dissolution of the Dáil to a [[Taoiseach]] who has "ceased to retain the support of a majority in [[Dáil Éireann]]". If a dissolution is granted, a general election is proclaimed to fill the seats now vacated by the dissolution. However, this means that for four to six weeks, until the new [[Dáil]] assembles, there is no Dáil. Fearing this gap might facilitate an invasion during [[World War II]], during which no parliament could be called upon to deal with the invasion, the Oireachtas enacted emergency legislation (under Article 28.3.3°) - [https://web.archive.org/web/20051205033004/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA11Y1943.html the General Elections (Emergency Powers) Act 1943] - which allowed an election to be called separate from a dissolution, with the Dáil only being dissolved just before new Dáil would assemble, so ensuring the gap between Dála (plural of Dáil) would be too short to facilitate an invasion. Under the Act the President could "refuse to proclaim a general election on the advice of a Taoiseach who had ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann".{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Hyde had that option, but after considering it with his senior advisor, Michael McDunphy, he opted to grant de Valera his election request. Hyde twice used his power under Article 26 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]], having consulted the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]], to refer a Bill or part of a Bill to the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]], for the court's decision on whether the Bill or part referred is repugnant to the Constitution (so that the Bill in question cannot be signed into law).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

On the first occasion, the court held that the Bill referred – Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1940 – was not repugnant to the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Article 26 of the Constitution and the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1940'' [1940] IR 470.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the second reference, the Court decided that the particular provision referred – section 4 of the School Attendance Bill, 1942 – was repugnant to the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Article 26 of the Constitution and the School Attendance Bill, 1942'' [1943] IR 334.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Article 34.3.3° of the Constitution, the constitutional validity of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1940/en/act/pub/0002/index.html|title=Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; cannot be challenged in any court, since the Bill which became that Act was found by the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] not to be repugnant in the context of an Article 26 reference.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

One of Hyde's last presidential acts was a visit to the German Ambassador [[Eduard Hempel]], on 3 May 1945, to offer his formal condolences on the [[death of Adolf Hitler]]. The visit remained a secret until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/hyde-and-de-valera-offered-condolences-on-hitlers-death-228426.html|title=Hyde (and de Valera) offered condolences on Hitler's death|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=31 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
Hyde left office on 25 June 1945, opting not to nominate himself for a second term. Due to his ill-health he did not return to his Roscommon home, ''Ratra'', empty since the death of Hyde's wife early in his term. He moved into the former Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant's residence in the grounds of Áras an Uachtaráin, which he renamed ''[[Little Ratra]]'' and where he lived out the remaining four years of his life. He died at 10pm, on 12 July 1949, aged 89.&lt;ref&gt;Announcement of death, The Irish Times 13 July 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

==State funeral==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Douglas Hyde St Patrick's Cathedral Dublin 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Douglas Hyde in [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]].]]
As a former President of Ireland he was accorded a [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]]. A problem arose; as a member of the [[Church of Ireland]], his funeral service took place in Dublin's Church of Ireland [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]]. However, contemporary rules of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland]] prohibited Roman Catholics from attending services in non-Catholic churches. As a result, all but one member of the Catholic cabinet, [[Noël Browne]], remained outside the cathedral grounds while Hyde's funeral took place. They then joined the cortège when his coffin left the cathedral. Éamon de Valera, by now Leader of the Opposition also did not attend, being represented by a senior [[Fianna Fáil]] figure who was a member of the Church of Ireland, [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine H. Childers]], a future President of Ireland himself. Hyde was buried in Frenchpark, County Roscommon at Portahard Church, (where he had spent most of his childhood life) beside his wife Lucy, his daughter Nuala, his sister Annette, mother Elizabeth and father Arthur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3402">'''Entoman''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] created by [[David Füleki]]. He is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[duck]] with [[superhuman]] powers who has major or minor roles in many [[comic book]]s.

==Characteristics==
According to his creator, Entoman is the [[incarnation]] of [[Sigmund Freud|Siegmund Freud's]] [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]&lt;ref&gt;Carolin Fischer (February 1, 2010): "Entoman powered by Comicstars", Retrieved 2010-09-23, http://www.openpr.de/news/392911/Entoman-powered-by-Comicstars.html&lt;/ref&gt;, which means that he does everything he wants without being bound by his conscience. Furthermore, Entoman often shows very crude forms of brutality but also high intelligence and even childish behavior. His only weakness may be his desire for [[ice cream]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7975">'''Governance frameworks''' are the structure of a government and reflect the interrelated relationships, factors, and other influences upon the institution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Governance structure'' is often used interchangeably with ''governance framework'' as they both refer to the structure of the [[governance]] of the organization.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Oliver E.|date=1984-01-01|title=The Economics of Governance: Framework and Implications|jstor=40750687|journal=Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft / Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics|volume=140|issue=1|pages=195–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governance frameworks structure and delineate power and the governing or [[management]] roles in an organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scu.edu.au/governance/index.php/4|title=Governance Framework - Governance - SCU|website=scu.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also set rules, procedures, and other informational guidelines.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charity-commission-governance-framework/governance-framework|title=Governance framework - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, governance frameworks define, guide, and provide for enforcement of these processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These frameworks are shaped by the goals, strategic mandates, financial incentives, and established power structures and processes of the organization.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.claytonutz.com/knowledge/2012/april/writing-good-governance-frameworks-a-how-to-guide|title=Writing good governance frameworks: A how-to guide - Knowledge - Clayton Utz|website=www.claytonutz.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governance frameworks establish and perpetuate the efficiency or lack of efficiency in an organization or institution's ability to meet its goals, and even their public relations and perception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The organization of the governance framework is important for the success of the organization meeting its goals.  [[Sociology|Sociologist]] John Child states that these are connected and, in a circular manner, belief that changes in governance frameworks will succeed positively impacts the chance that the framework will result in the desired changes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Additionally, Williamson suggests that the organization of a governance framework results in economic consequences for that organization.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Frequently, the term ''good governance framework'' references a preferred style of governance that the author believes to be better suited to that industry or organization, especially in relation to public relations, and organizational and financial transparency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications ==
There are examples of the use of governance frameworks in a wide variety of industries, as well as in the government of nation states and the public sector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In their application to specific industries, companies, and problems, governance frameworks appear differently and reflect the unique needs of the group or organization.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Child|first=John|date=1972-01-01|title=Organizational Structure, Environment and Performance: The Role of Strategic Choice|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/003803857200600101|journal=Sociology|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1177/003803857200600101|issn=0038-0385}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the governance structure of [[Information technology|internet technology]] (IT) organizations, multiple frameworks have been suggested by authors connecting IT issues to the underlying theoretical business, [[Sociology of organisations|organizational sociology]], and economic models.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlberg|first=T.|last2=Kivijarvi|first2=H.|date=January 2006|title=An Integrated Framework for IT Governance and the Development and Validation of an Assessment Instrument|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1579685&amp;tag=1|journal=Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)|volume=8|pages=194b–194b|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2006.57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PhD|first=A.

In the public sector's governance frameworks, issues of public opinion and financial transparency tied to the concept of good governance frameworks are important, according to consulting firm Clayton Utz.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.claytonutz.com/ArticleDocuments/178/Clayton-Utz-Governance-Frameworks-Building-The-Framework-2012.pdf.aspx?Embed=Y|title=Governance Frameworks: Building the Framework|last=Utz|first=Clayton|date=|website=Clayton Utz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charity Commission for England and Wales, a public commission responsible for ensuring trustworthiness of registered charities in the United Kingdom emphasizes its motives and mission, and accountability and transparency goals in its governance framework.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It also uses the governance framework to make publicly available its internal organization and leadership structure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Loorbach suggests governance frameworks for nation state governments' development which challenge current paradigms and that he suggests will lead to more sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loorbach|first=Derk|date=2010-01-01|title=Transition Management for Sustainable Development: A Prescriptive, Complexity-Based Governance Framework|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01471.x/abstract|journal=Governance|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=161–183|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01471.x|issn=1468-0491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8965">[[Image:Greek manuscript vetustissimus Thucydides.png|thumb|right|250px|Earliest type of minuscule writing, from a 10th-century manuscript of [[Thucydides]].]]
[[Image:Greek manuscript minuscule Aristotle.png|thumb|right|250px|Later minuscule, 15th-century manuscript of [[Aristotle]].]]
The '''minuscule''' script was a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] writing style which was developed as a book hand in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts during the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt; It replaced the earlier style of [[uncial script|uncial]] writing, from which it differed in using smaller, more rounded and more connected letter forms, and in using a large number of [[Greek ligatures|ligatures]]. Many of these forms had previously developed as parts of more informal [[cursive]] writing. The basic letter shapes used in the minuscule script are the ancestors of modern [[lower case]] Greek letters.

From the 10th century onwards, most Byzantine manuscripts of classical and early Christian Greek works were gradually rewritten in the new minuscule style, and few of the older uncial manuscripts were preserved. For this reason, uncial manuscripts are today extremely rare, while early minuscule manuscripts are often the oldest preserved sources attesting an ancient work and may therefore be of central importance for its [[philology|philological]] study. Manuscripts from the oldest phase of minuscule writing (mid-9th to mid-10th century) are known in scholarship today as ''codices vetustissimi'' ("oldest codices"). Those from the mid-10th to the mid-12th centuries are known as ''codices vetusti'' ("old codices"), and later ones as ''codices recentiores'' ("newer codices").&lt;ref name="thompson159"/&gt;

Minuscule writing remained in use for handwriting throughout the Byzantine and into the post-Byzantine era. In the modern era, western printers used minuscule book hands as a model for developing early Greek print fonts. Like with Latin, it became common to mix minuscule writing with some uncial or [[Capital letter|capital]] letters, with the latter used for emphasis, in titles and initials. From this practice, the modern orthographic system of [[letter case]] for Greek arose. In modern Greek writing, the upper case letters are generally modeled on the letter shapes of ancient inscriptions, while the lower case letters are based on the tradition of minuscule handwriting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">'''Gruppo dei Sei''' (Group of Six) or '''Sei di Torino''' (Six from Turin) was a group of painters who emerged under the mentorship of [[Felice Casorati]] in [[Turin]] in the late 1920s. They exhibited together for three years starting in 1929. Although each artist had an individual style, they were linked together by the influence of Parisian [[post-impressionism]] and [[fauvism]], including the work of [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and their anti-fascist ideology – a position that set them apart from other movements like [[Novecento Italiano]] and [[Futurism]]. 

The six artists in the group were:

* [[Jessie Boswell]] ([[Leeds]], 1881 - [[Moncrivello]], 1956),
* [[Gigi Chessa]] (Turin, 1898 - Turin, 1935),
* [[Nicola Galante]], ([[Vasto]], 1883 - [[Turin]], 1969),
* [[Carlo Levi]] (Turin, 1902 - [[Rome]], 1975), 
* [[Francesco Menzio]] (Turin, 1899 - Turin, 1979),
* [[Enrico Paulucci Delle Roncole]] (Genoa, 1901 - Turin, 1999).

Their association was championed by art critics like [[Edoardo Persico]] and [[Lionello Venturi]] and contemporary art collector [[Riccardo Gualino]] who, together with his wife, had purchased a theater in Turin where he was endorsing avante garde music concerts, dances, art events and plays.

The six artists first exhibited together in the spring of 1929 at Galleria Guglielmi in Turin. In November the same year they had two other shows at Circolo della Stampa in [[Genoa]] and at Galleria Bardi in [[Milan]] (later to be known as Galleria Il Milione). A combination of personal and political disagreements eventually contributed to split the group apart, along with Gualino's decision to withdraw his financial support following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and his being put under [[house arrest]] by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government. Levi, Menzio, and Paulucci delle Roncole continued to exhibit together until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Article assembled from Italian wikipedia entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hau''' is a notion made popular by the French anthropologist [[Marcel Mauss]] in his 1925 book ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss M., ''The gift; forms and functions of exchange in archaic societies'', Translated by Ian Gunnison with an Introduction by . E. [[Evans-Pritchard]], London: Cohen and West, 1966: [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying the practice of gifting, he came to the conclusion that it involved belief in a force binding the receiver and giver. The term 'Hau', used by the [[Māori people|Maori]], became a paradigmatic example for such a view.&lt;ref&gt;MacCormack G., Mauss and the 'Spirit'of the Gift, Oceania,  Vol. 52, No. 4, Jun., 1982 p.286 [[Jstor]]&lt;/ref&gt; Writing at the turn of the century{{when?|date=August 2014}}, Mauss relied on limited sources but his analysis has been expanded and refined.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Godelier]], ''The enigma of the gift''.

'''Islamic architecture''' encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the early [[history of Islam]] to the present day for  today it is known as Islamic architecture was influenced by [[Roman architecture|Roman]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], [[Persian architecture|Persian]] and all other lands which the Muslims conquered in the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer"&gt;Krautheimer, Richard.

It developed distinct characteristics in the form of buildings, and the decoration of surfaces with [[Islamic calligraphy]] and geometric and interlace patterned ornament.  The principal Islamic architectural types for large or public buildings are: the [[Mosque]], the [[Tomb]], the [[Palace]] and the [[Fort]]. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used for other buildings such as [[public baths]], [[Fountain|fountains]] and domestic architecture.&lt;ref name="Cop149"&gt;Copplestone, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1158658332974&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout A Tour of Architecture in Islamic Cities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the buildings which are mentioned in this article are listed as [[World Heritage Site]]s. Some of them, like the [[Citadel of Aleppo]], have suffered significant damage in the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="unesco 20/6/13"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1038 UNESCO: Syria's Six World Heritage sites placed on List of World Heritage in Danger". 20 June 2013, accessed 1 February 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different approaches are taken to study traditional Islamic architecture, historical and conceptual, Nader Ardalan is one of those to analysed traditional Islamic architecture based on Gnosticism 

== Beginning ==
According to one set of views, Islam started during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] in the [[7th century]] [[Common Era|CE]],&lt;ref name="Watt2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Watt |first=William Montgomery |authorlink=W.

The most recent building that can be known as a true example modern Islamic architecture is Imam Sadiq University, this building was the winner of Aga Khan fundation as well.

The [[Dome of the Rock]] ({{lang-ar|قُـبَّـة ٱلـصَّـخْـرَة|Qubbat aṣ-Ṣakhrah}}) in [[Jerusalem]] (691) is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture. It is patterned after the nearby [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]&lt;ref&gt;Avner, Rina [https://books.google.com/books?id=hs1YQ-RO7lwC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Origin+of+the+plan+of+the+Dome+of+the+Rock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zaboUcTqCej8yAGH_4C4Ag&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Origin%20of%20the%20plan%20of%20the%20Dome%20of%20the%20Rock&amp;f=false "The Dome of the Rock in Light of the development of Concentric Martyria in Jerusalem"] article in "Muqarnas: An annual on the visual cultures of the Islamic World" Vol 27, Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands, 2010, p. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Byzantine]] [[Christian]] artists were employed to create its elaborate [[mosaics]] against a golden background.&lt;ref name="Krautheimer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Martin Biddle. p.68&lt;/ref&gt; The great epigraphic vine [[frieze]] was adapted from the pre-Islamic [[Syrian]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Finbarr Barry [https://books.google.com/books?id=r5f8kxIyykQC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22dome+of+the+rock%22+epigraphic+frieze&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IgcLUv_gDqGs2gW-ooCIAQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dome%20of%20the%20rock%22%20epigraphic%20frieze&amp;f=false The Great Mosque of Damascus: Studies on the Makings of an Umayyad Visual Culture] Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands, 2000, p. 67–68. "The vine frieze finds various counterparts in the decoration of pre-Islamic Syrian temples and churches&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dome of the Rock]] featured interior vaulted spaces, a circular dome, and the use of stylized repeating decorative [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] patterns. Desert palaces in [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]] (for example, [[Mshatta facade|Mshatta]], [[Qasr Amra]], and [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]]) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated to promote an image of royal luxury.

The [[horseshoe arch]] became a popular feature in Islamic structures. Some suggest the Muslims acquired this from the [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigoths]] in Spain but they may have obtained it from Syria and Persia where the [[horseshoe arch]] had been in use by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantines]]. In Moorish architecture, the curvature of the horseshoe arch is much more accentuated. Furthermore, alternating colours were added to accentuate the effect of its shape. This can be seen at a large scale in their major work, the [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-man-of-cercles.org/articles/the_horseshoe_arch.pdf|title=Green-man-of-cercles.org|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque]] of [[Damascus]] (completed in 715 by caliph Al-Walid I),&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, Robert. Islamic Art and Architecture, Thames &amp; Hudson World of Art series; 1999, London. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; built on the site of the [[basilica]] of [[John the Baptist]] after the Islamic invasion of [[Damascus]], still bore great resemblance to 6th and 7th century Christian [[basilicas]]. Certain modifications were implemented, including expanding the structure along the transversal axis which better fit with the Islamic style of prayer.

The [[Abbasid dynasty]] (750 [[AD]]&lt;nowiki&gt;-&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1258&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, World of Art&lt;/ref&gt;) witnessed the movement of the capital from [[Damascus]] to [[Baghdad]], and then from Baghdad to [[Samarra]]. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. The [[Great Mosque of Samarra]], once the largest in the world, was built for the new capital. Other major mosques built in the Abbasid Dynasty include the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in Cairo, [[Abu Dalaf]] in Iraq, the great mosque in [[Tunis]]. Abbasid architecture in [[Iraq]] as exemplified in the [[Fortress of Al-Ukhaidir]] (c.775-6) demonstrated the "despotic and the pleasure-loving character of the dynasty" in its grand size but cramped living quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (in [[Tunisia]]) is considered the ancestor of all the mosques in the western Islamic world. Its original marble columns and sculptures were of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] workmanship brought in from [[Carthage]] and other elements resemble Roman form.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, Graham [https://books.google.com/books?id=5sYRAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kairouan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bgEMUs_MIIS72wWHyIHgBQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mosque&amp;f=false Tunis, Kairouan &amp; Carthage: described and illustrated with forty-eight paintings] William Heinemann, London, 1908, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.

The [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] in [[Iraq]], completed in 847 AD, combined the [[hypostyle]] architecture of rows of columns supporting a flat base above which a huge spiraling [[minaret]] was constructed.

The [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]] also influenced Islamic architecture. When the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s captured the city from the [[Byzantine]]s, they converted the [[basilica]] to a [[mosque]] (now a museum) and incorporated [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine architectural]] elements into their own work (e.g. [[domes]]). The Hagia Sophia also served as a model for many Ottoman mosques such as the Shehzade Mosque, the [[Suleiman Mosque]], and the [[Rüstem Pasha Mosque]].  Domes are a major structural feature of Islamic architecture. The dome first appeared in Islamic architecture in 691 with the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]], a near replica of the existing [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] and other [[Christian]] domed [[basilica]]s situated nearby. Domes remain in use, being a significant feature of many mosques and of the [[Taj Mahal]] in the 17th century. The distinctive pointed domes of Islamic architecture, also originating with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Sassanian Empire|Persians]],&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Charles Anthony [http://www.sas.upenn.edu/ancient/masons/Stweart-Flying_Buttresses.pdf Flying Buttress and Pointed Arch in Byzantine Cyprus] Accessed August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Karamagara Bridge]] and [[Byzantine architecture]] and [[Taq-i-Kisra]].&lt;/ref&gt; have remained a distinguishing feature of mosques into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, O. (2006) p.87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen (2003), p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing [[Motif (art)|motif]]s of Islamic architecture have always been the [[mathematics and architecture|mathematical themes]] of ordered repetition, radiating structures, and rhythmic, metric patterns. In this respect, [[fractal geometry]] has been a key utility, especially for mosques and palaces. Other significant features employed as motifs include columns, piers and arches, organized and interwoven with alternating sequences of niches and colonnettes.&lt;ref&gt;Tonna (1990), pp.182–197&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

=== Assimilation of earlier traditions ===
From the eighth to the eleventh century, Islamic architectural styles were influenced by two different ancient traditions:

# '''Greco-Roman tradition:''' In particular, the regions of the newly conquered [[Byzantine Empire]] (Southwestern Anatolia, Syria, Egypt and the [[Maghreb]]) supplied architects, masons, mosaicists and other craftsmen to the new Islamic rulers. These artisans were trained in [[Byzantine architecture]] and decorative arts, and continued building and decorating in Byzantine style, which had developed out of [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] and [[Ancient Roman architecture|ancient Roman]] architecture.
# '''Eastern tradition:''' [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Persia]], despite adopting elements of Hellenistic and Roman representative style, retained their independent architectural traditions, which derived from [[Sasanian architecture]] and its predecessors.&lt;ref name="Hoag_p7_9"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoag|first1=John D.|title=Islamic architecture|date=2004|publisher=Electaarchitecture|location=Milan|isbn=978-1-904313-29-8|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition process between late Antiquity, or post-classical, and Islamic architecture is exemplified by archaeologic findings in North Syria and Palestine, the [[Bilad al-Sham]] of the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties. In this region, late antique, or Christian, architectural traditions merged with the pre-Islamic Arabian heritage of the conquerors. Recent research on the history of [[Islamic art]] and architecture has revised a number of [[colonialism|colonialistic]] ideas. Specifically, the following questions are currently subject to renewed discussions in the light of recent findings and new concepts of cultural history:
# The existence of a linear development within the Islamic architecture;
# the existence of an inter- and intracultural hierarchy of styles;
# questions of cultural authenticity and its delineation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Karin Bartl, Abd al-Razzaq Moaz (Eds.)| title=Residences, castles, settlements. Transformation processes from late antiquity to early Islam in Bilad al-Sham| year=2009| publisher=Marie Leidorf GmbH| location=Rahden/Germany| isbn=978-3-89646-654-9| page=XV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to earlier research, the assimilation and transformation of pre-existing architectural traditions is investigated under the aspect of mutual intra- and intercultural exchange of ideas, technologies and styles as well as artists, architects, and materials. In the area of art and architecture, the [[Rise of Islam]] is seen as a continuous transformation process leading from late Antiquity to the Islamic period. Early research into the area regarded the early Islamic architecture merely as a break with the past, from which apparently rose a distorted and less expressive form of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bourgoin| first=Jules| title=Les arts Arabes| year=1867| publisher=A. Morel| location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a degenerate imitation of the post-classical architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Giovanni Theresia Rivoira, Gordon M.

Its origin and development| year=1918| publisher=Oxford University Press}} [https://archive.org/details/moslemarchitect00rushgoog online], accessed 26 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Modern concepts tend to regard the transition between the cultures rather as a selective process of informed appropriation and transformation. The Umayyads played a crucial role in this process of transforming and thereby enriching the existing architectural traditions, or, in a more general sense, of the visual culture of the nascent Islamic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Flood| first=Finbarr B.| title=The great mosque of Damascus.

=== Paradise garden ===
[[File:Afif abad.jpg|thumb|[[Afif-Abad Garden]], [[Shiraz]]]]
{{Main|Paradise garden}}

Gardens and water have for many centuries played an essential role in Islamic culture, and are often compared to the garden of [[Paradise]]. The comparison originates from the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. In his dialogue "[[Oeconomicus]]", [[Xenophon]] has [[Socrates]] relate the story of the Spartan general [[Lysander]]'s visit to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] prince [[Cyrus the Younger]], who shows the Greek his "Paradise at Sardis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Xenephon |title=Oeconomicus |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1173/1173-h/1173-h.htm |website=Gutenberg Press |accessdate=11 June 2015|date=January 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical form of the Persian [[Paradise garden]], or the ''[[Charbagh]]'', comprises a rectangular irrigated space with elevated pathways, which divide the garden into four sections of equal size:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the hallmarks of Persian gardens is the four-part garden laid out with axial paths that intersect at the garden's centre. This highly structured geometrical scheme, called the chahar bagh, became a powerful metaphor for the organization and domestication of the landscape, itself a symbol of political territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. Fairchild Ruggles]], ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A charbagh from Achaemenid time has been identified in the archaeological excavations at [[Pasargadae]]. The gardens of [[Chehel Sotoun]]  ([[Isfahan]]), [[Fin Garden]] ([[Kashan]]), [[Eram Garden]] ([[Shiraz]]), [[Shazdeh Garden]] ([[Mahan, Iran|Mahan]]), [[Dowlatabad Garden]] ([[Yazd]]), [[Abbasabad Garden]] ([[Abbasabad, Mazandaran|Abbasabad]]), [[Akbarieh Garden]] ([[South Khorasan Province]]), [[Pahlevanpour Garden]], all in [[Iran]], form part of the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1372|title=The Persian Garden|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=Whc.unesco.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large Paradise gardens are also found at the [[Taj Mahal]] ([[Agra]]), and at [[Humayun's Tomb]] ([[New Delhi]]), in India; the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] ([[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]) or at the [[Alhambra]] and [[Generalife]] in [[Granada]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Hoag_p7_9" /&gt;

=== Courtyard (Sehan) ===
[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], with a large courtyard (''sehan'') surrounded by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s, [[Kairouan]], Tunisia.]]
The traditional Islamic [[courtyard]], a ''sehan'' ({{lang-ar| صحن}}), is found in secular and religious structures.
#When within a residence or other secular building is a private courtyard and walled garden. It is used for: the aesthetics of plants, water, architectural elements, and natural light; for cooler space with fountains and shade, and source of breezes into the structure, during summer heat; and a protected and proscribed place where the women of the house need not be covered in the [[hijab]] clothing traditionally necessary in public.
#A ''sehan''—courtyard is in within almost every mosque in Islamic architecture. The courtyards are open to the sky and surrounded on all sides by structures with halls and rooms, and often a shaded semi-open arcade. Sehans usually feature a centrally positioned ritual cleansing pool under an open domed pavilion called a '''''[[howz]]'''''. A mosque courtyard is used for performing ablutions, and a 'patio' for rest or gathering.

=== Hypostyle hall ===
A [[Hypostyle]], i.e., an open hall supported by columns combined with a reception hall set at right angle to the main hall, is considered to be derived from architectural traditions of [[Achaemenids|Achaemenid period]] Persian assembly halls (''"[[apadana]]"''). This type of building originated from the [[Roman architecture|Roman]]-style [[basilica]] with an adjacent courtyard surrounded by [[colonnade]]s, like [[Trajan's Forum]] in Rome. The Roman type of building has developed out of the [[Greek architecture|Greek]] [[agora]]. In Islamic architecture, the hypostyle hall is the main feature of the hypostyle mosque. One of the earliest hypostyle mosques is the [[Tarikhaneh Temple|Tarikhaneh Mosque]] in Iran, dating back to the 8th century.&lt;ref name="Hoag_p7_9" /&gt;

=== Vaulting ===
In Islamic buildings, [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] follows two distinct architectural styles: Whilst [[Umayyad architecture]] continues Syrian traditions of the 6th and 7th century, Eastern Islamic architecture was mainly influenced by [[Sasanian architecture|Sasanian]] styles and forms.

==== Umayyad diaphragm arches and barrel vaults ====
[[File:Qasr Amra 21.jpg|thumb|Qusair 'Amra]]

In their vaulting structures, Umayyad period buildings show a mixture of ancient Roman and Persian architectural traditions. [[Diaphragm arch]]es with lintelled ceilings made of wood or stone beams, or, alternatively, with barrel vaults, were known in the [[Levant]] since the classical and [[Nabataeans|Nabatean]] period. They were mainly used to cover houses and cisterns. The architectural form of covering diaphragm arches with barrel vaults, however, was likely newly introduced from [[Iranian architecture]], as similar vaulting was not known in [[Bilad al-Sham]] before the arrival of the Umayyads. However, this form was well known in [[Iran]] from early [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times, as exemplified in the Parthian buildings of [[Assur|Aššur]]. The earliest known example for barrel vaults resting on diaphragm arches from [[Umayyad architecture]] is known from Qasr Harane in Syria. During the early period, the diaphragm arches are built from coarsely cut limestone slabs, without using supporting [[falsework]], which were connected by [[gypsum]] [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Later-period vaults were erected using pre-formed lateral ribs modelled from gypsum, which served as a temporal formwork to guide and center the vault. These ribs, which were left in the structure afterwards, do not carry any load. The ribs were cast in advance on strips of cloth, the impression of which can still be seen in the ribs today. Similar structures are known from [[Sasanian architecture]], for example from the palace of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]]. Umayyad-period vaults of this type were found in [[Amman Citadel]] and in [[Qasr Amra]].&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Arce (2006): ''Umayyad arches, vaults &amp; domes: Merging and re-creation. Contributions to early Islamic construction history.'' In: Proceedings of the second international congress on construction history Vol. I. Queen's College, Cambridge University 29.03.–02.04.2006, S. 195–220 [http://www.arct.cam.ac.uk/Downloads/ichs/vol-1-195-220-arce.pdf PDF], accessed 1 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iberian Peninsula ====
The double-arched system of [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] of the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba]] is generally considered to be derived from [[Roman Architecture|Roman]] [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] like the nearby [[Acueducto de los Milagros|aqueduct of Los Milagros]]. Columns are connected by [[horseshoe arch]]es, and support pillars of [[brickwork]], which are in turn interconnected by semicircular arches supporting the flat timberwork ceiling.

&lt;center&gt;

File:Aljaferia - Portique nord.JPG|Arcades of the [[Aljafería]] of Zaragoza
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In later-period additions to the Mosque of Córdoba, the basic architectural design was changed: Horseshoe arches were now used for the upper row of arcades, which is now supported by five-pass arches. In sections which now supported [[dome]]s, additional supporting structures were needed to bear the [[thrust]] of the cupolas. The architects solved this problem by the construction of intersecting three- or five-pass arches. The three domes spanning the vaults above the [[mihrab]] wall are constructed as ribbed vaults. Rather than meeting in the center of the dome, the ribs intersect one another off-center, forming an eight-pointed star in the center which is superseded by a [[pendentive]] dome.&lt;ref name=Giese-Vogeli&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giese-Vögeli|first1=Francine|title=Das islamische Rippengewölbe : Ursprung, Form, Verbreitung = Islamic rib vaults: Origins, form, spread|date=2007|publisher=Gebr. Mann|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-7861-2550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ribbed vaults of the mosque-cathedral of Córdoba served as models for later mosque buildings in the Islamic West of [[al-Andaluz]] and the [[Maghreb]]. At around 1000 AD, the ''Mezquita de Bab al Mardum'' (today: [[Mosque of Cristo de la Luz]]) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] was constructed with a similar, eight-ribbed dome. Similar domes are also seen in the mosque building of the [[Aljafería]] of [[Zaragoza]]. The architectural form of the ribbed dome was further developed in the Maghreb: The central dome of the Great Mosque of [[Tlemcen]], a masterpiece of the [[Almoravids]] built in 1082, has twelve slender ribs, the shell between the ribs is filled with filigree stucco work.&lt;ref name="Giese-Vogeli" /&gt;

Because of its long history of building and re-building, spanning the time from the [[Abbasids]] to the [[Qajar dynasty]], and its excellent state of conservation, the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan]] provides an overview over the experiments Islamic architects conducted with complicated vaulting structures.&lt;ref name="Giese-Vogeli_P66_88"&gt;{{citation/core |Surname1=Francine Giese-Vögeli |Authorlink1= |EditorSurname1= |Periodical= |Title=Das islamische Rippengewölbe: Ursprung – Form – Verbreitung |Edition= |Volume= |Issue= |Publisher=Gebr.

The system of [[squinch]]es, which is a construction filling in the upper angles of a square room so as to form a base to receive an [[octagon]]al or [[sphere|spherical]] [[dome]], was already known in [[Sasanian architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Schippmann| first1=Klaus| title=Die iranischen Feuerheiligtümer = Iranian Fire temples| date=1971| publisher=Walter de Gruyter| location=Berlin| isbn=978-3-11-001879-0| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWwiAAAAQBAJ| accessdate=23 January 2016| language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spherical trigonometry|spherical triangles]] of the squinches were split up into further subdivisions or systems of niches, resulting in a complex interplay of supporting structures forming an ornamental spatial pattern which hides the weight of the structure.

The "non-radial rib vault", an architectural form of ribbed vaults with a superimposed spherical dome, is the characteristic architectural vault form of the Islamic East. From its beginnings in the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, this form of vault was used in a sequence of important buildings up to the period of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] architecture. Its main characteristics are:&lt;ref name="Giese-Vogeli_P66_88" /&gt;
# Four intersecting ribs, at times redoubled and intersected to form an eight-pointed star;
# the omission of a transition zone between the vault and the supporting structure;
# a central dome or [[roof lantern]] on top of the ribbed vault.

While intersecting pairs of ribs from the main decorative feature of [[Seljuk architecture]], the ribs were hidden behind additional architectural elements in later periods, as exemplified in the dome of the [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar]] in [[Merv]], until they finally disappeared completely behind the double shell of a stucco dome, as seen in the dome of [[Ālī Qāpū]] in Isfahan.&lt;ref name="Giese-Vogeli_P66_88" /&gt;

==== Domes ====
Based on the model of pre-existing [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[dome]]s, the [[Ottoman Architecture]] developed a specific form of monumental, representative building: Wide central domes with huge diameters were erected on top of a centre-plan building. Despite their enormous weight, the domes appear virtually weightless. Some of the most elaborate domed buildings have been constructed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architect [[Mimar Sinan]].

When the Ottomans had conquered [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], they found a variety of Byzantine Christian churches, the largest and most prominent amongst them was the [[Hagia Sophia]]. The brickwork-and-mortar ribs and the spherical shell of the central dome of the Hagia Sophia were built simultaneously, as a self-supporting structure without any wooden [[centring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Auguste Choisy| title=L'art de bâtir chez les Byzantins| year=1883| publisher=Librairie de la société anonyme| location=Paris| pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Byzantine church of [[Hagia Irene]], the ribs of the dome vault are fully integrated into the shell, similar to Western [[Roman architecture|Roman]] domes, and thus are not visible from within the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Ebersoll |author2=Adolphe Thiers | title=Les églises de Constantinople| date=1913| publisher=Ernest Leroux| location=Paris| page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dome of the Hagia Sophia, the ribs and shell of the dome unite in a central medallion at the apex of the dome, the upper ends of the ribs being integrated into the shell: Shell and ribs form one single structural entity. In later Byzantine buildings, like the [[Kalenderhane Mosque]], the [[Eski Imaret Mosque]] (formerly the Monastery of Christ Pantepoptes) or the Pantokrator Monastery (today: [[Zeyrek Mosque]]), the central medallion of the apex and the ribs of the dome became separate structural elements: The ribs are more pronounced and connect to the central medallion, which also stands out more pronouncedly, so that the entire construction gives the impression as if ribs and medallion are separate from, and underpin, the proper shell of the dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Ebersoll |author2=Adolphe Thiers | title=Les églises de Constantinople| date=1913| publisher=Ernest Leroux| location=Paris| pages=100–117; 178–188; 192–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mimar Sinan solved the structural issues of the Hagia Sophia dome by constructing a system of centrally symmetric pillars with flanking semi-domes, as exemplified by the design of the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] (four pillars with two flanking shield walls and two semi-domes, 1550–1557), the [[Rüstem Pasha Mosque]] (eight pillars with four diagonal semi-domes, 1561–1563), and the [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]] (eight pillars with four diagonal semi-domes, 1567/8–1574/5). In the history of architecture, the structure of the Selimiye Mosque has no precedent. All elements of the building subordinate to its great dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Art and Architecture of Islam 1250–1800 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mhIgewDtNkC&amp;pg=PA226 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-300-06465-0 |first=Sheila |last=Blair |first2=Jonathan M. |last2=Bloom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/3588/doc/dpt0810.pdf Doğan Kuban: ''The Style of Sinan's Domed Structures.'' in: Muqarnas IV: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture.

=== Muqarnas ===
{{Main|Muqarnas}}
The architectural element of muqarnas developed in northeastern Iran and the Maghreb around the middle of the 10th century. The ornament is created by the geometric subdivision of a vaulting structure into miniature, superimposed pointed-arch substructures, also known as "honeycomb", or "stalactite" vaults. Made from different materials like stone, brick, wood or stucco, its use in architecture spread over the entire Islamic world. In the Islamic West, muqarnas are also used to adorn the outside of a dome, cupola, or similar structure, whilst in the East is more limited to the interior face of a vault.

=== Ornaments ===
{{Main|Islamic interlace patterns|Islamic geometric patterns|Arabesque}}

As a common feature, Islamic architecture makes use of specific ornamental forms, including mathematically complicated, elaborate [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] and [[Islamic interlace patterns|interlace patterns]], floral motifs like the [[arabesque]], and elaborate [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]] inscriptions, which serve to decorate a building, specify the intention of the building by the selection of the textual program of the inscriptions. For example, the calligraphic inscriptions adorning the [[Dome of the Rock]] include quotations from the Quran (e.g., Quran 19:33–35) which reference the miracle of Jesus and his human nature.

The geometric or floral, interlaced forms, taken together, constitute an infinitely repeated pattern that extends beyond the visible material world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA9Uuy2cSIcC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22the+arabesque+is%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=_2t2TI_dO4X54gbv5cjbBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20arabesque%20is%22&amp;f=false Sheila R. Canby, ''Islamic art in detail'', page 26. Harvard University Press, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; To many in the Islamic world, they symbolize the concept of infinite proves of existence of one eternal God. The repetitiveness, simplicity contrasted with complexity and percision suggests that our complex universe is only one of the many manifestations of the infinitely obvious and present Allah, the one God. Furthermore, the Islamic artist conveys a definite spirituality without the [[icon]]ography of [[Christian art]]. Non-figural ornaments are used in mosques and buildings around the Muslim world, and it is a way of decorating using beautiful, embellishing and repetitive Islamic art [[Aniconism in Islam|instead of using pictures of humans and animals]] (which some Muslims believe is forbidden (''[[Haram]]'') in Islam).

Instead of recalling something related to the reality of the [[spoken word]], calligraphy for the Muslim is a visible expression of spiritual concepts. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The [[holy book]] of Islam, al-[[Qur'ān]], has played a vital role in the development of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. [[Proverb]]s and complete passages from the Qur'an are still active sources for Islamic calligraphy. Contemporary artists in the Islamic world draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions in their work.

=== Architectural forms ===
Many forms of Islamic architecture have evolved in different regions of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]. Notable Islamic architectural types include the early [[Abbasid]] buildings, T-Type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of [[Anatolia]]. The [[Petroleum|oil]]-wealth of the 20th century drove a great deal of mosque construction using designs from leading modern architects.

''Arab-plan'' or ''hypostyle'' mosques are the earliest type of mosques, pioneered under the [[Umayyad Dynasty]]. These mosques are square or rectangular in plan with an enclosed courtyard and a covered prayer hall. Historically, because of the warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques have flat roofs on top of prayer halls, necessitating the use of numerous [[column]]s and [[Support (structure)|support]]s.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Masdjid. I. In the central Islamic lands | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | issn = 1573-3912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain]], as the building is supported by over 850 columns.&lt;ref name="mit-handout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s so that visitors can enjoy some shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and [[Abbasid]] dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, and as a result, these mosques gradually fell out of popularity.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"/&gt;

[[Ottoman Dynasty|The Ottomans]] introduced ''central dome mosques'' in the 15th century and have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having one large dome at the center, there are often smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed.&lt;ref name="mit-vocab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051124083425/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style was heavily influenced by the [[Byzantine]] religious architecture with its use of large central domes.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"/&gt;

=== Specific architectural elements ===
[[File:Ayyubid wall cyark.jpg|thumb|Plan view of Bab al-Barqiyya along [[Ayyubid]] Wall. Located close to one of Cairo's main modern traffic arteries, al-Azhar Street, the Fatimid-era Bab al-Barqiyya fortified gate was constructed with interlocking volumes that surrounded the entrant in such a way as to provide greater security and control than typical city wall gates. Laser scan data from an [[Aga Khan Foundation]]/[[CyArk]] research partnership.]]
Islamic architecture may be identified with the following design elements, which were inherited from the first mosque buildings (originally a feature of the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]]).

* [[Minaret]]s or towers (these were originally used as torch-lit watchtowers, as seen in the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]]; hence the derivation of the word from the Arabic ''nur'', meaning "light"). The minaret of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]] is considered as the oldest surviving minaret in the world.&lt;ref name="minaret"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=kairouan+oldest+minaret&amp;lr=&amp;cd=22#v=onepage&amp;q=kairouan%20oldest%20minaret&amp;f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'']. World Wisdom. 2009. p.128&lt;/ref&gt; It has the shape of a square massive tower of three superimposed sections.&lt;ref name="minaret"/&gt;
* A four-[[iwan]] plan, with three subordinate halls and one principal one that faces toward Mecca
* [[Mihrab]] or [[niche (architecture)|prayer niche]] on an inside wall indicating the direction to [[Mecca]].
* [[Dome]]s and [[Cupola]]s.  In South East Asia ([[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]), these are very recent additions.
* Pishtaq is the formal gateway to the [[iwan]], usually the main prayer hall of a mosque, a vaulted hall or space, walled on three sides, with one end entirely open; a [[Persian language|Persian]] term for a portal projecting from the facade of a building, usually decorated with calligraphy bands, glazed tilework, and geometric designs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0502 Dictionary of Islamic architecture: Pishtaq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172823/https://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0502 |date=2011-06-29 }}  archnet.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pishtaq"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461774/pishtaq Pishtaq] ''[[Britannica.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iwans to intermediate between different pavilions.

=== Qibla ===
The ''[[Qibla]]h'' ({{lang-ar|قِـبْـلَـة}}) is the direction in which [[Mecca]] is from any given location, and within Islamic architecture it is a major component of both the features and the orientation of the building itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=David|date=Aug 1, 1995|title=The Orientation of Medieval Islamic Religious Architecture and Cities|url=|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=26| issue = 3|pages=253–274|via=ProQuest|bibcode=1995JHA....26..253K|doi=10.1177/002182869502600305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Islamic cities and the ''[[Mihrab]]'' in mosques were meant to be built facing in this direction, yet when actually observing the layout of such areas they do not all point to the same place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is due to discrepancies in the calculations of the Islamic scientists in the past who determined where Mecca was from their individual locations. Scholars note that these differences come about for a multitude of reasons, such as some misunderstanding the meaning of Qibla itself, the fact that the geographic coordinates of the past do not line up with the coordinates of today, and that the determination of this direction was more an astronomical calculation, rather than a mathematical one. Early mosques were constructed according to either the calculations of what direction Qibla was approximately, or with the Mihrab facing south, as that was the direction that the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was facing when he prayed in [[Medina]], which is a city directly north of Mecca&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Towns and cities ==

=== Urban and nomadic life according to Ibn Khaldun ===
During its history, the society of the pre-modern Islamic world was dominated by two important social contexts, [[Nomads|nomadic life]] and [[Urbanism]]. The historian and politician [[Ibn Khaldun]] thoroughly discusses both concepts in his book [[Muqaddimah]]. According to him, the way of life and culture of the rural [[bedouin]] nomads and the townspeople are opposed in a central [[Conflict (process)|social conflict]]. Ibn Khaldun explains the rise and fall of civilizations by his concept of [[Asabiyyah]] ("bond of cohesion", or "family loyalty"), as exemplified by the rule of the [[caliph]]s. Bedouins, being the nomadic inhabitants of the steppe and the desert, are interconnected by strong bonds of asabiyyah and firm religious beliefs. These bonds tend to slacken in urban communities over some generations. In parallel, by losing their asabiyyah, the townspeople also lose the power to defend themselves, and fall victims to more aggressive tribes which may destroy the city and set up a new ruling dynasty, which over time is subject to the same weakening of power again.&lt;ref&gt;''The Muqaddimah'', translated by F. Rosenthal (III, pp.&amp;nbsp;311–15, 271-4 [Arabic]; [[Richard Nelson Frye]] (p.&amp;nbsp;91) [https://asadullahali.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ibn_khaldun-al_muqaddimah.pdf online], accessed 26 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiments with the hellenistic Ideal city ===
The antique concept of the architecture of a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[polis]] or [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[civitas]] is based on a structure of main and smaller roads running through the entire city, and dividing it into quarters. The streets are oriented towards public buildings like a palace, temple, or a public square. Two main roads, ([[cardo]] and [[decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]) cross each other at right angles in the center of the city. A few cities were founded during the early Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]], the outlines of which were based on the Ancient Roman concept of the [[Ideal city]]. An example of a city planned according to Hellenistic concepts was excavated at [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]] in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Finster| first=Barbara| title=Anjar: spätantik oder frühislamisch? = Anjar: Late antique or early Islamic?

=== Transformation of conquered towns ===
More often than founding new cities, the new Islamic rulers took over existing towns, and transformed them according to the needs of the new Islamic society. This process of transformation proved to be decisive for the development of the traditional Islamic city, or [[Medina quarter|Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Kennedy (1985): ''From Polis to Madina: Urban Change in Late Antique and Early Islamic Syria.'' Past &amp; Present '''106''' (Feb. 1985), p. 3–27 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650637 JSTOR], accessed 28 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of arranging buildings is known as "horizontal spread". Residencies and public buildings as well as private housing tend to be laid out separately, and are not directly related to each other architectonically. Archaeological excavations at the city of [[Jerash]], the Gerasa of Antiquity, have revealed how the Umayyads have transformed the city plan.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Simpson: ''Market building at Jarash. Commercial transformation at the Tetrakionion in the 6th to 9th centuries C.E.'' In: Bartl &amp; Moaz, 2009, p. 115–124&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban morphology of the Medina ===
The architecture of the "[[Orientalism|oriental]]"-Islamic [[town]] is based on cultural and sociological concepts which differ from those of European cities. In both cultures, a distinction is made between the areas used by the rulers and their government and administration, public places of everyday common life, and the areas of private life. Whilst the structures and concepts of European towns originated from a sociological struggle to gain basic rights of freedom – or [[town privileges]] – from political or religious authorities during the [[Middle Ages]], an Islamic town or city is fundamentally influenced by the preservation of the unity of secular and religious life throughout time.&lt;ref name="Wirth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wirth|first1=Eugen|title=Die orientalische Stadt im islamischen Vorderasien und Nordafrika: Städtische Bausubstanz und räumliche Ordnung, Wirtschaftsleben und soziale Organisation. = The Oriental town in the Islamic Near East and North Africa. Urban building and spatial order, economic life and social structure|date=2001|publisher=Von Zabern|location=Mainz|isbn=978-3-8053-2709-1|edition= 2nd|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental principle of the Islamic society is the ''[[ummah]]'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ummat al-Islamiyah}}'' ({{lang-ar|الأمة الإسلامية}}), the community of Muslims of whom each individual is equally submitted to [[Allah]] under the common law of [[sharia]], which also subjected the respective ruler, at least nominally. In [[Abbasid dynasty|Abbasid]] times, some cities like the [[Round city of Baghdad]] were constructed from scratch, set up to a plan which focused on the caliph's residence, located in the very centre of the city, with main roads leading radially from the city gates to the central palace, dividing individual tribal sections with no interconnection, and separated from each other by radial walls. However, these efforts were of short duration only, and the original plan soon disappeared and gave way to succeeding buildings and architectural structures.

In a medina, palaces and residences as well as public places like [[mosque]]-[[madrasa]]-[[Dar al-Shifa|hospital]] complexes and private living spaces rather coexist alongside each other. The buildings tend to be more inwardly oriented, and are separated from the surrounding "outside" either by walls or by the hierarchical ordering of the streets, or both. Streets tend to lead from public main roads to cul-de-sac byroads and onwards into more private plots, and then end there. There are no, or very few, internal connections between different quarters of the city. In order to move from one quarter to the next, one has to go back to the main road again.&lt;ref name="Wirth" /&gt;

Within a city quarter, byroads lead towards individual building complexes or clusters of houses. The individual house is frequently also oriented towards an inner [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], and enclosed by walls, which mostly are unadorned, unlike European outward-oriented, representative [[facade]]s. Thus, the spatial structure of a medina essentially reflects the ancient nomadic tradition of living in a family group or tribe, held together by asabiyya, strictly separated from the "outside". In general, the morphology of an Islamic medina is granting – or denying – access according to the basic concept of hierarchical degrees of privacy. The inhabitants move from public space to the living quarters of their tribe, and onwards to their family home. Within a family house, there are again to be found common and separate spaces, the latter, and most private, usually reserved for women and children. In the end, only the family heads have free and unlimited access to all rooms and areas of ther private home, as opposed to the more European concept of interconnecting different spaces for free and easy access. The hierarchy of privacy thus guides and structurizes the entire social life in a medina, from the caliph down to his most humble subject, from the town to the house.&lt;ref name="Bianca"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bianca| first=Stefano| title=Die Stadt als Haus.

==== Misr, Ribat ====
In the frontier area of the [[Spread of Islam|Arabic expansion]], military forts ('''[[Amsar|Misr]]''', Pl. {{lang-ar|أَمْـصَـار}}, amṣār), or '''[[Ribat|Ribāṭ]]''' ({{lang-ar|رِبَـاط}}, fortress) were founded. The structure and function of a misr is similar to an ancient Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|Colonia]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Hillenbrand: ''Anjar and early Islamic urbanism.'' In: G. P. Brogiolo and Bryan Ward-Perkins (Eds.): ''The idea and ideal of the town between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages''. Leiden, Brill, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;59–98&lt;/ref&gt; Like a frontier colony, the fortress served as a base for further conquests. Arabian military forts of this type were frequently built in the vicinity of an older town from Antiquity or from Byzantine times. They frequently were of square format.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand 1999, S.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than maintaining their original purpose to serve as a military base, many ''amṣār'' developed into urbane and administrative centers. In particular, this happened in the case of the [[Iraq]]i cities of [[Kufa]] and [[Basra]], which became known as ''"al-miṣrān"'' ("the [two] forts"), but also with [[Fustat]] and [[Kairouan]] in North Africa.

==== Qaṣr ====
''Qaṣr'' ({{lang-ar|قَ،صْـر}}'; Pl. {{lang-ar|قصور|}}, ''quṣūr'')  means palace, castle or (frontier) fort. Fortresses from Late Antiquity often continued to be in use, whilst their function changed during time. Some ''quṣūr'' were already used as [[Castra]] during Roman times, and were part of the fortifications of the North African [[Limes]]. Already during the Ancient Roman times, castra did not only serve as fortifications, but also as markets and meeting points for the tribes living beyond the border.

Smaller ''quṣūr'' are found in modern [[Jordan]], and include [[Qasr Al-Hallabat]] (located {{convert|50|km|mile|abbr=on}} east of [[Amman]]), Qasr Bushir ({{convert|15|km|mile|abbr=on}} north of [[Lajjun]]), the castle of Daganiya ({{convert|45|km|mile|abbr=on}} north of [[Ma'an]]) and Odruh ({{convert|22|km|mile|abbr=on}} east of [[Petra|Wadi Musa]]). After the [[Limes Arabicus]] was abandoned by the Roman Empire, many of the castra continued to be in use.&lt;ref name="Konrad 2009"&gt;Michaela Konrad: ''Roman military fortifications along the Eastern desert frontier. Settlement continuities and change in North Syria 4th–8th centuries A.D.'' In: Bart and Motz 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;433–453&lt;/ref&gt; This continuity was subject to archaeological investigations in the fort of Qasr al-Hallabat, which at different times served as a Roman castrum, Christian [[Cenobitic monasticism|cenobitic monastery]], and finally as an Umayyad Qasr.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Arche (2009): ''Hallabat: Castellum, coenobium, praetorium, qaṣr.

According to a hypothesis developed by [[Jean Sauvaget]], the umayyad ''quṣūr'' played a role in the systematic agricultural colonisation of the uninhabited frontier areas, and, as such, continue the colonisation strategy of earlier Christian monks and the [[Ghassanids]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Sauvaget]] (1939): ''Remarques sur les monuments omeyyades. Chateaux de Syrie. I.'' Journal Asiatique, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–59&lt;/ref&gt; The Umayyads, however, increasingly oriented their political strategy towards a model of [[Client politics]], of mutual interdependence and support.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Whitcomb (1995): ''Islam and the socio-cultural transition of Palestine - Early Islamic period (638–1099 C.E.)'' In: T. E. Levy (Ed.): ''The archeology of society in the Holy Land.'' London, Leicester University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;488–501&lt;/ref&gt; After the Umayyad conquest, the ''quṣūr'' lost their original function and were either abandoned or continued to serve as local market places and meeting points until the tenth century.&lt;ref name="Konrad 2009" /&gt; Another type of Islamic fortress is the [[Qalat (fortress)|Qalat]].

There are few buildings dating from the era of Prophet Muhammad, but one example is the [[Jawatha Mosque]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]. The [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (632–661) was the first state to use Islamic Architecture.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (661–750) combined elements of [[Byzantine architecture]] and [[Sassanid architecture]], but [[Umayyad architecture]] introduced new combinations of these western and eastern styles.{{sfn|Petersen|2002|p=295}}
The horseshoe arch appears for the first time in Umayyad architecture, later to evolve to its most advanced form in [[al-Andalus]].{{sfn|Ali|1999|p=35}} Umayyad architecture is distinguished by the extent and variety of decoration, including mosaics, wall painting, sculpture and carved reliefs with Islamic motifs.{{sfn|Petersen|2002|p=296}} The Umayyads introduced a [[transept]] that divided the prayer room along its shorter axis.{{sfn|Ettinghausen|Grabar|Jenkins|2001|p=24}} They also added the [[mihrab]] to mosque design.{{sfn|Ettinghausen|Grabar|Jenkins|2001|p=24}}
The mosque in [[Medina]] built by [[al-Walid I]] had the first ''[[mihrab]]'', a niche on the qibla wall, which seems to have represented the place where the Prophet stood when leading prayer. This almost immediately became a standard feature of all mosques.{{sfn|Ettinghausen|Grabar|Jenkins|2001|p=24}}

The [[Abbasid architecture]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750–1513) was strongly influenced by [[Sassanid architecture]], and later by Central Asian styles. The Abbasid mosques all followed the courtyard plan. The earliest was the mosque that al-Mansur built in Baghdad. since destroyed. The [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] built by al-Mutawakkil was {{convert|256|by|139|m}}. A flat wooden roof was supported by columns. The mosque was decorated with marble panels and glass mosaics.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=80}} The prayer hall of the Abu Dulaf mosque at Samarra had arcades on rectangular brick piers running at right angles to the [[qibla]] wall. Both of the Samarra mosques have spiral minarets, the only examples in Iraq.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=80}} A mosque at [[Balkh]] in what is now Afghanistan was about {{convert|20|by|20|m}} square, with three rows of three square bays, supporting nine vaulted domes.{{sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=82}}

Construction of the [[Mezquita de Córdoba|Great Mosque at Córdoba]] (now a cathedral known as the Mezquita) beginning in 785 CE marks the beginning of [[Moorish architecture]] in the [[Iberian peninsula]] and North Africa (see [[Moors]]). The mosque is noted for its striking interior [[arch]]es. Moorish architecture reached its peak with the construction of the [[Alhambra]], the magnificent palace/fortress of [[Granada]], with its open and breezy interior spaces adorned in red, blue, and gold. The walls are decorated with stylized [[foliage]] motifs, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions, and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] design work, with walls covered in glazed [[tile]]. Their other, smaller, survivals such as the Bab Mardum in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], or the caliphal city of [[Medina Azahara]]. Moorish architecture has its roots deeply established in the [[Arab]] tradition of architecture and design established during the era of the first Caliphate of the [[Umayyads]] in the [[Levant]] circa 660AD with its capital [[Damascus]] having very well preserved examples of fine [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] design and geometrics, including the carmen, which is the typical Damascene house, opening on the inside with a fountain as the house's centre piece.

[[Fatimid architecture]] in Egypt followed [[Tulunid]] techniques and used similar materials, but also developed those of their own. In [[Cairo]], their first congregational mosque was [[al-Azhar mosque]] ("the splendid") founded along with the city (969–973), which, together with its adjacent institution of higher learning ([[al-Azhar University]]), became the spiritual center for [[Ismaili|Ismaili Shia]]. The Mosque of al-Hakim (r. 996–1013), an important example of Fatimid architecture and architectural decoration, played a critical role in [[Fatimid]] ceremonial and procession, which emphasized the religious and political role of the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]]. Besides elaborate funerary monuments, other surviving Fatimid structures include the [[Aqmar Mosque]] (1125)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=INsmT6zjAl8C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=aqmar+mosque+1125&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zbfpTvpbkbSEB8z0gbYI&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aqmar%20mosque%201125&amp;f=false Doris Behrens-Abouseif (1992), ''Islamic Architecture in Cairo: An Introduction'', BRILL, p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Al-Hakim Mosque]], as well as the monumental gates for Cairo's [[Defensive wall|city walls]] commissioned by the powerful [[Fatimid]] [[emir]] and [[vizier]] [[Badr al-Jamali]] (r. 1073–1094).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XshAEMLqzmAC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false David Nicolle (2009), ''Saracen Strongholds 1100–1500: The Central and Eastern Islamic Lands''. Osprey Publishing, p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of the [[Mamluk]]s (1250–1517 AD) in Egypt marked a breathtaking flowering of Islamic art which is most visible in old Cairo. [[Zealotry|Religious zeal]] made them generous patrons of [[Mamluk architecture|architecture]] and art. Trade and agriculture flourished under Mamluk rule, and Cairo, their capital, became one of the wealthiest cities in the [[Near East]] and the center of artistic and intellectual activity. This made Cairo, in the words of [[Ibn Khaldun]], "the center of the universe and the garden of the world", with majestic domes, courtyards, and soaring minarets spread across the city.

[[File:Damghan7.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tarikhaneh Temple]], a pre-Islamic monument built in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]] which was later turned into a mosque, showing elements of [[Iranian architecture]] before the spread of Islam]]
The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century availed the Muslims with the vast wealth of architectural innovation developed over the centuries, from the [[Roman road|great roads]], [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s and [[arch]]es of the [[Roman Empire]], to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]]s and [[Sassanid empire|Persian]] [[Horseshoe arch|horseshoe]] and [[pointed arch]]es, and the Sassanian and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[mosaic]]s. The Islamic architects first utilized these native architects to build mosques, and eventually developed their own adaptations. Islamic architecture thus is directly related to [[Persian architecture|Persian]] and [[Byzantine architecture]].

In Persia and Central Asia, the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]], [[Samanid]]s, [[Ghaznavids]], and [[Ghurids]] struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as [[Neyshabur|Nishapur]] and [[Ghazni]] ([[Afghanistan]]), and the construction of the Great Mosque of [[Isfahan]] (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated.

Under the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]]s the "Iranian plan" of mosque construction appears for the first time. Lodging places called ''khans'', or [[caravanserai]], for travellers and their animals, or caravansarais, generally displayed utilitarian rather than ornamental architecture, with rubble masonry, strong fortifications, and minimal comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Seljuq architecture synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. Another important architectural trend to arise in the Seljuk era is the development of mausolea including the tomb tower such as the [[Gunbad-i-qabus]] (circa 1006-7) (showcasing a Zoroastrian motif) and the domed square, an example of which is the [[tomb of the Samanids]] in the city of [[Bukhara]] (circa 943).&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Isfahan_Royal_Mosque_general.JPG|left|thumb|[[Shah Mosque]] in [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]]]

The [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khanate period]] provided several innovations to dome-building that eventually enabled the Persians to construct much taller structures. These changes later paved the way for Safavid architecture. The pinnacle of Il-Khanate architecture was reached with the construction of the [[Soltaniyeh|Soltaniyeh Dome]] (1302–1312) in [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]], Iran, which measures 50&amp;nbsp;m in height and 25&amp;nbsp;m in diameter, making it [[List of largest domes in the world#Masonry|the 3rd largest]] and the tallest masonry dome ever erected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranreview.org/content/view/2280/51/]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/domes|title=DOMES – Encyclopaedia Iranicam|website=Iranicaonline.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb of [[Öljeitü]] in [[Soltaniyeh]] is one of the greatest and most impressive monuments in Iran, despite many later depredations.

Iranian architecture and city planning also reached an apogee under the [[Timurids]], in particular with the monuments of [[Samarkand]], marked by extensive use of exterior ceramic tiles and [[muqarnas]] vaulting within.

The renaissance in Persian mosque and dome building came during the [[Safavid dynasty]], when [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]], in 1598 initiated the reconstruction of [[Isfahan]], with the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] as the centerpiece of his new capital.&lt;ref&gt;Savory, Roger; Iran under the Safavids, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct feature of Persian domes, which separates them from those domes created in the Christian world or the Ottoman and Mughal empires, was the colorful tiles, with which they covered the ''exterior'' of their domes, as they would on the interior. These domes soon numbered dozens in Isfahan, and the distinct, blue- colored shape would dominate the skyline of the city. Reflecting the light of the sun, these domes appeared like glittering [[turquoise|turquoise gem]] and could be seen from miles away by travelers following the [[Silk road]] through Persia. This very distinct style of architecture was inherited to them from the [[Seljuq dynasty]], who for centuries had used it in their mosque building, but it was perfected during the Safavids when they invented the ''haft- rangi'', or seven- colour style of tile burning, a process that enabled them to apply more colours to each tile, creating richer patterns, sweeter to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Stephen P.; Half the World, The Social Architecture of Safavid Isfahan, 1590–1722, p. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; The colours that the Persians favoured were golden, white and turquoise patterns on a dark- blue background.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Sheila R.; Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive inscription bands of calligraphy and arabesque on most of the major buildings where carefully planned and executed by [[Reza Abbasi|Ali Reza Abbasi]], who was appointed head of the royal library and Master calligrapher at the Shah's court in 1598,&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Sheila R.; Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Shaykh Bahai]] oversaw the construction projects. Reaching 53 meters in height, the dome of Masjed-e Shah (Shah Mosque) would become the tallest in the city when it was finished in 1629. It was built as a double- shelled dome, with 14&amp;nbsp;m spanning between the two layers, and resting on an octagonal dome chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Hattstein M., Delius P.; Islam, Art and Architecture; p. 513–514&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bibi Heybat Mosque Baku 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]

Persian-style mosques are also characterized by their tapered brick pillars, large [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] and arches each supported by several pillars. In South Asia, such art was also used as was a technique throughout the region.&lt;ref name="B-I"&gt;"Islam", ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century also helped Islamic architecture to flourish in [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isesco.org.ma/english/publications/Islamtoday/14/P6.php Journal Islam Today N° 14-1417H/1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127034538/http://www.isesco.org.ma/english/publications/islamtoday/14/P6.php |date=2011-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerbaijan.com/azeri/azerbaijan4.htm|title=Virtual Azerbaijan Presents - Azerbaijan's History|first=Adil T.|last=Baguirov|website=Zerbaijan.com|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country became home of Nakchivan and Shirvan-Absheron architecture schools. An example of the first direction in the Azerbaijani Islamic architecture is the mausoleum of Yusuf, built in 1162.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Shirvan-Absheron school unlike Nakchivan style used stones instead of the bricks in the construction. At the same characteristics of this trend were the asymmetry and stone carving, which includes famous landmarks like [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]]

=== Ottoman ===
{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}
[[File:Sultan Ahmed Mosque Istanbul Turkey retouched.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]], built in 1616, [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]]]

The standard plan of Ottoman architecture was inspired in part by the example of [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]], [[Ilkhanid]] works like [[Oljeitu]] Tomb and earlier [[Seljuks of Rum|Seljuk]] and Anatolian Beylik monumental buildings and their own original innovations. The most famous of Ottoman architects was (and remains) [[Mimar Sinan]], who lived for approximately one hundred years and designed several hundreds of buildings, of which two of the most important are [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in Istanbul and [[Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]]. Apprentices of Sinan later built the famous [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]] in Istanbul.

The most numerous and largest of mosques exist in [[Turkey]], which obtained influence from Byzantine, [[Iranian architecture|Persian]] and [[Syria]]n-[[Arab]] designs. Turkish architects implemented their own style of [[cupola]] domes.&lt;ref name="B-I"/&gt; For almost 500 years [[Byzantine architecture]] such as the church of Hagia Sophia served as models for many of the Ottoman mosques such as the Shehzade Mosque, the Suleiman Mosque, and the Rüstem Pasha Mosque.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s mastered the technique of building vast inner spaces confined by seemingly weightless yet massive domes, and achieving perfect harmony between inner and outer spaces, as well as light and shadow. Islamic religious architecture which until then consisted of simple buildings with extensive decorations, was transformed by the Ottomans through a dynamic architectural vocabulary of [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], domes, semidomes and columns. The mosque was transformed from being a cramped and dark chamber with arabesque-covered walls into a sanctuary of esthetic and technical balance, refined elegance and a hint of heavenly transcendence.

{{anchor|Timurid architecture}}

Timurid architecture is the pinnacle of [[Islamic art]] in [[Central Asia]]. Spectacular and stately edifices erected by [[Timur]] and [[Timurid Dynasty|his successors]] in [[Samarkand]] and [[Herat]] helped to disseminate the influence of the [[Ilkhanid]] [[Art school|school of art]] in India, thus giving rise to the celebrated [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] school of architecture. Timurid architecture started with the [[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi|sanctuary of Ahmed Yasawi]] in present-day [[Kazakhstan]] and culminated in Timur's mausoleum [[Gur-e Amir]] in [[Samarkand]]. The style is largely derived from [[Persian architecture]]. [[Axial symmetry]] is a characteristic of all major Timurid structures, notably the [[Shah-i-Zinda]] in [[Samarkand]] and the mosque of [[Gowhar Shad]] in [[Mashhad]]. Double [[dome]]s of various shapes abound, and the outsides are perfused with brilliant colors.

[[File:Meknes-Medina.jpg|thumb|left|[[El Hedim Square]] in [[Meknes]], [[Morocco]] with the "[[Bab Mansour]] Gate" in the [[Old city of Meknes]]]]

Moroccan architecture dates from 110 BCE with the Berber's massive pisé ([[mud brick]]) buildings. The architecture has been influenced by Islamization during the [[Idrisid dynasty]], [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] exiles from Spain, and also by France who [[French protectorate in Morocco|occupied Morocco]] in 1912. [[Morocco]] is in [[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]] bordering the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Atlantic]]. The country's diverse geography and the land's long history marked by successive waves of settlers and military encroachments are all reflected in Morocco's architecture. [[Moroccan Islamic architecture]] is also present outside the country. For example, [[Sheikha Salama Mosque]] in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] city of [[Al Ain]] has two [[minaret]]s which partly look Moroccan.&lt;ref name="RoughGuides2016B"&gt;{{cite book |work=[[Rough Guides]] UK |title=The Rough Guide to Dubai |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |chapter= |page=266 |isbn=978-0-2412-9865-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3awnDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT266&amp;dq=sheikha+salama+mosque#v=onepage&amp;q=sheikha%20salama%20mosque&amp;f=false |date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian -Islamic architecture is a feature of the architecture of the [[Tatars]], formed under the influence of a sedentary and nomadic way of life in ancient times, developing in the epochs of the Golden Horde, the Tatar khanates and under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]]. The architecture was formed in the modern form for many centuries and depended on the culture, aesthetics and religion of the population, therefore combines a unique combination of Eastern, Russian, Bulgarian, Golden Horde architecture, European styles dominating in Russia at one time or another, especially this Is clearly reflected in the Tatar mosques.

[[File:Humayun Tomb in Delhi-Front view.JPG|thumb|[[Humayun's Tomb]], [[Delhi]], the first fully developed Mughal imperial tomb, 1569-70 CE]] 

The most known Indo-Islamic style is [[Mughal architecture]]. Its most prominent examples are the series of imperial [[Mausoleum|mausolea]], which started with the pivotal [[Tomb of Humayun]], but is best known for the [[Taj Mahal]], completed in 1648 by emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]] who died while giving birth to their 14th child. The Taj Mahal is completely symmetrical except for Shah Jahan's [[sarcophagus]], which is placed off center in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry extended to the building of an entire mirror mosque in black marble to complement the Mecca-facing mosque place to the west of the main structure. A famous example of the [[charbagh]] style of Mughal garden is the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] in [[Lahore]], where the domeless [[Tomb of Jahangir]] is also located. [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] which was commissioned by sixth [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] in memory of his wife.  The [[Red Fort]] in [[Delhi]] and [[Agra Fort]] are huge castle-like fortified palaces, and the abandoned city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], 26 miles (42&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Agra]], was built for [[Akbar]] in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&amp;pg=PA29 [[John F. Richards]] (1996), ''The Mughal Empire'', Cambridge University Press, p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Deccan sultanates]] in the Southern regions of the Indian subcontinent developed the Indo-Islamic Deccani architectural styles like [[Charminar]] and [[Gol Gumbaz]].&lt;ref name="michell_77"&gt;Michell, George &amp; Mark Zebrowski.

Within the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Bengal]]i region developed a distinct regional style under the independent Bengal Sultanate. It incorporated influences from Persia, Byzantium and North India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Architecture|title=Architecture - Banglapedia|website=En.banglapedia.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were with blended indigenous Bengali elements, such as curved roofs, corner towers and complex [[terracotta]] ornamentation.

The first Chinese mosque was established in the 7th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] in [[Xi'an]]. The [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]], whose current buildings date from the [[Ming Dynasty]], does not replicate many of the features often associated with traditional mosques. Instead, it follows traditional [[Chinese architecture]]. Some Chinese mosques in parts of western China were more likely to incorporate minarets and domes while eastern Chinese mosques were more likely to look like [[pagoda]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.mosques.htm|accessdate=2006-04-08|last=Cowen|first=Jill S.|date=July–August 1985|pages=30–35|publisher=Saudi Aramco World|title=Muslims in China: The Mosque|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322154300/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.mosques.htm|archive-date=2006-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important lathan feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on [[symmetry]], which connotes a sense of grandeur; this applies to everything from [[palace]]s to [[mosque]]s. One notable exception is in the design of gardens, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow; to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself.

Chinese buildings may be built with either red or grey bricks, but wooden structures are the most common; these are more capable of withstanding earthquakes, but are vulnerable to fire. The roof of a typical Chinese building is curved; there are strict classifications of gable types, comparable with the [[classical order]]s of European columns.

Most mosques have certain aspects in common with each other however as with other regions Chinese Islamic architecture reflects the local architecture in its style. China is renowned for its beautiful mosques, which resemble temples. However, in western China the mosques resemble those of the [[Arab World]], with tall, slender minarets, curvy arches and dome shaped roofs. In northwest China where the Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] have built their mosques, there is a combination of eastern and western styles. The mosques have flared Buddhist style roofs set in walled courtyards entered through archways with miniature domes and [[minaret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Aramco World, July/August 1985, page 3035&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesian-Malaysian ===

[[File:Masjid Menara Kudus.jpg|thumb|250px|Minaret is not an original architecture of Indonesian mosque, instead the [[Menara Kudus Mosque]] employs a [[Hindu temple|Hindu]]-[[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist]] [[Candi of Indonesia|temple]]-like structure for a [[beduk|drum]] used to call prayer&lt;ref name="Schoppert, P. 1997, p. 207"&gt;Schoppert, P., Damais, S., ''Java Style'', 1997, Didier Millet, Paris, p. 207, {{ISBN|962-593-232-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Southeast Asia]] was slow to adopt Middle Eastern architectural styles. Islam entered Indonesia in the 15th-century via [[Java]] island, during which period the dominant religion in Southeast Asia included a variety of pagan groups. Introduction of Islam was peaceful. Existing architectural features in Indonesia such as the [[candi bentar]] gate, [[paduraksa]] (normally marks entrance to the most sacred precincts), and the sacred pyramidal roof was used for Islamic architecture. For centuries, Indonesian mosques lacked domes or minarets, both considered a Middle Eastern origin. Indonesian original mosques feature multi-layered pyramidal roofs and no minaret. Prayer are called by striking a prayer's drum known as [[beduk]]. The minaret of the [[Menara Kudus Mosque]] is a great example of Indonesian architecture. Indonesian mosque architecture also features strong influence from the Middle Eastern architecture styles.&lt;ref name="heritage 88"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gunawan Tjahjono |authorlink= |title=Indonesian Heritage-Architecture |year=1998 |publisher=Archipelago Press |location=Singapore |isbn=978-981-3018-30-3 |pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of Javanese Indonesian mosques had a strong influence on the design of other mosques in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], and the [[Philippines]].

Today, with increasing Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Indonesian-Malaysian mosques are developing a more standard, international style, with a dome and minaret.

=== Sahelian ===
{{Main|Sudano-Sahelian}}


In [[West Africa]], Muslim merchants played a vital role in the Western [[Sahel]] region since the [[Kingdom of Ghana]]. At [[Kumbi Saleh]], locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques (as described by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri|al-bakri]]), one centered on [[Friday prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Ghana. Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana, The Society, 1957, pp81&lt;/ref&gt; The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long, forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Basil. The Lost Cities of Africa. Boston: Little Brown, 1959, pp86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudano-Sahelian|Sahelian architecture]] initially grew from the two cities of [[Djenné]] and [[Timbuktu]]. The [[Sankore]] Mosque in [[Timbuktu]], constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the [[Great Mosque of Djenné]].

=== Somali ===
{{Main|Somali architecture}}
[[File:Ancient-Almnara.jpg|thumb|left|''Almnara Tower'' [[Somalia]]]]
[[File:Fakr Ud Din Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|The 13th century [[Fakr ad-Din Mosque]] in [[Mogadishu]]]]

The spread of Islam in the early medieval era of [[History of Somalia|Somalia's history]] brought Islamic architectural influences from [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]], which stimulated a shift from [[drystone]] and other related materials in construction to [[Masonry|coral stone]], [[mud-brick|sundried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as [[mosques]] were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and customs of Somalia – Mohammed Abdullahi Diriye pg 102&lt;/ref&gt; Concordant with the ancient presence of Islam in the [[Horn of Africa]] region, mosques in Somalia are some of the oldest on the entire continent. One architectural feature that made Somali mosques distinct from other mosques in Africa were [[minaret]]s.

For centuries, Arba Rukun (1269), the Friday mosque of [[Merca]] (1609) and [[Fakr ad-Din]] (1269) were, in fact, the only mosques in [[East Africa]] to have minarets.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Islamic history and civilization By David Ayalon pg 370&lt;/ref&gt; Fakr ad-Din, which dates back to the [[Mogadishu|Mogadishan]] [[Golden Age]], was built with [[marble]] and [[coral]] [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and included a compact rectangular plan with a domed [[mihrab]] axis. Glazed tiles were also used in the decoration of the mihrab, one of which bears a dated inscription. The 13th century ''Al Gami University'' consisted of a rectangular base with a large cylindrical tower architecturally unique in the [[Islamic world]].

[[Shrine]]s to honor [[Somali people|Somali]] [[patriarchs]] and [[matriarchy|matriarchs]] evolved from ancient Somali burial customs. In Southern Somalia the preferred medieval shrine architecture was the [[Pillar tomb]] style while the North predominantly built structures consisting of [[domes]] and square plans.

=== Interpretation ===
[[File:Sebilj, Sarajevo.jpg|thumb|The [[Sebilj]] is a [[Ottoman Empire|pseudo-Ottoman]] style wooden [[fountain]] in the centre of [[Baščaršija]] square in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia]]]]

Common interpretations of Islamic architecture include the following: The concept of [[God in Islam|God]] or [[Allah]]'s infinite power is evoked by designs with repeating themes which suggest infinity. Human and animal forms are rarely depicted in [[decorative art]] as God's work is considered to be matchless. Foliage is a frequent motif but typically stylized or simplified for the same reason.
[[Arabic Calligraphy]] is used to enhance the interior of a building by providing quotations from the [[Qur'an]]. Islamic architecture has been called the "architecture of the veil" because the beauty lies in the inner spaces (courtyards and rooms) which are not visible from the outside (street view). Furthermore, the use of grandiose forms such as large domes, towering minarets, and large courtyards are intended to convey power.

== In modern times ==
In modern times, the architecture of Islamic buildings, not just religious ones, has gone through some changes. The new architectural style doesn't stick with the same fundamental aspects that were seen in the past, but mosques for the most part still feature the same parts - the ''Miḥrāb'' ({{lang-ar|مِـحْـرَاب}}), the minarets, four-iwan plan, and the ''pishtaq''. A difference to note is the appearance of mosques without domes, as in the past mosques for the most part all had them, but these new dome-less mosques seem to follow a function over form design, and are created by those not of the Islamic faith, in most cases. The influence of Islam still pervades the style of creation itself, and provides a 'conceptual framework',&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OMER|first=SPAHIC|date=2008|title=Towards Understanding Islamic Architecture|journal=Islamic Studies|volume=47|issue=4|pages=483–510|jstor=20839141}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the making of a building that exemplifies the styles and beliefs of Islam. It has also been influenced by the now meeting of many different cultures, such as European styles meeting Islamic styles, leading to Islamic architects incorporating features of other architectural and cultural styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdelmonem|first=Mohamed|date=2003-10-22|title=Contemporary Islamic Architecture in the Arab World|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320556990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Design and Islam ===
Urban design and the tradition of Islamic styled architecture have begun to combine to form a new 'neo-Islamic' style, where the efficiency of the urban style meshes with the spirituality and aesthetic characteristics of Islamic styles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ELARABY|first=KADRI M.G.|date=1996|title=Neo-Islamic Architecture and Urban Design in the Middle East: From Threshold to Adaptive Design|journal=Built Environment (1978-)|volume=22|issue=2|pages=138–150|jstor=23288987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic Architecture in itself is a style that showcases the values, and the culture of Islam, but in modern times sticking to tradition is falling out of practice, so a combination style formed. Examples showing this are places such as the [[Marrakesh Menara Airport]], the Islamic Cultural Center and Museum of Tolerance, ''Masjid Permata Qolbu'', the concept for The Vanishing Mosque, and the ''[[Mazar-e-Quaid]].'' All of these buildings show the influence of Islam over them, but also the movements of things like minimalism which are rising to popularity in the architectural field. Designers that use the aspects of both modern styles and the Islamic styles found a way to have the Western-inspired modernism&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; with the classical cultural aspects of Islamic architecture. This concept though brings up the controversy of the identity of the Islamic community, of the traditional Islamic community, within a space that doesn't follow the way they knew it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ALSAYYAD|first=NEZAR|date=1996|title=Islamic Architecture and Urbanism: Middle Eastern Perspectives|journal=Built Environment (1978-)|volume=22|issue=2|pages=88–90|jstor=23288982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy on Status as a Style of Architecture ===
There are some who also debate whether Islamic Architecture can truly be called a style, as the religious aspect is seen as separate and having no bearing on the architectural style,&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; while on the other side people also argue that the newfound trend and divergence from the style of old Islamic Architecture is what is causing the style to lose it status. There are scholars that also believe that the distinguishing features of the Islamic Architecture style were not necessarily found within the architecture, but were rather environmental markers, such as the sounds of prayer, the city around it, the events that occurred there.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jasmi|first=Abdullah|last2=Mitias|first2=Michael H.|date=2004|title=Does an Islamic Architecture Exist?|journal=Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia|volume=60|issue=1|pages=197–214|jstor=40338415}}&lt;/ref&gt; The example given is that we know that a building is a mosque based on what happens there, rather than any visual cues.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specific features that are notably related to Islamic Architecture - the Mihrab, the Minaret, and the Gate&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; - are seen in multiple locations and do not always serve the same use, and symbolism for being Islamic in nature is seen to be demonstrated more culturally than it is architecturally. Islamic Architecture is also sometimes referred to as a 'hidden architecture', one that doesn't necessarily show the physical traits of the style, rather it is something that is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Nawawi, N. (2009). ''ISLAMIC INFLUENCE ON THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MALAY WORLD''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connections &amp; deeper meanings ==
Islamic architecture displays intricate patterns, colors, and details embodying the Islamic culture. Such widespread religious displays typically have deeper meanings and connections. Islamic architecture is unique in this case because interior designs often lack or have unknown religious connections. This is caused by the Muslim ideology [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]], stating that an attempt to depict any earthly beings as holy is sinful. [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]] is unlike Western cultural ideals, often consisting of a large amount of religious symbolism in earthly beings. Due to this, symbolism in Islamic architecture is not as easily accessible compared to that of Western religious architecture.

=== Difficulty forming connections ===
Islamic architecture is a neglected subject within historical studies. Many scholars that study historical architecture often gloss over, if not completely ignore Islamic structures. This is caused by multiple elements, one being that there is little historic literary works that express an Islamic architect's motives with their structures.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic architecture : form, function, and meaning|last=Robert.|first=Hillenbrand|date=1994|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231101325|edition= Casebound |location=New York|oclc=30319450}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghasemzadeh|first=Behnam|date=|title=SYMBOLS AND SIGNS IN ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE|url=http://www.eras.utad.pt/docs/SET%202013%20visuais.pdf|journal=European Review of Artistic Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the massively spanning Islamic religion, there is a large variation between thousands of existing mosques with little consistency between them. Lastly, since it is against Islamic faith to idolize earthly beings, any depictions of earthly beings lack religious connection. These characteristics combine to make it difficult for historians to form symbolic connections from architecture in Islamic places of worship.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Religious &amp; societal connections ===
Islamic architecture is unique compared to other vast religions that encompass much of the West. Unlike Christianity, Islam does not sensationalize living beings because they view it as a conflict with the Qur'an. Anything created by Allah is under his order and thus should not be idolized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This leaves typical religious Western symbols out of the picture, and replaces them with an emphasis on complex geometrical shapes and patterns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are several aspects of Islamic architecture that to modern knowledge lack a symbolic religious meaning, but there are connections that do exist. A repeated and significant motif in mosques is calligraphy. Calligraphy plays a huge role in delivering religious connections through artistic design.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Calligraphy, in a mosque setting, is specifically used to reference holy excerpts from both the Qur’an and Muhammad's teachings. These references are one of the few religious connections architects include within their work.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Status &amp; hierarchy ====
Islamic architecture varies vastly across the scope of the world. Specifically, some mosques have different goals and intentions than others. These intentions often highlighted religious and social hierarchies within the mosque. Mosques are designed to have the least significant portions of the layout closest to the entrance, as people move deeper into the building more significant religious areas are revealed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hierarchy is also present because certain Islamic architects are tasked to design specifically for the presence of royalty. Designated locations had been carefully chosen in the mosque to highlight an individual’s position in society. This emphasis could be made through being within view to all attendees,  placed in the focal point of artistry, and a [[maqsurah]]'''.''' &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-614-religious-architecture-and-islamic-cultures-fall-2002/lecture-notes/glossary/|title=Glossary of Terms {{!}} Lecture Notes {{!}} Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures {{!}} Architecture {{!}} MIT OpenCourseWare|last=Nasser|first=Rabbat|website=ocw.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining a sociological hierarchy within a mosque would typically represent a recognition by a higher being aware of a delegation of power.  This hierarchy does exist but not with any sort of religious message as Hillenbrand points out, “in neither case is this hierarchy employed for especially portentous ends.” &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Hierarchy exist in the church in different forms, but is meant for purely functional purposes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Structural intentions ===
Deeper meanings in Islamic architecture often can take form as functional purposes. For example mosques are built around the ideal that it should not just be a place of mesmerizing aesthetics, but a place where the aesthetics’ fluidity guide the person into proper worship.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A key feature of the mosque is the [[Mihrab]], a universal part of any Islamic place of worship.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The [[Mihrab]] is easily identifiable through a receding wall and a gable over head often consisting of intricate patterns. Upon entering, the most crucial religious function the architecture of the mosque serves to deliver is the [[Qibla]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[Qibla]] is necessary for proper Islamic worship, and is revealed through architectural means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/philosophy-islamic-laws-nasir-makarim-shirazi-jafar-subhani/question-7-why-face-qibla-prayers|title=Question 7: Why To Face The Qibla In Prayers?|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">The '''King Hezekiah bulla''' is a 3 mm thick soft [[bulla (seal)|bulla]] (piece of clay with the impression of a seal) measuring 13 x 12 mm (½ in × ½ in). It was found  in an archaeological excavation together with 33 other seals, figurines and ceramics, in an ancient refuse dump adjacent to the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] by Israeli archaeologist [[Eilat Mazar]].

==Description==
The bulla, excavated in 2015, was dated to the reign of Judean king  [[Hezekiah]] between 715 and 686 BCE and bears an inscription in [[Paleo-Hebrew]] script: "Belonging to Hezekiah [son of] Ahaz king of Judah," and a two-winged sun, with wings turned downward, flanked by two ankh symbols symbolizing life.

==Location==
The building in which the bulla was found had been an administrative or royal building that the [[Babylonians]] destroyed when they conquered [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BCE.  According to Mazar, "although seal impressions bearing King Hezekiah's name have already been known from the antiquities market since the middle of the 1990s, some with a winged scarab (dung beetle) symbol and others with a winged sun, this is the first time that a seal impression of an [[Israelite]] or Judean king has ever come to light in a scientific archaeological excavation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151202132519.htm|title=Impression of King Hezekiah's royal seal discovered in excavations in Jerusalem: First seal impression of an Israelite or Judean king ever exposed in situ in a scientific archaeological excavation|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==King Hezekiah==
It attests that Jerusalem in King Hezekiah's time had  highly developed administrative system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/what-the-hezekiah-seal-proves-jerusalem-status-1.5385544|title=Hezekiah Seal Proves Ancient Jerusalem Was a Major Judahite Capital|last=Fridman|first=Julia|date=2016|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the discovery, [[Christopher Rollston]] of [[George Washington University]] said that the presence of ankh, an Egyptian symbol on a seal was not surprising as Judah had formed alliances with Egypt at various times during its history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5240">'''Legal opportunity structure''' or '''legal opportunity''' is a concept found in the study of law and [[social movements]]. It was first used in order to distinguish it from [[political opportunity structure]] or [[political opportunity]], on the basis that law and the courts deserved to be studied in their own right rather than being lumped together with political institutions.&lt;ref name="HilsonChris"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hilson | first = Chris | title = New social movements: the role of legal opportunity | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 238–255 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760110120246 | date = January 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760110120246 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal opportunities are made up of: access to the courts, which may be affected in particular by the law on standing or ''locus standi'', and costs rules; 'legal stock' or the set of available precedents on which to hang a case;&lt;ref name="AndersenEllen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Andersen | first = Ellen Ann | title = Out of the closets &amp; into the courts: legal opportunity structure and gay rights litigation | publisher = University of Michigan Press | location = Ann Arbor | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780472021574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and judicial receptiveness. Some of these are more obviously structural than others - hence the term legal opportunity is sometimes preferred over legal opportunity structure.

Legal opportunity has been used as an [[independent variable]] to help to explain strategy choice by social movement organisations (SMOs) - e.g. why SMOS adopt litigation rather than protest or political lobbying as a strategy. Other variables or explanatory frameworks it is commonly found alongside include [[framing (social sciences)|framing]],&lt;ref name="VanhalaLisa"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vanhala | first = Lisa | title = Making rights a reality?: disability rights activists and legal mobilization | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781107000872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[resource mobilization]] and grievance.

'''Lillehammer''' ({{IPA-no|ˈlɪl̥əhɔmɔr|-|}}) is a [[List of cities in Norway|town]] and [[Municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Oppland]] [[Counties of Norway|county]], Norway. It is part of the [[Districts of Norway|traditional region]] of [[Gudbrandsdal]].  The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Lillehammer.  As of May 2011, the population of the town of Lillehammer was 26,639. The city centre is a late 19th-century concentration of wooden houses, which enjoys a picturesque location overlooking the northern part of lake [[Mjøsa]] and the river [[Gudbrandsdalslågen|Lågen]], surrounded by mountains. Lillehammer hosted the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] and [[2016 Winter Youth Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/youth-olympics/2016/15116-lillehammer-awarded-2016-winter-youth-olympic-games Lillehammer awarded 2016 Winter Youth Olympic Games]&lt;/ref&gt;
Before Oslo's [[2022 Winter Olympics|withdrawal]] from consideration, it was included as part of a bid to host events in the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] if Oslo were to win the rights to hold the Games.

==Name==
The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old Hamar ([[Old Norse|Norse]] ''Hamarr'') farm, since the first church was built there. The name is identical with the word ''hamarr'' (rocky hill). To distinguish it from the nearby [[Hamar|town]] and [[bishop of Hamar|bishopric]], both called [[Hamar]], it began to be called "little Hamar": ''Lilþlæ Hamar'' and ''Litlihamarr'', and finally Lillehammer. It is also mentioned in the Old Norse [[saga]]s as ''Litlikaupangr'' ("Little Trading Place").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Norske gaardnavne: Kristians amt|edition=4|authorlink=Oluf Rygh|last=Rygh|first=Oluf|publisher=W.

==Coat-of-arms==
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] was granted in 1898 and  shows a [[birkebeiner]], carrying a spear and a shield, who is skiing down a mountainside.  It symbolizes the historical importance of when the Birkebeiners carried the to-be-King Haakon from Lillehammer to Rena on skis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkivverket.no/webfelles/kommunevaapen/h_linjer.html|title=Historiske Linjer|publisher=National Archives of Norway|accessdate=4 January 2009|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lillehammer kirke.JPG|left|thumb|[[Lillehammer Church]]]]
The area has been settled since the Norwegian [[Iron Age]]; it is also mentioned as a site for [[Thing (assembly)|council]] in 1390. Lillehammer had a lively market by the 1800s and obtained rights as a [[Market town|merchant city]] on 7 August 1827, at which point there were 50 registered residents within its boundaries.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The town of Lillehammer was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. {{Further information|formannskapsdistrikt}}
The rural municipality of [[Fåberg]] was merged into the municipality of Lillehammer on 1 January 1964.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Lillehammer was the site of the [[Lillehammer affair]] in 1973, wherein operatives of the Israeli [[Mossad]] shot and killed a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] waiter they mistakenly thought was [[Ali Hassan Salameh]], who was involved in the [[Munich Massacre]].

Lillehammer is known as a typical venue for winter sporting events; it was host city of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], and the [[2016 Winter Youth Olympics]], and was part of a joint bid with applicant host city [[Oslo]] to host events part of the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] until Oslo withdrew its bid on 1 October 2014.

Lillehammer is home to the largest literature festival in the Nordic countries, and in 2017 was designated as a UNESCO [[City of Literature]].

==Education==
A number of schools are located in Lillehammer including the [[Hammartun Primary and Lower Secondary School]], [[Søre Ål Primary School]] and [[Kringsjå Primary and Lower Secondary School]].
[[Lillehammer Public High School]] consists of two branches, North and South, both situated near the city center. The private High school [[Norwegian College of Elite Sports]], NTG, also has a branch in Lillehammer. The Lillehammer campus of [[Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences]] is situated just north of the town itself.

Lillehammer is also the home of the Nansen Academy - the Norwegian Humanistic Academy.  The Nansen Academy is an educational institution for adult students with varied political, religious, and cultural backgrounds. The Academy was founded on the core principles of humanism and aims at strengthening the knowledge of these principles.

The 14th World Scout Jamboree was held from July 29 to August 7, 1975 and was hosted by Norway at Lillehammer.

==Geography==

Lillehammer is situated in the lower part of [[Gudbrandsdal]], at the northern head of lake [[Mjøsa]], and is located to the south of the municipality of [[Øyer]], to the southeast of [[Gausdal]], northeast of [[Nordre Land]], and to the north of [[Gjøvik]], all in Oppland county. To the southeast, it is bordered by [[Ringsaker]] municipality in [[Hedmark]] county. To the northwest is the mountain [[Spåtind]].

=== Climate ===

By Norwegian standards, Lillehammer has an inland climate, with the Scandinavian mountain chain to the west and north limiting oceanic influences. The record high of 34&amp;nbsp;°C was recorded in June 1970. The record low of -31&amp;nbsp;°C was recorded in December 1978 and January 1979, and the same low was recorded in January 1987. Recent decades have seen warming. There has been no overnight air frost in August since 1978, and the coldest recorded temperature after 2000 is -26.2&amp;nbsp;°C in January 2010. The current weather station Lillehammer-Sætherengen became operational in 1982; extremes are also from two earlier weather stations in Lillehammer.

==Economy==
The basis for the city's commerce is its position as the northernmost point of the lake [[Mjøsa]] and as the gateway for the [[Gudbrandsdal]] [[districts of Norway|region]], through which the historical highway to [[Trondheim]] passes.  The [[Mesna (river)|Mesna]] river has provided the basis for several small industries through the years, but Lillehammer is now all but industry-less.

==Transport==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
One of the major [[Rail transport in Norway|Norwegian rail lines]], the [[Dovre Line]], runs from [[Hamar]] to the north through Lillehammer on its way up the Gudbrandsdal, to terminate in Trondheim.

[[European route E6]] passes through Lillehammer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11003">'''Lux Aeterna Theater''' is a blend of art and entertainment with a unique self-created method. It is a theater of laser and sound, which presents new synthetic art forms for almost 40 years.  Although the equipment Lux Aeterna Theater uses is meant for holographic ads, laser support of pop concerts and a variety of other shows, according to the founders of this method, their technique provides the ability to visualize the tone, harmony, tonality and nature of music, allowing to illustrate, emphasize and deepen the thematic development, and thus the whole dramaturgy of the performance. 

[[File:Laser interference 31.jpg|thumb|Laser projected on the dome of Kiev Planetarium]]

==Method==

Lux Aeterna Theater has no stationary location and operates internationally; it can be easily assembled on various sites. The premises must include a projection surface (planetarium, dome hemisphere, panoramic projection screen, etc.), seats, and an optical pad behind the seats, projectors, and remote control. The optical pad is a metal plate with drilled holes in the grid and with threaded openings. The drives are positioning the optical elements into the beam or slow-acting control beam with a set of lines. Each line of the laser creates a separate image. The method, resulting in interference patterns on flat surfaces, is based on the use of accidental phase modulation, which occurs when a laser beam passing through optically heterogeneous mediums is refracted at different points and angles along its way, resulting in interference patterns projected on a screen that change in contour and texture with each change in medium. The medium is made of solid transparent matter (e.g. moving plates of non-uniform structure -usually round discs mounted in a revolving cassette. And as a result, a wide selection of visual character, image, shapes, effect appears on a screen. Or/and an additional lens is used to concentrate the light field. Or/and transfocators are mounted at the beam's point of exit. These form-building methods can be used in the same cassettes (to increase image possibilities) with diffraction gratings, curvilinear reflectors or a large moving lens (for the deformation of light imago). Lighting plot involves complex abstract light ductile movements. The projection tool allows receiving on-screen a very complex dynamics of light colorful shapes, to create a light accompaniment by colorful, graphic, structural visualization of thematic development, to unite music, musical sounds, and musical noises with light content. It also allows the spatial separation and motion of different audio content, voices, melody and musical instruments.

==History==

Theater was founded in 1982 by Daniel Fridman, a professional theater lighting director and sound engineer, in [[Uzhhorod]], Transcarpathia, former USSR and now territory of Ukraine. Under the roof of the local House of Culture, Lux Aeterna became an independent half state funded legal entity with Daniel Fridman as its first artistic director. The theater team consisted of Victor Schurov, chief designer and engineer, Vasiliy Makara, engineer, Ferenc Pejchy, lighting designer, Pavel Gladovskiy, engineer, Ihor Skalskiy, laser designer and engineer. The theater hall was divided into two parts. In one part there was a spectator room for 70 seats. In another - the so-called "light mine". The light mine is known to have a special space, the walls, the ceiling and the floor of which are painted to matte black color, so that there is not the slightest reflection of light as well as a set of light projection equipment. Various light, light-projecting devices, mirror surfaces of small and large formats, reflective films, a large set of glass and film color filters, transparent cuvettes with water, helium-neon and helium-cadmium lasers, an optical pad saturated with various optical elements and lenses of large sizes. With the help of these technical means, the theater's artists were able to create complex dynamic light images, shapes, characters on a special homemade projection screen made of film-tracing paper. 

According to Daniel Fridman, the founder of the theater, the works of the Russian composer [[Alexander Scriabin]], the art of [[Kazimir Malevich]], the poetry of the early twentieth century poets were his sources of inspiration. {{Quote|We can consider [[Alexander Scriabin]] to be our predecessor — he experimented with combining music and light effects. Today the state of technology is such that it gives us almost unlimited possibilities for creating and developing the art of light and sound.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20062/126&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In the summer of 1985 Lux Aeterna Theater projected the rays of the most powerful at that time stage lasers (2,5 W krypton and 6,5 W argon) on the night clouds over the Moscow Dynamo stadium at the [[12th World Festival of Youth and Students]]. This equipment had a couple of hundred kilograms of weight, a water cooling system with a bunch of inconveniences in tens of meters of hoses for supply and discharge of water.  From 1987 The Light and Sound Theater operated in the Transcarpathian Regional Music and Drama Theater. 

In 2003 the Lux Aeterna came to [[Kiev]] with a new concept to create a stationary light and sound theater under the cupola of the [[Kiev Planetarium]]. In [[Kiev]] Aleksandr Kasian, student physicist, and musician Yevhen Khalaf, joined their theater group. During 2003 to 2007 they premiered three acclaimed performances - Gravitation: Zero, Exhilaration of the Milky Ways and Night of the Longest Kiss. More than 600 séances were held during that period and the theater became one of the most visited sights in the city. Furthermore, Lux Aeterna introduced scent design to their performances, adding aromas and experimenting with affecting one more of the human senses - the sense of smell. In the beginning of June 2007 collaboration between Lux Aeterna and Theater of Voice (Duo Zikr band) called The Sound of Magic premiered at the [[Kiev Planetarium]]. Its creator’s united visual effects with wide range of live vocal techniques, like throat singing, in a show. 

==Present==

In late spring 2017 Lux Aeterna takes part in the Tessart project, a center of art and immersive technologies in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], Russia. The theater group, joined by Nikolay Matveev, an associate professor of light design, creates a space called LuxAeterna 360°+ for the project. It is a mobile dome for 15 spectators, built for a real-time deep relaxation and visual art experience.&lt;ref&gt;https://topspb.tv/news/2017/03/31/v-peterburge-poyavilos-art-prostranstvo-so-specialnoj-kameroj-dlya-selfi/ &lt;/ref&gt;  

At the moment Lux Aeterna Theater is creating a medical approach to light and sound performances. The theater group, joined by a stress expert Vladimir Brody, are further developing the relaxation effects their seances have on the spectators. The VGoray Project is about eliminating stress and work-related health problems. Studies to determine the mechanisms of the theater's impact on the humans' psycho-emotional state and the development of methods for the formation of a restoring audio-visual environment &lt;ref&gt;http://www.vgoray.com/ &lt;/ref&gt; are conducted at the Higher School of Light Design of the [[ITMO University]], at the Department of General and Clinical Psychology of [[First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Petersburg]] and at the Medical Faculty of the [[University of Debrecen]] &lt;ref&gt;http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2628418 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2635756 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Matveev N.V., Shcheglov S.A., Romanova G.E., Koneva T.A.

'''Meskhetian Turks''' ({{Lang-tr|Ahıska Türkleri}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://cografya.ege.edu.tr/22_2_kahraman.pdf page78.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahiskalilar.org/portal/index.php ahiskalilar.org (turkish)]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ka|მესხეთის თურქები}} ''Meskhetis t'urk'ebi'') are an ethnic subgroup of [[Turkish people|Turks]] formerly inhabiting the [[Meskheti]] region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], along the border with [[Turkey]]. The Turkish presence in Meskheti began with the [[Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign|Turkish military expedition of 1578]],&lt;ref name="Aydıngün 2006 loc=4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aydıngün|Harding|Hoover|Kuznetsov|2006|loc=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes had settled in the region as early as the eleventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref name="Aydıngün 2006 loc=4"/&gt;

Today, the Meskhetian Turks are widely dispersed throughout the [[former Soviet Union]] (as well as in Turkey and the [[United States]]) due to [[Forced deportation in the Soviet Union|forced deportations]] during [[World War II]]. At the time, the [[Soviet Union]] was preparing to launch a pressure campaign against Turkey and [[Joseph Stalin]] wanted to clear the strategic Turkish population in Meskheti who were likely to be hostile to Soviet intentions.&lt;ref name="Bennigsen &amp; Broxup 1983 loc=30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennigsen|Broxup|1983|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the Meskhetian Turks were accused of smuggling, banditry and espionage in collaboration with their kin across the Turkish border. Expelled by Joseph Stalin from Georgia in 1944, they faced discrimination and human rights abuses before and after deportation.&lt;ref name="worldbulletin.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/140219/clashes-force-2000-meskhetian-turks-to-flee-ukraine|title=Clashes force 2,000 Meskhetian Turks to flee Ukraine - World Bulletin|website=World Bulletin|access-date=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 115,000 Meskhetian Turks were deported to [[Central Asia]] and subsequently only a few hundred have been able to return to Georgia. Those who migrated to Ukraine in 1990 settled in shanty towns inhabited by seasonal workers.&lt;ref name="worldbulletin.net"/&gt;

==Origins and terms==
[[File:Osmanlı Torunları Ahiskalı Türkleri.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Meskhetian/Ahiska Turks holding a banner saying "Osmanlıların Torunları: Ahiskalı Türkler" (The Ottoman Grandchildren: Ahiska Turks)]]

The origin of the Meskhetian is still unexplored and highly controversial. But now it seems to emerge two main directions:
# The ''pro-Turkish'' direction: The Meskhetians were ethnic Turks, descending from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] settlers, in which some Georgian were ethnic parts.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Glück: Metzler Lexikon Sprache, 2005, p. 774&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''pro-Georgian'' direction: [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] historiography has traditionally argued that the Meskhetian Turks, who speak the [[Kars]] dialect of the [[Turkish language]] and belong to the [[Hanafi]] school of [[Sunni Islam]], are simply [[Turkified]] [[Georgian people|Georgians]] converted to [[Islam]] in the period between the sixteenth century and 1829 when the region of [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]] (Historical [[Meskheti]]) was under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Khazanov 1995 loc=195"&gt;{{Harvnb|Khazanov|1995|loc=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Anatoly Michailovich Khazanov has argued that "it is quite possible that the adherents of this view oversimplified the ethnic history of the group, particularly if one compares it with another Muslim Georgian group, the [[Adzhar]], who in spite of their conversion to Islam have retained, not only the [[Georgian language]], but to some extent also the Georgian tradition culture and self-identification. Contrary to this, the traditional culture of Meshetian Turks, though it contained some Georgian elements, was similar to the Turkish one".&lt;ref name="Khazanov 1995 loc=195"/&gt; Kathryn Tomlinson has argued that in Soviet documents about the 1944 deportations of the Meskhetian Turks they were referred to simply as "Turks", and that it was after their second deportation from [[Uzbekistan]] that the term "Meskhetian Turks" was invented.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson 2005 loc=111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tomlinson|2005|loc=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Ronald Wixman, the term "Meskhetian" only came into use in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Wixman 1984 loc=134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wixman|1984|loc=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, majority of the Meskhetians call themselves simply as "Turks" or "Ahiskan Turks (Ahıska Türkleri)" referring to the region, meaning "Turks of Ahiska Region". The Meskhetians claim sometimes that the medieval [[Cumans]]-[[Kipchaks]] of Georgia ([[Kipchaks in Georgia]]) may have been one of their possible ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Yunusov, Arif. ''The Akhiska (Meskhetian Turks): Twice Deported People''. "Central Asia and Caucasus" (Lulea, Sweden), 1999 # 1(2), p. 162-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman conquest===
By the [[Peace of Amasya]] (1555), Meskheti was divided into two, with the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] keeping the eastern part and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] gaining the western part.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|page=xxxi}} In 1578, the Ottomans performed [[Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign|a successful invasion]] into the Safavid possessions in Georgia, initiating the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590]], and by 1582 they were in possession of the eastern (Safavid) part of [[Meskheti]] as well.{{sfn|Floor|2001|page=85}} The Safavids regained control over the eastern part of Meskheti in the early 17th century.{{sfn|Floor|2001|page=85}} However, by the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] (1639), all of Meskheti fell under Ottoman control, and it brought an end to Iranian attempts to retake the region.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson 2005 loc=110"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tomlinson|2005|loc=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Floor|2001|page=85}}

====1944 deportation from Georgia to Central Asia====
{{See|Deportation of the Meskhetian Turks}}
[[File:Ahiska Türk gençleri - 14 Kasım 1944 Unutmadık.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Young Ahiska Turks wearing T-shirts that read: 14 November, 1944, We have not forgotten the deportation.]]

On 15 November 1944, the then [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of [[CPSU]], [[Joseph Stalin]], ordered the deportation of over 115,000 Meskhetian Turks from their homeland,&lt;ref name="UNHCR 1999b loc=20"&gt;{{Harvnb|UNHCR|1999b|loc=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who were secretly driven from their homes and herded onto rail cars.&lt;ref name="Minahan 2002 loc=1240"&gt;{{Harvnb|Minahan|2002|loc=1240}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 30,000 to 50,000 deportees died of hunger, thirst and cold and as a direct result of the deportations and the deprivations suffered in exile.&lt;ref name="Polian 2004 loc=155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Polian|2004|loc=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minahan 2002 loc=1240"/&gt; The Soviet guards dumped the Meskhetian Turks at rail sidings across a vast region, often without food, water, or shelter. 

According to the [[1989 Soviet Census]], 106,000 Meskhetian Turks lived in Uzbekistan, 50,000 in [[Kazakhstan]], and 21,000 in [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref name="UNHCR 1999b loc=20"/&gt; As opposed to the other nationalities who had been deported during [[World War II]], no reason was given for the deportation of the Meskhetian Turks, which remained secret until 1968.&lt;ref name="Bennigsen &amp; Broxup 1983 loc=30"/&gt; It was only in 1968 that the Soviet government finally recognised that the Meskhetian Turks had been deported. The reason for the deportation of the Meskhetian Turks was because in 1944 the Soviet Union was preparing to launch a pressure campaign against [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Bennigsen &amp; Broxup 1983 loc=30"/&gt; In June 1945 [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], who was then Minister of Foreign Affairs, presented a demand to the Turkish Ambassador in Moscow for the surrender of three Anatolia provinces ([[Kars]], [[Ardahan]] and [[Artvin]]).&lt;ref name="Bennigsen &amp; Broxup 1983 loc=30"/&gt; As Moscow was also preparing to support [[Armenia]]n claims to several other Anatolian provinces, war against Turkey seemed possible, and Joseph Stalin wanted to clear the strategic Georgian-Turkish border where the Meskhetian Turks were settled and who were likely to be hostile to such Soviet intentions.&lt;ref name="Bennigsen &amp; Broxup 1983 loc=30"/&gt; 

Unlike the other deported Muslim groups, the Meskhetians have not been rehabilitated nor permitted to return to their homeland. In April 1970, the leaders of the Meskhetian Turkish national movement applied to the Turkish Embassy in Moscow for permission to emigrate to Turkey as Turkish citizens if the Soviet government persisted its refusal to allow them to resettle in Meskheti. However, the response of the Soviet government was to arrest the Meskhetian leaders.&lt;ref name="Bennigsen &amp; Broxup 1983 loc=31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennigsen|Broxup|1983|loc=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1989 deportation from Uzbekistan to other Soviet countries====
In 1989, riots broke out between the Meskhetian Turks who had settled in [[Uzbekistan]] and the native [[Uzbeks]].&lt;ref name="UNHCR 1999b loc=20"/&gt; Nationalist resentments against the Meskhetians who had competed with Uzbeks for resources in the overpopulated [[Fergana valley]] boiled over. Hundreds of Meskhetian Turks were dead or injured, nearly 1,000 properties were destroyed and thousands of Meskhetian Turks fled into [[exile]].&lt;ref name="UNHCR 1999b loc=20"/&gt; The majority of Meskhetian Turks, about 70,000, went to [[Azerbaijan]], whilst the remainder went to various regions of [[Russia]] (especially [[Krasnodar Krai]]), [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]&lt;ref name="UNHCR 1999b loc=20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNHCR 1999 loc=21"&gt;{{Harvnb|UNHCR|1999b|loc=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ukraine]].

=== War in Donbass ===
Around 2,000 Meskhetian Turks have been forced to flee from their homes in [[Ukraine]] since May amid [[War in Donbass|fighting]] between [[Armed Forces of Ukraine|government forces]] and [[War in Donbass|pro-Russian separatists]]. Meskhetian Turkish community representative in the eastern city of Donetsk, Nebican Basatov, said that those who have fled have sought refuge in [[Russia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]] and different parts of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="worldbulletin.net"/&gt; Over 300 Meskhetian Turks from the Turkish-speaking minority in eastern Ukraine have arrived in eastern Turkey’s Erzincan province where they will live under the country's recently adopted asylum measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Turkey welcomes Meskhetian Turks from east Ukraine - World Bulletin|url = http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/167797/turkey-welcomes-meskhetian-turks-from-east-ukraine|website = World Bulletin|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
[[File:Ahiskalı Türkler Beyaz Sarayda (Washington, ABD).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ahiska Turks outside the [[White House]] in [[Washington D.C.]].]]

According to the [[1989 Soviet Census]], there were 207,502 Turks living in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Aydıngün 2006 loc=1"/&gt; However, Soviet authorities recorded many Meskhetian Turks as belonging to other nationalities such as "[[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]]", "[[Kazakhs|Kazakh]]", "[[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]]", and "[[Uzbeks|Uzbek]]".&lt;ref name="Aydıngün 2006 loc=1"/&gt; Hence, official censuses do not necessarily show a true reflection of the real population of the Meskhetian Turks; for example, according to the 2009 Azerbaijani census, there were 38,000 Turks living in the country; however, no distinction is made in the census between Meskhetian Turks and Turks from Turkey who have become Azerbaijani citizens, as both groups are classified in the official census as "Turks" or "Azerbaijani".&lt;ref name=census&gt;{{cite web|author=The State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan |title=Population by ethnic groups |url=http://www.azstat.org/statinfo/demoqraphic/en/AP_/1_5.xls |accessdate=2012-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130101713/http://www.azstat.org/statinfo/demoqraphic/en/AP_/1_5.xls |archivedate=2012-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] report published in 1999, that 100,000 Meskhetian Turks lived in Azerbaijan and the defunct Baku Institute of Peace and Democracy stated, in 2001, that between 90,000 and 110,000 Meskhetian Turks lived in Azerbaijan,&lt;ref name="UNHCR 1999 loc=14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NATOPA&gt;{{cite web|author=NATO Parliamentary Assembly|title=Minorities in the South Caucasus: Factor of Instability?|url=http://www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=683|accessdate=2012-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308133627/http://www.nato-pa.int/Default.asp?SHORTCUT=683|archivedate=2012-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, academic estimates have also suggested that the Meskhetian Turkish community of Azerbaijan numbers 90,000 to 110,000.&lt;ref name="UNHCR 1999 loc=14"&gt;{{Harvnb|UNHCR|1999a|loc=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
More recently, some Meskhetian Turks in Russia, especially those in [[Krasnodar]], have faced hostility from the local population. The Krasnodar Meskhetian Turks have suffered significant human rights violations, including the deprivation of their citizenship. They are deprived of civil, political and social rights and are prohibited from owning property and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barton|Heffernan|Armstrong|2002|loc=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since 2004, many Turks have left the [[Krasnodar Krai|Krasnodar region]] for the [[United States]] as refugees. A large number of them, comprising nearly 1300 individuals, is in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. They are still barred from full repatriation to Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coşkun|2009|loc=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Georgia, racism against Meskheti Turks is still in popularity, due to difference beliefs and ethnic tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/meskhetian-turks/|title=Meskhetian Turks - Minority Rights Group|work=Minority Rights Group|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

===Religion===
Meskhetian Turks are Sunni Muslims.&lt;ref name="Aydıngün 2006 loc=15"/&gt;

===Language===
The Meskhetian Turks speak an [[Eastern Anatolia Region|Eastern Anatolian]] dialect of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which hails from the regions of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Ardahan]], and [[Artvin]].&lt;ref name="Aydıngün 2006 loc=23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aydıngün|Harding|Hoover|Kuznetsov|2006|loc=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Meskhetian Turkish dialect has also borrowed from other languages (including [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]) which the Meskhetian Turks have been in contact with during the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule.&lt;ref name="Aydıngün 2006 loc=23"/&gt;

=== Wedding ===
[[File:Meskhetian Bride.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Meskhetian bride in traditional attire.]]
Meskhetian Turks [[Wedding|weddings]] consist of a traditional proposal from the groom’s parents and if the bride’s parents accept the proposal, an [[engagement]] party, or ''Nişan'' , is done. Everyone at the ''Nişan'' is given a ceremonial sweet drink, called ''[[Sharbat]]''. The actual wedding lasts for two days. On the first day the bride leaves her house and on the second day is when the marriage happens. Before the bride enters her husband's house she uses the heel on her shoe to break two plates with her foot and applies honey on the doorway. This tradition serves the purpose of wishing happiness upon the new bride and groom in their marriage. At the end of the wedding, a dance ensues with the men and women dancing separately. Finally, the newlyweds have their last dance which is called the [[Waltz|‘Waltz]]’ and that completes the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meskhetian Turks: An Introduction to their History, Culture and Resettlement Experiences|last=|first=|publisher=the Center for Applied Linguistics|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Ranard|editor-first=Donald|location=Washington, DC|pages=18-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural-law argument''' for the existence of [[God]] was especially popular in the eighteenth century as a result of the influence of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. As [[Bertrand Russell]] pointed out much later, many of the things we consider to be [[Physical law|laws of nature]], in fact, are human conventions. Indeed, [[Albert Einstein]] has shown that [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] was such a convention, and though elegant and useful, one that did not describe the universe precisely. Most true laws are rather trivial, such as [[Mathematics|mathematical laws]], laws of [[probability]], and so forth, and much less impressive than those that were envisioned by Newton and his followers. Russell wrote:

:"If you say, as more orthodox theologians do, that in all the laws which God issues he had a reason for giving those laws rather than others -- the reason, of course, being to create the best universe, although you would never think it to look at it -- if there was a reason for the laws which God gave, then God himself was subject to law, and therefore you do not get any advantage by introducing God as an intermediary. You really have a law outside and anterior to the divine edicts, and God does not serve your purpose, because he is not the ultimate law-giver. In short, this whole argument from natural law no longer has anything like the strength that it used to have."

The argument of natural laws as a basis for God was changed by Christian figures such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], in order to fit biblical scripture and establish a Judeo-Christian [[Teleological argument|teleological law]].

'''Near poverty''' in economics refers to the state of living on an [[income]] marginally above the [[poverty line]], defined by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] at an income "between 100 percent and 125 percent of the poverty line".&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p60-248.pdf | title=Living in Near Poverty in the United States:  1966–2012 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | date=May 2014 | accessdate=7 July 2014 |author1=Hokayem, Charles |author2=Heggeness, Misty L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="al-jazeera" /&gt; The classification was first studied by the U.S. Census in a 2014 report that showed the number of people living just above the poverty line had decreased since the 1960s, believed to be due to an increase in the number of people who have fallen beneath the poverty line.&lt;ref name="al-jazeera"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/1/census-bureau-reportonlivinginnearpoverty.html | title=Census: U.S. has fewer ‘near poor’ as many slip into true poverty | publisher=Al Jazeera | date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=7 July 2014 | author=El Nasser, Haya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of Immigration Statistics''' ('''OIS''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] under the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans.

Since the passage of the [[Homeland Security Act]] of 2002, the Department of Homeland Security's [https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics Office of Immigration Statistics] has responsibility to carry out two statutory requirements: 1) to collect and disseminate to Congress and the public data and information useful in evaluating the [[Social science|social]], [[Economics|economic]], environmental, and [[Demography|demographic]] impact of [[immigration law]]s; and 2) to establish standards of reliability and validity for immigration [[statistics]] collected by the department's operational Components.

== Introduction ==
{{peacock|date=December 2017}}
Located within the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans and with a mission focused on data collection and analysis, the Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) is uniquely positioned to gather information from across the department and the entire [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] and to perform these centralizing analytic and dissemination functions. In so doing, the office provides critical support to three of the department's five core missions: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security (Mission 1), Secure and Manage Our Borders (Mission 2), and Enforce and Administer Our Immigration Laws (Mission 3).

The complexity of the immigration mission space drives further demand for high quality data and analysis from a range of policy stakeholders. The department's operational components require cross-cutting data to complete certain enforcement activities and to adjudicate certain claims. [[United States Congress|Congress]] seeks regular and comprehensive reporting on immigration benefits, immigration enforcement, border security, and migration inflows. Under the department's analytic agenda, senior leaders rely on detailed operational data and outcome metrics for strategic planning. Other executive branch actors also depend on empirical analysis to monitor and refine immigration policy. Most importantly, a firm commitment to transparency anchored in the collection and dissemination of clear and credible immigration data is essential to combating widespread confusion and misinformation about immigration trends, and to contribute to a more informed policy debate.

Since 2015, the department's commitment to empirical analysis and transparency has driven a major rebuilding effort, along with an effort to integrate the department's diverse and disparate immigration data systems. The newly reinvigorated Office of Immigration Statistics brings a unified and coordinated approach to supporting the homeland security mission. In doing so, OIS will foster cooperation and collaboration among the department's components to achieve a high level of quality data; to lead immigration research; to increase communication with partners, stakeholders, and customers; and to inform the department's overall decision-making process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Office%20of%20Immigration%20Statistics%20Strategic%20Plan%20FY%202016-2020%20%28Final%29_0.pdf|title=OIS Strategic Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=DHS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
OIS builds on a nearly two-century legacy of collecting and summarizing data on immigration into the United States. Such reporting began with the [[Steerage Act of 1819|"Steerage" (or "Passenger") Act]] of March 2, 1819, which required the Secretary of State to report to each session of Congress on the age, sex, occupation, and origins of passengers on arriving vessels. [[United States Department of State|The Department of State]] performed these duties until the early 1870s, after which responsibility shifted to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]'s Bureau of Statistics, followed by the [[United States Department of Commerce and Labor|Department of Commerce and Labor]] in 1903, and then the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] in 1913. [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)]] was transferred from the Department of Labor to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in 1940, where it resided until 2003, when the components of INS were subsumed under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Section 103 of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] establishes OIS's modern mandate: in consultation with interested academics, government agencies, and other parties, to provide Congress and the public, on an annual basis, with information about immigration and the impact of immigration laws. Section 701 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred these duties from the Statistics Branch of the Office of Policy and Planning of the INS to the DHS Undersecretary for Management, and charged OIS with establishing standards of reliability and validity for immigration statistics. OIS currently sits within DHS's Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans, and collects data from DHS's various operational Components, including [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)]], and [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)]], as well as from other Federal agencies such as the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]].

OIS meets these reporting mandates primarily through its flagship publication, ''[https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook The Yearbook of Immigration Statistics]''. The ''Yearbook'' reports on five immigration topics: [https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/lawful-permanent-residents lawful permanent residents], [https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/refugees-asylees refugees and asylees], [https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/naturalizations naturalizations], [https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/nonimmigrant nonimmigrant admissions], and [https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/enforcement-actions enforcement actions]. In addition to the yearbook, OIS publishes annual flow reports and [https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/population-estimates population estimates] that provide additional details on trends within each of these areas, and the office publishes additional reports and fact sheets on special topics as the need arises.

== Core Reports ==

=== The Yearbook of Immigration Statistics ===
The Yearbook of Immigration Statistics is a compendium of tables that provides data on foreign nationals who, during a fiscal year, were granted lawful permanent residence (i.e., admitted as immigrants or became legal permanent residents), were admitted into the United States on a temporary basis (e.g., tourists, students, or workers), applied for asylum or refugee status, or were naturalized. The Yearbook also presents data on immigration enforcement actions, including alien apprehensions, removals, and returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook|title=OIS Yearbook|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) ===
Lawful permanent residents (LPRs), also known as "green card" holders, are non-citizens who are lawfully authorized to live permanently within the United States. LPRs may accept an offer of employment without special restrictions, own property, receive financial assistance at public colleges and universities, and join the Armed Forces. They also may apply to become U.S. citizens if they meet certain eligibility requirements. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides several broad classes of admission for foreign nationals to gain LPR status, the largest of which focuses on admitting immigrants for the purpose of family reunification. Other major categories include economic and humanitarian immigrants, as well as immigrants from countries with relatively low levels of immigration to the United States.

The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) Annual Flow Reports on LPRs contain information obtained from foreign nationals' applications for LPR status on the number and characteristics of persons who became LPRs during a given fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/lawful-permanent-residents|title=LPRs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refugees and Asylees ===
A refugee is a person outside his or her country of nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An asylee is a person who meets the definition of refugee and is already present in the United States or is seeking admission at a port of entry. Refugees are required to apply for Lawful Permanent Resident ("green card") status one year after being admitted, and asylees may apply for green card status one year after their grant of asylum.

The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) ''Annual Flow Reports'' on refugees and asylees contain information obtained from the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS) of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the U.S. Department of State on the numbers and demographic profiles of persons admitted to the United States as refugees, and those applying for and granted asylum status during a given fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/refugees-asylees|title=Refugees and Asylees|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naturalizations ===
Naturalization confers U.S. citizenship upon foreign nationals who have fulfilled the requirements Congress established in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). After naturalization, foreign-born citizens enjoy nearly all of the same benefits, rights, and responsibilities that the Constitution gives to native-born U.S. citizens, including the right to vote.

The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) ''Annual Flow Reports'' on naturalization contain information obtained from naturalization applications on the number and characteristics of persons aged 18 years and older who became naturalized US citizens during a given fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/naturalizations|title=Naturalizations|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonimmigrant Admissions ===
Nonimmigrants are foreign nationals granted temporary admission into the United States. The major purposes for which nonimmigrant admission may be authorized include temporary visits for business or pleasure, academic or vocational study, temporary employment, or to act as a representative of a foreign government or international organization, among others.

The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) ''Annual Flow Reports'' on nonimmigrants contain information obtained from I-94 arrival records on the number and characteristics of nonimmigrant admissions to the United States during a given fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/nonimmigrant|title=Nonimmigrant Admissions|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration Enforcement Actions ===
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engages in immigration enforcement actions to prevent unlawful entry into the United States and to apprehend and repatriate aliens who have violated or failed to comply with U.S. immigration laws. Primary responsibility for the enforcement of immigration law within DHS rests with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). CBP enforces immigration laws at and between the ports of entry, ICE is responsible for interior enforcement and for detention and removal operations, and USCIS adjudicates applications and petitions for immigration and naturalization benefits.

The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) annual ''Immigration Enforcement Actions'' reports contain information obtained from CBP and ICE case records and processed by OIS to describe the number and characteristics of foreign nationals found inadmissible, apprehended, arrested, detained, returned, or removed during a given fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/enforcement-actions|title=Enforcement Actions|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population Estimates ===
The Office of Immigration Statistics occasionally publishes population estimates of a particular subgroup. Population estimates take information on immigration flows and may combine it with other counts or estimates, such as those in the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS), as well as demographic life expectancy tables to give an idea of population size and characteristics in a given year. Terminology, data sources, and methodology may have shifted over time. Current series include population estimates for unauthorized immigrants, nonimmigrants, and lawful permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/population-estimates|title=Population Estimates|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional Reports ==

=== Enforcement Priorities ===

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engages in immigration enforcement actions to prevent unlawful entry into the United States and to apprehend and repatriate aliens who have violated or failed to comply with U.S. immigration laws. In 2014, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced a number of measures to strengthen and unify the department's immigration enforcement priorities by concentrating resources on the arrest, detention, and removal of individuals identified as posing a threat to national security, public safety, or border security. The 2014 priorities emphasize criminal convictions over criminal arrests, and focus on felonies and significant or multiple misdemeanors over minor infractions of the law. The priorities also focus on forward-looking efforts to further reduce unlawful migration by targeting recent border crossers and those who significantly abuse the visa system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/enforcement-priorities|title=Enforcement Priorities|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration Statistics Fact Sheets ===

In addition to its regularly published yearbook and flow reports, the Office of Immigration Statistics also occasionally publishes various shorter fact sheets on widely varying topics ranging from characteristics of those apprehended at the border in a given time period to reports on immigrants' interstate migration between the acquisition of lawful permanent resident (LPR) status and citizenship. Reports may use Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data or publicly available data from other sources, such as from the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/factsheets|title=OIS Fact Sheets|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration Infographics ===

Immigration Infographics produced by OIS describe key immigration topics such as the number and characteristics of lawful permanent residents, refugees and asylees, naturalizations, nonimmigrant admissions, and immigration enforcement actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/visualization|title=Infographics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical Library ===

The historical library was created in 1987 as part of the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) History Office. Its mission is to track the agency history and the implementation of federal government immigration policy from 1891—when the federal government first created the Immigration Bureau—through its present time. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is now the government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/library|title=Historical Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users browse books online and have their choices home-delivered, rather than physically visiting a [[library]] to borrow a book. This [[e-commerce]] model is very similar to the popular [[video rental]] service provided by the California-based [[Netflix]]. Online book rental is gaining popularity in India, with a number of websites offering free doorstep delivery for a small monthly fee. The popularity of such websites can be attributed to increasing internet usage in the country; India is expected to have the third-largest number of internet users in the world by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/biz/india-business/India-to-have-3rd-largest-number-of-Internet-users-by-2013/articleshow/4821630.cms India to have 3rd largest number of Internet users by 2013 – The Times of India]. Timesofindia.indiatimes.com (2009-07-26). Retrieved on 2012-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics for the publishing industry are also promising.

== {{anchor|The rental system}}Rental system ==

Online book-rental services save time by delivering books to a member's home or office. In addition to convenience, the service also offers an ease-of-use benefit; membership on most websites involves a simple [[registration form]] and payment through [[bank transfer]] or [[Collect on delivery|cash on delivery]]. This is important in a market that does not yet trust internet-based monetary transactions. Once membership is paid the user logs in to browse books, and clicks the "rent" button to receive the chosen books at home. The books are collected when the user logs in to indicate that he or she has finished reading.&lt;!-- How are the books collected? --&gt; Another advantage of online rental services is that most do not have any due dates or late fees; borrowers may keep books for as long as they wish, provided they pay the regular [[subscription]].
This era is changing, edits being made with education book selling. Engineering books are often taken on rent for a semester or 2 and returned after use. With the online space roaring, newer start ups have emerged in online book renting. In engineering book stores, you order books and pay Cash on Delivery, after usage you collect back up to 70% of the invoice back. 

== Presence ==

Online libraries and rental companies have come  with a national presence and are trying to reach other smaller cities by using courier companies and the postal service to deliver books. These new ventures have become popular with the trend towards internet-based [[marketing]]; almost all have their own [[blog]]s and [[Facebook]] pages. Ventures like Pustakkosh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pustakkosh.com|title=Pustak Kosh - India's Leading TextBook and Student Need Rental Company|last=https://www.pustakkosh.com|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Justbooks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetechpanda.com/2013/06/10/justbooks-clc-the-economical-and-flexible-library-service-to-rent-and-read-books/|title=JustBooks CLC - Library Service to Rent and Read Books|website=thetechpanda.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; are major national level players in Indian online book rental scenario.

== {{anchor|E-books vs physical books}}Electronic versus print books ==

There is speculation as to the survival of these ventures, as more people use [[Amazon Kindle]] and read books online. However, most book-lovers prefer a physical book, and this is the premise on which these new ventures are based. Their success remains to be seen; however, they offer a ray of hope for young professionals in the country who currently lack access to books. Apart from the metropolitan areas, most cities and towns in India do not have good, well-stocked [[public libraries]]. For the residents of these cities, such ventures may offer an economical way to bridge the gap.

[[wiktionary:post-truth|Post-truth]] differs from traditional contesting and falsifying of facts by relegating facts and expert opinions to be of secondary importance relative to appeal to emotion. While this has been described as a contemporary problem, some observers have described it as a long-standing part of political life that was less notable before the advent of the [[Internet]] and related social changes.

{{As of|2018}} political commentators have identified post-truth politics as ascendant in many nations, notably the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Brazil, among others. As with other areas of debate, this is being driven by a combination of the [[24-hour news cycle]], [[false balance]] in news reporting, and the increasing ubiquity of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=economist-10-9-16&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21706498-dishonesty-politics-nothing-new-manner-which-some-politicians-now-lie-and |title="The post-truth world: Yes, I’d lie to you," '&amp;#39;The Economist'&amp;#39; Sept 10, 2016 |publisher=Economist.com |date=2016-09-10 |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Age-abbott"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/tony-abbotts-carbon-tax-outrage-signals-nadir-of-posttruth-politics-20140717-ztz2b.html|title=Tony Abbott's carbon tax outrage signals nadir of post-truth politics |date=14 July 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016|author=John Connor|newspaper=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Age-futile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/to-name-and-address/everything-but-the-truth-what-we-share-with-the-brexit-campaign-and-trump/|title=Life in post-truth times: What we share with the Brexit campaign and Trump|date=30 June 2016|author=Amulya Gopalakrishnan|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030763-000-free-speech-has-become-sound-bites-with-revolutionary-results/|title=Free speech has met social media, with revolutionary results|date=1 June 2016|newspaper=New Scientist|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, ''post-truth'' was chosen as the [[Oxford word of the year|Oxford Dictionaries' Word of the Year]],&lt;ref name="wordofyear"/&gt; due to its prevalence in the context of that year's [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit referendum]] and media coverage of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt;

==History==
According to [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]], the term ''post-truth'' was first used in a 1992 essay by the late Serbian-American playwright [[Steve Tesich]] in ''[[The Nation]]''. Tesich writes that following the shameful truth of [[Watergate]], more assuaging coverage of the [[Iran–Contra scandal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB567-Iran-Contra-Reagan-Oliver-North-and-Post-Truth-30-years-later/ |title=The Iran-Contra Affair 30 Years Later: A Milestone in Post-Truth Politics |work=National Security Archive|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] demonstrate that "we, as a free people, have freely decided that we want to live in some post-truth world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/15/post-truth-named-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-dictionaries| title= 'Post-truth' named word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries| first=Alison | last=Flood | date = 15 November 2016 | accessdate = 20 November 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kreitner |first=Richard |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/post-truth-and-its-consequences-what-a-25-year-old-essay-tells-us-about-the-current-moment/ |title=Post-Truth and Its Consequences: What a 25-Year-Old Essay Tells Us About the Current Moment |date=30 November 2016 |work=The Nation |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Ralph Keyes (author)|Ralph Keyes]] used the term "post-truth era" in his book by that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keyes|first1=Ralph|title=The Post-Truth Era: Dishonesty and Deception in Contemporary Life|date=2004|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year American journalist [[Eric Alterman]] spoke of a "post-truth political environment" and coined the term "the post-truth presidency" in his analysis of the misleading statements made by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] after 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alterman|first1=Eric|title=When Presidents Lie: A History of Official Deception and Its Consequences|date=2004|publisher=[[Viking Press|Viking]]|location=New York|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2004 book ''Post-democracy'', Colin Crouch used the phrase "post-democracy" to mean a model of politics where "elections certainly exist and can change governments," but "public electoral debate is a tightly controlled spectacle, managed by rival teams of professionals expert in the techniques of persuasion, and considering a small range of issues selected by those teams." Crouch directly attributes the "advertising industry model" of political communication to the crisis of trust and accusations of dishonesty that a few years later others have associated with post-truth politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crouch|first1=Colin|title=Post-democracy|date=2004|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge, UK|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "post-truth politics" was coined by the blogger David Roberts in a blog post for ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]'' on 1 April 2010, where it was defined as "a political culture in which politics (public opinion and media [[narrative]]s) have become almost entirely disconnected from policy (the substance of legislation)".&lt;ref name="HuffCoinage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tom-jeffery/britain-needs-more-democr_b_10699898.html|title=Britain Needs More Democracy After the EU Referendum, Not Less|author=Tom Jeffery|date=26 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|website=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coining"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://grist.org/article/2010-03-30-post-truth-politics/|title=Post-Truth Politics|date=1 April 2010|website=Grist|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post truth was used by philosopher  [[Joseph Heath]] to describe the [[2014 Ontario election]]. The term became widespread during the campaigns for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] in the United States and the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 "Brexit" referendum on membership in the European Union]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt; [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] declared that its international word of the year in 2016 is "post-truth", citing a 2,000% increase in usage compared to 2015.&lt;ref name="wordofyear"&gt;{{cite web |last=Flood |first=Alison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/15/post-truth-named-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-dictionaries |title='Post-truth' named word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries |work=The Guardian |date=15 November 2016 |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Hochschild, H.L. Jayne Professor of Government at [[Harvard University]], has described the rise of post-truth as a return to 18th and 19th century political and media practices in the United States, following a period in the 20th century where the media was relatively balanced and rhetoric was toned down.&lt;ref name="Harvard-politics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/07/politics-in-a-post-truth-age/|title=Politics in a 'post-truth' age|newspaper=[[Harvard Gazette]]|date=14 July 2016|accessdate=6 August 2016|author= Christina Pazzanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Not so in Britain and elsewhere necessarily; for example, in 1957 scientist [[Kathleen Lonsdale]] remarked that "for many people truthfulness in politics has now become a mockery.... Anyone who listens to the radio in a mixed company of thinking people knows how deep-seated is this cynicism." &lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Lonsdale, ''Is Peace Possible?'' by Penguin Books, 1957, p 11&lt;/ref&gt;) 

The [[pamphlet wars]] that arose with the growth of printing and literacy beginning in the 1600s have been described as an early form of post-truth politics. Slanderous and vitriolic pamphlets were cheaply printed and widely disseminated, and the dissent that they fomented contributed to starting wars and revolutions such as the [[English Civil War]] and the [[American War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut"/&gt;

A defining trait of post-truth politics is that campaigners continue to repeat their talking points, even when media outlets, experts in the field in question, and others provide proof that contradicts these talking points.&lt;ref name="Preston"&gt;{{cite news|title=Broadcast news is losing its balance in the post-truth era|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/09/post-truth-politics-us-broadcasting|date=9 September 2012|accessdate=11 July 2016|author=Peter Preston|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during campaigning for the British EU referendum campaign, [[Vote Leave]] made repeated use of the claim that EU membership cost £350&amp;nbsp;million a week, although later began to use the figure as a net amount of money sent directly to the EU. This figure, which ignored the [[UK rebate]] and other factors, was described as "potentially misleading" by the [[UK Statistics Authority]], as "not sensible" by the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], and was rejected in fact checks by [[BBC News]], [[Channel 4 News]] and [[Full Fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/|title=The UK's EU membership fee|website=Full Fact|date=27 May 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36040060|title=Reality Check: Would Brexit mean extra £350m a week for NHS?|author=Anthony Reuben|publisher=BBC News|date=25 April 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-send-350m-week-brussels/22804|title=FactCheck: do we really send £350m a week to Brussels?|author=Patrick Worrall|date=19 April 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|website=Channel 4 News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708115949/http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-send-350m-week-brussels/22804|archivedate=8 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vote Leave nevertheless continued to use the figure as a centrepiece of their campaign until the day of the referendum, after which point they downplayed the pledge as having been an "example", pointing out that it was only ever suggested as a possible alternative use of the net funds sent to the EU.&lt;ref name="ind11"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Jon|title=Vote Leave's £350m for the NHS pledge was ‘just an example’, says group's chair|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/gisela-stuart-vote-leaves-350m-for-the-nhs-pledge-was-just-an-example-the-groups-chair-says-a7238451.html|accessdate=16 November 2016|work=The Independent|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tory MP and Leave campaigner [[Sarah Wollaston]], who left the group in protest during its campaign, criticised its "post-truth politics".&lt;ref name="Wollaston"/&gt;

[[Michael Deacon (journalist)|Michael Deacon]], [[parliamentary sketch writing|parliamentary sketchwriter]] for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', summarised the core message of post-truth politics as "Facts are negative. Facts are pessimistic. Facts are unpatriotic."  He added that post-truth politics can also include a claimed rejection of [[Polarization (politics)|partisanship]] and [[negative campaigning]].&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/09/in-a-world-of-post-truth-politics-andrea-leadsom-will-make-the-p/|title=In a world of post-truth politics, Andrea Leadsom will make the perfect PM |author=Michael Deacon|date=9 July 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, campaigners can push a [[utopia]]n "positive campaign" to which rebuttals can be dismissed as [[Smear campaign|smears]] and [[scaremongering]] and opposition as partisan.&lt;ref name="Coining"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

In its most extreme mode, post-truth politics can make use of [[conspiracism]].&lt;ref name="Humanists"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://thehumanist.com/magazine/january-february-2016/church-state/humanists-rise-post-truth-america|title=Humanists and the Rise of "Post-Truth America"|author=Roy Boston|date=22 December 2015|accessdate=11 July 2016|magazine=The Humanist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-campaign-republican-us-election-2016-what-it-says-about-a7022276.html|title=Donald Trump's post-truth campaign and what it says about the dismal state of US politics|author=Chris Cillizza|date=10 May 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this form of post-truth politics, false rumors (such as the "[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birther]]" or "[[Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories|Muslim]]" conspiracy theories about Barack Obama) become major news topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harsin|first1=Jayson|title=That's Democratainment: Obama, Rumor Bombs and Primary Definers|url=http://www.flowjournal.org/2010/10/thats-democratainment/|website=Flow TV|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the "[[Pizzagate conspiracy theory|pizzagate]]" conspiracy, this resulted in a man entering the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria and firing an [[AR-15]] rifle.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, Cecilia, A. D. A. M. Goldman, and WASHINGTON—Edgar M. Welch. "In Washington pizzeria attack, fake news brought real guns." ''The New York Times'' 5 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to simply telling untruths, writers such as Jack Holmes of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' describe the process as something different, with Holmes putting it as: "So, if you don't know what's true, you can say whatever you want and it's not a lie".&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

In 2015 media and Politics scholar Jayson Harsin coined the term "regime of post-truth" which encompasses many aspects of post-truth politics. He argues that a convergent set of developments have created the conditions of post-truth society: the political communication informed by cognitive science, which aims at managing perception and belief of segmented populations through techniques like [[microtargeting]] which includes the strategic use of [[Rumor#Political communication strategy|rumors]] and falsehoods; the fragmentation of modern, more centralized mass news media gatekeepers, which have largely repeated one another's scoops and their reports; the attention economy marked by information overload and acceleration, user-generated content and fewer society-wide common trusted authorities to distinguish between truth and lies, accurate and inaccurate; the algorithms which govern what appears in social media and search engine rankings, based on what users want (per algorithm) and not on what is factual; and news media which have been marred by scandals of plagiarism, hoaxes, propaganda, and changing news values. These developments have occurred on the background of economic crises, downsizing and favoring trends toward more traditional [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] stories and [[Tabloid journalism|styles of reporting]], known as tabloidization&lt;ref&gt;Frank Esser [http://ejc.sagepub.com/content/14/3/291.short?rss=1&amp;ssource=mfc `Tabloidization' of News. A Comparative Analysis of Anglo-American and German Press Journalism] European Journal of Communication Vol 14, Issue 3, 1999 September 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[infotainment]].  

While some of these phenomena (such as a more tabloidesque press) may suggest a return to the past, the effect of the convergences is a socio-political phenomenon which exceeds earlier forms of journalism in deliberate distortion and struggle. Fact-checking and rumor-busting sites abound, but they are unable to reunite a fragmented set of audiences (attention-wise) and their respective trustful-/distrustfulness.  Harsin has called it a "regime of post-truth" instead of merely post-truth politics, professional pan-partisan political communication manipulates the communication competitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=24 February 2015|title=Regimes of Posttruth, Postpolitics, and Attention Economies|journal=Communication, Culture &amp; Critique|volume=8|issue=2|pages=327–333|last1=Harsin|first1=Jayson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major news outlets ===
Several trends in the media landscape have been blamed for the perceived rise of post-truth politics. One contributing factor has been the proliferation of state-funded news agencies like [[CCTV News]] and [[RT (TV network)|RT]], and [[Voice of America]] in the USA which allow states to influence [[Western world|Western]] audiences. According to [[Peter Pomerantsev]], a British-Russian journalist who worked for [[TNT (Russian TV channel)|TNT]] in Moscow, one of their prime objectives has been to de-legitimize Western institutions, including the structures of government, democracy, and human rights.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} 
As of 2016, trust in the mainstream media in the US had reached historical lows.&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the post-truth political era might be around for a while|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/16/why-the-post-truth-political-era-might-be-around-for-a-while/|author=[[Daniel W. Drezner]]|date=16 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been suggested that under these conditions, [[Fact checker|fact checking]] by news outlets struggles to gain traction among the wider public&lt;ref name="WaPo-era" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delivering trust: Impartiality and objectivity in the digital age|date=January 2012|author=Richard Sambrook|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/33772/1/Delivering_Trust_Impartiality_and_Objectivity_in_a_Digital_Age.pdf|website=Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism|publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that politicians resort to increasingly drastic messaging.&lt;ref name="Age-futile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Facts are futile in an era of post-truth politics|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/facts-are-futile-in-an-era-of-posttruth-politics-20140227-33m70.html|author=Gay Alcorn|newspaper=The Age|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many news outlets desire to appear to be, or have a policy of being, [[impartiality|impartial]]. Many writers have noted that in some cases, this leads to [[false balance]], the practice of giving equal emphasis to unsupported or discredited claims without challenging their factual basis.&lt;ref&gt;

But a major media organization taking meaningful steps to do something about it is."&lt;/ref&gt; The 24-hour news cycle also means that news channels repeatedly draw on the same public figures, which benefits PR-savvy politicians and means that presentation and personality can have a larger impact on the audience than facts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Post-Truth Era: Dishonesty and Deception in Contemporary Life|pages=127–128|year=2004|author=Ralph Keyes|isbn=9781429976220}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the process of claim and counter-claim can provide grist for days of news coverage at the expense of deeper analysis of the case.&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump"/&gt;

=== Social media and the Internet ===
[[Social media]] adds an additional dimension, as user networks can become [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers]] possibly emphasised by the [[filter bubble]] where one political viewpoint dominates and scrutiny of claims fails,&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FT-trust"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/24035fc2-3e45-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a.html|title=Why we no longer trust the experts|date=1 July 2016|author=Gillian Tett|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing a parallel [[media ecosystem]] of websites, publishers and news channels to develop, which can repeat post-truth claims without rebuttal.&lt;ref name="Humanist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehumanist.com/magazine/january-february-2016/church-state/humanists-rise-post-truth-america|title=Humanists and the Rise of "Post-Truth America"|date=22 December 2015|author=Rob Boston|accessdate=6 August 2016|newspaper=The Humanist}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this environment, post-truth campaigns can ignore fact checks or dismiss them as being motivated by bias.&lt;ref name="Indy" /&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' editor-in-chief [[Katherine Viner]] laid some of the blame on the rise of [[clickbait]], articles of dubious factual content with a misleading headline and which are designed to be widely shared, saying that "chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity" undermines the value of journalism and truth.&lt;ref name="Viner"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth| title=How technology disrupted the truth| date=12 July 2016|accessdate=12 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Katherine Viner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, David Mikkelson, co-founder of the [[fact checking]] and [[debunking]] site ''[[Snopes.com]]'', described the introduction of social media and [[fake news sites]] as a turning point, saying "I’m not sure I’d call it a post-truth age but … there’s been an opening of the sluice-gate and everything is pouring through. The bilge keeps coming faster than you can pump."&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/snopes-com-internet-fact-checker-post-truth-david-mikkelson| title=Can mythbusters like Snopes.com keep up in a post-truth era?| date=1 August 2016|author=Rory Carroll|accessdate=23 October 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital culture allows anybody with a computer and access to the internet to post their opinions online and mark them as fact which may become legitimized through echo-chambers and other users validating one another. Content may be judged based on how many views a post gets, creating an atmosphere that appeals to emotion, audience biases, or headline appeal instead of researched fact. Content which gets more views is continually filtered around different internet circles, regardless of its legitimacy. Some also argue that the abundance of fact available at any time on the internet leads to an attitude focused on knowing basic claims to information instead of an underlying truth or formulating carefully thought-out opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/post-truth-politics/|title=Is Digital Culture Responsible for Post-Truth Politics? - Eliane Glaser {{!}} Open Transcripts|work=Open Transcripts|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet allows people to choose where they get their information, allowing them to reinforce their own opinions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/opinion/campaign-stops/the-age-of-post-truth-politics.html|title=The Age of Post-Truth Politics|last=Davies|first=William|date=2016-08-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-03|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polarized political culture ===
The rise of post-truth politics coincides with polarized political beliefs. A [[Pew Research Center]] study of American adults found that "those with the most consistent ideological views on the left and right have information streams that are distinct from those of individuals with more mixed political views—and very distinct from each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amy Mitchell|first1=Amy|last2=Kiley|first2=Jocelyn|last3=Eva Matsa|first3=Katerina|last4=Gottfied|first4=Jeffrey|title=Political Polarization &amp; Media Habits|url=http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is becoming increasingly accessible as new technologies are introduced to the everyday lives of citizens. An obsession for data and statistics also filters into the political scene, and political debates and speeches become filled with snippets of information that may be misconstrued, false, or not contain the whole picture. Sensationalized television news emphasizes grand statements and further publicizes politicians. This shaping from the media influences how the public views political issues and candidates.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Dissenting views ==

In an editorial, ''[[New Scientist]]'' suggested "a cynic might wonder if politicians are actually any more dishonest than they used to be", and hypothesized that "fibs once whispered into select ears are now overheard by everyone".&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut"/&gt; Similarly, Viner suggested that while social media has helped some untruths to spread, it has also restrained others; as an example, she said ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''{{'}}s false "[[Hillsborough disaster#The Sun|The Truth]]" story following the [[Hillsborough disaster]], and the associated police cover-up, would be hard to imagine in the social media age.&lt;ref name="Viner"/&gt; The journalist George Gillett has suggested that the term "post-truth" mistakenly conflates empirical and ethical judgements, writing that the supposedly "post-truth" movement is in fact a rebellion against "expert economic opinion becoming a surrogate for values-based political judgements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgegillett.com/2017/04/20/the-myth-of-post-truth-politics/|title=The myth of post-truth politics|date=20 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toby Young]], writing for ''[[The Spectator]]'', called the term a "cliché" used selectively primarily by [[left-wing]] commentators to attack what are actually universal [[Confirmation bias|ideological bias]]es, contending that "[w]e are all post-truthers and probably always have been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/the-truth-about-post-truth-politics/|title=The truth about 'post-truth politics'|date=16 July 2016&lt;!-- Print date, presumably - web article was online earlier--&gt;|accessdate=14 July 2016|author=Toby Young|newspaper=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' has called this argument "complacent", however, identifying a qualitative difference between political scandals of previous generations, such as those surrounding the [[Suez Crisis]] and the [[Iran–Contra affair]] (which involved attempting to cover-up the truth) and contemporary ones in which public facts are simply ignored.&lt;ref name=economist-10-9-16/&gt; Similarly, Alexios Mantzarlis of the [[Poynter Institute]] said that political lies were not new and identified several political campaigns in history which would now be described as "post-truth". For Mantzarlis, the "post-truth" label was—to some extent—a "[[coping mechanism]] for commentators reacting to attacks on not just any facts, but on those central to their belief system", but also noted that 2016 had been "an acrimonious year for politics on both sides of the Atlantic".&lt;ref name="Poynter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/2016/no-were-not-in-a-post-fact-era/421582/|title=No, we’re not in a ‘post-fact’ era|date=21 July 2016|accessdate=27 October 2016|author=Alexios Mantzarlis|website=Poynter Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantzarlis also noted that interest in [[fact checking]] had never been higher, suggesting that at least part of the electorate rejects "post-truth" politics.&lt;ref name="Poynter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fact-check-this-is-not-really-a-post-fact-election/2016/10/07/7ef5f8fa-85c0-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html|title=Fact check: This is not really a post-fact election|publisher=Washington Post|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=27 October 2016|author=Alexios Mantzarlis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Helfand]] argues, following Edward M. Harris, that "public prevarication is nothing new" and that it is the "knowledge of the audience" and the "limits of plausibility" within a technology-saturated environment that have changed. We are, rather, in an age of misinformation where such limits of plausibility have vanished and where everyone feels equally qualified to make claims that are easily shared and propagated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Helfand |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David Helfand |title=Surviving the Misinformation Age |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=34-39 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006193643/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/surviving_the_misinformation_age |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Post-truth politics has been applied as a political buzzword to a wide range of political cultures; one article in ''The Economist'' identified post-truth politics in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[North Korea]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=economist-10-9-16/&gt;

===Germany===

In December 2016 "[[:de:Postfaktische Politik|postfaktisch]]" (post-factual) was named word of the year by the ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'' (''German language society''), also in connection with a rise of [[right-wing populism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gfds.de/wort-des-jahres-2016/|title=GfdS wählt »postfaktisch« zum Wort des Jahres 2016|date=9 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Alternative for Germany#Petry assumes leadership, Lucke quits|2015]] on.  Since the 1990s, "[[Colin Crouch#Post Democracy|post-democracy]]" was used in sociology more and more.

===India===
Amulya Gopalakrishnan, columnist for ''[[The Times of India]]'', identified similarities between the Trump and Brexit campaigns on the one hand, and [[hot-button issue]]s in India such as the [[Ishrat Jahan case]] and the ongoing case against [[Teesta Setalvad]] on the other, where accusations of forged evidence and [[historical revisionism]] have resulted in an "ideological impasse".&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump"/&gt;

===South Africa===

Health care and education in South Africa was substantially compromised during the presidency of [[Thabo Mbeki]] due to his [[HIV/AIDS denialism]].

===United Kingdom===
An early use of the phrase in British politics was in March 2012 by [[Scottish Labour]] [[Member of Scottish Parliament|MSP]] [[Iain Gray]] in criticising the difference between [[Scottish National Party]]'s claims and official statistics.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beware the black art of post-truth politics|author=Iain Gray|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/iain-gray-beware-the-black-art-of-post-truth-politics-1-2146059|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish Labour leader [[Jim Murphy]] also described an undercurrent of post-truth politics in which people "cheerfully [[shooting the messenger|shot the messenger]]" when presented with facts that didn't support their viewpoint, seeing it among pro-independence campaigners in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], [[Jeremy Corbyn]] supporters in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|2015 Labour leadership election]], and Leave campaigners in the then-upcoming EU membership referendum.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2015/09/we-live-volatile-age-post-truth-politics-and-so-brexit-cannot-be-ruled-out|title=We live in a volatile age of post-truth politics – and so Brexit cannot be ruled out|author=Jim Murphy|newspaper=New Statesman|date=23 September 2015|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-truth politics has been retroactively identified in the [[lead-up to the Iraq War]],&lt;ref name="Dunt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Post-truth politics is driving us mad |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/06/29/post-truth-politics-is-driving-us-mad|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|publisher=politics.co.uk|author=Ian Dunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly after the [[Chilcot Report]], published in July 2016, concluded that [[Tony Blair]] misrepresented [[military intelligence]] to support his view that [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq's chemical weapons program]] was advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/08/iraq-war-tony-blair-creativity-chilcot-inquiry|title=Millions of us knew the Iraq war would be a catastrophe.

The phrase became widely used during the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 UK EU membership referendum]] to describe the Leave campaign.&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wollaston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirror-350m"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/post-truth-politics-michael-gove-8111335|title=Post-truth politics: Michael Gove accused of 'importing Trump campaign' to Britain with £350m a week claim|newspaper=The Mirror|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|author=Mikey Smith, Rachel Bishop}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faisal Islam]], political editor for [[Sky News]], said that [[Michael Gove]] used "post-fact politics" that were imported from the Trump campaign; in particular, Gove's comment in an interview that "I think people in this country have had enough of experts..." was singled out as illustrative of a post-truth trend, although this is only part of a longer statement.&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirror-350m"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Flinders (academic)|Matthew Flinders]], [http://blog.oup.com/2016/07/post-political-democracy-uk-referendum Post-truth, post-political, post-democracy: the tragedy of the UK's referendum on the European Union], ''OUPBlog'' ([[Oxford University Press]] (3 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Arron Banks]], the founder of the unofficial [[Leave.EU]] campaign, said that "facts don't work ... You've got to connect with people emotionally. It's the Trump success."&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt; [[Andrea Leadsom]]—a prominent campaigner for Leave in the EU referendum and one of the two final candidates in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Conservative leadership election]]—has been singled out as a post-truth politician,&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt; especially after she denied having disparaged rival [[Theresa May]]'s childlessness in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in spite of transcript evidence.&lt;ref name="Viner"/&gt;

===United States===
In its original formulation, the phrase "post-truth politics" was used to describe the paradoxical situation in the United States where the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which enforced stricter [[party discipline]] than the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was nevertheless able to present itself as more [[bipartisan]], since individual Democrats were more likely to support Republican policies than vice versa.&lt;ref name="Coining"/&gt; The term was used by [[Paul Krugman]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' to describe [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign]] in which certain claims—such as that [[Barack Obama]] had cut defense spending and that he had embarked on an "apology tour"—continued to be repeated long after they had been debunked.&lt;ref name="Krugman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/opinion/krugman-the-post-truth-campaign.html|title=The Post-Truth Campaign|date=23 December 2011|author=Paul Krugman|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of scientific [[denialism]] in modern American politics include the [[anti-vaxxer]] movement, and the [[Genetically modified food controversies|belief that existing genetically modified foods are harmful]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://yoelinbar.net/papers/gmo_absolute.pdf|title=Evidence for Absolute Moral Opposition to Genetically Modified Food in the United States|first1=Sydney E.|last1=Scott|first2=Yoel|last2=Inbar|first3=Paul|last3=Rozin|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=315–324|doi=10.1177/1745691615621275|pmid=27217243}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a strong scientific consensus that no currently marketed GMO foods have any negative health effects.&lt;ref&gt;See {{section link|Denialism|Genetically modified foods}} for extensive citations.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[health freedom movement]] in the U.S. resulted in the passage of the bipartisan [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]], which allows the sale of dietary supplements without any evidence that they are safe or effective for the purposes consumers expect, though the FDA has begun regulation of [[homeopathic]] products.

In a review for the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'', Christopher Robichaud—a lecturer in ethics and public policy at [[Harvard Kennedy School]]—described [[conspiracy theories]] about the legitimacy of elections and politicians, such as the "[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birther]]" idea that [[Barack Obama]] is not a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born U.S. citizen]],&lt;!--, and claims from the [[Bernie Sanders]] [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] that the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Party candidate selection]] was rigged towards [[Hillary Clinton]]--&gt;&amp;nbsp;as one side-effect of post-truth politics. Robichaud also contrasted the behaviour of the candidates with that following the contested result of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]], in which [[Al Gore]] conceded and encouraged his supporters to accept the result of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''.&lt;ref name="Harvard-politics"/&gt; Similarly, [[Rob Boston]], writing for ''[[The Humanist]]'' saw a rise in conspiracy theories across American public life, including [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|Birtherism]], [[climate change denial]]ism, and [[Creation–evolution controversy|rejecting evolution]], which he identified as a result of post-truth politics, noting that the existence of extensive and widely available evidence against these conspiracy theories had not slowed their growth.&lt;ref name="Humanist"/&gt;

In 2016, the "post-truth" label was especially widely used to describe the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign of Donald Trump]], including by Professor [[Daniel W. Drezner]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt; [[Jonathan Freedland]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician|title=Post-truth politicians such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are no joke |author=Jonathan Freedland|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Cillizza]] in ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref name="Indy"/&gt; Jeet Heer in ''[[The New Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Heer | first = Jeet | date = 1 December 2015 | title = Donald Trump Is Not a Liar; He's something worse: a bullshit artist | magazine = The New Republic | url = https://newrepublic.com/article/124803/donald-trump-not-liar | accessdate = 22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Kirchick]] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kirchick-brexit-trump-20160629-snap-story.html|title=What Trump and the Brexiteers have in common |author=James Kerchick|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by several professors of government and history at Harvard.&lt;ref name="Harvard-politics"/&gt; In 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''The Washington Post'', and others, have pointed out lies or falsehoods in Trump's statements after the election.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170623"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leonhardt |first1=David |last2=Thompson |first2=Stuart A. |title=Trump’s Lies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=23 June 2017 |accessdate=24  June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170427"&gt;{{cite news |last=Qui |first=Linda |title=Fact-Checking President Trump Through His First 100 Days |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/us/politics/fact-checking-president-trump-through-his-first-100-days.html |date=27 April 2017 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=25 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP-20170501"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kessler |first1=Glenn |last2=Lee |first2=Michelle Ye Hee |title=Fact Checker Analysis - President Trump’s first 100 days: The fact check tally |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/05/01/president-trumps-first-100-days-the-fact-check-tally/ |date=1 May 2017 |work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=25 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CT-20170624"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Drinkard |first1=Jim |last2=Woodward |first2=Calvin |title=Fact check: Trump's missions unaccomplished despite his claims |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/factcheck/ct-fact-check-trump-missions-20170624-story.html |date=24 June 2017 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=25 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former president Barack Obama stated that the new media ecosystem "means everything is true and nothing is true".&lt;ref name="NYM-20161128"&gt;{{cite web |last=Remnick |first=David |title=Obama Reckons With A Trump Presidency |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/obama-reckons-with-a-trump-presidency |date=28 November 2016 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental politics===
Although the [[scientific opinion on climate change|consensus among scientists]] is that [[global warming|human activities contribute to global warming]], several political parties around the world have made [[climate change denial]] a basis of their policies. These parties have been accused of using post-truth techniques to attack environmental measures meant to combat climate changes to benefit industry donors.&lt;ref name="WasteManagement"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=687980493190405;res=IELENG|last=Connor|first=John|title=Climate change and post-truth politics|journal=Waste Management and Environment|volume=22|issue=10|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the most recent 2016 election, the United States has seen numerous climate change deniers rise to power, such as new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] head [[Scott Pruitt]] replacing Barack Obama's appointee [[Gina McCarthy]]. In Australia, the repeal of [[Carbon pricing in Australia|carbon pricing]] by the [[Abbott ministry|government]] of [[Tony Abbott]] was described as "the nadir of post-truth politics" by ''[[The Age]]''.&lt;ref name="Age-abbott"/&gt;

{{undue|date=March 2018|section|reason=What makes this professor's theory notable and no other?}}
Both technology companies and governments have started to make efforts to tackle the challenge of "post-truth politics". In an article for the journal ''[[Global Policy]]'', professor [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] suggested four particular responses:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/07/06/2017/post-truth-politics-fifth-estate-and-securitization-fake-news Nayef Al-Rodhan, "Post-Truth Politics, the Fifth Estate and the Securitization of Fake News]'', Global Policy Journal, 7th June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Improve the technological tools for fact checking.'' For example, Germany has already asked [[Facebook]] to introduce a [[fake news]] filtering tool.

[[Image:Posterization example.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of a photograph in [[JPEG]] format (24-bit color or 16.7 million colors) before posterization, contrasting the result of saving to [[GIF]] format (256 colors). Posterization occurs across the image, but is most obvious in areas of subtle variation in tone.]]
[[Image:Lucidity I.jpg|thumb|300px|Posterized photo of a [[hibiscus]].]]

'''Posterization''' or '''posterisation''' of an image entails conversion of a continuous gradation of tone to several regions of fewer tones, with abrupt changes from one tone to another.  This was originally done with photographic processes to create [[poster]]s.  It can now be done photographically or with digital image processing, and may be deliberate or an unintended artifact of [[color quantization]].

==Cause==
The effect may be created deliberately, or happen accidentally.  For artistic effect, most [[image editing]] programs provide a posterization feature, or photographic processes may be used. 

Unwanted posterization, also known as [[color banding|banding]], may occur when the [[color depth]], sometimes called bit depth, is insufficient to accurately sample a continuous gradation of color tone. As a result, a continuous gradient appears as a series of discrete steps or bands of color — hence the name. When discussing [[fixed pixel display]]s, such as LCD and plasma televisions, this effect is referred to as false contouring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/4520-7874_1-5107912-7.html#falsecontouring |title=HDTV World Glossary |accessdate=2007-06-06 |year=2007 |publisher=CNET Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Compression artifact|compression]] in image formats such as [[JPEG]] can also result in posterization when a smooth gradient of colour or luminosity is compressed into discrete quantized blocks with stepped gradients. The result may be compounded further by an [[optical illusion]], called the [[Mach bands|Mach band illusion]], in which each band appears to have an intensity gradient in the direction opposing the overall gradient. This problem may be resolved, in part, with [[Dither#Digital photography and image processing|dithering]].

== Photographic process ==
Posterization is a process in photograph development which converts normal photographs into an image consisting of distinct, but flat, areas of different tones or colors. A posterized image often has the same general appearance, but portions of the original image that presented gradual transitions are replaced by abrupt changes in shading and gradation from one area of tone to another. Printing posterization from black and white requires density separations, which one then prints on the same piece of paper to create the whole image. Separations may be made by density or color, using different exposures. Density Separations may be created by printing three prints of the same picture, each at a different exposure time that will be combined for the final image.

== Applications ==
Typically, posterization is used for tracing [[contour lines]] and [[raster to vector|vectorizing photo-realistic images]]. This tracing process starts with 1 bit per channel and advances to 4 bits per channel. As the bits per channel increases, the number of levels of lightness a color can display increases.

A visual artist, faced with [[line art]] that has been damaged through JPEG compression, may consider posterizing the image as a first step to remove artifacts on the edges of the image.

==Posterizing time {{anchor|Temporal posterization}} ==
Temporal posterization is the [[visual effect]] of reducing the [[frame rate|number of frames]] of [[video]], while not reducing the speed at which it actually plays.  This compares to regular posterization, where the number of individual color variations is reduced, while the overall range of colors is not.  The motion effect is similar to the effect of a flashing strobe light, but without the contrast of bright and dark.  Unlike a [[Telecine|pulldown]], the unused frames are simply discarded, and it is intended to be apparent (longer than the [[persistence of vision]] that [[video]] and [[motion picture]]s normally depend on). An [[animated GIF]] often looks posterized because of its normally-low frame rate.

More formally, this is [[downsampling]] in the time dimension, as it is reducing the resolution (precision of the ''input''), not the bit rate (precision of the ''output,'' as in posterization).

The resulting stop-go motion is a temporal form of [[jaggies]]; formally, a form of [[aliasing]]. This effect may be the intention, but to reduce the frame rate without introducing this effect, one may use [[temporal anti-aliasing]], which yields [[motion blur]].

Compare with [[Slow motion#Time stretching|time stretching]], which ''adds'' frames.

'''''Protologism''''' is a term invented in the early 2000s{{refn|For the earliest date of the use of the word ''protologism'', {{harvtxt|Maxwell|2014}} and {{harvtxt|Miller|2014|p=x}} indicate 2005; {{harvtxt|Eismann|2015|p=1756}} and {{harvtxt|Epstein|2011|p=19}} indicate 2003.}} by [[Mikhail Epstein]], an American [[literary theorist]], to refer to a new [[word]] which has not gained wide acceptance in the language.{{refn|name=Humez}}{{refn|name=Moore}}

==Overview==
The word ''protologism'' describes one stage in the development of [[neologism]]s, at which a word is proposed, extremely new, or not established outside a very limited group of people.{{refn|name=Gryniuk}}{{refn|name=Aitken}} A protologism is coined to fill a gap in the language, with the hope of it becoming an accepted word.{{refn|name=Eismann}}{{refn|name=Maxwell}} The term ''protologism'' is [[autological]]; it is an example of the thing it describes.{{refn|{{harvtxt|Maxwell|2014}} writes, "In other words, the term ''protologism'' is a protologism. This phenomenon, where a word itself possesses the property it refers to, is technically described as being ''autological''". {{harvtxt|Aitken|2013|p=316}}, {{harvtxt|Humez|Humez|Flynn|2010|p=36}}, and {{harvtxt|Moore|2011}}, on the other hand, each describe ''protologism'' as a [[neologism]].}} Epstein coined the term by combining the Greek words ''{{lang|grc|[[Wiktionary:protos|protos]]}}'' and ''{{lang|grc|[[logos]]}}'':

{{quote|I suggest calling such brand new words 'protologisms' (from Greek ''protos'', meaning 'first, original' and Greek ''logos'', meaning 'word'; cf. ''prototype'', ''protoplasm''). The protologism is a freshly minted word not yet widely accepted. It is a verbal prototype, which may eventually be adopted for public service or remain a whim of linguo-poetic imagination.{{sfnp|Epstein|2012|p=101}}}}

According to Epstein, every word in use started out as a protologism, subsequently became a neologism, and then gradually grew to be part of the language.{{sfnp|Epstein|2012|p=101}} There is no fixed rule determining when a protologism becomes a stable neologism.{{sfnp|Solnyshkina|2009|p=186}} According to Kerry Maxwell, author of ''Brave New Words'':

{{quote|[A] protologism is unlikely to make the leap to neologism status unless society connects with the word or identifies a genuine need for it [...] there's no guarantee that simple exposure to these creations will be effective in getting them used, as discovered by British inventor Sir James Dyson when he fruitlessly attempted to promote a verb ''dyson'' (by analogy with ''hoover'') in the early 2000s.{{sfnp|Maxwell|2014}}

{{reflist|30em|refs=

{{Refn |name=Aitken |"Most of [Lewis] Carroll's words were not adopted into the language, but nonetheless, such literary invention will be familiar to anyone reading academic writers, where terms are created for conveying particular innovative concepts. Linguists even have a word for such terms, ''protologisms'' (itself a modern neologism), a word that is new and not yet established beyond a small group" {{harv|Aitken|2013|p=316}}.}}

{{Refn |name=Eismann |"Ėpštejn's projective dictionary should be a collection of protologisms, a protologism being a new word, coined to designate a new phenomenon or to fill in blank spaces and semantic voids in the lexical-conceptual system, as he proclaimed in 2003" {{harv|Eismann|2015|p=1756}}.}}

{{Refn |name=Gryniuk |"This process [of lexicalization] does not seem to be coincidental because neologisms themselves are prone to go through certain stages of transformation.

{{Refn |name=Moore |"Recognising the preliminary (or even want-to-be) nature of many neologisms, Mikhail N.

{{broader|Pseudo-scholarship}}
'''Pseudohistory''' is a form of [[pseudoscholarship]] that attempts to distort or misrepresent the [[Recorded history|historical record]], often using methods resembling those used in legitimate [[History|historical research]]. Pseudohistory frequently presents a [[big lie]] or sensational claims about historical facts which require the [[Historical revisionism|revision]] (re-writing) of the historical record. The related term '''cryptohistory''' applied to a pseudohistory based upon or derived from the superstitions inherent to [[occultism]]. Pseudohistory is related to [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudoarchaeology]] and usage of the terms may occasionally overlap.

==Definition and etymology==
The term ''pseudohistory'' was coined in the early nineteenth century, which makes the word older than the related terms ''[[wikt:pseudo-scholarship|pseudo-scholarship]]'' and ''[[wikt:pseudo-science|pseudoscience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
Monthly magazine and British register, Volume 55 (February 1823), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q00oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA449&amp;dq=pseudohistory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Sh9ETLGJOJKTjAfV0PQV&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudo-history&amp;f=false p. 449],  in reference to John Galt, ''Ringan Gilhaize:  Or, The Covenanters'', Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1823.[https://books.google.com/books?id=7VYJAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In an attestation from 1815, it is used to refer to the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', a purportedly historical narrative describing an entirely fictional contest between the Greek poets [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;C.

Writers [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] define pseudohistory as "the rewriting of the past for present personal or political purposes".&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael|last2=Grobman|first2=Alex|title=Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uACijKy-cbgC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Holocaust+denial+pseudohistory#v=onepage&amp;q=Holocaust%20denial%20pseudohistory&amp;f=false|location=Oakland, California|publisher=University of California Press|date=2009|isbn=978-0-520-26098-6|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Other writers take a broader definition; Douglas Allchin, a historian of science, contends that when the history of scientific discovery is presented in a simplified way, with drama exaggerated and scientists romanticized, this creates wrong stereotypes about how science works, and in fact constitutes pseudohistory, despite being based on real facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allchin|first=D.|date=2004|url=http://www.tc.umn.edu/~allch001/papers/pseudo.pdf|title=Pseudohistory and pseudoscience|volume=1|journal=Science &amp; Education|issue=13|pages=179–95|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Robert Todd Carroll]] has developed a list of criteria to identify pseudo-historic works. He states that:
"Pseudohistory is purported history which:
* Treats myths, legends, sagas and similar literature as literal truth
* Is neither critical nor skeptical in its reading of ancient historians, taking their claims at face value and ignoring empirical or logical evidence contrary to the claims of the ancients
* Is on a mission, not a quest, seeking to support some contemporary political or religious agenda rather than find out the truth about the past
* Often denies that there is such a thing as historical truth, clinging to the extreme skeptical notion that only what is absolutely certain can be called 'true' and nothing is absolutely certain, so nothing is true
* Often maintains that history is nothing but mythmaking and that different histories are not to be compared on such traditional academic standards as accuracy, empirical probability, logical consistency, relevancy, completeness, fairness, honesty, etc., but on moral or political grounds
* Is selective in its use of ancient documents, citing favorably those that fit with its agenda, and ignoring or interpreting away those documents which don't fit
* Considers the possibility of something being true as sufficient to believe it is true if it fits with one's agenda
* Often maintains that there is a conspiracy to suppress its claims because of racism, atheism or ethnocentrism, or because of opposition to its political or religious agenda"&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd. [http://www.skepdic.com/pseudohs.html ''The skeptic's dictionary'']. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons (2003), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] prefers the term "cryptohistory." He identifies two necessary elements as "A complete ignorance of the primary sources" and the repetition of "inaccuracies and wild claims".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224,225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'', p. 225 (Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2005 edition). {{ISBN|978-1-86064-973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common characteristics of pseudohistory are:
* The arbitrary linking of disparate events so as to form – in the theorist's opinion – a pattern.  This is typically then developed into a [[conspiracy theory]] postulating a hidden agent responsible for creating and maintaining the pattern. For example, the pseudohistorical ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' links the [[Knights Templar]], the medieval [[Holy Grail|Grail Romances]], the [[Merovingian]] Frankish dynasty and the artist [[Nicolas Poussin]] in an attempt to identify lineal descendants of Jesus.
* Hypothesising the consequences of unlikely events that "could" have happened, thereby assuming tacitly that they did.
* [[Sensationalism]], or [[shock value]]

==Categories and examples==
{{Further|Historical negationism|Pseudoarchaeology}}
The following are some common categories of pseudohistorical theory, with examples.  Note that not all theories in a listed category are necessarily pseudohistorical; they are rather categories which seem to attract pseudohistorians. 

===Ancient aliens, ancient technologies, and lost lands===
{{main|Ancient astronauts}}
[[File:ZECHARIA SITCHIN.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zechariah Sitchin]], an influential proponent of the [[ancient astronauts hypothesis]], posing with an enlarged photograph of a purported 6000-year-old [[cylinder seal]] impression]]
[[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s books ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'' (1950), ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952), and ''Earth in Upheaval'' (1955), which became "instant bestsellers",&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt; demonstrated that pseudohistory based on ancient mythology held potential for tremendous financial success&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt; and became models of success for future works in the genre.&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt;

In 1968, [[Erich von Däniken]] published ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', which claims that ancient visitors from outer space constructed the pyramids and other monuments. He has since published other books in which he makes similar claims. These claims have all been categorized as pseudohistory.&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt;{{rp|201}} Similarly, [[Zechariah Sitchin]] has published numerous books claiming that a race of extraterrestrial beings from the [[Nibiru cataclysm#Origins|Planet Nibiru]] known as the [[Anunnaki]] visited earth in ancient times in search of gold and genetically engineered humans to serve as their slaves. He claims that memories of these occurrences are recorded in [[Sumerian mythology]], as well as other mythologies all across the globe. These speculations have likewise been categorized as pseudohistory.&lt;ref name=heiser&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of a Sumerian 12th Planet|url=http://www.michaelsheiser.com/nibiru.pdf|author=Michael S. Heiser|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skepdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/sitchin.html|title=Zecharia Sitchin and ''The Earth Chronicles''|last=Carroll|first=Robert T|date=1994–2009|work=The Skeptic's Dictionary|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient astronaut hypothesis was further popularized in the United States by the [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] television series ''[[Ancient Aliens]]''.&lt;ref name="Fritze2009"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hsp/summary/v010/10.5.fritze.html|last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|title=On the Perils and Pleasures of Confronting Pseudohistory|work=Historically Speaking|volume=10|number=5|date=November 2009|pages=2–5|issn=1941-4188}}&lt;/ref&gt; History professor [[Ronald H. Fritze]] observed that the pseudohistorical claims promoted by von Däniken and the ''Ancient Aliens'' program have a periodic popularity in the US:&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rorotoko/&gt; "In a pop culture with a short memory and a voracious appetite, aliens and pyramids and lost civilizations are recycled like fashions."&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt;{{rp|201}}&lt;ref name=Rorotoko&gt;{{cite web|last=Fritze|first=Ronald|title=Ronald H.

The author [[Graham Hancock]] has sold over four million copies of books promoting the pseudohistorical thesis that all the major monuments of the ancient world, including [[Stonehenge]], the [[Egyptian pyramids]], and the [[moai]] of [[Easter Island]], were built by a single ancient supercivilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheiko|first=Konstantin|date=2012|title=Nationalist Imaginings of the Russian Past: Anatolii Fomenko and the Rise of Alternative History in Post-Communist Russia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=74s0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Graham+Hancock+Pseudohistory#v=onepage&amp;q=Graham%20Hancock%20Pseudohistory&amp;f=false|series=Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society|location=Stuttgart, Germany|publisher=Ibidem-Verlag|volume=86|page=83|ref=harv|isbn=9783838259154}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Hancock claims thrived from 15,000 to 10,000 BC and possessed technological and scientific knowledge equal to or surpassing that of modern civilization.&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt; He first advanced the full form of this argument in his 1995 bestseller ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'',&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt; which won popular acclaim, but scholarly disdain.&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt; [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] has published numerous books, including ''[[Uriel's Machine]]'' (2000), expounding pseudohistorical assertions that ancient civilizations possessed technology far more advanced than the technology of today.&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, Nick, editor, ''Public Archaeology'', Routledge, 2004 p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tonkin, S., 2003, [http://www.astunit.com/astrocrud/uriel.htm Uriel's Machine – a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The comforts of unreason: the importance and relevance of alternative archaeology|editor-last=Merriman|editor-first=Nick|title=Public Archaeology|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|date=2004|page=260|isbn=9780415258890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tonkin|first=Stephen|date=2003|url=http://astunit.com/astrocrud.php?topic=uriel|title=Uriel's Machine – a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions|work=The Astronomical Unit|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that a lost continent known as [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] once existed in the Pacific Ocean has likewise been categorized as pseudohistory.&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

===Antisemitic pseudohistory===
[[File:1934 Protocols Patriotic Pub.jpg|thumb|American edition of the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' from 1934]]
{{see also|Blood libel}}
''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'' is a fraudulent work purporting to show a historical conspiracy for world domination by Jews.&lt;ref name="ushmm.org"&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10007058 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'' "Protocols of the Elders of Zion", last updated 4 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; The work was conclusively proven to be a forgery in August 1921, when ''[[The Times]]'' revealed that extensive portions of the document were directly plagiarized from [[Maurice Joly]]'s 1864 satirical dialogue ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Philip Graves| title = The truth about "The Protocols"| journal = The Times |date=August 16–18, 1921| location = London| url = https://archive.org/details/truthaboutthepro00londiala}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Hermann Goedsche]]'s 1868 anti-Semitic novel ''Biarritz''.&lt;ref name = "translated97"&gt;{{Citation | last = Segel | first = Binjamin W | title = A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion | editor-link = Richard S.

The [[Khazar theory]] is an academic [[fringe theory]] which postulates that the bulk of European Jewry are of [[Central Asia]]n (Turkic) origin. In spite of [[genetic studies on Jews|mainstream academic consensus]], this theory has been promoted in [[Anti-Semitic]] and [[Anti-Zionist]] circles alike, arguing that Jews are an alien element both in Europe and in Palestine.

[[Holocaust denial]] and [[genocide denial]] in general are widely categorized as pseudohistory.&lt;ref name="Shermer"/&gt;{{rp|237}}&lt;ref name="Lipstadt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipstadt|first=Deborah E.|date=1994|title=Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Plume|page=215|isbn=0-452-27274-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major proponents of Holocaust denial include [[David Irving]] and others, who argue that the [[Holocaust]], [[Holodomor]], [[Armenian genocide]], and other genocides did not occur, or were exaggerated greatly.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt"/&gt;

===Alternative chronologies===
An alternative [[chronology]] is a revised sequences of events, which deviates from the standard timeline of world history accepted by mainstream scholars. An example of an "alterative chronology" is [[Anatoly Fomenko]]'s [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]], which claims that recorded history actually began around the year 1000 AD and all events which allegedly occurred prior to that point either never really happened at all, or are simply inaccurate retellings of events that happened later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novikov|first=S. P.|title=Pseudohistory and pseudomathematics: fantasy in our life|journal=Russian Mathematical Surveys|year=2000|volume=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, slightly less extreme example, is the [[New Chronology (Rohl)|New Chronology]] of [[David Rohl]], which claims that the accepted timelines for ancient Egyptian and Israelite history are wrong.&lt;ref&gt;"In his book ''A Test of Time'' (1995), Rohl argues that the conventionally accepted dates for strata such as the Middle and Late Bronze Ages in Palestine are wrong" – in Daniel Jacobs, Shirley Eber, Francesca Silvani, ''Israel and The Palestinian Territories: The Rough Guide'', p. 424 (Rough Guides Ltd., 2nd revised edition, 1998). {{ISBN|978-1-85828-248-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical falsification===
[[File:Vortigern-Dragons.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'', a scene from which is shown in this fifteenth-century illumination, was a popular work of pseudohistory during the [[Middle Ages]].]]

In the eighth century, a forged document known as [[Donation of Constantine]], which supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the [[Pope]], became widely circulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cjr.org/feature/before_jon_stewart.php|title=Before Jon Stewart|newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twelfth century, [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] published the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'', a pseudohistorical work purporting to describe the ancient history and origins of the British people. The book synthesises earlier Celtic mythical traditions to inflate the deeds of the mythical [[King Arthur]]. The contemporary historian [[William of Newburgh]] wrote around 1190 that "it is quite clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, or indeed about his predecessors from [[Vortigern]] onwards, was made up, partly by himself and partly by others".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of the Kings of Britain|last=Thorpe|first=Lewis|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical revisionism===
The [[Shakespeare authorship question]] is a [[fringe theory]] which claims that the works attributed to [[William Shakespeare]] were actually written by someone other than William Shakespeare of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;Hope, Warren and Kim Holston. ''The Shakespeare Controversy'' (2009) 2nd ed., 3: "In short, this is a history written in opposition to the current prevailing view".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Lois. "Marlowe onstage" in ''Constructing Christopher Marlowe'', James Alan Downie and J. T. Parnell, eds. (2000, 2001), paperback ed., 88–101; 100: "The possibility that Shakespeare may not really be Shakespeare, comic in the context of literary history and pseudo-history, is understandable in this world of double-agents . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaronovitch, David. "The anti-Stratfordians" in ''Voodoo Histories'' (2010), 226–229: "There is, however, a psychological or anthropological question to be answered about our consumption of pseudo-history and pseudoscience. I have now plowed through enough of these books to be able to state that, as a genre, they are badly written and, in their anxiety to establish their dubious neo-scholarly credentials, incredibly tedious. . . . Why do we read bad history books that have the added lack of distinction of not being in any way true or useful . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathman, David. [http://shakespeareauthorship.com/harpers.html Shakespeare Authorship Page]: "... Shakespeare scholars regard Oxfordianism as pseudo-scholarship which arbitrarily discards the methods used by real historians. ... In order to support their beliefs, Oxfordians resort to a number of tactics which will be familiar to observers of other forms of pseudo-history and pseudo-science."&lt;/ref&gt; A similar revisionist fringe theory is the [[Christ myth theory]], which claims that [[Jesus]] of Nazareth never existed as a historical figure and that his existence was invented by early Christians. This argument currently finds very little support among scholars and historians of all faiths and has been described as pseudohistorical.&lt;ref name=Ehrman285&gt;In a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, [[Bart Ehrman]] (a secular agnostic) wrote: "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees" B.

A large number of nationalist pseudohistorical theories deal with the legendary [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of ancient Israel.

The "[[ancient Macedonians|Ancient Macedonia]] continuity theory" is another pseudohistorical theory, which postulates demographic, cultural and linguistic continuity between Macedonians of antiquity and the main ethnic group in the present-day [[Republic of Macedonia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Racist pseudohistory===
[[Josiah Priest]] and other nineteenth-century American writers wrote pseudohistorical narratives that portrayed [[African Americans]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in an extremely negative light.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Stephen|title=Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priest's first book was ''The Wonders of Nature and Providence, Displayed.''

===Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories===
{{main|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact}}
Most theories of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, excluding the [[Norse colonization of the Americas]], and other reputable scholarship, have been classified as pseudohistory, including claims that the Americas were actually discovered by Arabs or Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/article/23662|title=Did Muslims Visit America Before Columbus?|author=|date=|website=hnn.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gavin Menzies]]'s book ''[[1421: The Year China Discovered the World]]'', which argues for the idea that Chinese sailors discovered America, has also been categorized as a work of pseudohistory.&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

===Psychohistory===
{{main|Psychohistory}}
Psychohistory was the ill-fated attempt to merge psychology with history, replacing historical method. Its most notable proponent is [[Lloyd deMause]], the founder of ''The Journal of Psychohistory''. Mainstream historians have categorized it as pseudohistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzun|first1=Jacques|title=Clio and the Doctors: Psycho-History, Quanto-History and History|date=1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=9780226038513|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CqW82zyUoVAC&amp;dq=clio+and+the+doctors|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Lynn |editor=Kramer Lloyd S. and Maza, Sarah C.|title=A Companion to Western Historical Thought |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E2eKDjo4B_IC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=psychohistory+is+a+pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-21714-2 |pages=337–57 |chapter=Psychology, Pschoanalysis and Historical Thought -The Misfortunes of Psychohistory }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious pseudohistory===
{{see also|Bible conspiracy theory}}
''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail|The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' (1982) by [[Michael Baigent]], [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]], and [[Henry Lincoln]] is a book which purports to show that certain historical figures, such as [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], and contemporary aristocrats are the lineal descendants of [[Jesus]].

'''Santos''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈsɐ̃tus|pt|Br-Santos.ogg}}, ''Saints'') is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the [[Brazil]]ian [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], founded in 1546 by the Portuguese nobleman [[Brás Cubas]].&lt;ref name=Santos&gt;{{cite web|title=The City of Santos|url=http://www.seemannsmission.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=306&amp;Itemid=533&amp;lang=en|website=www.seemannsmission.org|publisher=Adelar Schünke and Lukas Müller|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partially located on the [[São Vicente Island (São Paulo, Brazil)|island of São Vicente]], which harbors both the city of Santos and the city of [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]], and partially on the mainland. It is the main city in the metropolitan region of [[Baixada Santista]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al.sp.gov.br/repositorio/legislacao/lei.complementar/1996/lei.complementar-815-30.07.1996.html Assembleia Legislativa do Estado de São Paulo, Lei Complementar Nº 815]&lt;/ref&gt; The population is 433,966 (2015 est.) in an area of {{convert|280.67|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ibge&gt;[http://cod.ibge.gov.br/2322H Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also home to the Coffee Museum, where world coffee prices were once negotiated. There is also a [[Soccer|association football]]  memorial, dedicated to the city's greatest players, which includes [[Pelé]], who played for the [[Santos FC|Santos Futebol Clube]]. Its beachfront garden, {{Convert|5,335|m|yd|abbr=on}} in length, figures in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the largest beachfront garden in the world.

==History==
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}
The exportation of coffee from the [[Port of Santos]] gave rise to the city and mostly accounted for the wealth of the city at the turn of the 20th century. Exportation and importation through its port have made it the modern city one finds today and turned it into the indispensable outlet for the production of the powerhouse that is São Paulo State. Adorning the landscape of the port city are the canals that are over a hundred years old. In 1899, Santos was the point of entry for the [[bubonic plague]] into Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1590/S0074-02762001000500003 |author1=de Carval ho R |author2=Serra-Freire N |author3=Linardi P |author4=de Almeida A |author5=da Costa J | title = Small rodents fleas from the bubonic plague focus located in the Serra dos Órgãos Mountain Range, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil | journal = Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 603–9 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11500756 | url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0074-02762001000500003&amp;tlng=es&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, it became the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Santos]].

In October 2006, [[light crude oil]] was discovered off the coast in the Santos basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/afx/2006/10/04/afx3066182.html | work=Forbes | title=BG finds oil in Brazil's Santos basin | date=10 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santos became a tourist city from the 1910s onwards, with the construction of the International Hotel and Parque Balneário and the construction of the beach front gardens in 1935. Until today, tourism in Santos is one of the main economic activities, mainly linked to beaches and historical heritage.

==Geography==
Santos is about 79&amp;nbsp;km (49&amp;nbsp;mi) from the metropolis [[São Paulo]], capital of the state São Paulo.

The municipality contains the [[Laje de Santos Marine State Park]], created in 1993, the first marine park to be created by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=pt|ref={{harvid|O Parque Estadual Marinho ... Instituto Laje Viva}} |title=O Parque Estadual Marinho da Laje de Santos|publisher=Instituto Laje Viva |url=http://www.lajeviva.org.br/parque/|accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is divided into two distinct geographic areas: the heavily urbanized [[São Vicente Island (São Paulo, Brazil)|island]] and the continental area, about 70% of which is [[Protected area|protected]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The areas differ radically in terms of population, economy and geography.

[[File:Panoramica Santos.jpg|thumb|right|580px|Santos]]
===Insular area===
Santos partially lies on the island of São Vicente (Saint Vincent), whose territory is divided with the neighboring municipality of São Vicente. It is a densely urbanized area of {{convert|39.4|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}} that houses almost all the inhabitants of the city. It includes a flat area - Plain Coastal extension of the State of São Paulo - which has altitudes that rarely go above twenty meters above sea level, and an area composed of isolated hills called the Mass of São Vicente, the former home and endowed an urban illegal occupation with a mix of families characterized by high and low incomes, {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} whose height does not exceed 200 meters above sea level.

The flat region of the island is almost completely devoid of native vegetation, although in the north region of the island - especially in the Alemoa, Chico de Paula and Saboó neighbourhoods - there are still remnants of mangroves. Before the occupation of the area of the island by 'chácaras' - rural residences, and subsequently by urbanization, there was a vast flooded land covered by mangroves, the native Atlantic Forest, and coastal vegetation.

On the city hills one can still find vast areas covered by the native Atlantic Forest, in spite of the existing ''chácaras'' and banana harvesting farms in the area. The 'Lagoa da Saudade' (Homesickness Lagoon), a pond located in one of the aforementioned hills, Morro Nova Cintra, was known to host a kind of [[Caiman (genus)|caiman]]. The lagoon is also a popular destination among families in the city due to its playgrounds, barbecue kiosks, picnic spots and green areas. The disordered occupation of the hills represents both an environmental as well as a geological risk: the deforestation leads to frequent landslides, mainly from January to March, the traditional rainy season in the region.

Most rivers in the island were channeled when engineer Saturnino de Brito designed the system of canals in the city. As examples, we can cite the rivers Dois Rios ("Two Rivers") and Ribeirao dos Soldados ("Soldiers Creek"), which is nowadays referred by santistas as the 'Canal 4' on Avenue Siqueira Campos.

Major water courses cut the island in the north, such as the Rio de São Jorge (St. George River), which suffers from the problems of pollution and silting due to the occupation of its banks by slums.

===Climate===
Despite the fact that it is located just outside the [[tropics]], Santos has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] with no real dry season. Tropical rainforest climates are typically found near the equator, so Santos featuring this type of climate is an exceptional situation. All months of the year averages more than 60&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall during the course of the year. Santos features warm weather throughout the year, though June in Santos is somewhat cooler (and drier) than January. The average temperature in the city during the month of June is 23&amp;nbsp;°C, while the average temperature in January is 28&amp;nbsp;°C. Precipitation in Santos is very high, amounting to {{convert|2081|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} annually.  Santos lies in one of the few isolated regions of Brazil outside of the tropical [[Amazon Basin]] that receive more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of total average precipitation annually, although nearby [[Ubatuba]], approximately {{convert|140|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the east-northeast, is considerably wetter than Santos, receiving an average of {{convert|2645|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually. The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is "[[Tropical rainforest climate|Af]]" (Tropical Rainforest Climate).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=28738&amp;cityname=Santos- Climate Summary for Santos, São Paulo]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13978">With increased interest in sea ice and its effects on the global [[climate]], efficient methods are required to monitor both its extent and exchange processes.  Satellite-mounted, [[microwave]] [[radiometers]], such [[SSMI]], [[AMSR]] and [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU]], are an ideal tool for the task because they can see through cloud cover, and they have frequent, global coverage.  A passive microwave instrument detects objects through emitted radiation since different substance have different [[emission spectra]].  To help us detect sea ice more efficiently, we need to model these emission processes.  The interaction of sea ice with [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the microwave range is still not well understood.&lt;ref name="smos_final"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills_Heygster2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills_Heygster2011"/&gt; In general is collected information limited because of the large-scale variability due to the emissivity of sea ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JC093iC03p02321/abstract;jsessionid=3477FA68667DA35CD332B2F31BBA2B35.f03t03|doi=10.1029/JC093iC03p02321|title=Principal component analysis of satellite passive microwave data over sea ice|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|date=March 15, 1988|pages=2321–2332|volume=93|bibcode = 1988JGR....93.2321R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General ==
Satellite microwave data (and visible, infrared data depending on the conditions) collected from sensors assumes that ocean surface is a binary (ice covered or ice free) and observations are used to quantify the radiative flux. During the melt seasons in spring and summer, sea ice surface temperature goes above freezing. Thus, passive microwave measurements are able to detect rising brightness temperatures, as the emissivity increases to almost that of a blackbody, and as liquid starts to form around the ice crystals, but when melting continues, slush forms and then [[melt pond]]s and the brightness temperature goes down to that of ice free water. Because the emissivity of sea ice changes over time and often in short time spans, data and algorithms used to interpret findings are crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=NASA/GISS|title=Enhanced Sea Ice Concentrations from Passive Microwave Data|author=Josefino C. Comiso|url=https://nsidc.org/data/docs/daac/nsidc0079_bootstrap_seaice/docs/Bootstrap_Algorithm_Revised07.pdf|issn=1883-1184|date=2009|journal=J. Remote Sens. Society Japan|pages=199–215|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective permittivity==

As established in the previous section, the most important quantity in radiative transfer calculations of sea ice is the [[relative permittivity]].  Sea ice is a complex composite composed of pure ice and included pockets of air and highly saline [[brine]].  The electro-magnetic properties of such a mixture will be different from, and normally somewhere in between (though not always—see, for instance, [[metamaterial]]), those of its constituents.  Since it is not just the relative composition that is important, but also the geometry, the calculation of [[effective permittivity|effective permittivities]] introduces a high level of uncertainty.

Vant et al.

have performed actual measurements of sea ice relative permittivities at frequencies between 0.1 and 4.0&amp;nbsp;GHz which they have encapsulated in the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon^* = a V_b + b
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon^*&lt;/math&gt; is the real or imaginary effective relative permittivity, ''V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the relative brine volume—see [[sea ice growth processes]]—and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants.  This empirical model shows some agreement with [[dielectric mixture model]]s based on [[Maxwell's equations]] in the [[low frequency limit]], such as this formula from Sihvola and Kong
:&lt;ref name="Sihvola_Kong1988"&gt;
{{cite journal
| author=A. H. Sihvola nd J. Kong
| journal=IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
| date=1988
| title=Effective Permittivity of Dielectric Mixtures

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\epsilon_{eff}=\epsilon_1+\frac{V_b \epsilon_1 (\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)/
(\epsilon_1+ P(\epsilon_2-\epsilon1)}{1-P V_b(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)/
\left [\epsilon_1+P (\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1) \right ]}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1&lt;/math&gt; is the relative permittivity of the background material (pure ice), &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2&lt;/math&gt; is the relative permittivity of the inclusion material (brine) and ''P'' is a depolarization factor based on the geometry of the brine inclusions.  Brine inclusions are frequently modelled as vertically oriented needles for which the depolarization factor is ''P''=0.5 in the vertical direction and ''P''=0. in the horizontal.
The two formulas, while they correlate strongly, disagree in both relative and absolute magnitudes.
&lt;ref name="Mills_Heygster2010"/&gt;

Pure ice is an almost perfect [[dielectric]] with a real permittivity of roughly 3.15 in the [[microwave]] range which is fairly independent of frequency while the imaginary component is negligible, especially in comparison with the brine which is extremely lossy.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, the permittivity of the [[brine]], which has both a large real part and a large imaginary part, is normally calculated with a complex formula based on [[Debye relaxation]] curves.&lt;ref name="Tucker_etal1992"/&gt;

== Electromagnetic properties of ice ==
[[Image:Rt diag.gif|thumb|right|upright=2|alt=Sea ice RT|Diagram illustrating radiative transfer in a discontinuous medium, such as sea ice.&lt;ref name="smos_final"/&gt;]]
When scattering is neglected, sea ice emissivity can be modelled through [[radiative transfer]].  The diagram to the right shows a ray passing through an ice sheet with several layers.  These layers represent the air above the ice, the snow layer (if applicable), ice with different electro-magnetic properties and the water below the ice.  Interfaces between the layers may be continuous (in the case of ice with varying salt content along the vertical axis, but formed in the same way and in the same time period), in which case the reflection coefficients, ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be zero, or discontinuous (in the case of the ice-snow interface), in which case reflection coefficients must be calculated—see below.  Each layer is characterized by its physical properties: temperature, ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', complex permittivity, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; and thickness, &lt;math&gt;\Delta z_i&lt;/math&gt;, and will have an upwelling component of the radiation, &lt;math&gt;T_i \uparrow&lt;/math&gt;, and a downwelling component, &lt;math&gt;T_i \downarrow&lt;/math&gt;, passing through it.  Since we assume plane-parallel geometry, all reflected rays will be at the same angle and we need only account for radiation along a single line-of-sight.

Summing the contributions from each layer generates the following [[sparse matrix|sparse]] [[system of linear equations]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
T_i \uparrow - \tau_i (1-R_i) T_{i+1} \uparrow - \tau_i R_i T_i \downarrow 
 = (1 - \tau_i) T_i 
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
T_i \downarrow - \tau_i (1-R_{i-1}) T_{i-1} \downarrow - \tau_i R_{i-1} T_i \uparrow 
 = (1 - \tau_i) T_i
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''i''th [[reflection coefficient]], calculated via the 
[[Fresnel equations]] and &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''th [[transmission coefficient]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
\tau_i = \exp \left (- \frac{\alpha_i \, \Delta z_i}{\cos \theta_i} \right )
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; is the transmission angle in the ''i''th layer, from [[Snell's law]], &lt;math&gt;\Delta z_i&lt;/math&gt; is the layer thickness and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[attenuation coefficient]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
\alpha_i = \frac{4 \pi \nu}{c} \mathrm{Imag}\, n_i
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency and ''c'' is the speed of light—see [[Beer's law]].
The most important quantity in this calculation, and also the most difficult to establish with any certainty, is the complex [[refractive index]],
''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name="Mills_Heygster2010"/&gt; Since sea ice is non-[[magnetic]], it can be calculated from relative [[permittivity]] alone:

&lt;math&gt;
n_i=\sqrt{\epsilon_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Scattering==

Emissivity calculations based strictly on radiative transfer tend to underestimate the brightness temperatures of sea ice, especially in the higher frequencies, because both included brine and air pockets within the ice will tend to [[scattering|scatter]] the radiation.
&lt;ref name="Ulaby_etal1986"&gt;

| editor=F. T. Ulaby
| editor2=R. K. Moore
| editor3=A. K. Fung
| publisher=Addison Wesley
| location=London, England}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, as ice becomes more opaque with higher frequency, radiative transfer becomes less important while scattering processes begin to dominate.
Scattering in sea ice is frequently modelled with a [[Born approximation]]

Scattering coefficients calculated at each layer must also be vertically integrated.  The Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpack (MEMLS)
&lt;ref name="Wiesmann_Maetzler1999"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
uses a six-flux radiative transfer model to integrate both the scattering coefficients and the effective permittivities with scattering coefficients calculated either empirically or with a distorted Born approximation.

Scattering processes in sea ice are relatively poorly understood and scattering models poorly validated empirically.

==Other factors==

There are many other factors not accounted for in the models described above.  Mills and Heygster,&lt;ref name="Mills_Heygster2010"/&gt; for instance, show that sea ice ridging may have a significant effect on the signal.  In such case, the ice can no longer be modelled using plane-parallel geometry.  In addition to ridging, surface scattering from smaller-scale roughness must also be considered.

Since the microstructural properties of sea ice tend to be [[anisotropic]], permittivity is ideally modelled as a [[tensor]].  This anisotropy will also affect the signal in the higher [[Stokes parameters|Stokes components]], relevant for polarimetric radiometers such as [[WINDSAT]].
Both a sloping ice surface, as in the case of ridging—see [[polarization mixing]],

'''Socialist Workers' Party''' ({{lang-fi|Sosialistinen Työväenpuolue}}, {{lang-sv|Socialistiska Arbetarepartiet}}) was a political party in [[Finland]]. The STP was founded in 1973 as split from [[Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders]] (TPSL). STP emerged from a group that did not approve of the return of TPSL to the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]].

STP had electoral alliances with [[Finnish People's Democratic League]] (SKDL), the mass front dominated by the [[Communist Party of Finland]] (SKP) but with little success. When SKP (and SKDL) split in 1985-1986 STP cooperated with [[Democratic Alternative (Finland)|Democratic Alternative]] which was founded by [[Communist Party of Finland (1997)|Communist Party of Finland (Unity)]] (SKPy).

In February 1990, STP chairman [[Pentti Waltzer]] said the party would join the new [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] if Democratic Alternative decided to merge with it,&lt;ref&gt;Marja Haapio &amp; Matti Virtanen: [http://www.hs.fi/arkisto/artikkeli/900208085 Vasemmistoliiton "torikokous" kerää monenlaisia sosialisteja] (Helsingin Sanomat 8.2.1990)&lt;/ref&gt; which later happened.

==Overview==
[[File:HHRNSGlasses1.jpg|thumb|left| Author Radhanath Swami in Mumbai, 2006]]
Readers follow Richard Slavin (born December 7, 1950) from the suburbs of Chicago to the inner sanctums of Vrindavan as he transforms from a young seeker to a renowned spiritual guide.&lt;ref name="radhanathswami.com"/&gt; The Journey Home is an intimate account of the steps to self-realization and also a penetrating glimpse into the heart of mystic traditions and the challenges that all souls must face on the road to inner harmony and a union with the Divine . Through near-death encounters, apprenticeships with advanced yogis and years of travel along the pilgrim's path, Radhanath Swami eventually reaches the inner sanctum of India's mystic culture and finds the love he has been seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report_tale-of-an-american-swami_1626248 |title=DNA: Tale of an American Swami |accessdate= |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his search for an inner essence of what life is about, Radhanath Swami interacted and learned from various spiritual teachers, such as [[Mother Teresa]], renowned yogi [[Swami Rama]], and his ''guru'' (spiritual master), founder of the Hare Krishna Movement Srila [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], to whom this memoir is dedicated.

Over the years, the book has been translated into several languages including Hindi, Chinese, German, Slovenian and Russian, besides as an audiobook in English.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''The Quickening Maze''''' is a 2009 historical fictional novel by British poet and author [[Adam Foulds]] and published by [[Jonathan Cape]]. The book received the [[Encore Award]] (2009), [[European Union Prize for Literature]] (2011) and was shortlisted for [[Man Booker Prize]] (2009) and [[Walter Scott Prize]] (2010). The book is based on the historical backdrop of a mental asylum run by Matthew Allen at [[High Beach]] in late 1830s and 1840s which had English poet [[John Clare]] admitted therein. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], another notable poet of the era, moves to High Beach to get his brother Septimus treated and Alfred, himself, has to overcome depression after the death of his close friend [[Arthur Hallam]]. The book narrates Clare's life, the asylum's effects on both poets and bases its storyline on the popular speculation of whether Clare and Tennyson had ever met.

== Plot ==
Dr Matthew Allen runs an asylum called High Beach Private Asylum for mental patients of his. John Clare, a peasant poet from Northamptonshire who is not so famous then, is admitted in the asylum for his lunatic behaviours, memory lapses and delusions. Dr Allen treats his patients differently from other mental institutes given them much freedom; especially to Clare by recognizing his talent in poetry. Alfred Tennyson's brother Septimus faces depression and he is also admitted in the asylum. Tennyson and his family move to High Beach and stay nearby the asylum. Dr Allen has an history of debts and was once imprisoned for frauds. He is now collecting funds for a new carpentry machine called "Pyroglyph" that he claims to have patented in UK. He convinces Tennyson and his family to invest in the machine. Various patients with characteristic personalities and disorders have been included. A certain George Laidlaw is show to be obsessed with the national debt and Margaret keeps believing that God is speaking to her. Charles Seymour is from an aristocratic family and he is wrongly placed in the asylum by his family to avoid his marriage with his lover who the family deems unsuitable for him. Various incidences of sexual violence between fellow inmates are noted in the asylum. Allen's teenage daughter, Hannah, craves for attention and starts fancying Tennyson. When she gets nothing out of it, she falls for Seymour. Tennyson is also brooding over the death of his friend [[Arthur Hallam]] and is shown working on a memorial to Hallam. Clare starts roaming about in the woods of [[Epping Forest]] coming in contact with local gypsies. He treasures these wanderings where he finds time for his poems, if he is not claiming to be a prize fighter or [[Lord Byron]] or [[Shakespeare]]. Tennyson loses much of his family fortunes in the wrong investments and decides to return to London determined to write about Hallam and Clare runs away from the institute and sets on his four-day walking journey back to his home finally reaching to his wife.

== History ==
John Clare was born in a poor farming family. In 1820 he had published his first poetry book which won him the epithet of "Northamptonshire Peasant Poet".&lt;ref name="NY28Jun10" /&gt; In 1836 he started having memory lapses and the next year he voluntarily got admitted in Dr Allen's asylum and stayed there until he ran away in 1841 and went on his four-day walk from Essex to [[Werrington, Peterborough|Werrington]] near Peterborough. Clare stayed with his wife for few months before being admitted to [[Northampton General Lunatic Asylum]].&lt;ref name="NY28Jun10" /&gt;

Tennyson's brother Septimus was a patient of Allen between 1837 and 1840. Tennyson and his family on various occasions stayed in the nearby houses.&lt;ref name="Batchelor2012"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tTwYMfjV7lYC&amp;pg=PA108 | title=Tennyson: To strive, to seek, to find | publisher=Random House | author=Batchelor, John | year=2012 | pages=108 | isbn=978-1-4481-3856-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennyson invested {{GBP}} 3,000 in mid-1840s in Allen's invention "Pyroglyph" and his three sisters added {{GBP}} 4,000 to the investment. Failure of the machine led to bankruptcy of Allen and great loss to the Tennyson family.&lt;ref name="Hagger2012"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAntBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT173&amp;lpg=PT173&amp;dq=john+clare+met+tennyson | title=A View of Epping Forest | publisher=John Hunt Publishing | author=Hagger, Nicholas | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-78099-588-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tennyson left High Beach and then went on to write ''[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]''.&lt;ref name="NY28Jun10" /&gt;

Allen ran an asylum for mentally challenged people and separated it into three houses; Fair Mead for men, Springfield for women and Leopard's Hill Lodge for severe patients of either gender. Visitors and patient's relatives have noted normality kept inside the asylum. He also went on to raise a fund to enable Clare to stay independently.&lt;ref name="Batchelor2012" /&gt; He died in 1845 and Tennyson got some financial help from Allen's insurance.&lt;ref name="Hagger2012" /&gt;

Historically, it is not known whether Tennyson and Clare had met each other while they both stayed together in the area in the same period.&lt;ref name="Batchelor2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagger2012" /&gt; But Clare's biographer [[Jonathan Bate]] speculates that although the two poets might not have met in the asylum, both used to take walks in the forest and also had a common friend; the son of poet [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]].&lt;ref name="Bate2011"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WZZDysAUv0C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=john+clare+met+tennyson | title=John Clare | publisher=Pan Macmillan | author=Bate, Jonathan | authorlink=Jonathan Bate | year=2011 | pages=232 | isbn=978-1-4472-0362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''The Quickening Maze'', the two poets never meet.&lt;ref name="NS14May09" /&gt;

== Reception ==
''[[The Independent]]'' in the review written by [[Simon Kövesi]], who is editor of the ''John Clare Society Journal'', summed the book to be "a heady mix of delicacy and grotesquery, intimacy and misanthropy."&lt;ref name="TI29May09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-quickening-maze-by-adam-foulds-1692331.html  |title= The Quickening Maze, by Adam Foulds |author= Kövesi, Simon |date= 29 May 2009|work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Adam Foulds notes that ''[[The Norton Anthology of English Literature]]'' that he studied in his college days dedicated only four pages to Clare but the poet's reputation increased significantly after [[Jonathan Bate]] published Clare's biography in 2003. Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', editor [[Ron Charles (critic)|Ron Charles]] notes that the book is not the biography of Clare but "its finely tuned sympathy will bring you close to the soul of an exuberant poet".&lt;ref name="WP23Jun10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/22/AR2010062204374.html |title= Book review of 'The Quickening Maze' by Alan Foulds |author=Charles, Ron |date=23 June 2010 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles also notes that the most moving parts of the book are of the episodes where Clare is wandering in the forest. The review in ''[[New Statesman]]'' appreciates Foulds for penning Clare's character that thinks in poems and also deemed Dr Allen and Tennyson's scenes together as awkward because of the historical nature of the book.&lt;ref name="NS14May09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/05/tennyson-novel-clare-allen |title=The Quickening Maze  |author=Ahmed, Fatema |date=14 May 2009 |work=[[New Statesman]] |accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist and author [[Lionel Shriver]] notes that Foulds, who won [[Costa Poetry Award]] in 2008, keeps the book poetic without losing the plot.

=== Awards ===
The book was nominated for the [[Man Booker Prize]]. It was shortlisted along with [[Hilary Mantel]]'s historic novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' about [[Thomas Cromwell]], [[A. S. Byatt]]'s novel ''[[The Children's Book]]'', Nobel laureate [[J. M.

'''''The Te of Piglet''''' is a 1992 philosophical non-fiction book written by [[Benjamin Hoff]] as a companion to his 1982 work ''[[The Tao of Pooh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/books/best-sellers-february-14-1993.html BEST SELLERS: February 14, 1993] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published by [[Dutton Penguin|Dutton Books]] and spent 21 weeks on the ''Publishers Weekly'' Bestseller List and 37 weeks on the ''New York Times'' Bestseller List.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-14-023016-1 The Te of Piglet] Publishers Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawes.com/1993/1993-06-06.pdf BEST SELLERS: June 6, 1993] Hawes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In ''The Te of Piglet'', the [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]] character of the ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' books explains the Chinese concept of ''[[De (Chinese)|Te]]'',  meaning 'power' or 'virtue'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/style/peace-is-a-bookshelf-away.html?src=pm Peace Is a Bookshelf Away] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Hoff elucidates the Taoist concept of 'Virtue — of the small'; though, he also uses it as an opportunity to elaborate on his introduction to [[Taoism]]. It is written with many embedded stories from the [[A. A. Milne]] Winnie the Pooh books, both for entertainment and because they serve as tools for explaining Taoism.

In the book Piglet is shown to possess great power — a common interpretation of the word Te, which more commonly means Virtue — not only because he is small, but also because he has a great heart or, to use a Taoist term, [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Tz'u]]. The book goes through the other characters — [[Tigger]], [[Owl (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Owl]], [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]], [[Eeyore]] and [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Pooh]] — to show the various aspects of [[Human nature|humanity]] that Taoism says get in the way of living in harmony with the [[Tao]].

==Reception==
The ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'' stated that although the first book was a "sleeper hit", the ''Te of Piglet'' "falls short as a companion to [the] Tao of Pooh".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peter. '' TE OF PIGLET FALLS SHORT AS COMPANION TO TAO OF POOH''. Palm Beach Post. November 15, 1992, p6L.&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton University's [[Cotsen Children's Library]] praised the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/cotsen/pdfs/Te-Piglet-eileen.pdf Review: ''The Te of Piglet''] Cotsen Children's Library&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote "if you like marshmallow laced with arsenic, it was worth the wait".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/benjamin-hoff/the-te-of-piglet/ THE TE OF PIGLET] ''Kirkus Reviews''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote "Hoff's tired attacks on the "Negative News Media" and on "Eeyore Amazons" who "call themselves feminists but . . . don't like femininity" weaken his presentation, but on the whole, his Taoist manifesto distills ageless personal and political wisdom, relaying an ecological message we ignore at our peril."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-93496-7 The Te of Piglet] ''Publishers Weekly''&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States encouraged [[uranium mining]] production because of the [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]], its opponent in the [[Cold War]]. Large [[uranium]] deposits were found on and near the [[Navajo Reservation]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and these were developed through the 20th century. Absent much environmental regulation prior to the founding of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1970 and passage of related laws, the mining endangered thousands of Navajo workers, as well as producing contamination that has persisted in adversely affecting air and water quality, and contaminating Navajo lands.

Private companies hired many Navajo employees to work the mines. Disregarding the known health risks of exposure to uranium, the private companies and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] failed to inform the Navajo workers about the dangers and to regulate the mining to minimize contamination. As more data was collected, they were slow to take appropriate action for the workers. Studies show that the Navajo mine workers and numerous families on the reservation have suffered high rates of lung, cancers (including [[Xeroderma pigmentosum]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/rare-disease-suddenly-arises-on-navajo-reservation/ review of documentary "Sun Kissed"&lt;/ref&gt; and other diseases, from environmental contamination. For decades, industry and the government failed to regulate or improve conditions, or inform workers of the dangers. As high rates of illness began to occur, workers were often unsuccessful in court cases seeking compensation, and the states at first did not officially recognize [[radon]] illness. In 1990 the US Congress passed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]], to settle such cases and provide needed compensation.

Despite efforts made in cleaning up uranium sites, significant problems from the legacy of uranium development persist today on the Navajo Nation and in the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Hundreds of [[abandoned mine]]s have not been cleaned up, and these present environmental and health risks in many communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-navajo19nov19,0,1645689.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Judy | last=Pasternak | title=A peril that dwelt among the Navajos | date=2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that there are 4000 mines with documented uranium production, and another 15,000 locations with uranium occurrences in 14 western states.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA, Radiation Protection, "Uranium Mining Waste,"

The [[Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act]] (1978) is a [[United States environmental law]] that amended the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] and authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to establish health and environmental standards for the stabilization, [[Environmental remediation|restoration]], and disposal of [[Radioactive waste|uranium mill waste]].&lt;ref name=EPASummary&gt;{{citation|title=Laws We Use (Summaries):1978 - Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act(42 USC 2022 et seq.) |publisher=EPA |url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/laws/laws_sum.html#umtrca |accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleanup has continued to be difficult, and EPA administers several [[Superfund]] sites located in the Navajo Nation.

==History==

The Navajo people refused to let any industry mine their land in the 1930s, when the appointed federal guardian to the Navajo Nation attempted to decide what mining should take place on their land.

But pressure for mining increased in the postwar years, when the United States believed it had to develop resources to compete with the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]]. In 1948, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) announced it would be the sole purchaser of any uranium mined in the United States, to cut off dependence on imported uranium. The AEC would not mine the uranium; it contracted with private mining companies for the product.&lt;ref name=Brugge&gt;Brugge, Doug, Timothy Benally, and Esther Yazzie-Lewis. ''The Navajo People and Uranium Mining,'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent mining boom led to the creation of thousands of mines; 92% of all western mines were located on the [[Colorado Plateau]] because of regional resources.&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;Dawson, Susan E, and Gary E Madsen. "Uranium Mine Workers, Atomic Downwinders, and the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act." In ''Half Lives &amp; Half-Truths: Confronting the Radioactive Legacies of the Cold War,'' pp. 117-143. Santa Fe: School For Advanced Research, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Navajo Nation]] encompasses portions of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]], and their reservation was a key area for uranium mining. More than 1000 mines were established by leases in the reservation.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; From 1944 to 1986, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 Navajo people worked in the uranium mines on their land.&lt;ref name="Fettus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fettus|first=Geoffry H.|title=Nuclear Fuel's Dirty Beginnings: Environmental Damage and Public Health Risks From Uranium Mining in the American West|url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/uranium-mining-report.pdf|work=National Resources Defense Council|publisher=National Resources Defense Council|accessdate=29 April 2014|author2=Matthew G. Mckinzie |date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work was scarce on and near the reservation, and many [[Navajo people|Navajo]] men traveled miles to work in the mines, sometimes taking their families with them.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

Between 1944 and 1989, 3.9 million tons of uranium ore were mined from the mountains and plains.&lt;ref name=Pasternak&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-navajo19nov19,0,5351917.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Judy | last=Pasternak | title=A peril that dwelt among the Navajos | date=November 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the [[US Public Health Service]] made a massive study of uranium miners. In 1962 it published the first report to show a statistical correlation between cancer and uranium mining.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The federal government finally regulated the standard amount of [[radon]] in mines, setting the level at .3 WL on January 1, 1969.&lt;ref name = Brugge/&gt; The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] was established on December 2, 1970. But, environmental regulation could not repair the damage already suffered. Navajo miners contracted [[lung cancer]] at much higher rates than the rest of the population, and they have suffered higher rates of other lung diseases caused by breathing in radon.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

Private companies resisted regulation through lobbying Congress and state legislatures. In 1990, the [[United States Congress]] finally passed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA), granting [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] for those affected by the [[radiation]]. The act was amended in 2000 to address criticisms and problems with the original legislation.&lt;ref name = Dawson/&gt;

The [[tribal council]] and Navajo delegates remained in control of mining decisions before the adverse [[Uranium#Human exposure|health effects]] of mining were identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasternak|first=Judy|title=Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed|year=2010|publisher=Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one fully understood the [[Health effects of radon#Cancer in miners|effect of radon exposure for miners]], as there was insufficient data before the expansion of mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brugge|first=Doug|title=The Navajo People and Uranium Mining|year=2006|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judy Pasternak's ''Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed''&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 1979, the tailings pond at United Nuclear Corporation's uranium mill in [[Church Rock, New Mexico]], breached its dam. More than 1,000 tons of [[radioactive waste|radioactive mill waste]] and 93 millions of gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution and mine effluent flowed into the [[Puerco River]], and contaminants traveled {{convert|80|mi|km}} downstream to [[Navajo County, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=Pasternak2&gt;Pasternak, ''Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed'', Free Press, 2010, p.149, {{ISBN|1416594833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flood backed up sewers, affected nearby [[aquifers]] and left stagnating, contaminated pools on the riverside.&lt;ref name=chur&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1963288 | pmid=17666688 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.103044 | volume=97 | title=The Sequoyah corporation fuels release and the Church Rock spill: unpublicized nuclear releases in American Indian communities | date=September 2007 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1595–600 | last1 = Brugge | first1 = D | last2 = Bui | first2 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=water&gt;Brendan Giusti, "Radiation Spill in Church Rock Still Haunts 30 Years Later", ''The Daily Times'' ([[Farmington, New Mexico]]), July 16, 2009, Section: Local&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sz&gt;Ferenc Morton Szasz, ''Larger Than Life: New Mexico in the Twentieth Century,'' UNM Press, 2006, pp.82-83, {{ISBN|0-8263-3883-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state contingency plan relied on English-only notification of the largely Navajo public populace affected by the spill. Local residents did not learn immediately of the toxic danger.&lt;ref name=Sequoyah/&gt; The locals were accustomed to using the riverside for recreation and herb gathering. Residents who waded in the acidic water went to the hospital complaining of burning feet and were misdiagnosed with heat stroke. Sheep and cattle died en masse.&lt;ref name=water/&gt; The Navajo Nation asked the governor of New Mexico to request disaster assistance from the US government and have the site declared a disaster area, but the governor refused.&lt;ref name=Sequoyah /&gt; This limited the amount of disaster relief the Navajo Nation received.

For nearly two years, the state and federal government trucked in water to the reservation, but ended the program in 1981. Farmers had little choice but to resume use of the river for watering livestock and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Shuey, MPH [http://www.sric.org/workbook/features/V11_1.html "The Puerco River: Where Did the Water Go?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226022609/http://www.sric.org/workbook/features/V11_1.html |date=2012-02-26 }}, ''Southwest Research and Information Center,'' 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health studies on exposure to uranium==
Concerned over the adverse health consequences which Europeans experienced from uranium mines, William Bale and John Harley conducted an independent study.  Their work led the US government to start the United States Public Health Study (USPHS) on uranium mine workers. Bale and Harley's studies focused on identifying the level of radon in mines and assessing any correlation with [[disease]], specifically lung cancer. Radon, they found, can attach to mine dust, which would be inhaled and subsequently concentrated in the lung tissue. Because of this action, workers breathed radon gas at concentrations up to 100 times higher than the amount of radon gas indicated.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The USPHS was subsequently launched in 1951, with two goals: to identify uranium mine [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] exposures, and to conduct a medical evaluation of the miners.&lt;ref name = Dawson/&gt;

===Ethical concerns===
The USPHS study raised ethical concerns. The Navajo workers were rarely notified of the possible dangers which the USPHS was studying.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; As late as 1960, the USPHS [[informed consent|medical consent]] form failed to inform miners about the possible health risks of working in the mine.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, created in 1994 to explore the treatment of the workers, said: "'Had they been better informed, they could have sought help in publicizing the fact that working conditions in the mines were extremely hazardous, which might have resulted in some mines being ventilated earlier than they were."&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The USPHS failed to abide by a centerpiece of [[Nuremberg Code]] (1947), by failing to have informed consent of the subjects of a research study.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

In 1952, the USPHS issued two reports, reporting exceptionally high concentrations of radon in these uranium mines, even higher than those found in European mines years before.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; Medically, there was little evidence found of sickness. But, the [[Incubation period|latency]] from exposure to disease, also found among the European cases, explains why there were few medical effects observed at this early stage.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; In a private meeting between the AEC and the USPHS, the AEC informed the USPHS scientists that not only could the high radon levels eventually cause cancer, but proper ventilation of the mines could avoid the problem.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; The government failed to take any action on this finding.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

===Continued effects and research===
The USPHS continued to study the uranium miners, eventually including 4,000 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and non-Indian underground uranium miners.  They added miners in 1951, 1953, 1954, 1957 and 1960.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; In 1962, the USPHS published the first account of the effects of radon exposure. It found a significant [[correlation]] between radon exposure and cancer.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; Additional studies were published in 1968, 1973, 1976, 1981, 1987, 1995 and 1997; these demonstrated linear relationships between radon exposure and lung cancer, a latency period of about 20 years between radon exposure and health effects, and noted that, while smoking [[tobacco]] caused a shorter latency period for the development of cancer, it did not fully explain the relationship between radon and cancer.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; Similar reports found instances of other diseases such as [[pneumoconiosis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), as well as diseases of the [[blood]].&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; A 2000 study of the number of cancer cases among Navajo uranium mine workers concluded that the miners were 28.6 times more likely to contract the disease than the study's control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brugge|first=Doug|title=The History of Uranium Mining and the Navajo People|pmc=3222290|work=American Journal of Public Health|author2=Rob Goble |date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many miners died from radiation-related illnesses. A 1995 report published by [[American Public Health Association]] found: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;excess mortality rates for lung cancer, pneumoconioses and other respiratory diseases, and tuberculosis for Navajo uranium miners. Increasing duration of exposure to underground uranium mining was associated with increased mortality risk for all three diseases… The most important long-term mortality risks for the Navajo uranium miners continue to be lung cancer and pneumoconioses and other nonmalignant respiratory diseases.&lt;ref name=Roscoe&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roscoe | first1 = Robert J | last2 = Deddens James | first2 = A | last3 = Salvan | first3 = Albert | last4 = Schnorr | first4 = Teressa M | year = 1995| title = Mortality Among Navajo Uranium Miners | doi = 10.2105/ajph.85.4.535 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 85| issue = | pages = 535–541 | pmc = 1615135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over the decades, Navajo miners extracted some four million tons of uranium ore, which was used by the U.S. government primarily to make nuclear weapons.  Some miners, unaware of the adverse health effects, carried contaminated rocks and tailings from local mines to build their family homes. These were found to be contaminated, with the family at risk. In 2009, those homes began to be demolished and rebuilt under a new government program, which involved temporarily relocating occupants until the homes could be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/us/27navajo.html?_r=0 |title=Uranium Contamination Haunts Navajo Country |author=Dan Frosch |date=July 26, 2009 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States government response==
Following the publication of the reports in the early 1950s, some private contractors attempted to properly ventilate their mines. The states of Colorado, New Mexico and Utah established minimum standards for radon concentrations (Dawson and Madsen 2007). But, the AEC was lax in enforcement of the rules; AEC commissioners did not establish national radon standards at the time the studies were released.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The AEC said it had no authority to regulate uranium, but it regulated [[beryllium]]. The health and activist communities have criticized the AEC for its failure to take action related to the scientific reports. The agency repressed the reports.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

Government and uranium industry personnel were privy to the information, but it was not until the 1960s that workers were informed of the environmental dangers.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The government response continued to be slow. Regulation of the uranium industry was first debated in Congress in 1966, but little progress was made. Journalists began to publish stories detailing the illnesses of uranium miners, giving them public attention.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; In 1969, Congress set the standard radon level for mines at .3 WL.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

Navajo miners began to file lawsuits to seek compensation for health damages, but often lost in court. But the publicity, presentation of harmful evidence, and victim testimony gave support to their cause.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;[[Ted Kennedy]] (D-MA) was the first senator to propose a Radiation Compensation bill, with the goal of avoiding lawsuits and compensating victims fully, though it was defeated in 1979. [[Orrin Hatch]]'s (R-UT) 1981 compensation bill was met with a similar fate, and his attempt in 1983 did not reach the [[United States Senate|Senate]] floor.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

===Progress toward legislation===
In 1989, Orrin Hatch, supported by fellow Utah Representative [[Wayne Owens]] (D-UT), sponsored the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA), which was signed into law by President [[George H.W. Bush]] on October 15, 1990.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA): "Offers an apology and monetary compensation to individuals who contracted certain cancers and other serious diseases following their exposure to radiation released during above-ground atmospheric nuclear weapons tests or, following their occupational exposure to radiation while employed in the uranium industry during the build-up to the Cold War." &lt;ref name=DOJ&gt;United States Department of Justice. Radiation Exposure Compensation Program, About the Program. November 6, 2009. http://www.justice.gov/civil/torts/const/reca/about.htm (accessed October 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]] established regulations for implementing the act, related to individuals eligible for payment, and guidelines for identification, including [[marriage licenses]], [[birth certificates]] and official documents, some of which the Navajo did not possess. In some cases, the government did not recognize individual's documentation as legitimate.&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

With additional data from the studies by the [[Public Health Service]] (PHS), in 2000 the act was amended to correct shortcomings: "The RECA Amendments of 2000 broadened the scope of eligibility for benefits to include two new occupationally exposed claimant categories (uranium mill workers and uranium ore transporters), expanding both the time periods and geographic areas covered, and adding compensable diseases, thus allowing more individuals to be eligible to qualify." &lt;ref name=GAO&gt;United States Government Accountability Office. "United States Government Accountability Office." September 7, 2007. www.gao.gov/new.items/d071037r.pdf - (accessed October 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 17, 2009, the government has paid claims of 21,810 people, denied 8,789, and paid $1,455,257,096 in reparations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/civil/omp/omi/Tre_SysClaimsToDateSum.pdf Department of Justice Civil Division, "Radiation Exposure Compensation System"], Radiation Exposure Compensation Program, 17 November 2009 (accessed November 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abandoned Mine Land program===
The ''Navajo Nation Abandoned Mine Land''(s) (NN AML) are numerous [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]-designated "AML sites" on lands of the [[Navajo people]] which were used for [[uranium mining|mining (e.g., uranium)]]. Sites include:

====History====
This specific Superfund site for the AUMs on Navajo land has been in existence since 1994. This is following many years of research on the health effects of uranium mining which eventually led to the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] in 1990. Since its acceptance as a Superfund site, many federal, tribal, and grassroots organizations have come together to assess and remediate contamination sites on the Navajo Nation. Due to the fact that there are hundreds of contaminated sites, there have been a few big successes and many communities stuck in limbo. The following is a history of this Superfund site, the organizations that have collaborated on this environmental remediation, and recent criticisms of the handling of this large and complicated problem.

The Abandoned Uranium Mines on the Navajo Nation were established as a Superfund site in 1994 in response to a Congressional hearing brought by the Navajo Nation on November 4, 1993. This hearing included the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE), and the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA). Superfund status stems from the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] of 1980 (CERCLA) which allows the United States federal government to assign funds for environmental remediation of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superfund|url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navajo Nation is located in Region 9 (Pacific Southwest) of the Superfund which serves [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], the [[Pacific Islands]], and Tribal Nations. The site's official EPA # is NNN000906087 and it is located in Congressional District 4. According to the EPA's Superfund site overview, other names for the AUMs may include "Navajo Abandoned Uranium Mines" or "Northeast Church Rock Mine." Church Rock Mine is one of the EPA's most successful clean-up sites among over 500 sites spanning the 27,000 square mile Navajo Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addressing Uranium Contamination in the Navajo Nation|url=http://epa.gov/region9/superfund/navajo-nation/index.html|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly four years after the initial Congressional hearing, the EPA announced their first helicopter survey for the AUMs in September 1997. Located in the Oljato area in Southeastern [[Utah]] near the Utah-Arizona border, this was first of several helicopter surveys that aimed to measure "naturally occurring radiation ([[gamma radiation]]) coming from abandoned uranium mining areas." The stated purpose of these surveys was to "determine if these sites pose a risk to the people in the area and if so, what measures should be taken to minimize that risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. EPA to Perform Helicopter Survey of Abandoned Uranium Mines in the Oljato Area|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/76cacdcfe20f9547882576cd007e059f/$FILE/1997%20Oljato%20Helicopter%20Survey.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over ten years later, on June 9, 2008, the EPA announced its five-year plan for the clean-up of uranium contamination on the Navajo Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/bf9a1608e7578ba388257405000499f8/$FILE/NN%205-Year%20Plan-June%2012-final.pdf|title=Health and Environmental Impacts of Uranium Contamination in the Navajo Nation Five-Year Plan|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five-year plan contained nine specific objectives for 2008-2012: assess up to 500 contaminated structures and remediate those that pose a health risk; assess up to 70 potentially contaminated water sources and assist those affected by it; assess and require cleanup of AUMs via a tiered ranking system of high priority mines; clean Church Rock Mine, the highest-priority mine; remediate groundwater of abandoned uranium milling sites; assess the Highway 160 site; assess and clean Tuba City Dump; assess and treat health conditions for populations near AUMs; and lastly to summarize the action of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) in its assistance to the Navajo Nation's cleanup efforts. Since the introduction of the five-year plan, the EPA has released a progress report (available online) each consecutive year. As of August 2011, the EPA lists its accomplishments as: screening 683 structures, sampling 250 unregulated water sources and shutting down 3 such contaminated sources, provision of public outreach and educational programs for safe water practices, instituting a 2.6 million dollar water hauling feasibility project, and providing up to 386 homes with clean drinking water through a 20 million dollar project with Indian Health Services. For 2012, the EPA has listed its next steps as replacing 6 contaminated structures, demolishing other contaminated structures, and continuing screening of these structures for referral to the EPA's Response Program. The 2011 progress report also lists Church Rock, the Oljato Mesa, and the Mariano Lake Mine as sites of current or proposed remediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/c0c617e006c655c28825791400795ae3/$FILE/Navajo%208_11%20911kb.pdf|title=Health and Environmental Impacts of Uranium Contamination in the Navajo NationEPA Progress in Implementing a 5-Year Cleanup Plan|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA's website, the AUM Superfund site is not on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL) and has no proposals to be put on this list. The NPL is the list of hazardous Superfund sites that are deemed eligible for long-term environmental remediation. The EPA suggests that although NPL listing is a possibility it is "not likely" for the abandoned uranium mines on the Navajo nation. NPL status guides the EPA in its decisions on sites to further investigate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/National_Priorities_List|title=National Priorities List|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process that has been criticized for the handling of these mines. With over 500 uranium sites and only a few sites slated for full-scale remediation plans, the prioritization process has recently been called into question by [[The New York Times]] (see Recent Press).

====Partnership agencies====
Superfund works with many agencies from both the federal government and the Navajo Nation in order to properly assess and direct funding to mining sites. These agencies include: the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency (NNEPA), the [[Indian Health Services]] (IHS), the Diné Network for Environmental Health (DiNEH), the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources (NNDWR), the Department of Energy (DOE), and US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
The NNEPA was established in 1972 and officially recognized through legislation as a separate regulatory branch of the Navajo Nation in 1995. With the official acceptance of the NNEPA also came the adoption of the Navajo Nation Environmental Policy Act. According to the NNEPA website, their mission is: "With respect to Diné values, to protect human health, land, air and water by developing, implementing and enforcing environmental laws and regulations with a commitment to public participation, sustainability, partnership, and restoration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navajonationepa.org/index.html |title=NNEPA |publisher=Navajonationepa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Diné is the word for Navajo in the traditional [[Navajo language]]) NNEPA consults with the US EPA on site assessments (the US EPA is the lead agency for the Site Assessment Project). NNEPA helps the EPA in assessing and deciding which contaminated structures should be demolished and which water sources should be deemed a human health risk. The two also collaborate to perform community outreach for the Navajo people whose lives are affected by the uranium mining.
The [[Center for Disease Control]] and the DiNEH Project are also integral players in the assessment of water quality and community outreach. The Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources, with funding from the EPA, assist Navajo residents by hauling water for residents near 4 contaminated water sources, a 2.6 million dollar project. Indian Health Services helped fund the 20 million dollar drinking water project started in 2011. This project serves 386 homes near 10 contaminated water sources. The NNEPA, IHS, NNDWR, and DiNEH project have been the main partners with the US EPA in water hauling projects.

====Community involvement and response====
Forgotten People&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgottennavajopeople.org/blog/ |title=Forgotten People &amp;#124; News, Events, and Activism concerning the former Bennett Freeze |publisher=Forgottennavajopeople.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (FP) is a grassroots organization incorporated on the Navajo Nation which represents the health and well-being of the residents of the Navajo Nation in Arizona. The full name of this organization is Forgotten People Diné Bé Iina' na' hil naa, meaning Diné Rebuilding Communities. Forgotten People began as a political organization dedicated to advocacy for the Navajo people against forced relocation plans which spanned 1974 to 2007. When forced relocation programs were ended in 2007, the organization shifted focus to a broader variety of issues with a focus in environmental remediation. In 2009, Forgotten People received the Environmental Excellence Award from the NNEPA. Forgotten People was an integral aspect of the Black Falls water project, which involved collaboration with the US EPA to provide clean drinking water and educational outreach for the Black Falls community which was affected by uranium mining. FP attributes the success of Black Falls with the evolution "from a needs-based or dependency approach to the agencies into an assumption of full responsibility for their own development." The Black Falls community was able to decide upon their own solutions for their water problems. Their efforts were coordinated by FP and funded by the US EPA. Forgotten People represents an evolving grassroots community which is moving simply from organizing to actually empowering residents to take their development into their own hands.

Forgotten People also gathers and displays pertinent public records for a variety of issues facing the Navajo on their website. For their campaigns against uranium mining, their website displays all official responses US attempts at relaxing uranium restrictions on Navajo territory. FP also preserves the response of the President of the Navajo Nation in response to proposals for uranium mining near the [[Grand Canyon]]. In 2005, the President of the Navajo Nation, [[Joe Shirley, Jr.]], signed the Diné Natural Resources Protection Act which banned uranium mining and processing on Navajo land. After signing the law, President Shirley stated, "As long as there are no answers to cancer, we shouldn't have uranium mining on the Navajo Nation. I believe the powers that be committed [[genocide]] on Navajo land by allowing uranium mining. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forgottennavajopeople.org/projects/advocacy/4%2030%2009%20Navajo%20Nation%20issues%20ban%20on%20uranium%20mining.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism and press====
Despite the EPA's claims of a "strong partnership with the Navajo Nation," recent articles have been published that call into question the equitability and efficiency of the EPA's action on the abandoned uranium mines. On March 31, 2012, The New York Times published an article entitled "Uranium Mines Dot Navajo Land, Neglected and Still Perilous"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leslie Macmillan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/us/uranium-mines-dot-navajo-land-neglected-and-still-perilous.html?pagewanted=all|title=Uranium Mines Dot Navajo Land, Neglected and Still Perilous|publisher=New York Times|date=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Leslie MacMillan. The article suggests that politics and money are influencing the prioritization of mine clean-up efforts. David Shafer, an environmental manager at the United States Department of Energy, has said that questions of whether current uranium problems are due to past mining or to the naturally occurring mineral are delaying the process of cleaning up. Similar concerns are common in environmental remediation projects for victims of industrial pollution.

While the EPA does prioritize mines that are nearest to people's homes, MacMillan highlights some remote locations where people do live and yet have been neglected by the EPA. [[Cameron, Arizona]] is one such site which has a population of nearly 1000. Rancher Larry Gordy stumbled across an abandoned uranium mine on his grazing land for his cattle near Cameron in the summer of 2010. There are still no warning signs in the town of Cameron to alert people of potential contamination.
On December 30, 2010 Scientific American published an article entitled "Abandoned Uranium Mines: An 'Overwhelming Problem' in the Navajo Nation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Francie Diep|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=abandoned-uranium-mines-a|title= Abandoned Uranium Mines: An "Overwhelming Problem" in the Navajo Nation|publisher=Scientific American|date=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Francie Diep. Diep told Gordy's story and reported that the EPA assessed his site on November 9, 2010. Diep suggested that this date was moved up due to publicity of Gordy's story; originally the EPA had promised to visit within six months of his original discovery of the uranium mine.

Similar allegations of prioritization due to negative publicity for the EPA were made of the Skyline Mine in the Oljato Mesa. Elsie Begay, a 71-year-old Navajo woman from the Oljato region was the topic of a series of articles in [[The Los Angeles Times]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-navajo19nov19,0,5351917.story |title=A peril that dwelt among the Navajos |publisher=latimes.com |date=2006-11-19 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These articles were written by Yellow Dirt: An American Story of a Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed (2010) author Judy Pasternak, whose work on these articles led to her book. One EPA representative, Jason Musante, stated this publicity "might have bumped the site up the priority list."

Over a year after Gordy stumbled across the mine in his cattle's grazing land, MacMillan reports that the site at Cameron has yet to be given a priority by the EPA. When EPA officials were asked to accompany a reporter to the Cameron site, the officials declined and instead offered to visit the newly cleaned site in Oljato. MacMillan spoke with a Navajo hotel manager near the Skyline Mine who expressed hesitation about the EPAs remediation, stating, "That's what they want you to see: something that's all nice and cleaned up." MacMillan drew attention to the fact that cows are grazing on contaminated land and people are eating these cattle. Taylor McKinnon, a director at the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], went so far as to say the site was the "worst he had seen in the Southwest." Although the locally grown beef is tested, standard tests for meat do not include checking for radioactive substances like uranium. The EPA has put an emphasis on health effects throughout its five-year plan, so the lack of any sort of attention in this matter has raised eyebrows.

In addition to the questioning of political bias in the prioritization of mining sites, there is criticism of the EPA's decision to revisit a 1989 permit proposing to mine for uranium near Church Rock. [[New Mexico]]'s [[KUNM]] radio station reported on May 9, 2012 that Uranium Resources Incorporated has expressed interest in starting production near Church Rock by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://kunm.org/post/epa-revisits-permit-what-could-be-first-new-wave-uranium-mines |title=EPA Revisits Permit for What Could Be First in New Wave of Uranium Mines |publisher=KUNM |date=2012-05-09 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition has already gained nearly 10,000 signatures against this new mining initiative.

==Navajo treatment, impact and response==
Beginning in the 1960s, uranium miners were beginning to become ill with cancer at increasing rates.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt; The state of Utah did not recognize radiation exposure at the time as a category of illness, making workers compensation unattainable for many of the sick Navajo (Dawson and Madsen 2007). Private industry's treatment of the Navajo workers was poor, according to recent standards: companies failed to educate workers on precautionary measures, did not install sufficient [[engineering]] controls, such as adequate ventilation; and did not provide sufficient safety equipment to protect workers to the known dangers related to the mines.&lt;ref name=Dawson2&gt;Dawson, Susan E. "Navajo Uranium Workers and the Effects of Occupational Illnesses: A Case Study," ''Human Organization'' Vol. 51, number 4, 1992: 389-397.&lt;/ref&gt; The Navajo were never told of the radiation effects, and did not have a word for it in their [[language]]. Many Navajo did not speak [[English language|English]] and trusted the uranium companies to have their interests in mind.&lt;ref name=Dawson2/&gt; Navajo workers and residents have felt betrayed as the results of the studies became known, as well as the long delays by companies and the US government to try to prevent the damage, and to pay compensation.&lt;ref name=Dawson2/&gt; Lung cancer became so prevalent among the Navajo people that working in uranium mines was banned on Navajo lands in 2005.&lt;ref name="Fettus"/&gt;

===Allegations of racism===
White workers also faced different conditions: Navajo workers were forced to enter the mine directly after a detonation, while it was filled with dust and smoke. However, the white workers were able to stay behind.&lt;ref name = Dawson2/&gt; Navajo miners were paid less than miners from off-reservation, well below minimum wage.{{sfn|Eichstaedt|1994|p=38}}&lt;ref name=Kuletz&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuletz|first=Valerie|title=The Tainted Desert|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1998|page=25|ref=Kuletz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until radon exposure safety standards were imposed by the [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[W. Willard Wirtz|Willard Wirtz]] over the objections of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and the uranium mining industry in June, 1967,&lt;ref name=Pasternak3&gt;{{cite book|last=Pasternak |first=Judy |year=2010 |title=Yellow Dirt: A Poisoned Land and a People Betrayed|publisher=Free Press |isbn= 1416594825 |ref=pasternak|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eichstaedt|first=Peter|title=If You Poison Us: Uranium and Native Americans|publisher=Red Crane Books|location=Santa Fe, NM|year=1994|ref=Eichstaedt|pages=71, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; mines lacked ventilation, exposing workers to [[radon]].

Widows of mine workers met to discuss their grief; they started a grassroots movement that eventually reached the Congressional floor.&lt;ref name=Brugge/&gt;

The [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people#Church Rock uranium mill spill|Church Rock uranium mill spill]] raised claims that race was a factor in the federal government's paying little attention to the disaster:

{{Quote|text=When there was a relatively minor problem at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the entire attention of the Nation was focused on this location and the Federal and State assistance brought to bear to deal with it was extraordinary. When the largest release of radioactive material in the history of the United States occurs in Navajo country, however, the attention paid to it by the Federal and State authorities is minimal at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=US Congress, House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment|title=''Mill Tailings Dam Break at Church Rock, New Mexico''|date=October 22, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|sign=[[Peter MacDonald (Navajo leader)|Peter MacDonald, Chairman of the Navajo Nation]]}}

===Enduring impact===
Many residents of the Navajo Nation have anxiety and concerns about the future because of large amounts of radioactive waste remaining. One Navajo Elder explains: "We, the elderlies, that resides around here don't know what was good and worst about the uranium. There were several deaths in this area that was affected by radiation or cancers. We need help. I lost my wife last year [to cancer] and now I am 87 years. My wife would have been 70 years old which made a lot of difference. I am lonely and can't get anywhere without her help. I was hurted and miserable."&lt;ref name=Dawson2/&gt; The number of cancer cases has continued to rise because of these conditions, as water, air and ground generally have been affected. In areas near uranium mills, residents suffer [[stomach cancer]] at rates 15 times those of the national level. In some areas, the frequency gets as high as 200 times the national average.&lt;ref name=Pasternak/&gt; Hundreds of abandoned uranium mines with exposed tailings remain unremediated in the Navajo Nation area posing a contamination hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diep|first=Francie|date=December 30, 2010|title=Abandoned Uranium Mines: An "Overwhelming Problem" in the Navajo Nation|journal=Scientific American|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=abandoned-uranium-mines-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the former uranium mills, [[water contamination]] and contamination of rocks which many residents used to build their houses, continue to be problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/us/27navajo.html "Uranium contamination at Navajo Reservation"], ''New York Times,'' 27 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 report published by [[American Public Health Association]] found: "excess mortality rates for lung cancer, pneumoconioses and other respiratory diseases, and tuberculosis for Navajo uranium miners. Increasing duration of exposure to underground uranium mining was associated with increased mortality risk for all three diseases… The most important long-term mortality risks for the Navajo uranium miners continue to be lung cancer and pneumoconioses and other nonmalignant respiratory diseases." That is to say, not stomach cancer, which the Navajo people naturally have a higher rate of experiencing than the national US average.&lt;ref name="Roscoe"/&gt;

===Clean-up efforts===
Since 1994, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), along with the [[Navajo Nation]] Environmental Protection Agency, has been mapping areas affected with radioactivity. In 2007, they compiled an [[atlas]] of the abandoned uranium mills in order to rid the area of [[nuclear waste]].&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. Addressing Uranium Contamination in Navajo Nation. October 7, 2009. http://www.epa.gov/region09/superfund/navajo-nation/index.html (accessed November 17, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the EPA implemented a five-year cleanup plan, focusing on the most pressing issues: contaminated water and structures. The EPA estimates that 30% of all Navajo people lack access to uncontaminated drinking water.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;

The EPA is targeting 500 abandoned uranium mills as another part of their five-year cleanup plan, with the goal of ridding the area of nuclear waste.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt; Its priority was identification of contaminated water sources and structures; many of the latter have been destroyed and removed. In 2011, it completed a multi-year project of removing 20,000 cubic yards of contaminated earth out of the reservation, near the Skyline Mine, to controlled storage on the plateau.&lt;ref name="Fonseca"&gt;[http://www.chron.com/news/article/Navajo-woman-helps-prompt-uranium-mine-cleanup-2155858.php Felicia Fonseca, "Navajo woman helps prompt uranium mine cleanup"], Associated Press, carried in ''Houston Chronicle'', 5 September 2011, accessed 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a $600 million settlement attempts to clean up 94 abandoned uranium mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/feds-agreement-reached-to-clean-up-abandoned-uranium-mines-on/article_9fb42856-0e34-585d-b25d-a7e5d1fec692.html |title=Feds: Agreement reached to clean up abandoned uranium mines on Navajo Nation|date=18 January 2017|work=[[Arizona Daily Sun]]|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''York Archaeological Trust for Excavation and Research Limited'''  is an educational charity, established in 1972 in the city of [[York]], [[England]]. It carries out archaeological investigations, fieldwork, excavation and research in York, Yorkshire and throughout Britain and beyond. 
Its staff include specialists in archaeological excavation, historic building analysis and recording, artefact curation, conservation and research, archaeological computing, illustration and design.

It created and runs the [[Jorvik Viking Centre]] in Coppergate Walk, York, which is noted for its [[living history]] approach.  It is on the site of the Trust's 'Viking Dig' which contributed to archaeologists' knowledge of town life in Viking Age England.{{sfn|Jones|1990|pp=258–260}} Other sites in York run by the Jorvik Group are:
* [[Barley Hall]], an excavated and reconstructed medieval house in Coffee Yard, off Stonegate
* [[DIG: an archaeological adventure]] in [[St Saviour's Church, York|St Saviour's Church, St Saviourgate]]
* [[Richard III Experience at Monk Bar]]
* [[Henry VII Experience at Micklegate Bar]]

It publishes hard copy and web based reports, popular books and information resources.

It offers opportunities to take part in archaeological investigation through its annual training excavation 'Archaeology Live', and hosts the Community Archaeologist for York.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2095">'''Šime Starčević''' (18 April 1784 – 14 May 1859) was a [[Croatia]]n priest and linguist.&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=57834 |contribution=Starčević, Šime |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Žitnik]], near [[Gospić]]. He worked as a pastor in [[Gospić]], [[Lički Novi]], [[Udbina]], and since 1814 in [[Karlobag]]. He knew Latin, French, Italian and German, and could read [[Slavic languages]]. In 1812 he published in [[Trieste]] his ''Nòva ricsôslovica iliricska vojnicskoj mladosti krajicsnoj poklonjena'' and ''Nòva ricsôslovica iliricsko-francèzka'' ("A new Illyrian-French grammar"). His French grammar was revised and translated from German, using domestic terminology for linguistic terms. His grammar of "Illyrian" was the first Croatian grammar describing the four-accentual system of the [[Štokavian|Neoštokavian]] dialect.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

==Works==
Thirty years after publishing his grammar he again become active as a writer. He published ''Homilie ili tumačenje Sv. evanđelja'' (1850), ''Ričoslovje'' in sequels in ''[[Glasnik dalmatinski]]'' (1849–1850) and polemics on grammar in ''[[Zora dalmatinska]]'' (1844-1849). He advocated the use of a single dialect as the literary language, namely the Neoštokavian [[Ikavian]], without dialectal mixing and without changes in the traditional orthographic practices.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

He has been described as a keen debater, great linguistic purist, and the most consistent representative of the Ikavian literary language and the so-called "Slavonian orthography".&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

He died in [[Karlobag]].
