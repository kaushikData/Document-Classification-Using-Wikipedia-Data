[[File:Scritta murale.JPG|thumb|ACAB graffiti in ''Barriera di Milano'', [[Turin]], Italy]]
'''A.C.A.B.''' is an anti-police [[acronym]] meaning "All Cops Are Bastards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|year=2014|editor-first1=Tom|editor-last1=Dalzell|editor-first2=Terry|editor-last2=Victor|publisher=Routledge|page=10|isbn=978-0-415-52720-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a slogan and written [[catchphrase]] in graffiti, tattoos, and other imagery to protest unethical police behavior.

==History==
Director [[Sidney Hayers]] used the phrase as the title of his 1972 crime drama ''[[All Coppers Are...]]'', and the ''Dictionary of Catchphrases'' states that while the initialism — later seen in 1977 by a Newcastle journalist written on the walls of a prison cell — may be no older than the 1970s, the full phrase may date back as far as the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studying the British Crime Film|first=Paul|last=Elliot|pages=78–79|year=2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-1-906-73374-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge1986"&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric|last=Partridge|title=A Dictionary of Catch Phrases|year=1986|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-05916-9|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[4-Skins]], a British [[Oi!]] [[Punk rock|punk band]], popularized the initialism A.C.A.B. in their 1980s song of the same name.&lt;ref name="Woodman2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gordon|last=Woodman|title=The Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law 57/2008|year=2009|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-10157-0|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:ACAB Montreal Police Car.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Service de police de la Ville de Montréal|Montreal police]] car spray-painted with "ACAB" during the [[2012 Quebec student protests]]]]
The acronym is often integrated into [[Prison tattooing|prison tattoos]] in the United Kingdom, commonly rendered as one letter per finger, alternatively sometimes seen as symbolic small dots across each knuckle.&lt;ref name="ThompsonBlack2006"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Tim|last1=Thompson|first2=Sue|last2=Black|title=Forensic Human Identification: An Introduction|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8493-3954-7|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
*Brian Stableford's 2009 ''Exotic Encounters'' states that "many years ago" during a fad for wearing ACAB shirts, a [[United Kingdom|British]] youth was arrested for incitement to riot for wearing one, and ineffectively claimed the shirt stood for "All Canadians Are Bastards".&lt;ref name="Stableford2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Brian|last=Stableford|title=Exotic Encounters: Selected Reviews|year=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=978-1-434-45760-8|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 7 January 2011, three [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] football fans in the [[Netherlands]] were fined for wearing T-shirts with the numbers 1312 printed on them, the numbers standing for "ACAB" by assigning each letter a numeric value (1=A, 2=B, 3=C).&lt;ref name="dutchnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/01/football_fans_fined_for_anti_p.php|title=Football fans fined for anti-police t-shirt|work=DutchNews |date=7 January 2011|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Germany]] both "ACAB" and "1312" have been deemed insults by state courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Local]]|date=28 April 2015|title=Constitutional Court allows 'FCK CPS' sticker|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20150428/fck-cps-high-court-agrees|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 4 July 2015, a girl in [[Alicante]], [[Spain]], was fined for wearing a T-shirt with the acronym "ACAB" printed on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yometiroalmonte.es/2015/07/04/multa-600-euros-alicante-llevar-camiseta-pone-acab/|title=Multa de 600 euros en Alicante por llevar una camiseta que pone "ACAB"|work=Yo Me Tiro Al Monte|date=4 July 2015|accessdate=17 August 2016}} {{link language|es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 22 May 2016, a 34-year-old woman in [[Madrid]], Spain, was charged under Article 37 of the Citizen Safety Law for carrying a bag displaying the acronym "ACAB" accompanied by the words "All Cats Are Beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/05/23/inenglish/1464010258_144707.html|title=All Cats Are Beautiful or All Cops Are Bastards?|first=Jaime Rubio|last=Hancock|work=[[El País]]|date=24 May 2016|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were dropped 3 days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/05/25/inenglish/1464163252_407863.html|title=Madrid police drop action against woman with All Cats Are Beautiful bag|work=[[El País]]|date=25 May 2016|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Please DO NOT alter the title to A Doll House; Wikipedia guidelines state that most-common title should be used. --&gt;
'''''A Doll's House''''' ({{lang-nb|Et dukkehjem}}; also translated as ''A Doll House'') is a three-act [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[Norway]]'s [[Henrik Ibsen]]. It premiered at the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], on 21 December 1879, having been published earlier that month.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 477).&lt;/ref&gt; The play is set in a Norwegian town circa 1879.

The play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman, who at the time [[Feminism in Norway|in Norway]] lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world. It aroused a great sensation at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/176284|title="Modernism" in Modern Drama, A Definition and an Estimate|last=Krutch|first=Joseph Wood|date=1953|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|location=Ithaca|page=9|language=en|oclc=176284}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused a “storm of outraged controversy” that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society.&lt;ref name="four-major-plays"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39674082|title=Four Major Plays|last=Walter|first=McFarlane, James|last2=Jens|first2=Arup|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192833871|oclc=39674082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the centennial of Ibsen's death, ''A Doll's House'' held the distinction of being the world's most performed play that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/news/world/22-05-2006/80777-ibsen-0/|title=Henrik Ibsen's psychodramas still grip the world 100 years after his death|work=Pravda Report|date=22 May 2006|access-date=30 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has inscribed Ibsen's autographed manuscripts of ''A Doll's House'' on the [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2001, in recognition of their historical value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/henrik-ibsen-a-dolls-house/|title=Henrik Ibsen: A Doll's House|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the play is most commonly translated as ''A Doll's House'', though some scholars use ''A Doll House''. [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] says that ''A Doll’s House'' is "the British term for what [Americans] call a 'dollhouse'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VukCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|title=Bapuage=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egil Törnqvist]] says of the alternative title: "Rather than being superior to the traditional rendering, it simply sounds more idiomatic to Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/635006762|title=Ibsen: A Doll's House|last=Törnqvist|first=Egil|date=1995|publisher=[[Capilano University Press]]|isbn=9780521478663|oclc=635006762|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Act One===

The play opens at [[Christmas]] time as Nora Helmer enters her home carrying many packages. Nora's husband Torvald is working in his study when she arrives. He playfully rebukes her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts, calling her his "little squirrel." He teases her about how the previous year she had spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand because money was scarce. This year Torvald is due a promotion at the bank where he works, so Nora feels that they can let themselves go a little. The maid announces two visitors: Mrs. Kristine Linde, an old friend of Nora's, who has come seeking employment; and Dr. Rank, a close friend of the family, who is let into the study. Kristine has had a difficult few years, ever since her husband died leaving her with no money or children. Nora says that things have not been easy for them either: Torvald became sick, and they had to travel to [[Italy]] so he could recover. Kristine explains that when her mother was ill she had to take care of her brothers, but now that they are grown she feels her life is "unspeakably empty." Nora promises to talk to Torvald about finding her a job. Kristine gently tells Nora that she is like a child. Nora is offended, so she teases the idea that she got money from "some admirer," so they could travel to Italy to improve Torvald's health.  She told Torvald that her father gave her the money, but in fact she managed to illegally borrow it without his knowledge because women couldn't do anything economical like signing checks without their husband. Over the years, she has been secretly working and saving up to pay it off.

Krogstad, a lower-level employee at Torvald's bank, arrives and goes into the study. Nora is clearly uneasy when she sees him. Dr. Rank leaves the study and mentions that he feels wretched, though like everyone he wants to go on living. In contrast to his physical illness, he says that the man in the study, Krogstad, is "morally diseased."

After the meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes out of the study. Nora asks him if he can give Kristine a position at the bank and Torvald is very positive, saying that this is a fortunate moment, as a position has just become available. Torvald, Kristine, and Dr. Rank leave the house, leaving Nora alone. The nanny returns with the children and Nora plays with them for a while until Krogstad creeps into the living room and surprises her. Krogstad tells Nora that Torvald intends to fire him at the bank and asks her to intercede with Torvald to allow him to keep his job. She refuses, and Krogstad threatens to blackmail her about the loan she took out for the trip to Italy; he knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father's signature. Krogstad leaves and when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad. Torvald refuses to hear her pleas, explaining that Krogstad is a liar and a hypocrite and that he committed a terrible crime: he forged someone's name. Torvald feels physically ill in the presence of a man "poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation."

===Act Two===
Kristine arrives to help Nora repair a dress for a costume function that she and Torvald plan to attend the next day. Torvald returns from the bank, and Nora pleads with him to reinstate Krogstad, claiming she is worried Krogstad will publish libelous articles about Torvald and ruin his career. Torvald dismisses her fears and explains that, although Krogstad is a good worker and seems to have turned his life around, he must be fired because he is not deferential enough to Torvald in front of other bank personnel. Torvald then retires to his study to work.

Dr. Rank, the family friend, arrives. Nora asks him for a favor, but Rank responds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of [[tuberculosis]] of the spine and that he has always been secretly in love with her. Nora tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it but is more disturbed by his declaration of love. She tries clumsily to tell him that she is not in love with him but that she loves him dearly as a friend.

Desperate after being fired by Torvald, Krogstad arrives at the house. Nora convinces Dr. Rank to go into Torvald's study so he will not see Krogstad. When Krogstad confronts Nora, he declares that he no longer cares about the remaining balance of Nora's loan, but that he will instead preserve the associated [[Bond (finance)|bond]] to blackmail Torvald into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him. Nora explains that she has done her best to persuade her husband, but he refuses to change his mind. Krogstad informs Nora that he has written a letter detailing her crime (forging her father's signature of [[surety]] on the bond) and put it in Torvald's mailbox, which is locked.

Nora tells Kristine of her difficult situation. Having had a relationship with Krogstad in the past before her marriage, Kristine says that they are still in love and promises to try to convince him to relent.

Torvald enters and tries to retrieve his mail, but Nora distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party, feigning anxiety about performing. She dances so badly and acts so childishly that Torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her. When the others go to dinner, Nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates killing herself to save her husband from the shame of the revelation of her crime and to pre-empt any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation.

===Act Three===

Kristine tells Krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has returned to offer him her love again. She believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and been in dire financial straits. Krogstad changes his mind and offers to take back his letter to Torvald. However, Kristine decides that Torvald should know the truth for the sake of his and Nora's marriage.

After literally dragging Nora home from the party, Torvald goes to check his mail but is interrupted by Dr. Rank, who has followed them. Dr. Rank chats for a while, conveying obliquely to Nora that this is a final goodbye, as he has determined that his death is near. Dr. Rank leaves, and Torvald retrieves his letters. As he reads them, Nora steels herself to take her life. Torvald confronts her with Krogstad's letter. Enraged, he declares that he is now completely in Krogstad's power; he must yield to Krogstad's demands and keep quiet about the whole affair. He berates Nora, calling her a dishonest and immoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their children. He says that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances.

A maid enters, delivering a letter to Nora. The letter is from Krogstad, yet Torvald demands to read the letter and takes it from Nora. Torvald exults that he is saved, as Krogstad has returned the incriminating bond, which Torvald immediately burns along with Krogstad's letters. He takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her. Nora realizes that her husband is not the strong and gallant man she thought he was, and that he truly loves himself more than he does Nora.

Torvald explains that when a man has forgiven his wife, it makes him love her all the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him, like a child. He dismisses the fact that Nora had to make the agonizing choice between her conscience and his health, and ignores her years of secret efforts to free them from the ensuing obligations and the danger of loss of reputation. He preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as a mere mistake that she made owing to her foolishness, one of her most endearing feminine traits.

Nora tells Torvald that she is leaving him, and in a confrontational scene expresses her sense of betrayal and disillusionment. She says he has never loved her, they have become strangers to each other. She feels betrayed by his response to the scandal involving Krogstad, and she says she must get away to understand herself. She has lost her religion. She says that she has been treated like a doll to play with for her whole life, first by her father and then by him. Concerned for the family reputation, Torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and mother, but Nora says that she has duties to herself that are just as important, and that she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be more than a plaything. She reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so. She now realizes that Torvald is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings.

Torvald is unable to comprehend Nora's point of view, since it contradicts all that he has been taught about the female mind throughout his life. Furthermore, he is so narcissistic that it is impossible for him to understand how he appears to her, as selfish, hypocritical, and more concerned with public reputation than with actual morality. Nora leaves her keys and wedding ring, and as Torvald breaks down and begins to cry, baffled by what has happened, Nora leaves the house, slamming the door behind her. Whether or not she ever comes back is never made clear.

===Alternative ending===
Ibsen's German agent felt that the original ending would not play well in German theatres. Therefore, for it to be considered acceptable, Ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for the German premiere. In this ending, Nora is led to her children after having argued with Torvald. Seeing them, she collapses, and the curtain is brought down. Ibsen later called the ending a disgrace to the original play and referred to it as a "barbaric outrage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ibsen.nb.no/id/11111794.0|title=The alternative ending of A Doll's House|publisher=[[National Library of Norway]]|date=30 May 2005|access-date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all productions today use the original ending, as do nearly all of the film versions of the play.

==Composition and publication==

===Real-life inspiration===
''A Doll's House'' was based on the life of [[Laura Kieler]] (maiden name Laura Smith Petersen), a good friend of Ibsen. Much that happened between Nora and Torvald happened to Laura and her husband, Victor. Similar to the events in the play, Laura signed an illegal loan to save her husband. She wanted the money to find a cure for her husband's tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - 2 May 2009 - Blaming Nora"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/02/ibsen-a-dolls-house|title=Blaming Nora|last=[[A. S. Byatt]]|date=2 May 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote to Ibsen, asking for his recommendation of her work to his publisher, thinking that the sales of her book would repay her debt. At his refusal, she forged a check for the money. At this point she was found out. In real life, when Victor discovered about Laura's secret loan, he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum. Two years later, she returned to her husband and children at his urging, and she went on to become a well-known Danish author, living to the age of 83.

Ibsen wrote ''A Doll's House'' at the point when Laura Kieler had been committed to the asylum, and the fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply, perhaps also because Laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial point in the scandal, which he did not feel able or willing to do. Instead, he turned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped, successful drama. In the play, Nora leaves Torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time.

Kieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as "Ibsen's Nora" years afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/635006762|title=Ibsen: A Doll's House|last=Törnqvist|first=Egil|date=1995|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521478663|oclc=635006762|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/610205542|title=The Wadsworth anthology of drama|last=Worthen|first=William B |date=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=9781428288157|oclc=610205542|page=667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===
Ibsen started thinking about the play around May 1878, although he did not begin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period (he visualised its [[protagonist]], Nora, for instance, as having approached him one day wearing "a blue woollen dress").&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 463–467, 472).&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined his conception of the play as a "modern [[tragedy]]" in a note written in Rome on 19 October 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 466).&lt;/ref&gt; "A woman cannot be herself in modern society," he argues, since it is "an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint."&lt;ref name="Ibsen 1967"/&gt;

===Publication===
Ibsen sent a [[Foul papers|fair copy]] of the completed play to his publisher on 15 September 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 474).&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in Copenhagen on 4 December 1879, in an edition of 8,000 copies that sold out within a month; a second edition of 3,000 copies followed on 4 January 1880, and a third edition of 2,500 was issued on 8 March.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 475).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
''A Doll's House'' received its world premiere on 21 December 1879 at the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in Copenhagen, with Betty Hennings as Nora, Emil Poulsen as Torvald, and [[Peter Jerndorff]] as Dr. Rank.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 477) and Moi (2006, 227, 230).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the Norwegian newspaper ''Folkets Avis'', the critic [[Erik Bøgh]] admired Ibsen's originality and technical mastery: "Not a single declamatory phrase, no high dramatics, no drop of blood, not even a tear."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Meyer (1967, 477).&lt;/ref&gt; Every performance of its run was sold out.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1967, 480"&gt;Meyer (1967, 480).&lt;/ref&gt; Another production opened at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in [[Stockholm]], on 8 January 1880, while productions in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (with Johanne Juell as Nora and Arnoldus Reimers as Torvald) and [[Bergen]] followed shortly after.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1967, 479"&gt;Meyer (1967, 479).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the actress [[Hedwig Raabe|Hedwig Niemann-Raabe]] refused to perform the play as written, declaring, "''I'' would never leave ''my'' children!"&lt;ref name="Meyer 1967, 480"/&gt; Since the playwright's wishes were not protected by copyright, Ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being rewritten by a lesser dramatist by committing what he called a "barbaric outrage" on his play himself and giving it an alternative ending in which Nora did not leave.&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 480–481).&lt;/ref&gt; A production of this version opened in [[Flensburg]] in February 1880.&lt;ref name=m481&gt;Meyer (1967, 481).&lt;/ref&gt; This version was also played in [[Hamburg]], [[Dresden]], [[Hanover]], and [[Berlin]], although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, Niemann-Raabe eventually restored the original ending.&lt;ref name=m481/&gt; Another production of the original version, some rehearsals of which Ibsen attended, opened on 3 March 1880 at the [[Residenz Theatre]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=m481/&gt;

In Great Britain, the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given in London was in an adaptation by [[Henry Arthur Jones]] and [[Henry Herman]] called ''Breaking a Butterfly''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.32000006471181;view=1up;seq=1 text] Jones, Henry Arthur. Herman, Henry.  ''Breaking a butterfly : a play in three acts.''  Printed for private use only: not published. 76 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation was produced at the Princess Theatre, 3 March 1884. Writing in 1896 in his book ''The Foundations of a National Drama'', Jones says: "A rough translation from the German version of A Doll's House was put into my hands, and I was told that if it could be turned into a sympathetic play, a ready opening would be found for it on the London boards. I knew nothing of Ibsen, but I knew a great deal of Robertson and H. J. Byron. From these circumstances came the adaptation called ''Breaking a Butterfly''."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Henry Arthur.

Reprinted: Wentworth Press (26 Aug. 2016) {{ISBN|978-1362548942}}. Page 208.&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. L. Mencken]] writes that it was ''A Doll’s House'' “denaturized and [[dephlogisticated]]. … Toward the middle of the action Ibsen was thrown to the fishes, and Nora was saved from suicide, rebellion, flight and immortality by making a faithful old clerk steal her fateful promissory note from Krogstad’s desk. … The curtain fell upon a happy home.“&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, H. L. ''The Collected Drama of H. L. Mencken: Plays and Criticism''. Scarecrow Press, 2012. {{ISBN|9780810883703}}. page 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1899 there were two private productions of the play in London (in its original form as Ibsen wrote it)  — one featured [[George Bernard Shaw]] in the role of Krogstad.&lt;ref name="blaming-nora"/&gt; The first public British production of the play in its regular form opened on 7 June 1889 at the Novelty Theatre, starring [[Janet Achurch]] as Nora and Charles Charrington as Torvald.&lt;ref name="Archer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibsen|first=Henrik|others=[[William Archer (critic)|William C.

Soon after its London premiere, Achurch brought the play to [[Australia]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 353).&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was first seen in America in 1883 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Helena Modjeska]] acted Nora.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; The play made its [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] premiere at the Palmer's Theatre on 21 December 1889, starring [[Beatrice Cameron]] as Nora Helmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Opening Night Production Credits: A Doll's House (1889) | url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=5582 | work=The Internet Broadway Database| year=2008 | accessdate=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first performed in France in 1894.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1967, 479"/&gt;
Other productions in the United States include one in 1902 starring [[Mrs. Fiske|Minnie Maddern Fiske]], a 1937 adaptation with acting script by [[Thornton Wilder]] and starring [[Ruth Gordon]], and a 1971 production starring [[Claire Bloom]].

==Analysis and criticism==
''A Doll's House'' questions the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-century marriage.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50638821|title=Women in literature: reading through the lens of gender|last=Fisher|first= Jerilyn|editor-last=Fisher|editor-first=Jerilyn|editor2-last=Silber|editor2-first=Ellen S|date=2003|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313313462|oclc=50638821|pages=99–101|chapter=The slammed door that still reverberates}}&lt;/ref&gt; To many 19th-century Europeans, this was scandalous.

The Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]] criticised the play in his volume of essays and short stories ''[[Getting Married (Strindberg)|Getting Married]]'' (1884).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 476).&lt;/ref&gt; Strindberg questioned Nora’s walking out and leaving her children behind with a man that she herself disapproved of so much that she would not remain with him. Strindberg also considers that Nora’s involvement with an illegal financial fraud that involved Nora forging a signature, all done behind her husband’s back, and then Nora’s lying to her husband regarding Krogstad’s blackmail, are serious crimes that should raise questions at the end of the play, when Nora is moralistically judging her husband. And Strindberg points out that Nora’s complaint that she and Torvald “have never exchanged one serious word about serious things,” is contradicted by the discussions that occur in act one and two.&lt;ref&gt;Sandbach, Mary, trans. Strindberg, August, author. 1972. ''Getting Married Parts I and II.''  London: Victor Gollancz. (1972) {{ISBN|0-575-00629-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons Nora leaves her husband are complex, and various details are hinted at throughout the play.  In the last scene, she tells her husband she has been “greatly wronged” by his disparaging and condescending treatment of her, and his attitude towards her in their marriage — as though she were his “doll wife” — and the children in turn have become her “dolls,” leading her to doubt her own qualifications to raise her children. She is troubled by her husband’s behavior in regard to the scandal of the loaned money. She does not love her husband, she feels they are strangers, she feels completely confused, and suggests that her issues are shared by many women. George Bernard Shaw suggests that she left to begin “a journey in search of self-respect and apprenticeship to life,” and that her revolt is “the end of a chapter of human history.”&lt;ref name="blaming-nora"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard. “A Doll’s House Again”. ''Dramatic Opinions and Essays. Volume II.'' Brentanos (1916) p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="four-major-plays"/&gt;

Ibsen was inspired by the belief that "a woman cannot be herself in modern society," since it is "an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint."&lt;ref name="Ibsen 1967"&gt;Ibsen, "Notes for a Modern Tragedy"; quoted by Meyer (1967, 466); see also Innes (2000, 79–81).&lt;/ref&gt; Its ideas can also be seen as having a wider application: [[Michael Meyer (translator)|Michael Meyer]] argued that the play's theme is not [[women's rights]], but rather "the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1967, 478).&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech given to the [[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]] in 1898, Ibsen insisted that he "must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement," since he wrote "without any conscious thought of making [[propaganda]]," his task having been "the ''description of humanity''."&lt;ref&gt;Ibsen, "Speech at the Festival of the Norwegian Women's Rights League, Christiana", 26 May 1898; in Dukore (1974, 563); see also Moi (2006, 229–230).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the departure from traditional behavior and theatrical convention involved in Nora's leaving home, her act of slamming the door as she leaves has come to represent the play itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Script into performance: a structuralist approach |first=Richard |last=Hornby |page=157 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsNX6DTt7w8C&amp;pg=PA157 |year=1995 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=978-1-55783-237-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/635006762|title=Ibsen: A Doll's House|last=Törnqvist|first=Egil|date=1995|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521478663|oclc=635006762|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Iconoclasts'' (1905), [[James Huneker]] noted "That slammed door reverberated across the roof of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Lawrence S.|title=Culture &amp; Values, Volume II: A Survey of the Humanities with Readings|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KiW8xOi0FvYC&amp;pg=PA492|first2=John J.|last2=Reich|isbn=978-0-495-56926-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Appeal to the Great Spirit''''' is a 1909 equestrian statue by [[Cyrus Edwin Dallin|Cyrus Dallin]], at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. It was the last in his four-piece series, ''The Epic of the Indian''. A statuette of it is in the permanent collection of the [[White House]], and decorated President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Oval Office]].

==History==
Dallin, a native of [[Utah]], had a large amount of interaction with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children while growing up. This provided him with unique insights that he was to call upon while creating this, and other, works. The actual model who posed for the sculpture was Antonio Corsi, an Italian, who modeled for the great painters and sculptors of the era.&lt;ref name="craven"&gt;{{cite book| last=Craven| first=Wayne| title=Sculpture in America| publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Company| location=New York| year=1968| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3FQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=appeal+to+great+spirit| pages=530–531| accessdate=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, the sculpture was [[casting|cast]] in [[Paris]], and won a gold medal for its exhibition in the [[Paris Salon]]. On January 23, 1912, it was installed outside the main entrance to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name="bac"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.publicartboston.com/content/appeal-great-spirit| title=Appeal to the Great Spirit| publisher=[[Boston Art Commission]]| accessdate=2013-07-22}}. See also "Big Bronze Statue by Cyrus Dallin Placed at Museum", ''The Christian Science Monitor'', January 24, 1912, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A restoration of the Boston version was reversed at Dallin's request because he preferred the light green tones that had developed on the [[equestrian sculpture]] over time rather than the typical "statuary brown" [[patina]] the conservator applied prior to consulting him.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Smaller versions==
An edition of nine 40-inch bronzes of the statue was produced about 1922. One example stands as the centerpiece of the Tower Room of [[Dartmouth College]]'s Baker Tower, the college's main library and most iconic building.&lt;ref name="hood"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hoodmuseum.dartmouth.edu/collections/overview/americas/northamerica/uscanada/sculpture/S92815.html| title=Cyrus Edwin Dallin, American, 1861-1944| publisher=[[Hood Museum of Art]]| date=29 April 2009| accessdate=2013-07-22}}Dartmouth was founded as an institution to educate the Native Americans of New England, and it recalls that heritage through art such as Dallin's ''Appeal to the Great Spirit''.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a full-scale model in [[Muncie, Indiana]], in the "Y" of the intersection of Walnut and Granville streets in the [[Wysor Heights Historic District]] {{nowrap|({{coord|40.20485|-85.38602|type:landmark_region:US-IN|display=inline}})}}, and is considered by many residents to be a symbol of Muncie.&lt;ref name="muncie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Appeal to the Great Spirit |url=http://www.cityofmuncie.com/attractions/attraction.asp?aid=23 |publisher=City of Muncie |accessdate=2013-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210183554/http://www.cityofmuncie.com/attractions/attraction.asp?aid=23 |archivedate=2013-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaster example in this size is at the Cyrus Dallin Museum in Arlington, Massachusetts, and another is in the [[Rockwell Museum]] in [[Corning, New York]].&lt;ref name="rockwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockwellmuseum.org/Appeal-to-the-Great-Spirit.html |title=Appeal to the Great Spirit |publisher=Rockwell Museum of Western Art |accessdate=2013-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725040734/http://www.rockwellmuseum.org/Appeal-to-the-Great-Spirit.html |archivedate=2013-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Central High School in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] possesses another plaster example, which was used, in 1985, as the model for a bronze version. The casting was done by American Artbronze Fine Arts Foundry under the direction of Howard R. Kirsch. The heroic sized bronze is now installed in Woodward Park in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the intersection of 21st Street and Peoria.{{nowrap|({{coord|36.13276|-95.97489|type:landmark_region:US-OK|display=inline}}).}}&lt;ref name="siris"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=13ES045M10415.5973&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!332823~!4&amp;ri=2&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=dallin+tulsa&amp;index=.GW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=2#focus| title=Appeal to the Great Spirit, (sculpture)| publisher=Smithsonian Institution Research Information System(SIRIS)| year=1996| accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of the 21-inch bronze statuette are at the White House, the [[U.S. Department of State]], and many American museums.

An 8-1/2-inch miniature edition was produced by the [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]] in 1913; in 2009, No. 263 sold for $9,375.&lt;ref name="christies"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5179590| title=Cyrus Edwin Dallin (1861-1944): ''Appeal to the Great Spirit''| date=5 March 2009| publisher=[[Christie's]]| accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Image:Brother Records logo.png|thumb|Brother Records logo.]]

* The sculpture is used as the logo for [[the Beach Boys]]’ vanity record label [[Brother Records]]. It was first seen on the band's 1967 album ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' and its attending single "[[Heroes and Villains]]." When Beach Boy [[Carl Wilson]] was asked in 1975 why the group used this as their logo, he said the Indian was chosen because Brian, Dennis, and Carl's grandfather believed that there was a spiritual Indian "guide" who watched over them from the "other side." The choice of the logo was Brian's. Carl called the logo "The Last Horizon."{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* A painting of the sculpture appears on the cover of the album ''[[Lysol (album)|Lysol]]'' (1992) by rock group [[The Melvins]].
* A painting of the sculpture appears on the cover of the album ''[[The Time Is Near]]'' (1970) by rock group Keef Hartley Band.
* In the vinyl release of ''[[Directions to See a Ghost]]'' by the American rock band [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]], the poster inside features a skeleton form of this sculpture with a psychedelic background.
* A painting of the sculpture appears on the cover of the album ''Spirit of God'' (1984) by the Native American Gospel recording artist [[Johnny P. Curtis]].
* An early instance of the sculpture's place in American culture is its appearance (as photographed by Baldwin Coolidge) on the cover of "A-M-E-R-I-C-A" (1917), a World War I song by [[May Greene]] and [[Billy Lang]] and published by [[D. W. Cooper (music publisher)|D. W. Cooper]].

The '''Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism''' ('''ARAS''') is an encyclopedic collection of [[archetypes|archetypal images]] consisting of photographs of [[works of art]], [[ritual]] images, and artifacts of sacred traditions and [[contemporary art]] from around the world. The archive is hosted by National ARAS, with institutional members in [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], and [[San Francisco]].

==Overview==
The ARAS archive contains about 17,000 photographic images collected over more than sixty years, each accompanied by scholarly commentary.&lt;ref name="taschen"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/search/archive-for-research-in-archetypal-symbolism-(aras) | title=Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism (ARAS) | publisher=[[Taschen]] | accessdate=5 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commentary includes a description of the image with a cultural history that places it in context historically and geographically, an important aspect for understanding and working with archetypal images.  Where applicable, the commentary brings the image into focus for its modern psychological and [[symbol]]ic meaning, as well as often including a bibliography for related reading and a glossary of technical terms.

The archive has physical [[Disciplinary repository|repositories]] in the cities of its institutional-member hosts; it is also available online (online access does require a subscription) and images are indexed with keywords, including historical, cultural, geographic and other useful terms.{{fact|date=February 2017}} ARAS also publishes a quarterly online journal connecting art, culture and depth psychology from a multi-disciplinary perspective that can be subscribed to free of charge on their website, aras.org.

==Usage==
The ARAS archive is designed for and used by students and scholars for research, by artists and designers as a [[sourcebook]] of [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s and [[iconography|iconographic]] forms, by individuals interested in commonalities in mythology, [[dream interpretation|dream imagery]], and vision which transcend nation and [[ideology]], and by practitioners of [[depth psychology]] or other psychological perspectives wanting to enhance their knowledge of archetypal symbolism.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web| title=About ARAS | publisher=ARAS | url=http://aras.org/aboutaras.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the scholars who have visited or made use of ARAS' resources are [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]], who in his ''The Great Mother: An Analysis of the Archetype'' (Princeton, 1955) mined ARAS for images of ancient [[goddess]]es to explore the [[Mother goddess|archetype of the feminine]] as it evolved over the centuries from ancient [[Sumer]]ia and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] into the modern era.{{fact|date=February 2017}} Two volumes have been published containing a small fraction of the images held by ARAS, entitled ''An Encyclopedia of Archetypal Symbolism''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==History==
ARAS was begun—and built to over six thousand images—by spiritualist and scholar [[Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn]], who founded the [[Eranos]] conferences in 1933.&lt;ref name="artstor"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.artstor.org/collection/archive-research-archetypal-symbolism | title=Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism | publisher=[[Artstor]] | accessdate=5 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each conference had a theme, and Fröbe-Kapteyn collected images to illustrate the topic of each year's meeting. In 1946, Olga Froebe-Kapteyn gave her collection of pictorial artifacts to the [[Warburg Institute]] in [[London]], and photographic duplicates were given to the [[C.G. Jung Institute]] in Zurich and to the [[Bollingen#Bollingen Foundation|Bollingen Foundation]] in New York. The collection in New York was edited and further developed, including collection, sorting, and classification of the material and the development of detailed study sheets for every image. This New York archive was eventually renamed the Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism and was acquired by the [[C.G. Jung Foundation]] of New York (mirror collections exist at the C.G. Jung Institutes in San Francisco and Los Angeles). The close association of ARAS with the Jung Institutes is "not because a symbolic point of view is limited to [[Jungian]]s, but because Jung was the particular proponent of a broadly archetypal point of view that insists upon transpersonal and symbolic connections transcending cultural and theological boundaries. This perspective lies at the heart of the archive."&lt;ref name="Gronning 2007"&gt;{{cite article| first1=Torben | last1=Gronning | first2=Thomas | last2=Singer | first3=Patricia | last3=Sohl | title=A.R.A.S. Archetypal Symbolism and Images | journal=[[Visual Resources]] | volume=XXIII | number=3 | date=September 2007 | pages=245–267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARAS contains more than 17,000 images from every era of human history, from the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] eras, from [[History of India|ancient India]], [[Asia Minor]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Mycenae]], from small tribal societies to great empires.  The study sheets that accompany each image provide a detailed description of the image, a cultural history to place it in context, an archetypal commentary which examines the image's modern psychological meaning and offers numerous cross-cultural references to related concepts/images, a [[bibliography]] for related reading, and a [[glossary]] of technical terms.  This detailed documentation renders the library of images accessible to the [[lay person]] as well as the specialist [[scholar]], although as the ARAS homepage notes, "There is...no supposition among those working in this field that they have found the one and only way of interpreting archetypal symbolism. The symbol is forever recreating itself anew in the imaginations of those who experience it."&lt;ref name="Gronning 2007" /&gt;

==ARAS online==
While for many years the archive was accessible only by personal visit to one of the three locations, [[New York City|New York]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Los Angeles]], the digitization of the archive has made it accessible to anyone with a computer connected through a web browser to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aras.org/about|title=About ARAS {{!}} ARAS|website=aras.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARAS online is built over a powerful search engine accessible through an intuitive user interface, and aided by reference features such as the ARAS cultural [[timeline]]. This timeline shows the selected images placed in historical time, and a click on the "live" marker for a particular image opens that image and its descriptive content.

ARAS online content is available only to members. Membership costs $100 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aras.org/join|title=Join {{!}} ARAS|last=|first=|date=|website=aras.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARAS also have a presence on social media and is a [[non-profit organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Facebook|arasarchive}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bixby Letter newspaper.jpg|thumb|260px|The Bixby letter in the ''Boston Evening Transcript'']]
The '''Bixby letter''' is a brief, consoling message sent by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] in November 1864 to Lydia Parker Bixby, a widow living in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], who was thought to have lost five sons in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Along with the [[Gettysburg Address]] and his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]], the letter has been praised as one of Lincoln's finest written works and is often reproduced in memorials, media, and print.

Controversy surrounds the recipient, the fate of her sons, and the authorship of the letter. Bixby's character has been questioned (including rumored [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathies), at least two of her sons survived the war, and the letter was possibly written by Lincoln's assistant private secretary, [[John Hay]].

Executive Mansion,&lt;br/&gt;
Washington, Nov. 21, 1864.

Dear Madam,

I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.
 
I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.

I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom.

Yours, very sincerely and respectfully,&lt;br/&gt;
A. Lincoln.

Mrs. Bixby.}}

==History==
[[File:William Schouler.jpg|thumb|right|210px|William Schouler, Massachusetts Adjutant General]]
Lydia Parker married shoemaker Cromwell Bixby on September 26, 1826, in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]]. The couple had at least six sons and three daughters before Cromwell's death in 1854. Some time before the Civil War, Bixby and her family settled in Boston.{{sfn|Bixby|Putnam|1914|pp=387&amp;ndash;389}}

===Meeting with Adjutant General Schouler===
On September 24, 1864, [[Massachusetts Adjutant General]] [[William Schouler]] wrote to [[Massachusetts Governor]] [[John Albion Andrew]] about a [[Military discharge|discharge]] request sent to the governor by Otis Newhall, the father of five [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers. In the letter, Schouler recalled how, two years prior, they had helped a poor widow named Lydia Bixby to visit a son who was a patient at an Army hospital. About ten days earlier, Bixby had come to Schouler's office claiming that five of her sons had died fighting for the Union. Governor Andrew forwarded Newhall's request to the [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] with a note requesting that the president honor Bixby with a letter.{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/14/mode/2up 13&amp;ndash;17]}}

In response to a War Department request of October 1, Schouler sent a messenger to Bixby's home six days later, asking for the names and units of her sons. He sent a report to the War Department on October 12, which was delivered to President Lincoln by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]] sometime after October 28.{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/18/mode/2up 18&amp;ndash;21]}}{{sfn|Steers|Holzer|2007|pp=94&amp;ndash;95}}

On November 21, both the ''Boston Evening Traveller'' and the ''Boston Evening Transcript'' published an appeal by Schouler for contributions to assist soldiers' families at [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] which mentioned a widow who had lost five sons in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=[[c:File:Schouler Thanksgiving appeal.jpg|Thanksgiving Day - An Appeal in Behalf of Soldiers' Families]]|last=|first=|date=21 November 1864|work=[[Boston Evening Traveller]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Barton|1926|pp=40-43}} Schouler had some of the donations given to Bixby and then visited her home on Thanksgiving, November 24. The letter from the President arrived at Schouler's office the next morning.&lt;ref name="Traveller" /&gt;{{sfn|Bullard|1946|p=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/46/mode/2up 46]}}

===Military record of the Bixby sons===
[[File:Lydia Bixby affidavit (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|210px|Bixby's 1862 affidavit attempting to secure a discharge for son Edward]]
Nevertheless, at least two of Lydia Bixby's sons survived the war:
* Private Arthur Edward Bixby (known as "Edward") – Company C, [[1st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery|1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery]] (enlisted June 24, 1861). Deserted from [[Fort Richardson (Arlington, Virginia)|Ft. Richardson]], [[Virginia]] on May 28, 1862.&lt;ref name="MSSMv5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/massachusettssol51931mass#page/576/mode/2up|title=Massachusetts Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines in the Civil War: Volume V|last=Massachusetts Adjutant General Office|first=|publisher=Norwood Press|year=1932|isbn=|location=Norwood, Massachusetts|pages=22, 576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to secure a discharge for him, his mother filed an affidavit on October 17, 1862 which claimed Edward had enlisted underage without her permission.{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/32/mode/2up 32&amp;ndash;34]}} Born July 13, 1843 in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.

* Sergeant Charles N. Bixby – Company D, [[20th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|20th Massachusetts Infantry]] (served July 18, 1861 – May 3, 1863). Killed in action near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. Born c.1841 in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Bullard|1946|p=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/28/mode/2up 29]}}&lt;ref name="MSSMv2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Massachusetts Soldiers, Sailors and Marines in the Civil War: Volume II|last = Massachusetts Adjutant General Office|first = |publisher = Norwood Press|year = 1931|isbn = |location = Norwood, Massachusetts|pages = 523, 549|url = https://archive.org/stream/massachusettssol21931mass#page/n531/mode/2up|volume = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Died November 8, 1871 in [[Milford, Massachusetts]],{{sfn|Bixby|Putnam|1914|p=387}} from [[tuberculosis]] he contracted while a soldier.{{sfn|Nieters|2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=[[c:File:Lydia Bixby 1874 charity appeal.jpg|A Case of Destitution]]|last=|first=|date=4 April 1874|work=[[Boston Daily Globe]]|access-date=|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Private Oliver Cromwell Bixby, Jr. – Company E, 58th Massachusetts Infantry (served February 26, 1864 – July 30, 1864). Wounded at [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]] on May 12, 1864. Killed in action near [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg, Virginia]]. Born February 1, 1828 in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Bixby|Putnam|1914|p=387}}&lt;ref name="MSSMv5" /&gt;
* Private George Way Bixby – Company B, 56th Massachusetts Infantry (served March 16, 1864 – ?). Enlisted under the name "George Way," apparently to conceal his enlistment from his wife. Captured at Petersburg on July 30, 1864. First held prisoner at Richmond but later transferred to [[Salisbury Prison]] in [[North Carolina]], arriving there on October 9, 1864. His fate after that remains uncertain. Military records report conflicting accounts of him either dying at Salisbury or deserting to the Confederate Army.{{efn|A "George Bixby, nephew of Cuba" is also mentioned in an 1878 estate record of Albert Bixby, an uncle who died in Milford, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Bixby|Putnam|1914|p=388}} However, this George was not included on the estate's list of surviving heirs of Cromwell Bixby. Milford relatives later admitted confusing Lydia Bixby's sons with cousins having the same name.{{sfn|Banning|1922|p=519}}}}{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/28/mode/2up 28&amp;ndash;32]}}{{sfn|Steers|Holzer|2007|p=97}} Born June 22, 1836 in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Bixby|Putnam|1914|p=388}}

Schouler's report to the War Department erroneously listed Edward as a member of the [[22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|22nd Massachusetts Infantry]] who had died of his wounds at [[Folly Island]], [[South Carolina]].{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/32/mode/2up 32&amp;ndash;33]}}&lt;ref name="Traveller" /&gt; Bixby may have been trying to conceal—possibly from embarrassment or hope of further financial aid—Edward's 1862 desertion. (She had been receiving a pension following Charles's death in 1863.){{sfn|Bullard|1946|p=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/22/mode/2up 22]}}

At the time of her September meeting with Schouler, Bixby's son George had been a prisoner of war for just over a month, and Henry was still hospitalized following his exchange.{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/46/mode/2up 46&amp;ndash;47]}}  The War Department failed to use its own records to correct errors in the Schouler report.{{sfn|Steers|Holzer|2007|pp=95&amp;ndash;97}}

===Questions of character===
Lydia Bixby died in Boston on October 27, 1878, while a patient at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. In his initial letter to Governor Andrew, Schouler called Bixby "the best specimen of a true-hearted Union woman I have yet seen,"{{sfn|Bullard|1946|p=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/16/mode/2up 16]}} but in the years following her death both her character and loyalty were questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/11/28/defense-boston-widow-bixby/1iiMKXLf27SEr8toEhRy8N/story.html|title=In defense of Boston's Widow Bixby|last=Giesberg|first=Judith|date=28 November 2014|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|access-date=11 January 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/48/mode/2up 48&amp;ndash;49]}}

Writing to her daughter in 1904, Boston socialite Sarah Cabot Wheelwright claimed she had met and had given charitable aid to Lydia Bixby during the war, hoping that one of her sons, in Boston on leave, might help deliver packages to Union prisoners of war; but she later heard gossip that Bixby "kept a [[Brothel|house of ill-fame]], was perfectly untrustworthy and as bad as she could be".{{sfn|Burlingame|1995|pp=60&amp;ndash;61}}{{sfn|Shattuck|1963}}

In the 1920s, Lincoln scholar, William E Barton interviewed the oldest residents of Hopkinton, Massachusetts for their memories of Bixby's family before she moved to Boston. They recalled her sons as being "tough" with "some of them too fond of drink". One son may have "served a jail sentence for some misdemeanor".{{sfn|Barton|1926|pp=79&amp;ndash;80}}

On August 12, 1925, Elizabeth Towers, a daughter of Oliver Bixby, told the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' that her grandmother had "great sympathy for the South" and that her mother recalled that Bixby had been "highly indignant" about the letter with "little good to say of President Lincoln".{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/44/mode/2up 45]}}&lt;ref name="Towers"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=MRS.

The fate of the original letter given to Bixby is unknown. William A. Bixby, a son of Oliver, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in an August 9, 1925 interview that he did not know what happened to the letter after his grandmother received it, though he doubted it still survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1925/08/09/archives/grandson-believes-bixby-letter-lost-declares-his-grandmother-would.html|title=GRANDSON BELIEVES BIXBY LETTER LOST; Declares His Grandmother Would Not Realize the Value of Lincoln's Message.

In the early 20th century, it was sometimes claimed that the original letter could be found on display at [[Brasenose College]] at the [[University of Oxford]] along with other great works in the [[English language]]. Lincoln scholar [[F. Lauriston Bullard]] investigated this claim in 1925, discovering that it was untrue and the college had never heard of the Bixby letter.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson|first=Merrill D. |title=Lincoln in American Memory|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] US|year=1995|pages=246|chapter=Ch. 5 Themes and Variations|isbn=0-19-509645-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D_FjY_ARcGoC&amp;pg=PA246 |accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These first appeared in 1891, when [[New York City]] print dealer Michael F. Tobin applied for a [[copyright]] to sell souvenir copies of the letter with an engraving of Lincoln by [[John Chester Buttre]] for $2 each.{{sfn|Steers|Holzer|2007|pp=96, 98}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2003653265/|title=Letter from Abraham Lincoln to Mrs. Bixby, with bust-length portrait of Lincoln|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|publisher=|access-date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Huber's Museum, a [[dime museum]] in [[Manhattan]], began displaying a copy, "stained by coffee and exposure", of Tobin's facsimile as "the original Bixby letter" and selling their own copies for $1 each.{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/54/mode/2up 54&amp;ndash;58]}}{{sfn|Banning|1922|p=520}}

[[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], an [[autograph]] dealer and handwriting expert, examined the Tobin facsimile; concluding it had been copied from a poorly executed [[forgery]] originally written in pencil and retraced in ink to imitate Lincoln's handwriting, calling it "halting and awkward and makes his forceful hand appear like a child's scrawl".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Great Forgers and Famous Fakes|last = Hamilton|first = Charles|publisher = Crown Publishers|year = 1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 29–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobin's facsimile also errs when compared to the original text of the letter published in Boston newspapers; adding the [[salutation]] "To Mrs Bixby, Boston Mass", misspelling the word "assuage" as "assauge", omitting the word "to" after the word "tendering", changing the plural "words" into "word", not capitalizing the words "freedom" and "republic", missing the recipient "Mrs. Bixby" on the bottom left, and combining the original three paragraphs into one.{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/146/mode/2up 146&amp;ndash;147]}}&lt;ref name="Basler"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/collectedworksof015584mbp#page/n131/mode/2up|title=Abraham Lincoln to Mrs. Lydia Bixby|last=Basler|first=Roy P.|year=1953|work=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln Vol. 8|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|pages=116-117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huber's Museum corrected the spelling of "assuage" in their version of the facsimile.{{sfn|Emerson|2008|p=108}}

==Authorship==
Scholars have debated whether the Bixby letter was written by Lincoln himself or by his assistant [[Secretary to the President of the United States|private secretary]], [[John Hay]].&lt;ref name="Emerson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emerson |first=Jason |date=February–March 2006 |title=America's Most Famous Letter |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/america%E2%80%99s-most-famous-letter |journal=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |volume=57 |issue=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401181131/http://www.americanheritage.com/content/america%E2%80%99s-most-famous-letter?page=show |archive-date= 1 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; November 1864 was a busy month for Lincoln, possibly forcing him to delegate the task to Hay.&lt;ref name="Burlingame" /&gt;

Second- and third-hand recollections of acquaintances suggest Hay may have claimed to others that he wrote it,{{sfn|Steers|Holzer|2007|pp=98-100}} but his children could not recall him ever mentioning composing the letter.{{sfn|Bullard|1946|p=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/108/mode/2up 109]}} Writing to [[William E. Chandler]] in 1904, Hay said "the letter of Mr. Lincoln to Mrs. Bixby is genuine",{{sfn|Bullard|1946|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/abrahamlincolnwi00bull#page/122/mode/2up 122&amp;ndash;125]}} but he may only have been referring to its text.{{sfn|Burlingame|1995|p=69}} In a 1917 letter to historian [[Isaac Markens]], [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] said Hay had told him that he did not have "any special knowledge of the letter at the time" it was written.{{sfn|Emerson|2008|pp=104-106}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPqgC3RS-7sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Bixby%20Hay&amp;f=false | title = Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

Historian [[Michael Burlingame (historian)|Michael Burlingame]], who believes Hay is the author, has pointed out that Hay's [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]] have two newspaper clippings of the letter while largely containing Hay's own writing.{{sfn|Burlingame|1995|pp=70&amp;ndash;71}} However, they also contain material written by Lincoln including the [[Gettysburg Address]] and the [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|Second Inaugural]].&lt;ref name="Emerson" /&gt;

Scholars favoring Lincoln's authorship, including [[Edward Steers, Jr.|Edward Steers]] and Jason Emerson, note that the Gettysburg Address and the [[Abraham Lincoln's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] are similar examples of Lincoln's highly regarded style.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;{{sfn|Steers|Holzer|2007|p=93}} Other scholars, such as Burlingame, have countered that Hay wrote pieces that compare favorably to the Bixby letter and note words and phrases in the letter that appear more frequently in Hay's writings than those of Lincoln.{{sfn|Burlingame|2000|pp=169&amp;ndash;184}} For instance, Burlingame notes the word ''beguile'' appears numerous times in the works of Hay and the phrase ''I cannot refrain from tendering'' is used by Hay in an 1864 letter to [[Quincy Gillmore]], but neither appears once in the other collected works of Lincoln.{{sfn|Burlingame|2000|pp=86, 169&amp;ndash;184}} Although, the phrase ''I cannot refrain from'' is used by Lincoln in an 1859 letter to [[Salmon P. Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln3/1:143?hi=0;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;q1=I+cannot+refrain+from|title=Letter to Salmon P.

In 1988, at the request of investigator [[Joe Nickell]], [[University of Kentucky]] professor of English Jean G. Pival studied the vocabulary, syntax, and other stylistic characteristics of the letter and concluded that it more closely resembled Lincoln's style of writing than Hay's.{{sfn|Nickell|1989|pp=137&amp;ndash;140}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1V-BIdlc9YEC&amp;pg=PA95|title=Unsolved History: Investigating Mysteries of the Past|last=Nickell|first=Joe|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8131-9137-9|pages=95–105, 164|chapter=Suspect Documents|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter's passage "the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom" is inscribed on the base of the statue of [[Columbia (name)#Personification|Lady Columbia]] at the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacom.mil/Media/SpeechesTestimony/tabid/6706/Article/785134/67th-honolulu-mayors-memorial-day-ceremony.aspx|title=67th Honolulu Mayor’s Memorial Day Ceremony|date=31 May 2016|website=www.pacom.mil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623000928/http://www.pacom.mil/Media/SpeechesTestimony/tabid/6706/Article/785134/67th-honolulu-mayors-memorial-day-ceremony.aspx|archive-date=23 June 2016|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions on the topic of siblings dying in war have frequently mentioned the letter; such as the [[Sullivan brothers]], the [[Niland brothers]], the [[Borgstrom brothers]], and the [[Sole Survivor Policy]] of the [[United States military]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CAEyh6EY9kYC|title=Saving Private Property: Steven Spielberg's American DreamWorks|last=Kodat|first=Catherine Gunther|work=The American Experience in World War II|volume= 11: ''Remembering and Representing the Second World War''|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Hixson|editor-first=Walter L.|location=New York|pages=255&amp;ndash;256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1998 war film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', General [[George Marshall]] (played by [[Harve Presnell]]) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle. In a voiceover near the end of the film, Marshall quotes the Bixby letter in a letter to Mrs. Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_LycDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|title=The Progressive Revolution: History of Liberal Fascism through the Ages, Vol. V: 2014-2015 Writings|last=Washington|first=Ellis|publisher=Hamilton Books|year=2017|isbn=9780761868507|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=191-194|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3576">[[File:Bosatlas NL 1988 50th edition.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Bosatlas 1988]]The '''Bosatlas''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[atlas]]. Used in most schools, it remains the best selling atlas in the Netherlands.

==History==
The atlas was started by [[:nl:Pieter Roelf Bos|Pieter Roelf Bos]], a [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] teacher. The first atlas was published in 1877 with the name ''Bos' Schoolatlas der geheele aarde (Bos's School Atlas of the Whole Earth)''. Later editions were named ''Bosatlas''.  Bos continued to look after the production of the atlas until his death in 1902: his final production was the 15th edition.   The last of his successors to take individual responsibility for the Atlas was F.J.Ormeling (1976–1981).   Since 1981 responsibility for the atlas has been collectively attributed and it is the publisher's name that has been highlighted in the atlas and associated marketing material.&lt;ref name=DeGroteBosatlas /&gt;

The reason for first publication was the introduction of [[geography]] in (former) Dutch high schools. The maps were originally drawn by hand. The publisher was [[Wolters|Jan Berend Wolters]] of Groningen, whose firm continues to publish the atlas as [[:nl:Noordhoff Uitgevers|Wolters-Noordhoff]].&lt;ref name=DeGroteBosatlas&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title=De Grote Bosatlas|year=1988 |publisher=Wolters-Noordhoff bv|location=Groningen|isbn=90-01-12100-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Different versions of the atlas are (or were) published, as follows. 
*De Grote Bosatlas, continuation of the Bosatlas
*De Basis Bosatlas (until 2003 named De Kleine Bosatlas)
*De Junior Bosatlas
*Mijn Eerste Bosatlas
*De Wereld Bosatlas, a big atlas
*De Bosatlas van Nederland
*De Bosatlas van Fryslân
*De Bosatlas van Amsterdam

==Frisian Bosatlas==
In November 2009, a Frisian edition, ''De Bosatlas van Fryslân'' was published, completely dedicated to the Dutch province of [[Friesland]], with historical and modern maps, aerophotography, background information on hundreds of topics and a complete set of topographical maps, [[Scale (map)|scale]] (1:25 000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.friesebosatlas.nl/# |title=''De Friese Bosatlas'' |access-date=2009-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205085352/http://www.friesebosatlas.nl/# |archive-date=2009-12-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeuwardercourant.nl/nieuws/regio/article5506715.ece/Friese-Bosatlas-niet-aan-te-slepen "Friese Bosatlas niet aan te slepen"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Dutch editions==
Editions of the atlas have also been published in Belgium (both Dutch and French),&lt;ref name="Le Grand Atlas"&gt;{{cite book |author=J. Charlier |author2=D. Charlier-Vanderschraege |author3=M. De Roeck |author4=J. Lambion |last-author-amp=yes |title=Le Grand Atlas|year=1989 |publisher=De Boeck-Wesmael|location=Bruxelles|isbn=2-8041-1163-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Sweden and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   The standard "Grote Bosatlas", although a world atlas, provides a greatly extended level of detail and variety in respect of the Netherlands.   With the non-Dutch editions this greater level of national focus is switched away from the Netherlands in favour of the country for which the edition has been prepared.

'''''Broussard v. School Board of Norfolk''''', 801 F. Supp. 1526 ([[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|E.D. Va.]] 1992) was a court case that took place in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], United States in 1992.  Kimberly Broussard, a middle school student was disciplined by the [[Norfolk Public Schools]] for wearing a t-shirt that read "Drugs Suck". When her parents sued on her behalf, her lawyer claimed that her shirt was a form of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] protected by the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution]] and the [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District|Tinker Standard]]. The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] ruled in favor of the school board, saying that although the shirt displayed an anti-drug message, the word "suck" was a vulgar word with a sexual [[connotation]] and therefore not allowed in school.

A '''church treasure''' ({{lang-de|Kirchenschatz}}) is the collection of historical art treasures belonging to a [[church (building)|church]], usually a [[monastery]] ('''monastery treasure'''), [[abbey]], [[cathedral]]. Such "treasure" is usually held and displayed in the church's [[treasure chamber|treasury]] or in a [[diocesan museum]]. Historically the highlight of church treasures was often a collection of [[reliquaries]].

As a result of gifts and the desire to acquire sacred artifacts, many churches over the centuries gathered valuable and historic collections of [[altar plate]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s of liturgical or religious books, as well as [[vestments]], and other works of art or items of historical interest. Despite [[iconoclasm]], [[secularism]], looting, fire, the enforced sale of treasure in times of financial difficulty, theft and other losses, much of this treasure has survived or has even been repurchased.  Many large churches have been displaying their riches to visitors in some form for centuries.

Performing '''[[A/B testing|split testing]]''' on a [[website]] requires a combination of features. There are many tools that make it easier to rotate variants and report results, yet they have many differences.

== Definitions ==
* '''Integration''' of a tool with web development: using a [[JavaScript]] [[snippet (programming)|snippet]] means the developer must edit and install a snippet into the [[HTML]] code of the [[website]]. Use of a [[WordPress]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] requires download and activation of the plug-in.
* '''Content testing:''' identifying what the tool allows the developer to test, and what requires optimization
* '''Test creation:''' whether tests can be created by the developer (user defined), or the tool automatically creates tests  based on many permutations of all options that can be tested
* '''Minimum traffic required:''' by the website receive before it can use the tool
* '''Release:''' open to the public, or only granted to a select few users

The '''"Dear Boss" letter''' was a message allegedly written by the notorious [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]]. It was postmarked and received on 27 September 1888, by the [[Central News Agency (London)|Central News Agency]] of [[London]]. It was forwarded to [[Scotland Yard]] on 29 September.&lt;ref name="Sugden 2002 260–270"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete History of Jack the Ripper |last= Sugden |first= Philip |authorlink=Philip Sugden (historian) |year= 2002 |publisher= Carroll &amp; Graf |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7867-0932-8 |pages= 260–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written in red ink, the message, like most alleged Ripper letters that followed, contains spelling and punctuation errors. It reads:
&lt;!--- ATTENTION: DO NOT FIX THE SPELLING ERRORS. THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE OF WHAT THE ACTUAL LETTER SAID.---&gt;
{{quote|Dear Boss,
I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they wont fix me just yet. I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the &lt;u&gt;right&lt;/u&gt; track. That joke about Leather Apron gave me real fits. I am down on whores and I shant quit ripping them till I do get buckled. Grand work the last job was. I gave the lady no time to squeal. How can they catch me now. I love my work and want to start again. You will soon hear of me with my funny little games. I saved some of the proper &lt;u&gt;red&lt;/u&gt; stuff in a ginger beer bottle over the last job to write with but it went thick like glue and I cant use it. Red ink is fit enough I hope &lt;u&gt;ha. ha.&lt;/u&gt; The next job I do I shall clip the ladys ears off and send to the police officers just for jolly wouldn't you. Keep this letter back till I do a bit more work, then give it out straight. My knife's so nice and sharp I want to get to work right away if I get a chance. Good Luck.
&lt;!--- ATTENTION: DO NOT FIX THE SPELLING ERRORS. THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE OF WHAT THE ACTUAL LETTER SAID.---&gt;
Yours truly&lt;br&gt;
Jack the Ripper&lt;br&gt;&lt;!--- ATTENTION: DO NOT FIX THE SPELLING ERRORS. THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE OF WHAT THE ACTUAL LETTER SAID.---&gt;

Dont mind me giving the trade name

PS Wasnt good enough to post this before I got all the red ink off my hands curse it. No luck yet. They say I'm a doctor now. &lt;u&gt;ha ha&lt;/u&gt;&lt;!--- ATTENTION: DO NOT FIX THE SPELLING ERRORS. THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE OF WHAT THE ACTUAL LETTER SAID.---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casebook.org/ripper_letters/ Casebook: Jack the Ripper article on the Ripper letters]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Police response==
Initially the letter was considered to be just one of many [[hoax]]es, but when the body of [[Catherine Eddowes]] was found with one earlobe severed on 30 September, the writer's promise to "clip the ladys ears off"&lt;!--- DO NOT FIX THE SPELLING ERRORS.---&gt; attracted attention. The [[Metropolitan Police]] published handbills with facsimiles of it and the [[Saucy Jacky postcard]] (which had referred to the earlier message and was received before the first became public knowledge) hoping someone would recognise the handwriting, but nothing came of this effort. Many newspapers also reprinted the text in whole or in part.  These two messages gained worldwide notoriety after their publication. It was the first time the "Jack the Ripper" name had been used to refer to the killer, and the term captured the imagination of the public. Soon hundreds of other letters claiming to be from "Jack the Ripper" were received, most copying key phrases from these letters.&lt;ref name="Sugden 2002 260–270" /&gt;

==Later events==
After the murders, police officials stated that they believed this letter and the postcard were hoaxes by a local [[journalist]]. One journalist is reported to have confessed that he had written it and other messages purported to be from the Ripper in order "to keep the business alive".&lt;ref name = "joe"&gt;Joe Nickell, ''Real or Fake: Studies in Authentication'', University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, 2009. pp.44-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

These suspicions were not well publicised, and the idea that the killer had sent messages taunting the police became one of the enduring legends of the Ripper case. Modern scholars are divided on which, if any, of the letters should be considered genuine, but the "Dear Boss" letter is one of three named most frequently as potentially having been written by the killer. A number of authors have tried to advance their theories by [[Graphology|comparing handwriting]] samples of their suspects to the writing found in this letter.&lt;ref name="Sugden 2002 260–270" /&gt;

Like many items related to the Ripper case, the "Dear Boss" letter disappeared from the police files not long after the investigation ended. It may have been kept as a [[souvenir]] by one of the investigating officers.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} It was returned anonymously to the Metropolitan Police in 1987, whereupon Scotland Yard recalled all the documents from their file from the Public Record Office, now [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], at [[Kew]]. The return of the documents was announced in 1988.

In 1993 the handwriting of the Dear Boss letter was compared to that of the purported diary of [[James Maybrick]]. The report noted that the "characteristics of the Dear Boss letter follow closely upon the [[Round Hand]] writing style of the time and exhibit a good writing skill."&lt;ref name = "joe"/&gt;

The '''Finnish Declaration of Independence''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen itsenäisyysjulistus}}; {{lang-sv|Finlands självständighetsförklaring}}; {{lang-ru|Провозглашение независимости Финляндии}}) was adopted by the [[Parliament of Finland]] on 6 December 1917. It declared [[Finland]] an [[Independence|independent]] [[nation state|nation, among nations]] ending its autonomy within [[Russia]] as its [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], with reference to a simultaneously delivered [[bill (law)|bill]] to the Diet to make Finland an independent [[republic]] instead.

Declaring the independence was only part of the long process leading to the [[independence of Finland]]. The declaration is celebrated as the [[Independence Day (Finland)|Independence Day]] in Finland.

==Revolution in Russia==
After the [[February Revolution]] and the [[abdication]] of [[Grand Duke of Finland|Grand Duke]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] on 2 March (15 March [[New Style|N.S.]]) 1917, the [[personal union]] between Russia and Finland lost its legal base &amp;ndash; at least according to the view in [[Helsinki]]. There were negotiations between the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and Finnish authorities.

The resulting proposal, approved by the Provisional Government, was heavily rewritten in the Finnish Parliament and transformed into the so-called Power Act (Finnish: ''Valtalaki'', Swedish: ''Maktlagen''), whereby the Parliament declared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.histdoc.net/historia/valtalaki1917.html| date=25 July 1917 | title=Hallituksen esitykseen, joka sisältää ehdotuksen laiksi erinäisten asiain siirtämisestä Suomen senaatin ja kenraalikuvernöörin ratkaistavaksi | language=Finnish | accessdate=8 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; itself to now hold all powers of legislation, except with respect to foreign policy and military issues, and also that it could be dissolved only by itself. At the time of the vote it was believed that the Provisional Government would be quickly defeated by the [[July Days|rebellion in Saint Petersburg]]. The Provisional Government survived, however, disapproved of the Power Act and dissolved the Parliament.

After new elections and the ultimate defeat of the Provisional Government in the [[October Revolution]], the Finnish Parliament decided to set a three-man regency council, based on Finland's Constitution, and more precisely on clause [http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Regeringsform_1772#%C2%A7_38. §38] of the old [[Instrument of Government (1772)|Instrument of Government]] of 1772, which had been enacted by the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Estates]] after [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav&amp;nbsp;III]]'s bloodless coup. This paragraph provided for the election of a new monarch in case of the extinction of the royal line and was interpreted in Finland as vesting sovereignty in the estates, later the Parliament, in such an interregnum. The regency council was however never elected because of the strong opposition of Finnish socialists and their [[Finnish General Strike of 1917|general strike]] which demanded for more radical action.

On 2 November (15 November N.S.) 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] declared a general right of [[self-determination]], including the right of complete [[secession]], [[Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia|"for the Peoples of Russia"]]. On the same day the Finnish Parliament issued a declaration by which it assumed, ''[[pro tempore]]'', all powers of the [[Grand Duke of Finland|Sovereign]] in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www15.uta.fi/yky/arkisto/suomi80/teema4.htm |title= Eduskunta |website= Suomi 80|publisher=Tampere University |access-date=20 August 2016 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old Instrument of Government was however no longer deemed suitable. Leading circles had long held monarchism and hereditary [[nobility]] to be antiquated, and advocated a republican constitution for Finland.

The [[Senate of Finland]], the government that the Parliament had appointed in November, drafted a Declaration of Independence and a proposal for a new republican Instrument of Government. Chairman of the Senate ({{aka}} Prime minister) [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] read the Declaration to the Parliament on 4 December. The Declaration of Independence was technically given the form of a preamble of the proposition, and was intended to be agreed by the Parliament, which adopted the Declaration on 6 December.

On 18 December (31 December N. S.) the [[Council of People's Commissars|Soviet Russian government]] issued a [[Soviet Decrees|Decree]], recognizing Finland's independence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/finland1917.htm |title= Primary Documents - Soviet Recognition of Finland's Independence, 18 December 1917 |website= first world war|publisher= |access-date=20 August 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 22 December (4 January 1918 N. S.) it was approved by the highest Soviet executive body, the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee|All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/onthisday/1918_01_04.htm |title= On This Day - 4 January 1918 |website= first world war|publisher= |access-date=20 August 2016 |quote=Eastern front: Bolshevik Government recognises independence of Finland.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Declaration and 15 November==

With reference to the declaration of 15 November, the declaration says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The people of Finland have by this step taken their fate in their own hands; a step both justified and demanded by present conditions. The people of Finland feel deeply that they cannot fulfil their national and international duty without complete sovereignty. The century-old desire for freedom awaits fulfilment now; Finland's people step forward as a free nation among the other nations in the world.

(...) The people of Finland dare to confidently await how other nations in the world recognize that with their full independence and freedom, the people of Finland can do their best in fulfilment of those purposes that will win them a place amongst civilized peoples.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Context===
[[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] declared their independence from Russia during the same period. See [[Estonian War of Independence]], [[History of Latvia#Independence|Latvian Independence]] and [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence]].

These three countries were occupied by, and annexed into, the Soviet Union (1940-1941, 1944-1991). See [[Occupation of the Baltic states]].

===Text of Finland's Declaration of Independence===
{{quote|'''To The Finnish People.'''

The Finnish Parliament has on 15th day of the last November, in support of Section 38 of the Constitution, declared to be the Supreme holder of the State Authority as well as set up a Government to the country, that has taken to its primary task the realization and safeguarding Finland’s independence as a state. The people of Finland have by this step taken their fate in their own hands: a step both justified and demanded by present conditions. The people of Finland feel deeply that they cannot fulfil their national duty and their universal human obligations without a complete sovereignty. The century-old desire for freedom awaits fulfilment now; The People of Finland has to step forward as an independent nation among the other nations in the world.

Achieving this goal requires mainly some measures by the Parliament. Finland’s current form of government, which is currently incompatible with the conditions, requires a complete renewal and therefore has the Government now submitted a proposition for a new Constitution to the Parliament’s council, a proposition that is based on the principle that Finland is to be a sovereign republic. Considering that, the main features of the new polity has to be carried into effect immediately, the Government has at the same time delivered a bill of acts in this matter, which mean to satisfy the most urgent renewal needs before the establishment of the new Constitution.

The same goal also calls for measures from the part of the Government. The Government will approach foreign powers to seek an international recognition of our country’s independence as a state. At the present moment this is particularly all the more necessary, when the grave situation caused by the country’s complete isolation, famine and unemployment compels the Government to establish actual relations to the foreign powers, which prompt assistance in satisfying the necessities of life and in importing the essential goods for the industry, are our only rescue from the imminent famine and industrial stagnation.

The Russian people have, after subverting the Tsarist Regime, in a number of occasions expressed its intention to favour the Finnish people the right to determine its own fate, which is based on its centuries-old cultural development. And widely over all the horrors of the war is heard a voice, that one of the goals of the present war is to be, that no nation shall be forced against its will to be dependent on another ''(nation)''. The Finnish people believe that the free Russian people and its constitutive National Assembly don’t want to prevent Finland’s aspiration to enter the multitude of the free and independent nations. At the same time the People of Finland dare to hope that the other nations of the world recognizes, that with their full independence and freedom the People of Finland can do their best in fulfilment of those purposes that will win them an independent position amongst the people of the civilized world.

At the same time as the Government has wanted to let all the Finnish citizens to know these words, the Government turns to the citizens, as well as the private and public authorities, calling everyone on their own behalf  with rapt attention to follow the ''(law and)'' order by filling their patriotic duty, to strain all their strength for achieving the nation's common goal in this point of time, which has such an importance and decisiveness, that there have never before been in the life of the Finnish people. In Helsinki, 4 December 1917.

'''Gansong Art Museum''' is the first modern private museum of [[Korea]] and was founded by [[Jeon Hyeongpil]] (전형필 全鎣弼) in 1938. The museum was named after the [[pen name]] of the founder, ''Gansong'' (간송 澗松). The aim of the foundation was to prevent [[Japanese people|Japanese]] removal of Korean cultural properties, during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.kbs.co.kr/society/events/1397154_11777.html Gansong Art Museum to Display National Treasures] from [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS Global]]&lt;/ref&gt; At times, numerous Korean cultural properties were taken to Japan, such as [[Korean pottery and porcelain#Goryeo(Koryo) Dynasty|Goryeo porcelains]], [[Korean Buddhist sculpture|statues of Buddha]] made in [[Silla kingdom]], documents and books made in [[Joseon dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://kr.gugi.yahoo.com/detail/detailInfo/DetailInfoAction.php?cid=2601727619 Brief information about ''Gansong Art Museum''] from Yahoo Korea dictionary {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314072940/http://kr.gugi.yahoo.com/detail/detailInfo/DetailInfoAction.php?cid=2601727619 |date=March 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeon Hyeongpil contributed at his own expense to protect [[Korean culture]] and art.

The museum holds many top-rated antique pieces of art such as [[Hunmin jeongeum]] (No. 70 [[National treasures of South Korea|National Treasure]]), [[Donggukjeongun]] Book 1, 2 (No. 71 National Treasure), Geumdong gyemimyeong samjonbul (No. 72 National Treasure), [[Hyewon pungsokdo]].

==Am I Not a Man?==
[[File:Am I not a man.jpg|150px|thumb|''Am I Not A Man And A Brother'' emblem used by abolitionists.]]

Historically, in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]], the term "[[boy]]" was used as a [[pejorative]] [[racist]] [[insult]] towards men of [[Black people|color]] and [[Slavery|slaves]], indicating their subservient [[social status]] of being less than [[men]].&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UILcQZS6Bi4C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=boy+african+american+pejorative&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i-89AM4K-5&amp;sig=LIjrydmYVlYYVrVnMG8b94KUCWE&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=boy%20african%20american%20pejorative&amp;f=false |last=Andersen |first=Margaret L. |title=Sociology With Infotrac: Understanding a Diverse Society |year=2008 |pages=61 |publisher=Thompson Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Josiah Wedgwood#"Am I Not a Man And a Brother?"|''Am I Not A Man And A Brother?'']] became a [[catchphrase]] used by British and American [[abolitionism|abolitionists]]. In 1787, [[Josiah Wedgwood]] designed a [[medallion]] for the British anti-slavery campaign. He copied the original design from the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] as a [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] in [[black-and-white]]. It was widely reproduced and became a popular [[fashion statement]] promoting [[justice]], humanity, and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/abolition/africans_in_art_gallery_02.shtml |title=The Black Figure in 18th-century Art |author=Dabydeen, David |date=February 17, 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On trial for bringing his son back to [[Nebraska]] for burial, from a forced march to Oklahoma, in 1879 [[Ponca]] Chief [[Standing Bear]] spoke to judge Dundy in his Omaha trial, "That hand is not the color of yours, but if I pierce it, I shall feel pain. If you pierce your hand, you also feel pain. The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. God made us both." Standing Bear (and Native Americans) were granted [[habeas corpus]] meaning that they had status in the court and were indeed human beings.&lt;ref&gt; "I Am a Man": Chief Standing Bear's Journey for Justice, Joe Starita 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Image magic''' is a tradition of magic in [[medieval]] [[Europe]] originating from the influx of [[Arabic]] texts in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and focused on astrology. It serves as a major precursor to and was reinterpreted by the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] [[Renaissance]] magical traditions, particularly the work of [[Marsilio Ficino]].

The term astrological image first appears in the ''[[Speculum astronomiae]]'' and refers to talismans created under specific astrological signs in order to draw down influence from astral spirits (i.e. the planets and stars embodied as the Aristotelian Intelligences, and later the Neoplatonic planetary demons) for magical operation.

Image magic stands in contrast to medieval ritual magic and theurgy, particularly of the Solomonic tradition descending ultimately from the [[Testament of Solomon]]. The two competing traditions remained separate in manuscripts until the early Renaissance at which point they were often combined into single codexes.

As they originated from Arabic sources, image magic was often treated as a natural science manipulating the occult powers of nature rather that the invocation and necromancy associated with Solomonic ritual magic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5969">'''Integrated Software Dependent Systems''' (ISDS) is an offshore standard (DNV-OS-D203) and recommended practice guideline (DNV-RP-D201) covering systems and software verifications and classification of any integrated system that utilizes extensive software control.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=https://rules.dnvgl.com/ServiceDocuments/dnvgl/
  |title=DNV Service Specifications, Standards and Recommended Practices
  |publisher=DNV GL
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ISDS Recommended Practice (DNV-RP-D201) was launched in 2008 by [[Det Norske Veritas]] (DNV), the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[classification society]]. DNV Offshore Standard OS-D203 launched in April 2010.

Since the ISDS standard was first published by DNV, it has been applied by several oil companies, equipment suppliers, ship and rig owners. The ISDS standard focuses on how to set up and run a project and how to develop system and [[software quality assurance]] processes that will last the lifetime of the unit (ship, rig etc.). It provides a framework for working systematically to achieve the required reliability, availability, maintainability and safety for the integrated unit of software dependent systems.

The process typically starts when owners are specifying their requirements, either for a new project or an enhancement to an existing system. In collaboration with DNV specialists, the owner can assess the integrator and the suppliers to ensure they have the prerequisites for delivering good quality software. One of the innovations of ISDS is that it assigns systems and software responsibilities to one or more of the roles: owner, operator, system integrator, suppliers, and independent verifier.

Another important feature of ISDS is that it requires the designation of a system integrator. This can be the shipbuilder, the major automation supplier, or a specialized contractor. The ISDS defines the activities to be performed by the system integrator. These activities focus on managing requirements and interfaces among the different systems.

The ISDS-required practices for suppliers focus on ensuring that software quality is built into vendors’ products through systematic reviews, inspections, and testing. All of these requirements are generally accepted good practices in software engineering. Nothing revolutionary is demanded.

Among the rig-owners, Songa Offshore, Seadrill and Dolphin Drilling have been early adopters of the ISDS approach. DNV conducted a pilot project of the recommended practice version of ISDS with Seadrill (in Houston) in 2009. Several improvements were made to Seadrill’s new build and operations practices as a result of this initiative, and a story on this has been published in ''Offshore Engineer''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNV has been engaged with Dolphin Drilling in an effort that will lead to the issuance of the first ISDS class certificate, see article by Steve Marshall in Upstream Online.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=https://www.upstreamonline.com/archive/?q=Dolphin+in+Software+Class+Leap&amp;languages=en&amp;locale=en%20Dolphin%20in%20Software%20Class%20Leap]%22.%20Upstream%20Online.%20February%202011

DNV is engaged by the Daewoo Ship and Marine Engineering (DSME), Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) and Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) yards in South Korea, for drilling units they are building for Songa Offshore, Fred Olsen Energy (Dolphin Drilling), Statoil and Diamond Drilling. The owners have specified a full scope for DNV follow-up on ISDS, including systems for emergency shut-down, fire and gas, BOP control, drilling control, pipe/riser handling, heave compensation &amp; tensioning, bulk storage, drilling fluid circulation, cementing, dynamic positioning, power management and integrated automation. See article published in Offshore Magazine for the Songa Offshore units.&lt;ref&gt;

  |title=Software standard gains momentum with new drilling rigs
  |work=Offshore Magazine
  |date=April 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, DNV announced the contract with Diamond Drilling, the first American rig-owner to apply ISDS for a new-build project.&lt;ref&gt;

  |title=ISDS breakthrough with American rig-owner
  |work=Oceanhub
  |date=September 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISDS methodology has been developed starting with best industry practices from aerospace, telecom and automotive industries, and adapting the requirements to fit the offshore and maritime domains. An article published in Oil &amp; Gas Journal gives an industry perspective to ISDS.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://www.ogj-digital.com/ogj/20110704?pg=185#pg185
  |title=Oil &amp; Gas Journal
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the ''Songa Equinox'', the first of ''Songa Offshore''’s four new sixth generation Cat-D semisubmersible rigs, met the requirements of integrated software dependent systems (ISDS) standard (DNV-OS-D203) to prevent software glitches. The aim is to enable full tracking of the quality and version control of all integrated software systems, so that the yard and the user knows the status of all systems, the latest updates, if any still require close-out at the yard, at any given time. Noticeable improvements to the typical complex cyber dependent vessel newbuilding lifecycle were observed.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Leksikon fun yidishn teater''''' (לעקסיקאן פון יידישן טעאטער Lexicon of Yiddish Theatre or Encyclopedia of the Yiddish Theatre) is a Yiddish language reference encyclopedia compiled by [[Zalmen Zylbercweig]], assisted by Jacob Mestel on two volumes.

The six-volume 3,066 page work contains biographies of more than 3,000 individuals, as well as articles on theatre troupes and plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Zylbercweig_Zalmen YIVO Zalmen Zylbercweig] "The entries for major figures such as [[Avrom Goldfadn]], [[Y. L. Peretz]] and [[Ester-Rokhl Kaminska]] amount to book-length monographs, including bibliographies of works by and about them; smaller entries are often the only source of information about lesser-known actors, playwrights, composers, and critics; there is a wealth of photographs and graphic material throughout."&lt;/ref&gt; The compiler published the first volumes in New York and Warsaw before World War II. Later volumes were published in New York and Mexico City from 1959 to 1969. A seventh volume was prepared for publication, but on Zylbercweig's death it was unable to be completed.

Early on Zylbercweig received support for his project from the [[Hebrew Actors' Union]], which sponsored a 16-page prospectus for the lexicon in 1928; with the Union's help Zylbercweig mailed out a questionnaire to all of its members, the responses to which served as a basis for entries.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Faith (2012). "Sex and Scandal in the ''Encyclopedia of the Yiddish Theatre''". In: Joel Berkowitz and Barbara Henry (Eds.), ''Inventing the Modern Yiddish Stage: Essays in Drama, Performance, and Show Business''. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. {{ISBN|9780814337196}}. p. 251-274; here p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume of the lexicon appeared in New York in 1931, and the second in Warsaw, in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2012), p. 257-258; notes p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Zylbercweig raised money for the publication of these volumes through a number of routes, such as banquets, fundraiser performances, pre-sales, and the sales of his other books.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Faith|date=2006|title=The Fate of Yiddish Dictionaries: Zalmen Zylbercweig’s Leksikon fun Yidishn teater|url=|journal=Journal of Modern Jewish Studies|volume=5.3|pages=323–342|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the ''Leksikon'' changed significantly between the second volume and all further volumes. The early volumes were edited so that length of entry reflected the stature of individuals, and attempted to limit information given to the most meaningful details. In the post-War years, however, Zylbercweig understood his mission to be the dissemination of any and all information he could gather, to prevent it being lost to history. Thus, in later volumes the entries are generally longer, and the length of entry does not correspond to the importance of the individual but to the amount of material available about them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Volume 5 is titled ''kadoyshim band'' [martyr's volume] and consists entirely of entries for individuals who perished in the Holocaust. Some entries are very short; most lack dates of death.

The '''''Leksikon vokabulam novym po alfavitu''''' ({{lang-ru|'''Лексикон вокабулам новым по алфабиту'''}}) is a Russian dictionary of foreign words in published during [[Peter the Great]]'s age, possibly ordered by him. It is an example of borrowing words deliberately. It consists of 503 foreign words that should be settled in the Russian vocabulary. Most of words have now their space in the Russian language. Every foreign word had its own definition in Russian. The types of words varies from art of war (армея, авангардиа...) to everyday words (интерес, люстра, пардон...). The dictionary appears to have been edited by Peter himself.

Most '''countries of the world''' have '''different names''' in different languages. Some countries have also undergone name changes for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known alternative names for all nations, countries and sovereign states. It does not offer any opinion about what the "original", "real", or "correct" name of any country is or was.

Countries are listed alphabetically by their '''current best-known name in English'''. Each English name is followed by its currently best-known equivalents in other languages, listed in English alphabetical order (ignoring accents) by name and by language. Historical and/or alternative versions, where included, are noted as such. Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents are listed, to provide an answer to the question "What is that name in..."?. See also: [[List of alternative country names]]

Entries are formatted as follows: languages written in the Latin alphabet use "'''Name''' (language)" [for example, "'''Afeganistão''' (Portuguese)"] and are alphabetized in the list according to English rules of alphabetical order. Languages written in other [[writing system]]s use "'''Romanization''' - native script (language)" [for example, "'''English''' - אַרגענטינע (Yiddish)"] and are alphabetized in the list by the romanized form.

For reasons of size, this article is broken into four parts:
*[[List of country names in various languages (A–C)]]
*[[List of country names in various languages (D–I)]]
*'''List of country names in various languages (J–P)'''

Individual portraits of 53 people central to the history of the United States are depicted on the country's banknotes&lt;ref name="Friedberg"&gt;Friedberg&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref |The scope of U.S. banknotes (e.g., 1861 to the present) is based on the parameters established by the Friedberg reference book.&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Arthur L. &amp; Ira S.&lt;/ref&gt;| group="nb"}} including [[List of Presidents of the United States|presidents]], [[United States Cabinet|cabinet members]], members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], [[Supreme Court of the United States|jurists]], and [[List of American Civil War Generals (Union)|military leaders]]. &lt;!--Some faces are seen daily on modern currency, others are familiar from the pages of history but may be surprising to see on a bank note. There may be one or two who are completely unfamiliar.--&gt;

The redesign of U.S. banknotes in 1922 prompted the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] to review the portraits on banknotes and conclude that "portraits of Presidents of the United States have a more permanent familiarity in the minds of the public than any others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=U.S. Currency |publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing |url=http://www.moneyfactory.gov/faqlibrary.html |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505025421/http://www.moneyfactory.gov/faqlibrary.html |archivedate= 5 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions were made for [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Salmon P. Chase|Salmon Chase]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. There have been no changes in the people depicted on currency intended for the general public since 1928; when [[Woodrow Wilson]] was depicted on the 1934 $100,000 [[gold certificate]], the note was only for internal Treasury and [[Federal Reserve Bank]] use.

Five people have been depicted on U.S. currency during their lifetime, with each of those depictions occurring during the [[American Civil War]]. [[Abraham Lincoln]] was portrayed on the 1861 $10 [[Demand Note]]; Salmon Chase, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, approved his own portrait for the 1862 $1 [[United States Note|Legal Tender Note]]; [[Winfield Scott]] was depicted on [[Interest Bearing Note]]s during the early 1860s; and [[Francis E. Spinner|Francis Spinner]] and [[Spencer M. Clark|Spencer Clark]] both approved the use of their own image on [[Fractional currency (United States)|fractional currency]]. In 1873, driven in large part by the actions of Spinner and Clark, Congress prohibited the use of portraits of living people on any U.S. bond, security, note, or fractional or postal currency.&lt;ref&gt;"Laws of the United States Relating to Loans and the Currency Including the Coinage Acts". Treasury Department, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key to banknote type abbreviations==
Many of the 53 individuals were depicted on more than one note of a series or denomination. In the description of the banknotes, the date in parentheses indicates the individual's first appearance on a given note type and denomination. When multiple banknotes are listed, the order, though seeming random, is in accordance with the Friedberg Number,&lt;ref name="Friedberg"&gt;Friedberg&lt;/ref&gt; in ascending Friedberg order.{{#tag:ref | Large size notes represent the earlier types or series of U.S. banknotes. Their "average" dimension is 7.375 x 3.125 inches (187 x 79&amp;nbsp;mm). Small size notes (described as such due to their size relative to the earlier large size notes) are an "average" 6.125 x 2.625 inches (156 x 67&amp;nbsp;mm), the size of modern U.S. currency. "Each measurement is +/- 0.08 inches (2mm) to account for margins and cutting".&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;| group="nb"}}{{#tag:ref | Exceptions to the large versus small categories are the CITN, IBN, and RC, all slightly larger than the large size note dimensions.| group="nb"}} The engraved portraits are from a virtual exhibit of bank notes&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Portraits on U.S. Bank Notes | publisher = The National Currency Foundation | url = http://nationalcurrencyfoundation.org/portraitgallery.html| accessdate = 25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are part of the [[National Numismatic Collection]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

[[File:Maimon-Marrans.jpg|thumb|300px|''Marranos: Secret [[Passover Seder|Seder]] in Spain during the times of inquisition'', an 1892 painting by [[Moshe Maimon]] ]]
'''Marranos''' were [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Jews]] living in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] who converted or were [[Forced conversion#Spanish Inquisition|forced to convert to Christianity]] during the Middle Ages, yet continued to [[Crypto-Judaism|practice Judaism in secret]]. 

The term specifically refers to the charge of Crypto-Judaism, whereas the term [[converso]] was used for the wider population of Jewish converts to Catholicism, whether or not they secretly still practised Jewish rites. Converts from either Judaism or Islam were referred to by the broader term of "[[New Christian]]s".

The term "marrano" came into later use in 1492 with the Castilian [[Alhambra Decree]]; it prohibited the practice of Judaism in Spain and required all remaining Jews to convert or leave. By then, the large majority of Jews in Spain had converted to Catholicism, and conversos numbered hundreds of thousands. They were closely monitored by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and subject to suspicions by Catholics of the secret practice of Judaism, also known as "Marranism". 

In modern use "marrano" is sometimes, but not always, considered offensive; and "crypto-Jew" is occasionally preferred in scholarly works.&lt;ref name="Primack"&gt;Karen Primack, "That Word 'Marrano'". Chapter 8 (pp. 55-58) in Karen Primack (ed.) ''Jews in Places You Never Thought Of'', KTAV Publishing House, Inc. (1998), {{ISBN|0881256080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:First Cemetery of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, Shearith Israel (1656-1833) in Manhattan, New York City.jpg|thumb|[[First Shearith Israel Graveyard|First Cemetery of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, Shearith Israel]] (1656–1833), in Manhattan, New York City]]
The origin of the term ''marrano'' as applied to Crypto-Jews is debatable, since there are at least three possible etymologies for the word. 

One source of the term derives from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|مُحَرّمٌ}} ''[[Haram|muḥarram]]''; meaning "forbidden, anathematized". ''Marrano'' in this context means "swine" or "pig", from the ritual [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|prohibition against eating pork]], practiced by both [[Jews]] and [[Muslim]]s. However, as applied to crypto-Jews, the term marrano may also derive from the Spanish verb "marrar" (of Germanic rather than Arabic origin) meaning "to deviate" or "to err", in the sense that they deviated from their newly adopted faith by secretly continuing to practice Judaism. A third origin has been cited from [[Galician-Portuguese]], where ''marrar'' means "to force" and ''marrano'' means "forced one," indicating the compulsory nature of the religious conversions.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

==Demographics==
Under state pressure in the late 14th and early 15th century, over half of Jews in the Iberian Peninsula converted to Christianity, thus avoiding the Decree of Expulsion which affected Spain's remaining openly Jewish population in 1492. The numbers who converted and the effects of various migrations in and out of the area have been the subject of historical debate. A [[Phylogeography|phylogeographic]] study in 2008 of 1,150 volunteer [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups]] appeared to support the idea that the number of forced conversions has been significantly underestimated, as 20% of the tested Iberian population had [[haplogroups]] consistent with [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] ancestry. This percentage was suggested as representing the proportion of Sephardi in the population at the time of mass conversions in the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Susan M. |last=Adams |first2=Elena |last2=Bosch |first3=Patricia L. |last3=Balaresque |year=2008 |title=The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=725–736 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.11.007 |pmid=19061982 |pmc=2668061|display-authors=etal|ref={{harvid|Adams, Bosch, et al.|2008}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authors concede that other historical population movements from the Near East such as Syrians and Phoenicians may also account for these results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adams, Bosch, et al.|2008}}: "Despite alternative possible sources for lineages ascribed a Sephardic Jewish origin, these proportions attest to a high level of religious conversion"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"La cifra de los sefardíes puede estar sobreestimada, ya que en estos genes hay mucha diversidad y quizá absorbieron otros genes de Oriente Medio" ''("The Sephardic result may be overestimated, since there is much diversity in those genes and maybe absorbed other genes from the Middle East")''. ¿Pone en duda Calafell la validez de los tests de ancestros?

==Portugal==
{{main|History of the Jews in Portugal}}
Some Portuguese ''conversos'' or ''cristãos-novos'' continued to practice as [[crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]]. In the early 20th century, historian Samuel Schwartz wrote about crypto-Jewish communities discovered in northeastern Portugal (namely, [[Belmonte, Portugal|Belmonte]], [[Bragança, Portugal|Bragança]], [[Miranda do Douro|Miranda]], and [[Chaves, Portugal|Chaves]]). He claimed that members had managed to survive more than four centuries without being fully assimilated into the Old Christian population.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Almog, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtVty.jhtml?sw=Russia&amp;itemNo=64697 "Cryptic, these crypto Jews"], nda, last update 02/12/2005, haaretz.com, in English; review of Hebrew translation of Schwarz's 1925 ''Hanotzrim Hakhadashim Beportugal Be'meah Ha'esrim'' (''New Christians in Portugal in the 20th Century'')&lt;/ref&gt; The last remaining crypto-Jewish community in Belmonte officially returned to Judaism in the 1970s and opened a [[synagogue]] in 1996. In 2003, the [[American Sephardi Federation]] founded the Belmonte Project to raise funds to acquire Judaic educational material and services for the Belmonte community, who then numbered 160–180.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Two documentary films are known to have been made in north-eastern Portugal where present day descendants of marranos were interviewed about their lives. In 1974 for ''The Marranos of Portugal'', the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) sent reporter [[Ron Ben-Yishai]] to carry out interviews with families about their religious practice. After being asked to prove he knew Hebrew before they would talk, he found people still reluctant to talk openly but did eventually gain a remarkable insight into their version of Jewish customs, prayers and songs. The film was commended at the 1976 Jerusalem Jewish Film and TV Festival. Another documentary, ''The Last Marranos'', was made by the New York Jewish Media Fund in 1997.

After the expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain (1492) and Portugal (1497), ''conversos'' continued to be suspect in times of social strain. In Lisbon in 1506, a months-long plague caused people to look for scapegoats. Some became suspicious that ''conversos'' might be practicing Judaism and therefore be at fault. On April 17, 1506, several ''conversos'' were discovered who had in their possession "some lambs and poultry prepared according to Jewish custom; also unleavened bread and bitter herbs according to the regulations for the [[Passover]], which festival they celebrated far into the night".  Officials seized several, but released them after a few days.

On the same day on which the ''conversos'' were freed, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] displayed a crucifix and a reliquary in glass from which a peculiar light issued in a side-chapel of their church, where several New Christians were present. A New Christian who tried to explain the miracle as due to natural causes was dragged from the church and killed by an infuriated woman. A Dominican roused the populace still more. Friar João Mocho and the [[Aragon]]ese friar Bernardo, crucifix in hand, were said to have gone through the streets of the city, crying "Heresy!" and calling upon the people to destroy the conversos.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Attracted by the outcry, sailors from [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]] and others from ships in the port of Lisbon, joined the Dominicans and formed a mob with local men to pursue the ''conversos''.

The mob dragged ''converso'' victims from their houses and killed some.  Old Christians who were in any way associated with New Christians were also attacked. The mob attacked the tax-farmer João Rodrigo Mascarenhas, a New Christian; although a wealthy and distinguished man, his work also made him resented by many. They demolished his house. Within 48 hours, many "conversos" were killed; by the third day all who could have escaped, often with the help of other Portuguese. The killing spree lasted from 19 to 21 April, in what came to be known as the [[Lisbon massacre]].

[[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel]] severely punished those who took part in the killings. The ringleaders and the Dominicans who encouraged the riot were also executed. Local people convicted of murder or pillage suffered corporal punishment and their property was confiscated.  The king granted religious freedom for 20 years to all ''conversos'' in an attempt at compensation. Lisbon lost ''[[Foral]]'' privileges. The foreigners who had taken part generally escaped punishment, leaving with their ships.

New Christians were attacked in Gouvea, [[Alentejo]], [[Olivenza|Olivença]], [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]], and other places. In the [[Azores]] and the island of [[Madeira]], mobs massacred former Jews. Because of these excesses, the king began to believe that a [[Portuguese Inquisition]] might help control such outbreaks.

The Portuguese ''conversos'' worked to forestall such actions, and spent immense sums to win over the ''[[Curia (Catholic Church)|Curia]]'' and most influential cardinals. Spanish and Portuguese conversos made financial sacrifices. Alfonso Gutierrez, Garcia Alvarez "el Rico" (the rich), and the Zapatas, conversos from Toledo, offered 80,000 gold crowns to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], if he would mitigate the harshness of the Inquisition (''Revue des Etudes Juives'', xxxvii, p.&amp;nbsp;270 et seq.).

The Mendes of Lisbon and [[Flanders]] also tried to help. None were successful in preventing Portugal from introducing the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Inquisition]] in 1478. The ''conversos'' suffered immensely both from mob violence and interrogation and testing by the Inquisition.  Attacks and murders were recorded at [[Trancoso, Portugal|Trancoso]], [[Lamego]], Miranda, [[Viseu]], [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]], and [[Braga]].

At [[Covilhã]], there were rumors that the people planned to massacre all the New Christians on one day. In 1562, prelates petitioned the ''Cortes'' to require ''conversos'' to wear special badges, and to order Jewish descendants to live in [[ghetto]]s (''judiarias'') in cities and villages as their ancestors had before the conversions.

==Spain==
{{main|History of the Jews in Spain}}

According to historian [[Cecil Roth]], Spanish political intrigues had earlier promoted the anti-Jewish policies which culminated in 1391, when Regent Queen [[Eleanor of Castile, Queen of Navarre|Leonora of Castile]] gave the Archdeacon of [[Écija]], [[Ferrand Martinez]], considerable power in her realm.  Martinez gave speeches that led to violence against the Jews, and this influence culminated in the sack of the Jewish quarter &lt;!--do we have a more specific link?--&gt; of [[Seville]] on June 4, 1391. Throughout Spain during this year, the cities of Ecija, [[Carmona, Spain|Carmona]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Barcelona]] and many others saw their Jewish quarters destroyed and inhabitants massacred.

It is estimated that 200,000 Jews saved their lives by converting to Christianity in the wake of these persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliah b. Jachia the Spaniard, ''Sefer Shalshelet HaKabbalah'', p. 268, Jerusalem 1962, while citing ''Sefer HaYuchasin''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jews left the country altogether and around 100,000 openly practicing Jews remained.

In 1449, feelings rose against ''conversos'', breaking out in a riot at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Instigated by two canons, Juan Alfonso and Pedro Lopez Galvez, the mob plundered and burned the houses of Alonso Cota, a wealthy converso and tax-farmer. They also attacked the residences of wealthy New Christians in the quarter of la Magdelena. Under Juan de la Cibdad, the conversos opposed the mob, but were repulsed. They were executed with their leader. As a result, several prominent converso men were deposed from office, in obedience to a new statute.

Nearly 20 years later in July 1467, another riot occurred where a mob attacked ''conversos'' in Toledo. The chief magistrate (''alcalde mayor'') of the city was Alvar Gomez de Cibdad Real, who had been private secretary to King [[Henry IV of Castile]]. He was a protector of the conversos.  Together with prominent conversos Fernando and Alvaro de la Torre, Alvar wished to take revenge for an insult by the counts de Fuensalida, leaders of the Old Christians. His intention was to seize control of the city, but fierce conflict erupted. Opponents set fire to houses of New Christians near the cathedral.  The conflagration spread so rapidly that 1,600 houses were consumed. Both Old Christians and conversos perished. The brothers De la Torre were captured and hanged.

Tensions arose in Córdoba between Old Christians and conversos, where they formed two hostile parties. On March 14, 1473, during a dedication procession, a girl accidentally threw dirty water from the window of the house of one of the wealthiest conversos (the customary way to dispose of it.) The water splashed on an image of the Virgin being carried in procession in honor of a new society (from which conversos had been excluded by Bishop D. Pedro.) A local blacksmith started arousing a rabble against the Jews, who he blamed for the insult, which immediately joined in a fierce shout for revenge.{{Dubious|date=April 2016}}

The mob went after conversos, denouncing them as [[heresy|heretics]], killing them, and burning their houses. To stop the excesses, the highly respected D. Alonso Fernandez de Aguilar, whose wife was a member of the converso family of Pacheco, together with his brother D. [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]] ("El Gran Capitán"), and a troop of soldiers, hastened to protect the [[New Christian]]s. D. Alonso called upon the mob to retire. Its leader insulted the count, who immediately felled him with his lance. Aroused, the people considered him a martyr. Incited by Alonso de Aguilar's enemy, they again attacked the conversos. The rioting lasted three days. Those who escaped sought refuge in the castle, where their protectors also took shelter. The government decreed that Jews and Conversos should remain in their neighborhood or leave the city.

In 1473, attacks on conversos arose in numerous other cities: [[Montoro]], [[Bujalance]], [[Adamuz]], [[La Rambla, Córdoba|La Rambla]], [[Santaella]], and elsewhere. Mobs attacked conversos in [[Andújar]], [[Úbeda]], [[Baeza]], and [[Almodóvar del Campo]] also. In [[Valladolid]], groups looted the belongings of the New Christians. At [[Segovia]], there was a massacre (May 16, 1474). D. Juan Pacheco, a converso, led the attacks. Without the intervention of the alcalde, Andres de Cabrera, all New Christians might have died. At [[Carmona, Spain|Carmona]], it was reported that not one converso was left alive.

===Inquisition===
[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|180px|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] in Mexico, 1601.]]

Tens of thousands of Jews were baptised in the three months before the deadline for expulsion, some 40,000 if one accepts the totals given by Kamen: most of these undoubtedly to avoid expulsion,{{citation needed|reason=I wouldn't be surprised but wording sounds rather like original research|date=November 2014}} rather than as a sincere change of faith. These ''conversos'' were the principal concern of the Inquisition; being suspected of continuing to practice Judaism put them at risk of denunciation and trial.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

During 1492, about 12,000 conversos entered [[Navarre]] from Aragon's repression, where they were allowed to remain. [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela in Navarre]] turned into a converso haven. The Tudelans had already proclaimed in 1486 that "''if any inquisitor enters their city, he will be thrown into the [[Ebro]] river.''" Later the resistance to the inquisitors was so strong that its aldermen ordered commissioners and attorneys to ask the [[Catholic Monarchs]] to limit the power of the Inquisition in 1510.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Salcedo Izu, Joaquín, Gran Enciclopedia Navarra, Caja de Ahorros de Navarra, Pamplona 1990, Tomo VI, voz Inquisición, pp. 131–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;González Echeverría, Francisco Javier ''The love for truth. Life and work of Michael Servetus (El amor a la verdad. Vida y obra de Miguel Servet)'', printed by Navarro y Navarro, Zaragoza, collaboration with the Government of Navarre, Department of Institutional Relations and Education of the Government of Navarre, pp.&amp;nbsp;445-450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/index.html Michael Servetus Research] Website with historical and graphical study on the conversos in Navarre, specifically the converso Michael de Villanueva ("Servetus").&lt;/ref&gt;

The most intense period of persecution of ''conversos'' lasted until 1530. From 1531 to 1560, however, the percentage of ''conversos'' among the Inquisition trials dropped to 3% of the total. There was a rebound of persecutions when a group of crypto-Jews was discovered in [[Quintanar de la Orden]] in 1588; and there was a rise in denunciations of ''conversos'' in the last decade of the sixteenth century. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, some ''conversos'' who had fled to Portugal began to return to Spain, fleeing the persecution of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], founded in 1536. This led to a rapid increase in the trials of crypto-Jews, among them a number of important financiers. In 1691, during a number of ''[[autos-da-fé]]'' in [[Majorca]], 37 ''chuetas'', or ''conversos'' of Majorca, were burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eighteenth century the number of ''conversos'' accused by the Inquisition decreased significantly. [[Manuel Santiago Vivar]], tried in Córdoba in 1818, was the last person tried for being a crypto-Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kamen|2014|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Converso-Jewish relations===
The ''conversos'' of Seville and other cities of Castile, and especially of Aragon, bitterly opposed the [[Spanish Inquisition]] established in 1478. They rendered considerable service to the king, and held high legal, financial, and military positions. The government issued an edict directing traditional Jews to live within a ghetto and be separated from ''conversos''. Despite the law, however, the Jews remained in communication with their [[New Christian]] brethren.

"They sought ways and means to win them from Catholicism and bring them back to Judaism. They instructed the Marranos in the tenets and ceremonies of the Jewish religion; held meetings in which they taught them what they must believe and observe according to the Mosaic law; and enabled them to circumcise themselves and their children. They furnished them with prayer-books; explained the fast-days; read with them the history of their people and their Law; announced to them the coming of the Passover; procured unleavened bread for them for that festival, as well as [[kosher]] meat throughout the year; encouraged them to live in conformity with the law of Moses, and persuaded them that there was no law and no truth except the Jewish religion." These were the charges brought by the government of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] against the Jews. They constituted the grounds for their expulsion and banishment in 1492, so they could not subvert conversos. Jews who did not want to leave Spain had to accept baptism as a sign of conversion.

The historian Henry Kamen's ''Inquisition and Society in Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries'' questions whether there were such strong links between conversos and Jewish communities.  Whilst historians such as Yitzhak Baer state, "the conversos and Jews were one people",&lt;ref name="Kamen pg 27"&gt;{{Citation |title=Inquisition and Society in Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries |first=Henry |last=Kamen |page=27 |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1985 |isbn=0-253-22775-5 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kamen claims, "Yet if the conversos were hated by the Christians, the Jews liked them no better."&lt;ref name="Kamen pg 27"/&gt; He documented that "Jews testified falsely against them [the conversos] when the Inquisition was finally founded."&lt;ref name="Kamen pg 27"/&gt; This issue is being debated by historians.

==Conversos in Italy==
Although the vast majority of Spain's 250,000 ''conversos'' abandoned Judaism and simply assimilated into Spain's dominant Catholic culture, many of those continuing to secretly practice their former religion felt threatened and persecuted by the Inquisition which continued to actively persecute heresy. Some of these chose to leave Spain, in bands or as individual refugees. Many migrated to Italy, attracted by the climate, which resembled that of the Iberian Peninsula, and by the kindred language. When they settled at [[Ferrara]], Duke [[Ercole I d'Este]] granted them privileges. His son [[Alfonso d'Este|Alfonso]] confirmed the privileges to twenty-one Spanish ''conversos'': physicians, merchants, and others (ib. xv. 113 et seq.). A thoroughly researched history of these migrations is also contained in the book about one of their leaders called, "The Woman Who Defied Kings", by the historian and journalist Andree Aelion Brooks.

Spanish and Portuguese ''conversos'' also settled at [[Florence]] and contributed to make [[Livorno]] a leading seaport. They received privileges at [[Venice]], where they were protected from the persecutions of the Inquisition. At [[Milan]], they materially advanced the interests of the city by their industry and commerce. At [[Bologna]], [[Pisa]], [[Naples]] and numerous other Italian cities, they freely exercised the Jewish religion again. They were soon so numerous that Fernando de Goes Loureiro, an abbot from [[Oporto]], filled an entire book with the names of ''conversos'' who had drawn large sums from Portugal and had openly avowed Judaism in Italy.

In [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], Duke [[Emmanuel Philibert]] of [[Savoy]] welcomed ''conversos'' from [[Coimbra|Coímbra]] and granted them commercial and industrial privileges, as well as the free exercise of their religion. Rome was full of ''conversos''. Pope [[Paul III]] received them at [[Ancona]] for commercial reasons. He granted complete liberty "to all persons from Portugal and [[Algarve]], even if belonging to the class of New Christians." By 1553, three thousand Portuguese Jews and ''conversos'' were living at Ancona.

Two years later, [[Pope Paul IV]] issued orders to have all the ''conversos'' in Italy be thrown into the prisons of the Inquisition which he had instituted. Sixty of them, who acknowledged the Catholic faith as penitents, were transported to the island of [[Malta]]; twenty-four, who adhered to Judaism, were publicly burned (May 1556). Those who escaped the Inquisition were received at [[Pesaro]] by [[Guidobaldo II della Rovere]], Duke of Urbino. Guidobaldo had hoped to have the Jews and ''conversos'' of Turkey select Pesaro as a commercial center; when that did not happen, he expelled the New Christians from Pesaro and other districts in 1558 (ib. xvi. 61 et seq.).

Many ''conversos'' also went to [[Dubrovnik]], formerly a considerable [[Croatia]]n seaport on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled with Portuguese refugees.

==Latin America==
{{main|History of the Jews in Latin America|History of the Jews in Mexico|History of the Jews in Brazil}}
During the 16th and 17th centuries, some ''conversos'' migrated to [[Americas|the Americas]], often the Castilian territories of the Viceroyalties of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] (North and Central America) and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] (South America and [[White Colombians|Colombia]]). Legal emigration to the New World was strictly controlled and required proof of three generations of Christian ascendance. Nevertheless, many Conversos managed to evade these restrictions and managed to obtain encomiendas in the New World.

==France==
{{main|History of the Jews in France}}
According to [[Isidore Loeb]], in a special study of the subject in the ''[[Revue des Études Juives]]'' (xiv. 162–183), about 3,000 Jews came to Provence after the [[Alhambra Decree]] expelled Jews from Spain in 1492.

From 1484, one town after another had called for expulsion, but the calls were rejected by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. However, [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], in one of his first acts as king in 1498, issued a general expulsion order of the Jews of Provence. Though not enforced at the time, the order was renewed in 1500 and again in 1501. On this occasion, it was definitively implemented. The Jews of Provence were given the option of conversion to Christianity and a number chose that option. However, after a short while – if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the Jews – the king imposed a special tax, referred to as "the tax of the neophytes." These converts and their descendants soon became the objects of social discrimination and slanders.&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0016_0_16137.html Jewish Virtual Library – Provence]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migrations==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
There was no significant wave of emigration of ''conversos'' from Spain, the majority of Sephardic communities, such as that of Salonika having been formed as a result of the Alhambra Decree in 1492.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Henry Kamen: The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there was a steady trickle of crypto-Jewish marranos who wished to practice their faith freely to more liberal environments. One of their leaders who helped them get there was the Lisbon-born international banker, [[Gracia Mendes Nasi]]. They also migrated to [[Flanders]], where they were attracted by its flourishing cities, such as [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] and [[Brussels]]. ''Conversos'' from Flanders, and others direct from the Iberian Peninsula, went under the guise of Catholics to [[Hamburg]] and [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] about 1580, where they [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg|established a community]] and held commercial relations with their former homes.  Some migrated as far as [[Scotland]]. [[Christian IV of Denmark]] invited some New Christian families to settle at [[Glückstadt]] about 1626, granting certain privileges to them and to ''conversos'' who came to [[Emden]] about 1649.

The vast majority of Spain's ''conversos'', however, remained in Spain and Portugal and were suspected of "Marranism" by the Spanish Inquisition. Although the wealthier among them could easily bypass discriminatory ''[[Limpieza de sangre]]'' laws, they constituted a significant portion of the over three thousand people executed for heresy by the Spanish Inquisition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The New Christians of Portugal breathed more freely when [[Philip III of Spain]] came to the throne. By the law of April 4, 1601, he granted them the privilege of unrestricted sale of their real estate as well as free departure from the country for themselves, their families, and their property. Many, availing themselves of this permission, followed their coreligionists to North Africa and Turkey. After a few years, however, the privilege was revoked, and the Inquisition resumed its activity.

Some migrated to London, whence their families spread to Brazil (where ''conversos'' had settled at an early date) and other colonies in the Americas. Migrations to [[Constantinople]] and [[Thessaloniki]], where Jewish refugees had settled after the expulsion from Spain, as well as to [[Italy]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Vienna]], and [[Timișoara]], continued into the middle of the 18th century.{{citation needed|reason=As far as I'm aware there were no migrations of Conversos out of Spain in the 18th century and few in the 17th century, by that time they had been largely assimilated|date=May 2016}}

==Today==
Late 20th century political and social changes in Spain caused reappraisal of Jewish and Muslim contributions to its culture. There has been much new scholarship on Sephardic Jews, Moors and the consequences of conversion and expulsion. In addition, there have been official governmental efforts to welcome tourists of both ancestries to Spain. Towns and regions have worked to preserve elements of Jewish and Moorish pasts.

By Spanish Civil Code Art. 22.1, the government created concessions for gaining citizenship to nationals of several countries and [[Sephardi Jews]] historically linked with Spain, allowing them to seek citizenship after five years rather than the customary ten required for residence in Spain. Later it was dropped to two years. In November 2012, the residency requirement was eliminated completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.udg.edu/normacivil/estatal/CC/1T1.htm ''Código Civil''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, the [[Parliament of Andalusia]] asked the three parliamentary groups that form the majority to support an amendment that would similarly ease the way for nationals of [[Morisco]] descent to gain Spanish citizenship. The proposal was originally made by IULV-CA, the Andalusian branch of the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.ya.com/local/andalucia/07/10/2006/mesa-propuesta-iu.html ''Propuesta de IU sobre derecho preferente de moriscos a la nacionalidad''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211014807/http://noticias.ya.com/local/andalucia/07/10/2006/mesa-propuesta-iu.html |date=2008-12-11 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Shlomo Moshe Amar]] traveled to Portugal to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the [[Lisbon]] synagogue Shaare Tikvah. During his stay, Shlomo Moshe Amar met descendants of Jewish families persecuted by the Inquisition who still practice Judaism (Bnei [[Anusim]]) at the house of rabbi Boaz Pash. This was an historical meeting that had not happened between a Chief Rabbi and Portuguese marranos (Bnei Anusim) in centuries. Rabbi Shlomo Moshe Amar promised to create a committee to evaluate the Halachic situation of the community. The delay of the Chief Rabbi to create the committee and help the descendents of [[Sephardi]] Jews in Portugal forced the creation of a second Jewish community in Lisbon, Comunidade Judaica Masorti Beit Israel, to ensure the recognition of the Bnei Anussim as Jews.

[[File:Würzburg - Martin-von-Wagner-Museum (Schild).JPG|thumb|Sign of the Museum]]
[[File:Wuerzburger Residenz vom Hofgarten.jpg|thumb|The [[Würzburg Residence]], in which the Museum is located.]]
The '''Martin von Wagner Museum''' contains the art collection of the [[University of Würzburg]] and has been located in the south wing of the [[Würzburg Residence]] since 1963. It is among the largest university museums in Europe.

== History ==
The collection, founded in 1832 as ''Ästhetisches Attribut'' was first substantially extended by the art collection of [[Johann Martin von Wagner]] (1777-1858) who was active as an artist and archaeologist and also as artistic agent for the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]]. Because of this, the museum adopted the name of von Wagner. Since 1963 the museum has been located in the south wing of the Würzburg Residence.

== Collections ==
The Museum contains a collection of antiquities, an [[art gallery]] and a [[graphic collection]].

=== Antiquities ===
[[File:Aineias Aphrodite Martin-von-Wagner-Museum L793.jpg|thumb|left|[[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] [[amphora]] in the Museum's collection (L 793)]]
The collection of antiquities includes artworks and antiquities of the [[Mediterranean]] from the third century BC until [[Late Antiquity]]. Works from [[Ancient Greece]] are the focus, but the collection also includes material from [[Imperial Rome]], the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Near East]]ern cultures (e.g. the [[Aegean civilizations]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]]). The collection of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] is particularly significant - it is among the three largest collections of Greek vases in [[Germany]], containing around five thousand objects and documents Greek pottery from the [[Mycenaean pottery|Mycenaean]] period through to the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic period]]. Important items include the [[Mamarce Oinochoe]], the [[Four seasons altar of Würzburg]] and the [[Brygos Cup of Würzburg]].

=== Art gallery ===

The art gallery contains [[German art|German]], [[Dutch art|Dutch]] and [[Italian art|Italian]] paintings from the fifteenth century to the twentieth century, including pictures by [[Hans Leonhard Schäufelein]], [[Bartholomäus Spranger]], [[Pieter Claesz]], [[Luca Giordano]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], [[Friedrich Overbeck]], [[Carl Rottmann]], [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[August von Brandis]] and [[Hans Purrmann]]. This section also contains the collection of [[sculpture]]. Notable among these are works of [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] and his school.

=== Graphic collection ===
The graphic collection contains some eleven thousand sketches and fourteen thousand prints. These include, among others, [[copper engraving]]s and [[woodcut]]s of [[Albrecht Dürer]], sketches by [[Federico Barocci]] and drawings by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and his son [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]].

The '''Nationalist Front of Mexico''' ({{lang-es|Frente Nacionalista de México}}), formerly known as the '''Organization for the National Will''' ({{lang-es|Organización por la Voluntad Nacional}}) and the '''Mexicanist Nationalist Front''' ({{lang-es|Frente Nacional Mexicanista}}), is a [[far-right]] Mexican [[nationalism|nationalist]] group, known for its use of [[Falangism| Falangist]] paraphernalia. Since its formation in 2006, the Nationalist Front of Mexico claims it was formed by people coming from different political tendencies, social positions and cultural backgrounds who fight legally and peacefully for the national renewal of their country and for the unity of the Mexican nation.

==Beliefs==
[[File:protesta-fnm.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Supporters of the Nationalist Front of Mexico and other far-right protesters in Mexico City, 2010.]]
[[File:Political divisions of Mexico 1821 (location map scheme).svg|thumb|250px|left|A map showing the [[First Mexican Empire]] at its greatest extent and borders the Nationalist Front of Mexico advocates a return to.]]
The organization opposes what it sees as "Anglo"-U.S. culture and influences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=201871|title=Neonazismo a la Mexicana|trans-title=Neonazism, Mexican style|work=[[Revista Proceso]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rejects the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], as well as what its members consider the "American occupation" of territory formerly belonging to [[Mexico]] and now form the [[southwestern United States]].

On its website, the front states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We reject the occupation of our nation in its northern territories, an important cause of poverty and emigration. We demand that our claim to all the territories occupied by force by the United States be recognized in our Constitution, and we will bravely defend, according to the principle of self-determination to all peoples, the right of the Mexican people to live in the whole of our territory within its historical borders, as they existed and were recognized at the moment of our independence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenamex.net/programa/|title=Loading...|website=www.frenamex.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, it promotes the reincorporation of [[Central America]] to [[First Mexican Empire|Mexico]], advocates the [[Second Mexican Empire]], and deplores the establishment of the republic, which it considers decadent and against the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contralinea.info/archivo-revista/index.php/2011/09/18/nazis-cristeros/|title=Nazis cristeros|trans-title=Christian Nazis|work=[[Revista Contralínea]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the group has gained notoriety for honoring [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] and conservatives of the 19th century such as [[Miguel Miramón]] and [[Tomás Mejía Camacho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2014/07/01/opinion/004o1pol |title=Astillero |work=[[Periódico La Jornada]]|date=2014-06-30|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideologically, it proposes a [[distributism|distributist]] economy, [[fascist socialization|socialization]] and the [[Third Position|Third-Positionist]] ideology as an alternative to both communism and capitalism. The group also wants Mexico to withdraw from the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America]] (SPP), [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and the [[World Bank]].

Also, the movement believes to have a strong alliance with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], due to the CSA being anti-USA.

==Extremist reputation==
In its official website, the organization declares its opposition to all forms of violence and states that its primary goal is to win Mexicans' approval and adherence to their nationalist points of view. However, the front held protests in various cities to demand the immediate expulsion of Haitian and African immigrants who flooded Mexico's borders in the fall of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/10/11/us-mexican-governments-helping-haitian-migrants-enter-country-lawmaker-says/|title=U.S., Mexican governments helping Haitian migrants enter country, lawmaker says |work=[[Fox News Latino]]|date=2016-10-11|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of the front have also made open calls for Mexicans to join in their struggle against foreigners, sexual minorities and leftists. Human right advocates in Mexico raised their concerns about the group's rhetoric and increasing popularity among the youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrantologos.mx/es/convocatorias/189-comunicado-urgente-sobre-migrantes-haitianos-y-africanos-en-mexico-red-integra-sobre-discriminacion-racismo-y-xenofobia-11-de-octubre-2016  //|title=COMUNICADO URGENTE sobre migrantes Haitianos y Africanos en México|date=2016-10-11|language=Spanish|publisher=Migrantólogos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not a political party and thus cannot nominate candidates directly.

{{About|the region mentioned in the Bible|other uses|Ophir (disambiguation)}}

'''Ophir''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|f|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ophir "Ophir"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Hebrew Name|אוֹפִיר|Ofir|ʼÔp̄îr}}) is a port or region mentioned in the [[Bible]], famous for its wealth. [[King Solomon]] received a cargo from Ophir every three years,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} which consisted of gold, silver, [[sandalwood]], pearls, [[ivory]], apes, and [[peacock]]s.{{sfn|Schroff, The Periplus of the Erythræan Sea|1912|p=41}}

==Biblical references==
Ophir in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10 (the [[Table of Nations]]) is said to be the name of one of the sons of [[Joktan]].{{efn|This is also stated in ''[[1 Chronicles]] 1:22''}} The [[Books of Kings]] and [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] tell of a joint expedition to Ophir by King Solomon and the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] king [[Hiram I]] from [[Ezion-Geber]], a port on the [[Red Sea]], that brought back large amounts of gold, precious stones and '[[Algum|algum wood]]' and of a later failed expedition by king [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah.{{efn|The first expedition is described in ''[[1 Kings]] 9:28; 10:11; [[1 Chronicles]] 29:4; [[2 Chronicles]] 8:18; 9:10'', the failed expedition of Jehoshaphat in ''[[1 Kings]] 22:48''}}  The famous 'gold of Ophir' is referenced in several other books of the Hebrew Bible.{{efn|''[[Book of Job]] 22:24; 28:16; [[Psalms]] 45:9; [[Isaiah]] 13:12''}}

In [[Septuagint]], other variants of the name are mentioned: ''Ōpheír'', ''Sōphír'', ''Sōpheír'' and ''Souphír''.{{sfn|Mahdi, The Dispersal of Austronesian boat forms in the Indian Ocean|1999|p=154}}

The [[New Testament apocrypha]] book ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' contains a passage: "And the children of Ophir, that is, Send, appointed to be their king Lophoron, who built Ophir with stones of gold; now, all the stones that are in Ophir are of gold."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book of The Cave of Treasures by Ephrem the Syrian: Translated from the Syriac Text of The British Museum|last=Badge|first=William|publisher=The Religious Tract Society|year=1927|isbn=|location=London|publication-date=|pages=32|translator-last=|translator-first=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
In 1946 an [[Ostracon|inscribed pottery shard]] was found at [[Tell Qasile]] (in modern-day [[Tel Aviv]]) dating to the eighth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Maisler, B., ''Two Hebrew Ostraca from Tell Qasîle'', Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 10, No. 4 (Oct., 1951), p. 265 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/542173]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, John, ''The Prehistory of the Balkans: The Middle East and the Aegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries B.C., Part 1'', Cambridge University Press, 1982, p. 480 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&amp;pg=PA480]&lt;/ref&gt; It bears, in [[Paleo-Hebrew]] script, the text "''gold of Ophir to/for Beth-Horon [...] 30 [[shekel]]s''"{{efn|Beth-Horon probably refers to the [[Bethoron|ancient city]] 35 km south of Tell Qasile; another interpretation is that Beth-Horon means 'the temple of Horon', (a Canaanite deity also known as Hauron), see {{harvtxt|Lipiński|2004|p=197}}}}&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Kenneth A.; Handy, Lowell K. (ed.), ''The Age of Solomon: Scholarship at the Turn of the Millennium'', BRILL 1997, p. 144 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gam10TAOZusC&amp;pg=PA144]&lt;/ref&gt; The find confirms that Ophir was a place where gold was imported from.{{sfn|Lipiński|2004|p=144}}

==Theorized or conjectural locations==

===India===
''A Dictionary of the Bible'' by [[Sir William Smith]], published in 1863,&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, William, ''A dictionary of the Bible'', Hurd and Houghton, 1863 (1870), pp.1441&lt;/ref&gt; notes the Hebrew word for parrot ''Thukki'', derived from the Classical Tamil for peacock ''Thogkai'' and Cingalese "tokei",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/peacock.html Smith's Bible Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; joins other Classical Tamil words for ivory, cotton-cloth and apes preserved in the Hebrew Bible. This theory of Ophir's location in [[Tamilakkam]] is further supported by other historians.&lt;ref&gt;Ramaswami, Sastri, ''The Tamils and their culture'', Annamalai University, 1967, pp.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, James, ''Tamil lexicography'', M. Niemeyer, 1991, pp.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fernandes, Edna, ''The last Jews of Kerala'', Portobello, 2008, pp.98&lt;/ref&gt; Locations on the coast of Kerala conjectured to be Ophir include [[Poovar]] and [[Beypore]].&lt;ref name="Menon1967"&gt;{{citation |last=Menon |first=A. Sreedhara |title=A Survey of Kerala History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7WaZe2PBy8C |year=1967 |publisher=Sahitya Pravarthaka Co-operative Society &amp;#91;Sales Department&amp;#93;; National Book Stall |p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aiyangar2004"&gt;{{citation |last=Aiyangar |first=Sakkottai Krishnaswami |title=Ancient India: Collected Essays on the Literary and Political History of Southern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htArUg0OMpcC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2004 |origyear=first published 1911 |publisher=Asian Educational Services |isbn=978-81-206-1850-3 |pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the 19th century [[Max Müller]] and other scholars identified Ophir with [[Abhira Kingdom|Abhira]], near the [[Indus River]] in modern-day state of [[Gujarat]], [[India]]. According to Benjamin Walker Ophir is said to have been a town of the [[Abhira tribe]].&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{citation |last=Walker |first=Benjamin |title=Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iGjXAAAAMAAJ |year=1968 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Biblical scholars, archaeologists and others have tried to determine the exact location of Ophir. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s companion [[Thomé Lopes|Tomé Lopes]] reasoned that Ophir would have been the ancient name for [[Great Zimbabwe]] in [[Zimbabwe]], the main center of sub-African trade in gold in the Renaissance period — though the ruins at Great Zimbabwe are now dated to the medieval era, long after Solomon is said to have lived. The identification of Ophir with [[Sofala]] in Mozambique was mentioned by [[John Milton|Milton]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (11:399-401), among many other works of literature and science.

Another, more serious, possibility is the African shore of the [[Red Sea]], with the name perhaps being derived from the [[Afar (ethnicity)|Afar]] people living in the [[Danakil desert]] ([[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]]) between [[Adulis]] and [[Djibouti]].

[[Afri]] was a Latin name used to refer to the [[Punics|Carthaginians]], who dwelt in [[North Africa]], in modern-day [[Tunisia]]. This name, that later gave the rich [[Roman province of Africa]] and the subsequent medieval [[Ifriqiya]], are from which the name of the continent [[Africa]] is ultimately derived, seems to have referred to a native [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] tribe originally, however, see [[Terence#Biography|Terence]] for discussion. The name is usually connected with [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''afar'', "dust", but a 1981 hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://michel-desfayes.org/namesofcountries.html Names of countries], Decret and Fantar, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; has asserted that it stems from the [[Berber language|Berber]] word ''ifri'' (plural ''ifran'') meaning "cave", in reference to cave dwellers.&lt;ref name="book on ligne"&gt;The Berbers, by Geo. Babington Michell, p 161, 1903, Journal of the Royal African Society [https://www.jstor.org/pss/714549 book on ligne]&lt;/ref&gt; This is proposed&lt;ref name="book on ligne"/&gt; to be the origin of ''Ophir'' as well.{{sfn|Lipiński|2004|p=200}}

===Americas===
The theologian [[Benito Arias Montano]] (1571) proposed finding Ophir in the name of [[Peru]], reasoning that the native Peruvians were thus descendants of Ophir and Shem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shalev|first1=Zur|title=Sacred Geography, Antiquarianism and Visual Erudition: Benito Arias Montano and the Maps in the Antwerp Polyglot Bible|journal=Imago Mundi|date=2003|volume=55|page=71|doi=10.1080/0308569032000097495|url=http://research.haifa.ac.il/~zshalev/Articles/IMundi-2003-Montano.pdf|accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other assumptions===
In 1568 [[Alvaro Mendaña]] became the first European to discover the [[Solomon Islands]], and named them as such because he believed them to be Ophir.&lt;ref&gt;HOGBIN, H.

In Jewish tradition, Ophir is often associated with a place in [[India]],{{efn|Fourteenth-century biblical commentator, [[Nathanel ben Isaiah]], writes: "''And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab'' (Gen. 10:29), these are the tracts of countries in the east, being those of the first [[clime]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben Isaiah |first=N.|author-link=Nethanel ben Isaiah |title=Sefer Me'or ha-Afelah |publisher=Mechon Moshe |translator=[[Yosef Qafih]] |volume= |edition= |date=1983|location=Kiryat Ono |page=74 |language=Hebrew |url= |doi= |id= |isbn= |jfm= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and which first clime, according to [[al-Biruni]], the sub-continent of India falls entirely therein.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Sharma, ''Mughal Arcadia: Persian Literature in an Indian Court'', [[Harvard University Press]]: Cambridge 2017, p.

The travel guide started from the Cape of Good Hope in Africa to India, to Burma, to Sumatra, to Moluccas, to Borneo, to Sulu, to China, then finally Ophir which is said to be the [[Philippines]]. While all other probable locations of Ophir are based on expert opinion, this is the only probable location with documentary support.

'''OsmAnd'''{{pronunciation needed|date=February 2015}} (OpenStreetMap Automated Navigation Directions) is a map and navigation app for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osmand.net/blog.html?id=osmand-ios |title=OsmAnd for iPhone is released}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the [[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM) map database for its primary displays, but is an independent app not endorsed by the [[OpenStreetMap Foundation]]. It is available in both free and paid versions; the latter unlocks the download limit for offline maps and provides access to Wikipedia points of interest [[Point of interest|(POIs)]] and their descriptions from within the app.

==Features==
OsmAnd (OSM Automated Navigation Directions) is a map and navigation application with access to the free and worldwide OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theappzine.com/content/osmand-maps-genius-and-helpful-maps-app|title=OsmAnd Maps: a genius and helpful MapsApp|date=May 31, 2015|publisher=theappzine.com
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All map data can be stored on the device's memory card for offline use. Via the device's GPS, OsmAnd offers routing, with visual and voice guidance, for car, bike, and pedestrian. All the main functionalities work both online and offline.

The '''Oxford Historical Society''' ('''OHS''') is a [[text publication society]] concerned with the [[history]] of the city of [[Oxford]] and the surrounding area in the historic county of [[Oxfordshire]] in southern [[England]].

== History ==
The Oxford Historical Society was founded in 1884 by a group of [[Oxford University]] dons in memory of the Revd [[John Richard Green]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~uzdh0149/ohs/history/ History of the Oxford Historical Society]'', Oxford Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The society formally became a charity in 2003. 

== Aims ==
The OHS exists to publish [[archive]]s, historical texts, bibliographical tools and studies about the city and University of Oxford, and the neighbouring villages and towns in [[Oxfordshire]] (as it was before 1972).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~uzdh0149/ohs/aims/ Aims of the Oxford Historical Society]'', Oxford Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The society seeks out materials from a wide variety of sources for its research. It has published around 140 volumes on the history of Oxford and Oxfordshire, especially concentrating on early records.

The Society is administered by a committee of trustees from the University and city of Oxford.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2155">'''Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 102''' ('''P. Oxy. 102''' or '''P. Oxy. I 102''') is a lease of land, written in [[Greek language|Greek]] and discovered in [[Oxyrhynchus]]. The manuscript was written on [[papyrus]] in the form of a sheet. The document was written 13 October 306. Currently it is housed in the [[British Museum]] (766) in [[London]].&lt;ref name = Oxy&gt;[http://163.1.169.40/cgi-bin/library?e=d-000-00---0POxy--00-0-0--0prompt-10---4----ded--0-1l--1-en-50---20-about-P.Oxy.I+0100--00031-001-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=POxy&amp;cl=CL5.1.1&amp;d=HASH018aae267b75be42f0f99ba9 P. Oxy. 102] at the Oxyrhynchus Online&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The document is a lease of 9 ''[[Arura|arourae]]'' of land, near the village of Sestoplelo in the middle [[toparchy]]. The land was owned by Aurelia Antiochia and leased to Aurelius Dioscorus for one year. The land was to be sown with [[flax]]. The rent was 1 [[Attic talent|talent]] and 3500 [[drachma]]e for the year. Although the papyrus was written on 6 October 306, it mentions the fifteenth year of the reign of [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius I]], which he did not attain, having died in July of that year. Grenfell and Hunt speculate that the [[scribe]] was unaware of the emperor's death. The measurements of the fragment are 250 by 140 mm.&lt;ref name = OPI&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2463">'''Patrick Francis Marsden''' (November 8, 1936 &amp;ndash; April 27, 2006) was a [[Canadian]] sportscaster and voice of the [[Canadian Football League]] play-by-play coverage in the 1970s and 1980s. He also worked as host for the historic 1972 Canada-Soviet Union hockey [[Summit Series]] sports telecasts. He was inducted into the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] in 1989.

Marsden was born in [[Ottawa]] and attended [[St. Patrick's High School (Ottawa)|St. Patrick's High School]] and the [[University of Ottawa]], where he started his sportscasting career at local station [[CIWW (AM)|CKOY]]. 

He later became sports director at [[CFTO-TV|CFTO]] in [[Toronto]], and became immersed in all local and national sporting events. He even appeared as "John Marsden" in an episode of ''[[Bizarre (TV series)|Bizarre]]'' (filmed at CFTO), in a [[Super Dave Osborne]] [[stunt]] at Toronto's [[CN Tower]]. 

Fired in 1986 after a physical altercation with his boss Ted Stuebing, Marsden then was hired by his [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] football broadcasting partner Bill Stephenson at [[CFRB]], went to [[The Sports Network|TSN]], and later surfaced at [[CJCL|The Fan 590]]. After helping to rebuild and essentially help create the image for The Fan 590, he retired in 2004.

Marsden spent most of his time in [[Florida]] due to what he felt was the ''socialization of Canadian society'', but he continued to maintain a home in [[Toronto]]. 

He returned in 1996 to live in [[Toronto]] with his family joining him and died of [[lung cancer]] on April 27, 2006, aged 69, at [[Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre]].

The '''Procession Kiosk''' ({{lang-tr|Alay Köşkü}}) is a 16th-century historical building on the outer walls of the [[Gülhane Park]] next to [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul, Turkey]]. It was used by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultans to receive the salute of processing [[janissary]] as well as a pleasure locale. The building is situated across the [[Sublime Porte]].

In 2011, the building was transferred to the [[Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar Literature Museum Library]] .&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;

The '''progressive stack''' is a &lt;!--!!READ BEFORE EDITING!!, before changing the article to say progressive stacking is racist, please gain consensus by discussing the issue on the talk page first--&gt;technique used to give [[marginalized groups]] a greater chance to speak.&lt;ref name=penny&gt;{{cite news|last=Penny|first=Laurie|title=Protest By Consensus|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2011/10/spain-movement-square-world|accessdate=11 November 2011|newspaper=[[New Statesman]]|date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is sometimes an introduction to, or stepping stone to, [[consensus decision-making]] in which simple majorities have less power.

The progressive stack technique attempts to counter what its proponents believe is a flaw in traditional representative democracy, where the majority is heard while the minority or non-dominant groups are silenced or ignored.&lt;ref name=penny/&gt; In practice, "majority culture" is interpreted by progressive stack practitioners to mean [[White people]], [[men]] and young adults, while non-dominant groups include [[women]], people who are [[LGBT culture|lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender]], [[people of color]], and very young or older people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mott|first=Meg|title=Wicca roots|url=http://www.reformer.com/ci_19286528?source=most_viewed|accessdate=11 November 2011|newspaper=[[Brattleboro Reformer]]|date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Quattrochi |first=Gina |title=When the System Itself is the Problem: Trans women anarchists share Occupy Wall Street message |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109071714/http://anarchistnews.org/node/19566 |archivedate=9 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |url=http://www.gaycitynews.com/articles/2011/11/09/gay_city_news/news/doc4ebace95a0c26985577656.txt |newspaper=Gay City News |date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "stack" in the [[Occupy movement]] is the list of speakers who are commenting on proposals or asking questions in public meetings. Anyone can request to be added to the stack. In meetings that don't use the progressive stack, people speak in the order they were added to the [[queue area|queue]]. In meetings that use the progressive stack, people from non-dominant groups are allowed to speak before people from dominant groups, by [[facilitator]]s, or stack-keepers, [[Cutting in line#Sanctioned line cutting|urging speakers to "step forward, or step back"]] based on which racial, age, or gender group they belong to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seltzer|first=Sarah|title=Where Are the Women at Occupy Wall Street?|url=http://www.truth-out.org/where-are-women-occupy-wall-street/1319895284|accessdate=11 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Nation]]|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A. Barton Hinkle, a columnist for the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'', has expressed the opinion that "lining up speakers by race and gender might not seem fair on an individual level", and suggests that proponents of the progressive stack care more about class struggle than individual concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle|first=A.

Among those opposed to the concept of "progressive stack", conservative journalist and author [[Jim Goad]] commented satirically on the concept in these terms: "The concept of intersectionality is also related to the "progressive stack," which assumes that white males at all times bear noxious degrees of unearned power, which is why they have to get to the back of the line and let all the legless black lesbians speak first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://takimag.com/article/cannibalism_among_the_oppressed_jim_goad/print#axzz4Voo9xjsQ|title=Cannibalism Among the Oppressed|first=Jim|last=Goad|website=Taki's Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8665">The '''protection of sources''', sometimes also referred to as the '''confidentiality of sources''' or in the U.S. as the '''[[reporter's privilege]]''', is a right accorded to journalists under the laws of many countries, as well as under [[international law]]. It prohibits authorities, including the courts, from compelling a journalist to reveal the identity of an anonymous source for a story. The right is based on a recognition that without a strong guarantee of anonymity, many would be deterred from coming forward and sharing information of public interests with journalists. As a result, problems such as corruption or crime might go undetected and unchallenged, to the ultimate detriment of society as a whole.  In spite of any such legal protections, the pervasive use of traceable electronic communications by journalists and their sources provides governments with a tool to determine the origin of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/a-high-tech-war-on-leaks.html?hpw=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=A High-Tech War on Leaks |last=Liptak |first=Adam |publisher=New York Times |date=February 11, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A famous instance of the use of an anonymous source is the series of articles by ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] which uncovered the [[Watergate Scandal]], ultimately leading to the resignation of US President [[Richard Nixon]]. Woodward and Bernstein relied extensively on information provided by someone known to the world only under the nickname [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]. Woodward and Bernstein were not forced to invoke the protection of sources, since the US authorities made no attempt to uncover the identity of "Deep Throat". In 2005  [[W. Mark Felt]], who at the time had been Associate Director of the [[United States|US]] [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], revealed that he was "Deep Throat".

An example of the legal operation of the right is the case of Bart Mos and Joost de Haas, of the Dutch daily ''[[De Telegraaf]]''. In an article in January 2006, the two journalists alleged the existence of a [[News leak|leak]] in the [[Military Intelligence and Security Service Netherlands|Dutch secret services]] and quoted from what they claimed was an official dossier on Mink Kok, a notorious criminal. They further alleged that the dossier in question had fallen into the hands of Kok himself. A subsequent police investigation led to the [[prosecution]] of Paul H., an agent accused of selling the file in question. Upon motions by the prosecution and the defence, the investigative judge in the case ordered the disclosure of the source for the news story, on the grounds that it was necessary to safeguard [[national security]] and ensure a [[fair trial]] for H. The two journalists were subsequently detained for refusing to comply with the disclosure order, but were released on [[appeal]] after three days, on November 30. [[The Hague]] district court considered that the national security interest served by the order was minor and should not prevail over the protection of sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/30/europe/EU_GEN_Netherlands_Journalists_Released.php 'Dutch court releases 2 reporters jailed for refusing to reveal their sources'], ''International Herald Tribune'', November 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era of telecommunications, journalists' ability to protect their sources increasingly depends on the adequacy of the [[Information security|computer and communications security measures]] they employ. In June 2010, [[Bill Keller]], then the executive editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', and Alan Rusbridger, editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'', discussed classified cables provided to them by [[WikiLeaks]] over a non-encrypted international telephone line. The Times did not have a readily available means of secure telecommunications for dealing with such matters, despite its history of dealing with whistle-blowers in reporting stories like [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|the interception of international calls made by Americans by the National Security Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/opinion/without-computer-security-sources-secrets-arent-safe-with-journalists.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion&amp;pagewanted=print |title=When Secrets Aren’t Safe With Journalists |last=Soghoian |first=Christopher |work=The New York Times |date=October 27, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
Various authorities in international law point to a recognition that a right to protection of sources is implicit in the right to [[freedom of expression]].

In '''Europe''', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] stated in the 1996 case of ''Goodwin v. United Kingdom'' that "[p]rotection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom ... Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest. As a result the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined and the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected."&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1996/16.html European Court of Human Rights decision in Goodwin v. UK]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court concluded  that absent "an overriding requirement in the public interest", an order to disclose sources would violate the guarantee of free expression in Article 10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art10|title=European Convention on Human Rights and its Five Protocols|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

In the wake of ''Goodwin'', the [[Council of Europe]]'s Committee of Ministers issued a Recommendation to its member states on how to implement the protection of sources in their domestic legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805e2fd2 Recommendation No. R (2000)7 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the right of journalists not to disclose their sources of information]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] has also called on states to respect the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/osce/text/VIENN89E.htm|title=Vienna Follow-up Meeting CONCLUDING DOCUMENT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''Americas''', protection of sources has been recognised in the ''Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iachr.org/declaration.htm Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression]&lt;/ref&gt; which states in Principle 8 that "every social communicator has the right to keep his/her source of information, notes, personal and professional archives confidential."

In '''Africa''', the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] has adopted a ''Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa'' which includes a right to protection of sources under Principle XV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.wits.ac.za/humanrts/achpr/expressionfreedomdec.html Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beginnings ==
Record-Rama was founded by Paul C. Mawhinney, a collector of vinyl records. According to the store's website, Mawhinney was a significant help in restarting [[David Bowie]]'s career by getting fellow Pittsburgher and [[RCA]] boss [[Tom Cossie]] to re-release the album ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'' in 1972 after its initial release in 1969 failed to hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordrama.com/david_bowie.htm |title=David Bowie Story |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715164146/http://www.recordrama.com/david_bowie.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mawhinney started the shop after his personal collection reached the many thousands. It was his wife who told him to get rid of the records or start a business around them. By the mid-1990s, Record-Rama was doing $5 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1994|r=1}}}} million today) a year of business.&lt;ref name="failed-deals-2"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, Mawhinney built the world's biggest record collection. He also cataloged records in a directory called the ''MusicMaster''.&lt;ref name="failed-deals-2" /&gt; Mawhinney released the first edition in 1982, and it came in two volumes: one listing by artist, the other by title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldjournal-gs.blogspot.com/2009/01/record-rama-archives.html Record-Rama Archives] blog on [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]. Retrieved 2009-10-19. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wNa9ZWk5?url=http://worldjournal-gs.blogspot.com/2009/01/record-rama-archives.html |date=9 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, the business had dropped to $500,000 a year, one tenth of what it had been. Mawhinney attributed the drop in sales to large retailers who were able to sell recorded music below cost and illegal Internet downloading.&lt;ref name="failed-deals-2" /&gt;

== Closure ==
Record-Rama closed in the summer of 2008 during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global credit crunch]]. &lt;ref name="closes"&gt;{{cite news

}} &lt;/ref&gt; Mawhinney stated that he had been squeezed out of business by the recording industry and large retailers who can sell compact discs to the public for less than his wholesale costs.&lt;ref name="closes" /&gt;

== The biggest record collection on Earth ==
Mawhinney started his record collection in 1951. The first record he bought was [[Frankie Laine]]'s "[[Jezebel (song)|Jezebel]]". Mawhinney built his collection into the thousands before he founded Record-Rama. After he set up shop, he decided to keep and archive one copy of every record he sold. In 2003, at over 2 million items, Mawhinney's collection was more than twice the size of the collection at the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="failed-deals-2" /&gt; By the time the store closed in 2008, the collection stood at more than three million items and was valued at [[United States dollar|$]]50 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|2008|r=1}}}} million today).&lt;ref name="worlds-greatest"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts to sell ==
Mawhinney first attempted to sell the collection in 1997. According to the owner, [[CD Now]] offered $28.5 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|28.5|1997|r=1}}}} million today) for the collection plus a $100,000/year job (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1997}}}} today) to Mawhinney to administer the archive.&lt;ref name="failed-deals-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worlds-greatest" /&gt; Mawhinney claims the sale fell through three weeks later when CD Now went to bankruptcy court.&lt;ref name="failed-deals-1" /&gt;

In the fall of 2002, Mawhinney and the Library of Congress were actively discussing the sale of Mawhinney's collection.&lt;ref name="failed-deals-2" /&gt; The parties were unable to reach an agreement due to the scarcity of federal funding and difficulties justifying the purchase using taxpayer dollars.&lt;ref name="failed-deals-2" /&gt; The Library of Congress denies the parties had reached an agreement.  

In 2008, Mawhinney closed his shop and needed to sell the record archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By 2012, Mawhinney had sold various sections of the archive and various formats to other interested individuals. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The remains of a once-great collection were housed in a number of storage units that were in danger of being auctioned off due to the cost of maintenance by somebody on a fixed income with no retirement funds.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2318">'''Roving reference''', also called '''roaming reference''', is a library service model in which, instead of being positioned at a static [[reference desk]], a [[librarian]] moves throughout the library to locate patrons with questions or concerns and offer them help in finding or using library resources.&lt;ref name=ifla&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ifla.org/VII/dg/dgrw/dp99-05.htm|publisher=IFLA|title=Roving Reference: A New Approach to User Services|author1=Courtois, Martin |author2=Liriano, Maira |date=31 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Roving reference as a library service practice was first formalized in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A 1999 report from the [[International Federation of Library Associations]] identified several advantages and disadvantages with roving reference in the pre-mobile era. The roving model allowed librarians to engage with "the majority of users who have questions in mind [who] do not approach the reference desk for assistance".&lt;ref name=ifla/&gt; However, libraries reported that some staff were uncomfortable with the practice, and that there were concerns about user privacy.&lt;ref name=ifla/&gt;

Beginning in the 2000s, librarians used laptops or laptop carts to engage in technology-supported roaming reference. Since the development of mobile technologies, roving reference can be facilitated with the use of such technologies, such as [[tablet computer]]s, which allow librarians to readily check the [[online public access catalogue]] or the library's electronic databases while away from their desk.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Annie; Stevens, Mark (2012). "We're Going Mobile: Roving Reference in an Academic Library" Utah Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This has contributed to the increased popularization of roving-reference programs as supplements for more traditional reference desks. The model has also been extended to service beyond the library building (library outreach), for example in a dormitory or faculty building at an academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Bowers, Jennifer; Forbes, Carrie|title=Rethinking Reference for Academic Libraries: Innovative Developments and Future Trends|year=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|chapter=Roving Reference|author=Wilkinson, Zara|pages=85&amp;ndash;98|isbn=9781442244535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sight &amp; Sound''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] monthly [[film]] [[magazine]] published by the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI).

==History and content==

''Sight &amp; Sound'' was first published in 1932 and in 1934 management of the magazine was handed to the nascent BFI, which still publishes the magazine today. ''Sight &amp; Sound'' was published quarterly for most of its history until the early 1990s, apart from a brief run as a monthly publication in the early 1950s, but in 1991 it merged with another BFI publication, the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', and started to appear monthly. The journal was edited by [[Gavin Lambert]] from 1949 to 1955, and from 1956 to 1990 by [[Penelope Houston (film critic)|Penelope Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/penelope-houston-vital-commentator-on-post-war-cinema-who-edited-the-bfi-s-sight-sound-film-magazine-a6715811.html|title=Penelope Houston: Influential editor of 'Sight &amp; Sound' magazine|date=2015-10-30|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaunch editor was [[Philip Dodd (broadcaster)|Philip Dodd]]. It is currently edited by [[Nick James (critic)|Nick James]]. The magazine reviews all film releases each month, including those with a limited ([[art film|art house]]) release, as opposed to most film magazines which concentrate on those films with a general release. ''Sight &amp; Sound'' features a full cast and crew credit list for each reviewed film, as well as the entire plot of said film.

==The ''Sight &amp; Sound'' Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time==
Every decade, ''Sight &amp; Sound'' asks an international group of film professionals to vote for their ten [[Films considered the greatest ever|greatest films of all time]]. Until 1992, the votes of the invited critics and directors were compiled to make one list. However, since 1992, directors have been invited to participate in a separate poll.

The individual results are eclectic; in the 2002 poll, 885 different films received at least one mention from one voter. Even the top-of-the-list consensus has its limits. In 2002, both the critics and the directors selected [[Stanley Kubrick]] films in their top ten; however, the critics chose ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', while the directors preferred ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.

The ''Sight &amp; Sound'' accolade has come to be regarded as one of the most important of the "greatest ever film" polls. [[Roger Ebert]] described it as "by far the most respected of the countless polls of great movies—the only one most serious movie people take seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Citizen Kane' fave film of movie elite | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | author = Roger Ebert | authorlink = Roger Ebert | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020811/COMMENTARY/88010305 |accessdate=2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first poll, in 1952, was topped by ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]''. The five subsequent polls (1962–2002) were won by ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (which finished 13th in 1952), while ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' received the most votes in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Eric C. [http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/sight/1952.html Sight and Sound Poll 1952: Critics], [[Caltech]].&lt;/ref&gt; Only ''[[La Règle du jeu|La Règle du jeu (The Rules of the Game)]]'' has appeared in all seven of the magazine's decennial polls. Among the directors that participated in 2012 are [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Ken Loach]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

''Sight &amp; Sound'' has in the past been the subject of criticism, notably from [[Raymond Durgnat]], who often accused it of elitism, puritanism and snobbery, although he did write for it in the 1950s, and again in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Henry K.|title=Poetry in motion|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/poetry-motion|website=BFI Film Forever|publisher=BFI|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gough-Yates|first1=Kevin|title=Raymond Who?|url=http://www.raymonddurgnat.com/|website=Raymond Durgnat.com|publisher=The Estate of Raymond Durgnat|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The magazine's American counterpart is ''[[Film Comment]]'', a magazine published by the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Independent-Film-Road-Movies/Journals-and-Magazines-ACADEMIC-JOURNALS.html Academic Journals]&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been accused of populism in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/02/entertainment/la-et-mn-citizen-kane-vs-vertigo-what-does-sight-sound-poll-really-mean-20120802]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer Kim Novak at Golden Gate Bridge Fort Point.jpg|thumb|[[Vertigo (film)|''Vertigo'']] (1958)]]
{{Main|The Sight &amp; Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time}}

A new rule was imposed for this ballot: related films that are considered part of a larger whole (e.g. ''The Godfather'' and ''The Godfather Part II'', [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]]'s ''[[Three Colors trilogy]]'' and ''[[Dekalog]]'', or [[Satyajit Ray]]'s ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'') were to be treated as separate films for voting purposes.

For the 2012 poll, ''Sight &amp; Sound'' also listened to decades of criticism about the lack of diversity of its poll participants and made a huge effort to invite a much wider variety of critics and filmmakers from around the world to participate, taking into account gender, ethnicity, race, geographical region, socioeconomic status, and other kinds of underrepresentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">[[File:Vaclav Hajek z Libocan 1861.jpg|thumb|Lithograph, about 1861]]

'''Wenceslaus Hajek of Libočan''' ({{lang-cz|Václav Hájek z Libočan}}; {{lang-de|Wenzeslaus Hagek von Libotschan}}; {{lang-la|Wenceslai Hagecii, Wenceslai Hagek a Liboczan}}; died 18 March 1553) was a [[Bohemia]]n [[chronicle]]r, author of the ''Annales Bohemorum'' (''Kronyka Czeská'' or ''Kronika Česká'' in modern Czech). 

A scion of a noble family based in [[Libočany]] near [[Žatec]], Hajek was ordained priest of the Kostelec parish near [[Budyně nad Ohří]] in 1520. One year later, he became a chaplain in [[Zlonice]]. Hajek initially was a member of the Bohemian [[Unity of the Brethren]], who later converted to [[Catholicism]]. In 1524 he served as a preacher at the St. Thomas' Church in Prague [[Malá Strana]]; from 1527 as a dean of [[Karlštejn]] Castle and a priest in [[Tetín (Beroun District)|Tetín]]. In May 1533, he was appointed royal administrator of the [[Vyšehrad Chapter]]. Hajek reached the peak of ecclesiastical career when he became provost of [[Brandýs nad Labem-Stará Boleslav|Stará Boleslav]] Chapter, however, he fell from grace shortly afterwards and retired to [[Prague]].

His famous ''Annales'' cover the [[History of the Czech lands]] from the legendary early medieval rulers [[Lech, Czech, and Rus]] up to the coronation of King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1526. They were translated into German by Johann Sandel (1596), and were extensively studied by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832). Long considered one of the best sources of Bohemian history, modern criticism has found it to be quite inaccurate, although still useful for information about [[Czech literature]] traditions of the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1904">The '''Yearbook of International Organizations''' is a [[reference work]] on [[non-profit]] [[international organizations]], published by the [[Union of International Associations]]. It was first published in 1908 under the title ''Annuaire de la vie internationale'', and has been known under its current title since 1950. It is seen as a quasi-official source associated with the [[United Nations]].

The Yearbook contains profiles of over 67,000 organizations active in about 300 countries and territories in every field of human endeavor. It profiles both international [[intergovernmental organization]]s and [[non-governmental organization]]s, from formal structures to informal networks, from professional bodies to recreational clubs. The Yearbook does not, however, include for-profit enterprises. Profiles include names and addresses, historical and structural information, aims, links with other organizations, as well as specifics on activities, events, publications and membership. In addition to organization profiles, the Yearbook also provides biographies of important members, a bibliography of the important publications of international organizations, and statistics.

The Yearbook is published in six book volumes and online.
