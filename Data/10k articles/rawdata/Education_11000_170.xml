'''Academia del Perpetuo Socorro''' (English: "Academy of Our Lady of Perpetual Help") was founded in 1921 as a Catholic parochial school of the Perpetuo Socorro Parish at the Archdiocese of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. The school is located in [[Miramar, Puerto Rico|Miramar]] in [[Puerto Rico]]'s capital city of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. Students, teachers and alumni commonly refer to their school as Perpetuo. The school has historically been known to be a very prestigious school, traditionally educating young men and women who are to become influential leaders of Puerto Rican society. The school is featured prominently in Magali Garcia Ramis's novel ''Felices Dias Tio Sergio".

Many graduates attend top-ranked colleges and universities. Perpetuo provides academic instruction in Math, Sciences, History, English, Spanish, and Religion. It also provides a variety of athletic intercollegiate teams for its students as well as academic teams, specifically its Math, Model UN, Forensics, High School Choir, Drama Club and History teams. Perpetuo has 42 organized clubs, a varsity program in ten sports, four student publications and a yearbook, a Student Council, and an Honor Society for qualified students. It also offers membership for a Jr. Honor Society and an Honor Academy.

Students participate in a wide range of extracurricular activities ranging from Drama Club to community service. Every year, a handful of students have the opportunity to participate in a community service trip to [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]], and [[Honduras]]. Students spend two weeks with nuns in villages helping build houses, schools and also sharing time with local children as part of a community development program. Also, rising juniors have the opportunity to participate in a European Educational Trip coordinated by school officials.

==Mission==
The goal of the  Academia del Perpetuo Socorro is the complete development of the student - spiritually, mentally, morally, socially, culturally, and physically in order to live a full life and to prepare for his/her final goal - union with God. To this end, the school works to create a Catholic academic community in which faith, knowledge, and recreation are shared in a spirit of freedom, love, and creativity. The school, however, does not emphasize religion over other subjects, accepts students of all faiths and does not impose religious requirements such as baptism, confirmation or [[church attendance]] as a condition for continued attendance.

The school provides one of the most encompassing and through education experiences available to Puerto Rican students. It is known to be the stepping stone many future leaders of Puerto Rican society have prior to being educated in elite American institutions and becoming influential professionals.

==Motto==
"Esto Perpetua" translated as "This Endures" stressing how the Catholic values and formal academic education learned at this school, symbolized in the school seal by the oil lamp over the open book, (as in burning the midnight oil) are to permeate individuals and society forever.
 
In short this motto is a reference to how the school's positive influence is eternal.

{{grading}}
The [[Vietnam]]ese [[grading (education)|grading system]] is an academic [[grading (education)|grading system]] utilized in [[Vietnam]].  It is based on a 0-10 point scale, similar to the [[Academic grading in the United States|US 1.0-4.0 scale]].

Typically when an [[United States|American]] educational institution requests a grade-point average ([[GPA]]) calculated on the 4 point scale, the student will be expected to do a direct mathematical conversion, so 10 becomes 4.0, 7.5 becomes 3.0, etc. This makes sense from a practical standpoint. In reality, however, it is completely inaccurate.

In the Vietnamese system, a score of ten is rarely given. In contrast, a 4.0 in a U.S. classroom is not unusual, nor is someone with a 4.0 GPA overall. According to the Research Center for Vocational, Technical and Higher Education under the [[Ministry of Education and Training (Vietnam)|Vietnamese Ministry of Education]], someone with a 7.5 GPA will probably be in the top 10-15% of his or her class.

The practice of most Vietnamese colleges is not to provide [[Transcript (education)|official transcripts]] to other universities on behalf of their students. Students can request a signed and stamped original transcript from their school, and then have copies certified with a red stamp at a government office. Translation services are also available at such offices.

In practice, most U.S. universities used a standardized acceptance of A, B, C, D's only.  Thus any A+'s, B+, C+ will be down-convert to A, B, C respectively.

==Credit hours==

Some universities in Vietnam notes standardized [[Course credit|credit hours]], which can translate directly over to the U.S. system.  Some instead notes class hours of 15, 30, 45, 60 ... etc.  which needs to be converted into credit hours by dividing class hours by 15.  Thus a 15-hour class is equivalent to 1 credit hours, a 45-hour class is equivalent to 3 credit hours.

==Method of calculating GPAs==

Most universities convert GPAs class by class.  Each class is evaluated for credit hours equivalent.  Each class grade point is evaluated in its native grade point, then converted to A, B, C, D, F.  Then convert the individual class grade to the 4.0 system.  Next, multiply each class grade point by the number of credit hours for the respective class.  Finally, total up the points, and divide by the total number credit hours to arrive at the final GPA.

==High school credit system==

[[Education in Vietnam#Middle school and secondary school education|High schools]] seem to use a slightly modified GPA system, with higher criteria to receive the equivalent grading letter scale.  High school classes are standardized in most Vietnamese public schools, with the respective classes and Grade Point tables listed below.

The '''Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia''' ({{lang-ka|საქართველოს შინაგან საქმეთა სამინისტროს აკადემია}}, ''sak'art'velos shinagan sak'met'a akademia''), also known as the '''Police Academy of Georgia''' (საქართველოს პოლიციის აკადემია, ''sak'art'velos polits'iis akademia''), the Legal Entity of Public Law of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia, the mission of which is to integrate the knowledge in the sphere of law, including the knowledge in the field of police regulation, its updating with the standards oriented on public service and training the personnel of higher values and principles with practical skills and knowledge as well as the skills necessary for lawyers with the use of innovative methods for public and private sectors.

==History==
The Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was founded in 1930 and has been changed many times since the day of its foundation. In 1930 the structure of the school of senior staff of the Militia changed and launched the program for training of ordinary police officers on its basis. From January, 1941 the School of Senior Staff of Militia was awarded the name of the Tbilisi School of Militia of the Commissariat of Internal Affairs of the USSR. In the documents dating back to 1941 we first meet women staff among the students and listeners. By the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Georgia in 1994 the High School of the Militia was transformed into the Academy of MIA. On March 15, 2006, the Special Training Center was incorporated into the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. On June 1, 2012 the Archive of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was transferred to the Academy. The Archive of the Ministry of Internal Affairs unites the archives of the former State Security Committee, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Central Committee of Communist Party of the Georgian SSR. Under the initiative of the Minister of Internal Affairs, in 2016, the Academy introduced to the remote education, which covers all regions of Georgia. It was founded the Alumni Association, joining the first 39 MA graduates of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://policeacademy.gov.ge/ka/about-the-academy/history History]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10663">'''Andreas Constantine Papadakis''' FLS (17 June 1938 – 10 June 2008) was a Cypriot-born British academic, entrepreneur and leading figure in the field of [[Publishing|architectural publishing]]. He opened the Academy Bookshop in [[Holland Street, Kensington|Holland Street]], Kensington in 1964 and moved into publishing as Academy Editions in 1968. From then until 1990, when he sold the company to VCH Germany (now part of [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley]]) he published more than a thousand titles mainly on art, architecture and the decorative arts.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;Anon.

(2008) Andreas Papadakis, ''Telegraph.co.uk'', 18 Aug. [internet] Available at: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2581290/Andreas-Papadakis.html &lt;!--accessed 30 April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Papadakis was born in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]] on 17 June 1938 and relocated to London in 1956. He obtained a DIC from [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] and a PhD from [[Brunel University]]. In 1964 he bought a house in Holland Street, [[Kensington]] without realising that the shop (then a dry cleaners) on the ground floor could not be used for residential purposes.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; He decided to open a bookshop. The Academy Bookshop began as a general bookshop. His first publications were finely bound limited editions of other publishers’ books but he soon decided that he would prefer to make his own and began in 1967 with a large format paperback of [[Aubrey Beardsley]]’s prints, an ideal title to attract the customers of [[Biba]], who had recently opened her shop just round the corner in Kensington Church Street. The Beardsley book was still in print when Academy was sold in 1990.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Academy Editions &amp; ''Architectural Design''==
In 1971 Papadakis expanded his fast-growing business with the acquisition of the Tiranti publishing company and the London Art Bookshop. He moved the shop to No. 8 Holland Street, just opposite the Academy Bookshop and set about expanding the combined Academy/Tiranti list. Early publications included Jim Burns’s ''Arthropods'', Roger Bilcliffe’s ''Charles Rennie Mackintosh'', [[Bernard Rudofsky|Rudofsky]]’s [[Architecture Without Architects|''Architecture without Architects'']], [[Reyner Banham]]’s ''Design by Choice'', ''Alphonse Mucha, Complete Graphic Works'', and [[Rudolf Wittkower|Wittkower]]’s ''Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism''.

In 1975 Papadakis bought the financially troubled ''Architectural Design'' magazine. This created some controversy because of his non-architectural background and his unwillingness to give his unconditional support to one particular architectural style.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bd"&gt;Latham, I. (1988) Anniversaries: Edited Highlights. ''Building Design'', 30 Sep. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suntimes"&gt;Pearman, H. (1993) Function Follows Farm. ''The Sunday Times'', 25 Jul. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy increased with the publication of [[Charles Jencks]]’s ''The Language of Post-Modern Architecture'' in 1977, which was in its sixth edition by the time he sold Academy in 1990.

Both ''Architectural Design'' and Academy Editions continued to publish [[Postmodern architecture|Post-Modern]], [[Classical architecture|Classical]] and [[Deconstructivism|Deconstructivist]] projects throughout the 1980s while Papadakis himself actively fostered the pluralist debate through seminars, conferences and exhibitions at the [[University of Westminster|Polytechnic of Central London]], the [[Architectural Association]], the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]], the [[German Architecture Museum]] in [[Frankfurt]], and through his Academy Forums at the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]] and the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy of Arts]], where he also founded the annual Architecture Lecture.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt;

In 1990, Papadakis sold what was by now the Academy Group Ltd. with ''Architectural Design'' and the journals he had founded: ''Architectural Monographs'', ''Art and Design'' and the ''Journal of Philosophy and the Visual Arts''. He left the group at the end of 1992 and was banned by a non-competition clause from publishing for five years.&lt;ref name="bdd"&gt;Anon. (1993) Rise and Fall of PoMo King. ''Building Design'', 15 Jan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papadakis Publisher and Restoration Projects==
In 1997, Papadakis founded a new publishing house, Papadakis Publisher, with his daughter Alexandra. In addition to books on architecture and the decorative arts the company broadened its scope to include books on natural science, including the acclaimed&lt;ref name="seedscience"&gt;Thompson, K.

As Papadakis’s business ventures were increasingly successful, he purchased several properties for restoration, including the medieval Kilbees Farm in [[Winkfield|Winkfield, Berkshire]] and Dauntsey Park House in [[Wiltshire]], although the latter project ended in 2005 when planning permission was refused.&lt;ref name="suntimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphdp"&gt;Aslet, C.

&lt;/ref&gt; he had published, to design a house for him.
“For his luxury mansion on his Greek-island-in-the-Thames, the great man chose not Michael Graves, one of the deconstructivists or even CZWG, but pragmatic classicist Basil Al Bayati, whom he instructed to design a country house in the English turn-of-the-century manner.”&lt;ref name="secondcoming"&gt;

An '''assault course''' (also called '''trim trail''') is a special sort of [[trail]] that combines [[running]] and [[Physical exercise|exercising]]. It was more popular in the 1970s than it is now.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} It is heavily used in [[military training]]. The prime use is to evaluate progress and weaknesses within the team involved.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

==Military training==
Assault courses are used in military training to increase fitness, to demonstrate techniques that can be used for crossing very rough terrain, and to increase teamwork and self-confidence.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

Often military assault courses will be standardised, and will have, for example (in the UK), a six-foot and a ten-foot wall, a climbing net, some type of bar to climb over, and a high rope or net that must be crossed (these being or representing the most likely difficult terrain that a soldier will come across). The standardisation means that every course will be to the same quality, though it also means that there will be certain parts that may be familiar if practised.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}}

However, they have different purposes. For example, they can be short (less than a minute) with a range on the end (e.g. Junior Leaders, Folkestone), or long (five minutes) as at Thetford.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} This is partially because of space restraints and training objectives. The short one can be run as an individual course and a warmup for the range. The long Thetford course is more of an exercise in endurance and teamwork.

==Trim trail==
The term "trim trail" has more recently been applied to a series of wooden exercise stations, scattered in parkland or other locations beside a jogging or walking trail, which can be used to develop balance, strength and coordination.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} They are suitable for both adults and children, and the individual stations have been scientifically designed to provide a range of exercise.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Most have simple instructions attached to them, and the stations include balance beams, sit-up bars, chin-up bars, parallel bars, and more challenging stations such as pole climbs and ladder walks.{{Original research inline|date=December 2013}} Bristol City Council have now installed trim trails in six parks, ranging in complexity from Withywood Park, which has a single station, to Victoria Park, which has nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loughgallcountrypark.co.uk/?page=cycling&amp;sub=17 |title=Welcome to Loughall Country Park |publisher=Loughall Country Park |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/6645 |title=Trim trail exercise stations |publisher=Bristol City Council |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the trim trail at [[Hollingworth Lake]], in [[Greater Manchester]], which was the idea of the Friends of Hollingworth Lake and opened in August 2010, was provided by the [[Big Lottery Fund|Big Lottery]] Community Spaces fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |title=Woodland Wonder opens for all |publisher=Groundwork Oldham and Rochdale |date=17 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212114711/http://www.northwest.groundwork.org.uk/oldham--rochdale/news--events/news/2010/woodland-wonder-opens-for-all.aspx |archivedate=12 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aufbaugymnasium''' ("Structured Grammar School") is a school for mature students in Germany and Austria. It serves students who graduated from a [[Hauptschule]] or [[Realschule]] and are headed for the [[Abitur]].
It is not to be confused with a traditional [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], which serves young students who have not graduated from another [[secondary school]] before.

'''Basis Educational Group''', styled '''BASIS.ed''', is a for-profit [[education management organization]] based in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. It serves primarily [[Basis Schools]], a non-profit [[charter management organization]] with offices in the same complex.

Basis comprises various companies organized by the regions in which the schools operate: Basis Schools, Inc., BTX Schools, Inc., Basis Washington D.C. ([[Washington D.C.]]), and Basis Baton Rouge ([[Louisiana]]).  In 2018, the company claims twenty-five schools and 17,000 students, which matches publicly available enrollment numbers from Basis Schools. In 2015, Basis Schools had enrolled 12,0140 students.&lt;ref name="jw2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodworth|first1=James L|title=Charter Management Organizations 2017|url=https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/CMO%20FINAL.pdf| publisher=Center for Research on Education Outcomes|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}}

==Controversy==
Critics observe that the relation between Basis Educational Group and Basis Schools is not arms-length. As a result, there is little financial transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/20121119editorial1121-charters-transparent.html |title=Charter transparency |publisher=Azcentral.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigative article in 2010 compared the founders' salary compared to the teachers and other public school administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azstarnet.com/news/blogs/senor-reporter/sr-reporter-basis-school-execs-salaries-rose-fast/article_a428653c-d706-11df-9137-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Basis School Execs Salaries Rose Fast|publisher=Azcentral.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools have suffered high attrition rates (senior classes are typically a third to a quarter of the size of the fifth grade class).  Critics argue that Basis achieves good test scores in part by weeding out underperforming students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogforarizona.com/blog/2013/04/conservatives-on-basis-charter-print-the-legend.html |title=conservatives on BASIS print the legend |publisher=blogforarizona.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501003341/http://www.blogforarizona.com/blog/2013/04/conservatives-on-basis-charter-print-the-legend.html |archivedate=2013-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2014/04/23/basis-and-university-high-are-top-us-high-schools-which-means|title= BASIS and University High are Top U.S. High Schools, which means...?|publisher=tucsonweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogforarizona.net/basis-charters-education-model-success-by-attrition|title=Success by Attrition|publisher=blogforarizona.com|date= |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borwick Hall''' is a 16th-century manor house at [[Borwick]], [[Lancashire]], England. It is a [[Grade I listed building]] and is now used as a residential [[outdoor education]] and [[conference centre]] by [[Lancashire County Council]].

==History==
The manor of Borwick is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as being part of the estates of [[Roger of Poitou]]&lt;ref name=VCH&gt;[[#VCH|Victoria County History]] pp. 170&amp;ndash;174.&lt;/ref&gt; but the oldest parts of the building still in existence date from the 14th century when a [[pele tower]] was built on the site.&lt;ref name=NMR&gt;[[#NMR|National Monuments Record]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought c. 1590 by Roger Bindlosse.

The tower was extended to a manor house by Roger in the early 1590s before he died in 1595.&lt;ref name=VCH/&gt; His son Robert inherited and was appointed [[High Sheriff of Lancashire]] in 1615. Robert's son [[Francis Bindlosse|Sir Francis Bindlosse]] predeceased him and so the estate passed to Francis's eldest son, [[Sir Robert Bindlosse, 1st Baronet|Robert]], who was created a baronet in 1641 and was elected MP for [[Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancashire]] in 1660. He also served twice as High Sheriff. He built a private Oratory on the estate. On his death in 1688 with no male heir the baronetcy became extinct and the estate passed to his only daughter, Cecilia, who had married William Standish. On her death there were again no male heirs and the estate passed to a daughter who had married Thomas Strickland of the Sizergh family. The Scottish soldier Charlie MacDougal is believed to have died in the grounds in 1745 following the infighting between the Scots returning from England with Bonnie Prince Charlie. The Stricklands sold the Hall in 1854 for £28,000 to Col. Marton of Capernwray.

By the early 19th century the Hall was falling into disrepair&lt;ref name=borwickvillage&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of Borwick Hall|url=http://www.borwickvillage.com/borwickhall1.html#borwickhall1|publisher=borwickvillage.com|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was only repaired in the 1910s when it was leased to music critic [[John Alexander Fuller Maitland]] on the specific condition that he restore the building.&lt;ref name=borwickvillage/&gt; He died there in 1936.

After the [[Second World War]] during which the hall was used as a military base, the estate was sold to Lancashire Youth Clubs Association&lt;ref name=borwickvillage/&gt; and later passed into the ownership of Lancashire County Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The LCVYS Lolly |url=http://www.lcvys.org.uk/lolly/text/2003february.txt |work= |publisher=Lancashire Council for Voluntary Youth Services |format=txt |doi= |date= February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Externally the Hall is built of stone rubble with sandstone dressing and a slate roof.&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[[#HG|Heritage Gateway]]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its exceptional features it was listed as a Grade I listed building in 1967.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

'''CISV International''' (''Formerly'' '''''Children's International Summer Villages''''') was founded in 1951&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/about-cisv-int/founder/&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Doris Twitchell Allen]] and aims to educate and inspire action for a more just and peaceful world.

The organisation operates international educational programmes on an annual basis to bring together participants from member countries. CISV also operates in smaller communities through its around 200 local Chapters in 69 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisv.org/mycisv/national-chapter-officials-directory/about-us/our-world/|title="Our World"|last=|first=|date=1 March 2017|website=CISV International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CISV International is a [[UNESCO]] partner Non Governmental Organization (NGO), holds participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]] and is a candidate member of the [[European Youth Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/our-partners/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CISV was founded in 1951, after [[World War II]], by [[Doris Twitchell Allen]]. Since then, the organisation has expanded into around 69 countries, and over 150,000 delegates have participated in more than four thousand international CISV activities that delegates have made up over the course of these years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

For Dr. Allen and the CISV organisation, children and youth were seen as the ideal starting point for peace education.  Programmes were developed which offered young people opportunities to meet their peers from other countries and to form intercultural friendships and to learn about what life is really like where they come from. Local programmes give people the chance to learn about the cultures in their own communities and explore important themes related to peace and understanding.

The first village was held in 1951 in Glendale, Ohio; commissioned for its 50th anniversary, the sculpture "How Alike I Am to You” was created in 2000 by Tim Werrell and stands on the property of the Harry Whiting Brown Community Center in Glendale, Ohio.

==CISV programmes==
The CISV International delivers its education through its seven official programmes:

* Village: Today, delegations composed of four children and one adult "Leader" from 10–12 countries come together for a four-week programme for 11-year-old children, who participate in activities based around simple activities that indirectly promote peace and understanding of each other.  Each delegation consists of two boys, two girls, and an adult leader. Additionally, there are five or six Junior Counsellors (JCs, age 16–17) invited, who should be a care-taking "older sibling" for the 11-year-old. There is also a STAFF that takes cares of the camp and it is, usually, a group of 5-6 adults. The staff is responsible for organizing all the structure so the camp can happen.
* Step Up: A three-week programme for participants 14–15 years of age. Delegations include 4 participants and an adult leader. In Step Up's participants can think of new rules for the camp, these will be discussed and voted upon in a so-called 'camp meeting'. Also, the delegates are largely responsible for putting together activities to promote social and leadership skills. Each delegation consists of two boys, two girls, and an adult leader.
* Interchange: Involving only two countries, this programme spans up to two years. A delegation of 6–12 youth, aged 12–14, is selected from each participating country. In the programme one delegation will travel to visit for two or four weeks with the other's family.  After those weeks and a little time in between, the delegations reciprocate. Each delegation has one adult leader, and may also have a Junior Leader.
* Youth Meeting: An 8 or 15 day programme for either 12–13, 14–15, 16–18 or 19+. This programme is based on a specific theme. For youth 12–15 each delegation consists of six young people, and an adult leader. People at the age 16+ travel alone.
* Seminar Camp: A three-week programme for youth 17–18 in which there is one or more (but not more than four) delegates from each participating country.  Seminar Camps have a more direct educational approach, and youth are encouraged to form opinions on various world issues. Usually youth-directed, this program has only thirty participants in total.
* International People's Project:  CISV's newest international programme is open to people aged 19+ and is three weeks long. Participants participate in hands-on work contributing to a community project.
* Mosaic: Mosaic is a programme that consists of projects with educational content, developed by local CISV Chapters worldwide.  These projects empower individuals to be agents of change, reach out, and involve as many people as possible.

The CISV International website provides more detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/cisv-programmes/&lt;/ref&gt;

CISV Chapters also hold activities that aim to share the CISV experience within their local community.

In addition to this CISV International delivers its education through:

* '''Junior Branch (JB)''': Junior Branch is an integral, but self-governing youth-based part of the structure of CISV. Junior Branch develops intercultural skills and attitude through educational and administrative activities consistent with CISV Goals.
* '''Mini Camp''': A weekend long camp within the local chapter. It is planned and run by local Juniors and leaders, often the older members of the chapter. It is a chance for participants to have a camp like experience locally and allows potential delegates and JCs to have a taste what a few days at camp may be like. Often delegate, leader and JC selection takes place at Mini Camps and activities can range from sports, to simulation activities to guest speakers and much more. 
* CISV also has other things you can do, such as being a leader, more commonly meant for the Village, Step-Up, and Interchange (Also for NYM). They are the ones who take the delegations to the Camp/Village. There are also usually 6 Junior Counselors (JC's) on a Village picked from chapters around the world who provide a link between children and adults on Villages. They are age 16-17 and it is common for there to be 2 JCs from the country the camp is being held in. On every programme there is a Staff team, usually from the hosting country although there are sometimes international staff. They are incharge of all the doings of the camp with the help of the JC's and the Leaders. When a camp is being run there is always a need for Host Families. These are families who have participants to stay at their houses when the camp has either not begun yet, has ended and participants have some time to wait before their flights leave or, in the case of a Village, when the leaders weekend off is underway. Another thing which is important is Junior Branch. There are many roles to be taken on throughout your local and national Junior Branch, these vary from country to country and national junior branch roles are usually taken on by Juniors aged 16+, however, you can contribute in many ways; from helping to plan your Junior Branch meetings to helping to raise money to host programmes.

The '''Department of Skills Development''' ({{lang-ms|Jabatan Pembangunan Kemahiran}}, abbreviated '''DSD''' or '''JPK''') is an agency under the [[Ministry of Human Resources (Malaysia)|Ministry of Human Resources]] for co-ordination and control of training skills for Malaysian citizens. It researches and develops standards to evaluate job expertise and competency.

==Organisation==
The agency is led by a Director General, assisted by a Deputy Director General and a Legal Adviser. Department of Skill Development's functions are further delegated to 14 agencies. Each agency is led by a director.

==Malaysian Skill Certificate==
Defining the contents of Sijil Kemahiran Malaysia (Malaysian Skill Certificates) is the major function of Department of Skill Development.

There are currently five different levels of certification. Skill Certificates are obtained through Accredited Training Institutions and Industry-Oriented Training. Apprenticeship training courses in the National Dual Training System are carried out in approved institutes.

Separately, Pengiktirafan Pencapaian Terdahulu (PPT) (Recognition of Prior Achievement) allow trainees or trainers to convert their experience (either in work or training) into Sijil Kemahiran Malaysia. Malaysians can be awarded SKM without formal courses. They submit proof of such experience and the evidence is reviewed by the relevant officers and confirmed by the Pegawai Pengesahan Luaran, who is usually from the Department of Skill Development.

==Accredited Centres==
Malaysian Skills Certificates are awarded to trainees who complete the course at the centres accredited by the agency. Accredited centres are divided into:

1) Public Approved Centres
2) Private Approved Centres
30 Industrial Approved Centres
4) Association Approved Centres
5) National Dual Training (NDT) Approved Centres

==National Occupational Skills Standard==
National Occupational Skills Standard (NOSS) specifies level of competency required by a worker to perform a specific job at different levels. A syllabus describes each skill and level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1217">The '''Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grant and Loan Program''' ('''DLT''') is a program authorized by the 1990 farm bill (P.L. 101-624) to provide grants to rural schools and health care providers to help them invest in telecommunications facilities and equipment to bring educational and medical resources to rural areas where the services otherwise might be unavailable.  The [[1996 farm bill]] (P.L. 104-127) reauthorized and streamlined the program. 

The program was also reauthorized in the [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 6203).  

DLT is administered by the [[Rural Utilities Service]].

'''ETS Europe''' is the [[Europe]]an arm of [[Educational Testing Service]], an American company, involved in scholastic assessment in Europe.

==History==
It is headquartered in [[Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]]. ETS employs about 2,700 individuals, including 240 with [[doctorate]]s and an additional 350 others with "higher degrees." Work that ETS does that is not associated with its nonprofit educational research mission is conducted by for-profit subsidiaries, such as [[Prometric]], which administers test by computer for licensing and certification in the professional world, and [[ETS Global BV]], which contains much of the international operations of the company.

About 25% of the work carried out by ETS is contracted by the private, [[not-for-profit]] firm, the [[College Board]]. The most popular of the College Board's tests is the [[SAT]], taken by more than 3 million students annually. ETS also develops and administers The College Board's [[Advanced Placement]] program, which is widely used in US high schools for advanced course credit.

==England and Wales Controversy==
In England and [[Wales]] ETS Europe were contracted to operate the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] assessments on behalf of the government. ETS took over this role from [[Edexcel]] in 2008. The first year of their operation was struck by a number of problems, including the late arrival of scripts to examiners, a database of student entries being unavailable, and countrywide reports of problems with the marking of the papers. The opposition Conservative party has criticised the awarding of the contracts to ETS, and produced a dossier listing previous problems with ETS' service. Their contract with the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency|QCA]] was terminated in August 2008: ETS is to pay back £19.5m and cancel invoices worth £4.6m. The UK government asked Lord Sutherland to conduct an inquiry into the failure of the 2008 tests. The report included in its main findings:
*Primary responsibility for this summer's delivery failure rests with ETS Global BV, which won the public contract to deliver the tests
*ETS's capacity to deliver the contract proved to be insufficient. A lack of comprehensive planning and testing by ETS of its systems and processes was a key factor in the delivery failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229092/0062.pdf |title=The Sutherland Inquiry |publisher=[[The Stationery Office]] |date=16 December 2008 |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''eating club''' is a [[social club]] found in [[Higher education in the United States|American universities]].  Eating clubs date to the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are intended to allow college students to enjoy meals and pleasant discourse.  Some clubs are referred to as '''bicker clubs'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/10/15/21778/ Admitting the problem - The Daily Princetonian]&lt;/ref&gt; because of the process of bickering over which applicants to accept as members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/education/edlife/princeton.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print More Than a Meal Plan - New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; Replaced largely by the [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|modern fraternity and sorority system]], eating clubs are now limited to a few colleges and universities, most notably [[Princeton University]], [[Davidson College]], [[Mount Olive College]], and [[Reed College]] in the [[United States]].

The origins of such clubs are collegiate [[dining club]]s in the [[United Kingdom]], specifically founded earlier than or contemporarily with the foundation of the early American universities such as The [[Pitt Club]], The [[Bullingdon Club]], and [[The 16' Club]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Educational measurement''' refers to the use of educational assessments and the analysis of data such as scores obtained from educational assessments to infer the abilities and proficiencies of students. The approaches overlap with those in [[psychometrics]].
Educational measurement is the assigning of numerals to traits such as achievement, interest, attitudes, aptitudes, [[intelligence]] and performance.   

==Overview==
The aim of theory and practice in educational measurement is typically to measure abilities and levels of attainment by students in areas such as reading, writing, mathematics, science and so forth. Traditionally, attention focuses on whether assessments are reliable and valid. In practice, educational measurement is largely concerned with the analysis of data from educational assessments or tests. Typically, this means using total scores on assessments, whether they are multiple choice or open-ended and marked using marking rubrics or guides.

In technical terms, the pattern of scores by individual students to individual items is used to infer so-called scale locations of students, the "measurements". This process is one form of scaling. Essentially, higher total scores give higher scale locations, consistent with the traditional and everyday use of total scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baker | first = F| title = The Basics of Item Response Theory| publisher = ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation | location = University of Maryland, College Park, MD | year = 2001 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If certain theory is used, though, there is not a strict correspondence between the ordering of total scores and the ordering of scale locations. The Rasch model provides a strict correspondence provided all students attempt the same test items, or their performances are marked using the same marking rubrics.

In terms of the broad body of purely mathematical theory drawn on, there is substantial overlap between educational measurement and psychometrics. However, certain approaches considered to be a part of psychometrics, including [[Classical test theory]], [[Item Response Theory]] and the [[Rasch model]], were originally developed more specifically for the analysis of data from educational assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rasch| first = Georg| title = Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests. |publisher = Danish Institute for Educational Research | location = Copenhagen | year = 1960 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lord | first = Fred | title = Applications of item response theory to practical testing problems. |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.
 | location = CMahwah, NJ | year = 1980 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the aims of applying theory and techniques in educational measurement is to try to place the results of different tests administered to different groups of students on a single or common scale through processes known as [[test equating]]. The rationale is that because different assessments usually have different difficulties, the total scores cannot be directly compared. The aim of trying to place results on a common scale is to allow comparison of the scale locations inferred from the totals via scaling processes.

==Career==

Atlason’s career as a designer started at ten years old winning an essay competition for the [[Ministry of Welfare (Iceland)|Icelandic Ministry of Welfare]], which resulted in an ad campaign and a slogan “Your teeth, Your choice”.  This ad campaign which was featured on buses all over Reykjavik and was used as an example in parliamentary discussions about healthcare in Iceland.&lt;ref name=Althingi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/altext/109/s/pdf/0659.pdf|website=http://www.althingi.is/|publisher=Althingi|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After living for some time in [[Copenhagen]] and two years in [[Paris]] studying at the [[Sorbonne]] and [[Parsons Paris]], he moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a degree in Industrial Design at [[Parsons the New School for Design]] completing his degree in 2001.  Shortly before graduating from Parsons, [[IKEA]] produced his “TUNO” clock for their 2002 PS Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rashid|first1=Karim|title=International Design Yearbook 18|date=May 1, 2003|publisher=Abbeville Press|isbn=0789207885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working for Boym Partners for a year and later becoming the director of product design for G2 Worldwide, Atlason left to start his own design practice in 2004.

Since founding his eponymous design studio, ATLASON in 2004, he has led a team of creatives and strategists that collaborate with companies across a variety of industries. His professional projects are produced by major international manufacturers, which include furniture for [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Design Within Reach]] and [https://www.ercol.com/en-us/ Ercol], a female focused body razor for [https://mybillie.com/ Billie], a condiment holder for [[MOMA]], lighting for Artecnica&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yorky Lamp|url=http://design-milk.com/yorky-lamp-by-hlynur-atlason-for-artecnica/|website=http://design-milk.com/|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hennepin Made and packing for [[Xbox]] and [[Stella Artois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.packagingnews.co.uk/design/new-packs/stella-artois-limited-edition-xmas-packs-19-12-2017|title=Stella Artois launches limited-edition Christmas packs|last=|first=|date=2017-12-19|work=Packaging News|access-date=August 8, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to running his own studio, Atlason was hired as an adjunct lecturer at Parsons the New School for Design in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part-time Lecturer|url=http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/faculty_program.aspx?sbid=44667&amp;sc=PUPD,PSCE&amp;id=4d6a-4d30-4f54-413d|website=www.newschool.edu|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the School of Visual Arts in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://productsofdesign.sva.edu/faculty/hlynur-atlason/|title=Hlynur Atlason Bio|last=Atlason|first=Hlynur|date=|website=https://productsofdesign.sva.edu/|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work has been published in various books and periodicals, with the most notable being ''The Design Encyclopedia'' a book published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], The International Design Year Book 18 edited by famed designer [[Karim Rashid]], and On the Cutting Edge: Design in Iceland a book on Icelandic design curated by German design and art historian and curator Klaus Klemp.

{{expand German|Juniorstudium|date=May 2013}}
The '''Hochbegabtenstudium''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhoːxbəˌɡaːptn̩ˌʃtuːdi̯ʊm|lang}}, "College for the talented") is a programme in [[Germany]] that allows students of prerequisite intellectual ability (as shown on [[IQ test]]s) to attend college even if they do not hold the [[Abitur]]. The Hochbegabtenstudium is also called '''Schülerstudium''' ("college for school-students") because many of the students, who benefit from it are still enrolled in school, while they attend college. 

==Requirements==
A person wishing to do the Hochbegabtenstudium must be of above average intellectual ability and must as a rule have completed at least 10th grade. However some exceptions from that rule are made for very young students of superior intellectual ability, who are in a lower grade.
In most cases a student wishing to participate in the programme must be at least 16 years old, however again exceptions from this rule are made for students of superior intellectual ability some of whom are only 13 or 14 when they enter college.

==Notable examples==
In 2009 the case of Felix Dietlein made news. The young student of superior intellectual ability received his master's degree in mathematics (from the [[University of Cologne]]) one month before he graduated from his high school. He was only 18 at this time.&lt;ref&gt;D. Graalmann: "Hochbegabter Schüler: Ein eifriger junger Mann". Sueddeutsche [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/jobkarriere/58/472581/text/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Humanist''''' is an international electronic [[seminar]] on humanities computing and the [[digital humanities]], in the form of a long-running [[electronic mailing list]] and its associated archive. The primary aim of ''Humanist'' is to provide a forum for discussion of intellectual, scholarly, pedagogical, and social issues and for exchange of information among members.

''Humanist'' is also a [[publication]] of the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) and the [[Office for Humanities Communication]] (OHC) and an affiliated publication of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS). In  2008, there were 1650 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Report on ''Humanist'' 2007‐8 |author= Willard McCarty |date= June 15, 2008 |url= http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/McCarty__Report_on_Humanist_2008-abbreviated.pdf |accessdate= October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ''Humanist'' list was created in 1987 by [[Willard McCarty]], then at the [[University of Toronto]], as a [[BITNET]] (NetNorth in Canada) [[electronic mail]] newsletter for people who support computing in the humanities for the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]].  McCarty, later at [[King's College London]], continued to edit it.

Although ''Humanist'' started off as a means of communication for people directly involved in the support of humanities computing, it grew in scope to become an extended conversation about the nature of "humanities computing" (or "digital humanities", or one of a contested range of other names), about what computing looks like viewed from the humanities, and humanities from computing: "''Humanist'' remains the forum within which the technology, informed by the concerns of humane learning, can be viewed from an interdisciplinary common ground." &lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/announcement.html What is ''Humanist''?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ilan Ramon Youth Physics Center''' was established in honor of [[Ilan Ramon]], Israel's first astronaut. The center was established in 2007&lt;ref name="pqarchiver" /&gt; by the [[Rashi foundation]] in order to allow high school students that are interested in [[physics]] access to high grade [[laboratory]] and [[astronomy]] equipment. The center is located at the [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]] and hosts students of all ages and of a wide cultural variety.&lt;ref name="ynetnews" /&gt;

The objectives of the Center are to advance the study of physics and astronomy in high school; increase the number of pupils who take Physics at matriculation level and improve their matriculation results; establish and operate physics centers in school increase the number of physics and engineering students in academic institutions.

'''Inkling''' is an [[United States|American]] company based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].  It produces a set of tools that businesses use to build, manage, and distribute digital content, which includes its cloud-based authoring environment, called Inkling Habitat.

== History ==
Matt MacInnis, Josh Forman, and Robert Cromwell founded Inkling in August 2009. While working at [[Apple Inc.]], MacInnis heard rumors about a new device (which would later become the Apple [[iPad]]). Believing the device had potential to host interactive electronic [[textbook]]s, he left Apple to found the new company several months before the iPad was officially announced.&lt;ref name=BETA1-12&gt;{{cite news|last=Bury|first=Erin|title=Digital Textbook Publishing Turns Into David vs. Goliath Battle|url=http://www.betakit.com/digital-textbook-publishing-turns-into-david-vs-goliath-battle/|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=Betakit|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacInnis became the CEO, with Forman as the VP, Product and Cromwell as the VP, Engineering.&lt;ref name=ED7-13&gt;{{cite news|last=Wan|first=Tony|title=An Inkling of the Future of Books|url=https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-07-17-an-inkling-of-the-future-of-books|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=edSurge|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2010, the company launched its iPad app and announced partnerships with [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], [[McGraw Hill Financial#McGraw-Hill_Education|McGraw-Hill]], and [[Wolters Kluwer]].&lt;ref name=GIG8-10&gt;{{cite news|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|title=Inkling Says the iPad is the Textbook of the Future|url=http://gigaom.com/2010/08/23/inkling-says-the-ipad-is-the-textbook-of-the-future/|accessdate=21 August 2013|newspaper=Gigaom|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company initially focused on creating interactive e-book versions of existing textbooks. In 2011, it added other types of general-interest non-fiction titles, such as travel guides and cookbooks.&lt;ref name=USA12-12&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Jefferson|title=Inkling cooks up multimedia iPad books|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/talkingtech/2012/12/19/inkling-releases-illustrated-books-for-ipad/1777587/|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company creates e-books in [[HTML5]] and includes features not normally available in conventional e-books such as video, interactive animations, and the ability to share notes with other readers.&lt;ref name=SFGATE2-13&gt;{{cite news|last=Kucera|first=Danielle|title=Inkling gives e-books more visual punch|url=http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Inkling-gives-e-books-more-visual-punch-4286587.php|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=SFGate|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, Inkling pivoted from a [[business-to-consumer]] model to a [[business-to-business]] model by selling their authoring platform, Inkling Habitat, to publishers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcompany.com/3028090/bottom-line/what-happened-when-a-digital-textbook-company-was-forced-to-redefine-its-custome&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the majority of their revenue comes from licensing fees under the [[Software as a Service]] model.  Both publishers and enterprises use Inkling’s cloud-based content creation tools. Inkling no longer produces e-books, but continues to sell its existing e-books through its online bookstore, publishers’ online stores, and the [[Apple App Store.]]  

== Products ==
===Inkling Habitat===
Inkling Habitat is a cloud-based authoring environment. Its collaboration features include assigned comments and version control on a [[single source of truth]]. The platform also comes with drag-and-drop “widgets,” or interactive elements, such as slideshows and quizzes. To verify how content will respond to different devices and layouts Habitat has a cross-device preview with [[responsive web design]]. 

===Inkling Axis===
Inkling Axis is a web reader and mobile app for content created in Habitat. On the web, Habitat content integrates with websites upon embedding a segment of code. For Android and iOS use, Inkling Axis deploys content through a branded mobile app. 

===Inkling Latitude===
Inkling Latitude is a [[software development kit]]. It allows companies to build interactive content within existing web and mobile applications. 

==Press==
In February 2014, ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' named Inkling one of the most innovative companies, calling the company’s product “a huge advancement over the usual, flat boring PDFs under glass.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2014/inkling Fast Company]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Inkling was named #105 on the ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' 500 list of the fastest-growing companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/magazine/201409/ryan-underwood/inc.500-matt-macinnis-quit-apple-to-start-inkling.html Inc Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">The '''[[Jacob K. Javits]] Fellowship''' program formerly provided fellowships to students of superior academic ability—selected on the basis of demonstrated achievement, financial need, and exceptional promise—to undertake study at the doctoral and Master of Fine Arts level in selected fields of arts, humanities, and social sciences. The program stopped accepting applications as of fiscal year 2012.

== The Program ==
The Javits Fellowship program was highly competitive, with only 6-8% of applicants receiving funding in any given year.  

The fellowship provided an institutional payment—which the fellow's institution accepts in lieu of tuition and fees—and a stipend based on the fellow's financial need as determined by the financial aid office using the student's FAFSA and the established cost of living in the area.  In fiscal year 2007, the institutional payment was $12,627 and the maximum stipend was $30,000.  For fiscal year 2008, the maximum stipend was $30,000, and the institutional payment was $12,891.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/programs/jacobjavits/index.html U.S. Department of Education Javits Fellowship Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration and Funding ==

The Javits Fellowship program was administered by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] and governed by laws laid out in the [[Higher Education Opportunity Act]] ([[Act of Congress|Public Law]] 110-315).  Between 40 - 70 new fellowships were issued in any given year, with $9,500,000 - $10,000,000 available to support continuing and new fellows.

'''Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo''' ({{IPA-es|ˈxwan maˈnwel ˈsantʃeθ ɣoɾˈðiʎo|lang}}; born 5 February 1952) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] politician, labour leader and history school teacher. Since 1979 he has been the Mayor of Marinaleda and since 2008 deputy for [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (UL) in the [[Parliament of Andalusia]].&lt;ref name = "Jobs for all"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/world/europe/26spain.html?_r=1|title=A Job and No Mortgage for All in a Spanish Town|date=25 May 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also leader of the party [[Collective for the Unity of Workers - Andalusian Left Bloc]] (CUT-BAI), part of UF and the rural workers's union [[Andalusian Workers Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130112012142/http://www.diagonalperiodico.net/Cuarenta-anos-de-lucha-por-la.html Cuarenta años de lucha por la tierra de jornaleros en Andalucía] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sánchez Gordillo has a long history of participating in militant action for the benefit of Spanish working class. He helped to transform [[Marinaleda, Spain|Marinaleda]] from a town blighted by rural poverty into what Sánchez Gordillo himself and ''[[The Guardian]]'' have described as a "communist utopia",&lt;ref name = "Dan"&gt;{{Cite news

==Robin Hood raids==
In mid August 2012, Sánchez Gordillo attracted considerable media attention both within Spain and internationally due to his role in raids on supermarkets in nearby towns, [[Seville]] and [[Cádiz]], where food was stolen and handed out to poor families and to [[Food banks]]. The items stolen were part of a list chiefly made of rice, sugar, pasta, milk, olive oil and flour. Sánchez Gordillo did not personally remove food, but was outside in the car parks while members of his union conducted the raids. Several of these members have been arrested and later released, though Sánchez Gordillo  himself has immunity from prosecution. Sánchez Gordillo has however said he is happy to waive his immunity and go to jail for his cause, in fact he said he expected to be jailed in order to make his message spread further. English speaking media have widely reported that Sánchez Gordillo is seen as a hero and a "national celebrity" within Spain, comparing him to [[Robin Hood]].&lt;ref name = "FT"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A dissenting voice came from Jonathan Blitzer of the ''New York Times'', who suggested he may fail to live up to the hype and be more like a [[Don Quixote]].&lt;ref name = "Don"/&gt;
Sánchez Gordillo has also been called a modern Robin Hood and "the revolutionary of Andalusia" by several Spanish newspapers, including the center-left [[El País]].&lt;ref name = "Dan"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fiona"/&gt; Gordillo has been criticised by several Spanish citizens and officials, including Alfonso Alonso, a spokesman for the governing [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in Spain's national parliament, who said "One can’t be Robin Hood and at the same time earning a salary as the sheriff of Nottingham".&lt;ref name = "FT"/&gt;

==2012 anti austerity march==
On 16 August, Gordillo set off on a three-week march to Madrid; on the way he planned to occupy banks and to persuade local authorities to default on their debts and refuse to implement austerity.  So far this has included a brief occupation of a [[Unicaja]] branch in [[Mancha Real]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Content==
The title offers an interactive multimedia exploration of the [[Louvre]] collection.

==Reception==
The game sold 15,000 copies by February 1996,&lt;ref name="lexpress.fr"/&gt; and by January 1997 it had sold more than 300,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=4Q4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA54&amp;lpg=RA1-PA54&amp;dq=%22BMG+Interactive%22+%22Le+Louvre%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5M2kEeB44M&amp;sig=P7mZc8OyQJ2NEoHm85rrzVeYcFY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF56P9rcnaAhVJnZQKHQrTAC4Q6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22BMG+Interactive%22+%22Le+Louvre%22&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=25 January 1997|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly'' praised the game's achievements despite its graphical limitations, deeming it "thoughtful — and less taxing" than a trip to [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/1995/12/15/le-louvre-palace-its-paintings/|title=Le Louvre: The Palace &amp;amp; Its Paintings|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''People'' magazine thought the game wouldn't offer new insights to art lovers, but had the potential to inspire non-art lovers to take a trip to the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-le-louvre-vol-44-no-16/feed/|title=Picks and Pans Review: Le Louvre|date=16 October 1995|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Billboard'' felt the title was the "grandaddy" of the [[art game|art-based game genre]], and praised the developer's choice to narrow down the collection to 100 items to prevent the feeling of overwhelm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=9A0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=%22Le+Louvre:+The+Palace+&amp;+Its+Paintings%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8YI1IK4Reu&amp;sig=lLAZATFNug_ozuYrjK33BBajZ-0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5gobsncraAhUCa7wKHec8Axg4ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Le+Louvre:+The+Palace+&amp;+Its+Paintings%22&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=23 September 1995|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Newsweek'' deemed it "satisfying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/see-art-spare-feet-184258|title=See Art, Spare Feet|date=22 October 1995|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louise_Dumont,_Hofgarten_Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|Dumont-Büste im Hofgarten (Düsseldorf). Die Büste wurde im Dezember 2012 gestohlen.]]
'''Louise Dumont''' (February 22, 1862 [[Cologne]] - 16 May 1932 Düsseldorf, née '''Louise Maria Hubertine Heynen''') was a German actress and theater director.

== Life ==
Louise Maria Hubertine Heynen, born on 22 February 1862 in [[Cologne]] near Neumarkt, was the second of eleven or twelve siblings.&lt;ref name=lsb/&gt; Her parents were the merchant Christian Joseph Hubert Heynen (born in 1837) and Maria Elisabeth Elise Dumont (born 1836 or 1837). By 1879, Louise was working as a seamstress, following her father's second bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=lsb/&gt; Louise Dumont auditioned in 1882 at the [[Residenz Theater]] in Berlin, where she received her first role. As her artist's name she chose her mother's maiden name, Dumont. In 1888, she won an engagement at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in Stuttgart, where she became acquainted with and a friend of [[Queen Charlotte]]. In 1898 Dumont left Stuttgart in order to join the [[Deutsches Theatre]] in Berlin, where she achieved her greatest successes, especially as a performer of pieces by Henrik Ibsen.

In 1903, she met [[Gustav Lindemann]]. As it was not possible for them to establish a theatre in Berlin because of local court intrigues, they then attempted to do so in Darmstadt, also without success. They finally succeeded in Düsseldorf, where Louise Dumont and Gustav Lindemann founded the Schauspielhaus Düsseldorf on 16 June 1904, as a direct competitor to the municipal theatre. Louise Dumont and Gustav Lindemann both contributed financially to the project, as did ten members of prestigious families like the Poensgens and the Luegs. The theatre opened on October 28, 1905, to which a theatre academy was later added. The academy trained a number of actors who significantly influenced German theatre life, such as [[Gustaf Gründgens]], Peter Esser, Adolf Dell, [[Paul Henckels]], [[Paul Kemp (actor)|Paul Kemp]], [[Wolfgang Langhoff]], Maria Alex and Henry Orthmayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duesseldorf.de/theatermuseum/th_mehr/tm_archiv_dateien/Ausstellungen_und_Veranstaltungen_2013/tm_rampenlicht.shtml auf duesseldorf.de/theatermuseum Eine Zeitreise mit Düsseldorfer Bühnenkünstlern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113539/http://www.duesseldorf.de/theatermuseum/th_mehr/tm_archiv_dateien/Ausstellungen_und_Veranstaltungen_2013/tm_rampenlicht.shtml |date=2016-03-04 }}, auf Theatermuseum Landeshauptstadt Düsseldorf, abgerufen am 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Louise Dumont married Gustav Lindemann. They separated in the 1920s, after which Dumont was attached to a number of young actresses, including [[Fita Benkhoff]], Hanni Hoessrich and [[Luise Rainer]]. It has been presumed that she was bisexual.&lt;ref name=lsb&gt;[http://www.lesbengeschichte.de/bio_dumont_d.html Bio of Dumont], lesbengeschichte.de, Retrieved 24 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
Louise Dumont is considered the 20th century successor to [[Friederike Caroline Neuber]]. She exerted less of a mimic-erotic fascination than a strong, convincing and defining gravity, which she understood as performing faithful service to the words of the author.
[[File:Grabstein_Louise_Dumont,_Gustav_Lindemann,_Nordfriedhof_Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|Gravestone of Louise Dumont and Gustav Lindemann, Nordfriedhof Düsseldorf]]

Dumont died in 1932 in Düsseldorf and was buried in the local cemetery. Her grave is decorated with a sculpture by [[Ernst Barlach]]. Her husband donated in her memory a necklace with a pearl-encircled topas that she had received as a present from Queen Charlotte of Württemberg, to be awarded to outstanding actresses during their lifetime. In 1976 she was featured on a postage stamp issued by the Deutsche Bundespost. The Louise-Dumont-Straße in Düsseldorf-Pempelfort was named after her.

'''Midreshet Ben-Gurion''' ({{lang-he-n|מִדְרֶשֶׁת בֶּן גּוּרְיוֹן}}), also known as '''Midreshet Sde Boker''', is an educational center and boarding school in southern [[Israel]]. Located in the [[Negev]] next to kibbutz [[Sde Boker]], it falls under the jurisdiction of [[Ramat HaNegev Regional Council]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Midreshet Ben Gurion}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

==History==
The construction of a field school began in 1962, inspired  by [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s vision of developing a thriving [[Jew]]ish culture in the arid Negev. The [[Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research]], affiliated with [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], the Ben Gurion Heritage Institute, and a [[high school]] emphasizing environmental studies, are now located there. Ben-Gurion and his wife [[Paula Ben-Gurion]] are buried on the cliff overlooking the Zin valley.

==Solar energy research ==
{{see also|Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center}}

The Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research has developed a [[Solar power in Israel|solar energy]] research program focusing on how extremes of heat and cold in the desert can be mitigated through efficient storage of heat during the day for release at night.

An [[adobe]] house was built with rational [[window|fenestration]], small windows in the northern side and heat collecting concrete prisms in the windows of the south facing wall. The prisms are situated in the rooms. They absorb heat during the day and can be rotated to allow the heat to discharge into the rooms at night.  The  "chimney" is part of an evaporative cooling system that maintains the temperature of the house during the day at bearable levels.

A double skin [[greenhouse]] uses [[copper]] [[sulfate]] solution as a heat screen during the day. The liquid is pumped between the two skins, protects the interior from [[ultraviolet]] rays and collects heat. At night the liquid is recirculated returning the heat to the greenhouse.

[[David Faiman]] of the Solar Center has made advancements in the realm of concentrator photovoltaics [[Concentrated photovoltaics|CPV]]. Faiman has produced a CPV unit capable of producing energy at a factor of up to a thousand more than conventional units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://132.72.126.71/NR/rdonlyres/86A56629-51FC-49A1-A05E-624839C6FECE/35433/NewOrlPETAL2.pdf PETAL: A research pathway to fossil-competitive solar electricity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703034308/http://132.72.126.71/NR/rdonlyres/86A56629-51FC-49A1-A05E-624839C6FECE/35433/NewOrlPETAL2.pdf |date=2011-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural and biotechnology research==
Researchers at Midreshet Ben-Gurion have made breakthroughs in agriculture and biotechnology relevant to [[drylands]] and sustainable agriculture. The STRS1 and STRS2 genes, master controller genes in stress responses, discovered by Dr. Simon Barak and his students in 2006, helped to elucidate some of the more important genes involved with abiotic stress responses &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/abstract/145/3/814 Helicases That Attenuate Arabidopsis Responses to Multiple Abiotic Stresses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Director of the institutes, [[Avigad Vonshak]], made headlines for his discovery, together with [[Prof. Sammy Boussiba]] (also of the institutes) of [[astaxanthin]] accumulation in green algae.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/32/7/1077 Astaxanthin Accumulation in the Green Alga Haematococcus pluvialis]&lt;/ref&gt; Astaxanthin is an extremely valuable poly-unsaturated fatty acid ([[PUFA]]) which is valued for its use as a pigment, nutritional value, and possible use in bio-diesel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23831">[[File:Guadec2013 - Marina Zhurakhinskaya.jpg|thumb|Marina Zhurakhinskaya presenting about the Outreach Program for Women at the [[GUADEC]] in August 2013]]
'''Outreachy '''(previously the '''Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program for Women''') is a program that organizes three-month paid internships with [[free and open-source software]] projects for people who are typically underrepresented in those projects. The program is organized by the [[Software Freedom Conservancy]] and was formerly organized by [[The GNOME Project]] and the [[GNOME Foundation]].

It is open to [[cisgender]] and [[transgender]] women, people of other gender identities that are minorities in open source (including transgender men and genderqueer people), and people of any gender in the United States who have racial/ethnic identities underrepresented in the US technology industry (Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander). Participants can be of any background and any age older than 18. Internships can focus on programming, design, documentation, marketing, or other kinds of contributions.

The program began in 2006 with a round of internships for women working on the [[GNOME]] [[desktop environment]] (which primarily runs on [[Linux]]), and it resumed in 2010 with internships twice a year, adding projects from other organizations starting in 2012. As of 2014, these rounds of internships have had up to 16 participating organizations, including [[Mozilla]] and the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Funding comes from the GNOME Foundation, [[Google]], organizations participating in the internships, and other software companies.

== Program details ==
[[File:Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program for Women January - April 2013 Flyer.png|thumb|Promotional flyer for January-April 2013 internships]]

The goal of Outreachy is to "create a positive feedback loop" that supports more women participating in free and open-source software, since contributors to free and open-source projects have mostly been men (see also [[Linux user group#Women in Libre software communities|Women in Libre software communities]]).&lt;ref name="journal-outreach"/&gt; The program is similar to [[Google Summer of Code]], also an internship in free and open-source software, but unlike Google Summer of Code it is not limited to students or developers.&lt;ref name="h-gsoc"/&gt; It is intended to be compatible with student schedules, with mid-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the northern hemisphere, and late-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="linux-reincarnates"/&gt;

The program began with inviting women participants, and it grew to include "anyone who was assigned female at birth and anyone who identifies as a woman, genderqueer, genderfluid, or genderfree regardless of gender presentation or assigned sex at birth".&lt;ref name="gnome-wiki"/&gt; The December 2014 round was also open to participants of the Ascend Project of any gender,&lt;ref name="gnome-wiki"/&gt; a training program for people from other groups underrepresented in open source.&lt;ref name="guardian-mozilla"/&gt; Starting in September 2015, Outreachy became open to "residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander", as people underrepresented in the technology industry in the US.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Outreachy Expands to People of Color Underrepresented in U.S. Tech|url = http://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/sep/18/outreachy-expands/|website = Software Freedom Conservancy|accessdate = 18 September 2015|date = 18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the application process, applicants have to make a contribution to the project they want to work with.&lt;ref name="linux-project"/&gt; Participants work remotely, so the internship includes a $500 travel budget to support interns meeting fellow contributors in person and develop stronger connections to the project.&lt;ref name="linux-project"/&gt; Participants also write a blog about their work, which one said "allowed me to meet many people interested in the same topic as myself and opened a completely different range of opportunities."&lt;ref name="martinez-encouraging"/&gt;

== Impact ==

The GNOME Project has noted several signs that the program has improved its recruitment and retention of women contributors. In April 2011, it said its 3.0 release "included more contributions by women than any previous release, an increase the project attributes [to] its new internship program."&lt;ref name="linux-new"/&gt; In November 2011, it said the program had also helped recruit seven women to its Google Summer of Code program that year, in comparison to one or zero women in previous years.&lt;ref name="gnome-impress"/&gt; At the project's annual conference, [[GUADEC]], 17% of attendees (41) in 2012 were women, "compared to only 4% (6 women) among attendees affiliated with GNOME three years earlier at the Desktop Summit 2009."&lt;ref name="gnome-ten"/&gt; In June 2013, program co-organizer [[Marina Zhurakhinskaya]] said half of the 41 participants had continued to contribute to GNOME after their internships, including five becoming mentors for the program.&lt;ref name="linux-project"/&gt;

Wikimedia said that working with the Outreach Program for Women and Google Summer of Code caused the project to develop better resources for newcomers interested in contributing to Wikimedia in general, including documentation and lists of suitable projects for newcomers.&lt;ref name="wikimedia-catalysts"/&gt;

In 2013, [[Bruce Byfield]] said "Already, the program could claim to be the most successful FOSS program for women ever."&lt;ref name="linux-project"/&gt; In March 2014, the [[Free Software Foundation]] gave the program its annual Award for Projects of Social Benefit as part of the [[FSF Free Software Awards]], saying that the program does "critical work", "addressing gender discrimination by empowering women to develop leadership and development skills in a society which runs on technology."&lt;ref name="free-award"/&gt;

Explaining what has made the program effective, Zhurakhinskaya said "You just need to say that women are welcome in your project, because that in itself sends a signal. Also, you want specific people they can get in touch with to do their first patch and to ask questions."&lt;ref name="linux-reincarnates"/&gt;

In June 2015, an Outreachy coordinator and Linux kernel contributor, [[Sage Sharp]], won a [[Red Hat]] Women in Open Source Award for "efforts in improving communications and inviting women into open source communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Winner of the first Red Hat Women in Open Source Community Award|url = http://opensource.com/business/15/6/red-hat-women-open-source-award-winner-sarah-sharp|website = opensource.com|accessdate = 18 September 2015|date = 23 June 2015|last = Endsley|first = Rikki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introducing our first Women in Open Source Award winners|url = http://www.redhat.com/en/about/women-in-open-source|website = Red Hat|accessdate = 18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, program co-organizer Marina Zhurakhinskaya won an [[O'Reilly Open Source Award]] for her work on Outreachy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview with Marina Zhurakhinskaya, Red Hat|url = http://opensource.com/life/15/8/interview-marina-zhurakhinskaya-outreachy|website = opensource.com|accessdate = 18 September 2015|date = 24 August 2015|last = Wike Huger|first = Jen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Women's Summer Outreach Program ===
In 2006, [[Hanna Wallach]] and [[Chris Ball]] noticed there were no women among the 181 applicants to GNOME's internship program with [[Google Summer of Code]], and they decided to run GNOME's Women's Summer Outreach Program (WSOP) to invite participation from women.&lt;ref name="linux-project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="journal-outreach"/&gt; They organized it in about a month and focused on student developers.&lt;ref name="journal-now"/&gt; They received 100 applications and selected six for internships, half sponsored by the GNOME Foundation and half by Google.&lt;ref name="ostatic-revamps"/&gt; The students reported positive experiences and continued to use free and open-source software after the internship, but many of them did not have their work integrated into the main codebase.&lt;ref name="journal-now"/&gt;

=== GNOME Outreach Program for Women ===
In 2009, the GNOME community decided to revive the program as part of continuing efforts to encourage more women to contribute to GNOME, renaming it to the GNOME Outreach Program for Women.&lt;ref name="linux-barbie"/&gt; The GNOME Foundation board appointed Marina Zhurakhinskaya to organize it, including finding mentors for the program.&lt;ref name="linux-reincarnates"/&gt; The program's internship options expanded to include non-coding work such as documentation and localization,&lt;ref name="linux-internships"/&gt; and it opened up to non-student applicants. To increase chances of success, the new application process included making an improvement to the project, and the internship shifted to encouraging several tasks incrementally incorporated into the main project, instead of one larger project like Google Summer of Code.&lt;ref name="linux-reincarnates"/&gt; After restructuring the program and finding interested projects and mentors within GNOME, they selected eight interns in November 2010.&lt;ref name="linux-selected"/&gt;

Another eight interns, from five continents, began in May 2011.&lt;ref name="itweb-zulu"/&gt; They included Priscilla Mahlangu, a [[South Africa]]n woman translating GNOME desktop software into the [[Zulu language]].&lt;ref name="itweb-zulu"/&gt; Twelve interns started in November 2011, with sponsorship from [[Collabora]], [[Google]], [[Mozilla]], [[Red Hat]], and the GNOME Foundation.&lt;ref name="gnome-impress"/&gt;

For the May 2012 round, the Software Freedom Conservancy joined the program with an internship with the [[Twisted (software)|Twisted project]], mentored by [[Jessica McKellar]].&lt;ref name="conservancy-twisted"/&gt; Nine other interns worked on GNOME.&lt;ref name="gnome-new"/&gt; 

=== Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program for Women ===
The January 2013 round of the program, renamed to the Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program for Women, expanded to provide 25 internships with 10 organizations ([[Deltacloud]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], GNOME, [[JBoss]], Mozilla, [[Open Technology Institute]], [[OpenITP]], [[OpenStack]], [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]], and [[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia]]), with GNOME Foundation Executive Director [[Karen Sandler]] joining Zhurakhinskaya in organizing the program.&lt;ref name="gnome-ten" /&gt;

The June 2013 internships included seven participants contributing to the [[Linux kernel]], for example working on [[parallel computing|parallelizing]] the [[x86]] [[booting|boot]] process.&lt;ref name="linux-outreach"/&gt; Led by kernel contributor [[Sage Sharp]], who found mentors and projects for the interns, they made significant contributions to the 3.11 kernel release.&lt;ref name="intel-kernel"/&gt; This round had 37 interns working with 16 organizations,&lt;ref name="wiki-june2013"/&gt; and the next round starting in December 2013 had 30 interns working with 8 organizations.&lt;ref name="wiki-december2013"/&gt;

In April 2014, the GNOME Foundation temporarily froze nonessential expenditures because of a budget shortfall linked to the Outreach Program for Women; it paid interns on a schedule that was sometimes before payments from sponsoring organizations arrived.&lt;ref name="pcworld-crunch"/&gt; This was related to the program growing quickly, and the Foundation said it would follow up with those organizations and take other steps to resolve the problem.&lt;ref name="zdnet-dry"/&gt; GNOME Foundation board meeting notes from June 2015 indicate that the problem was resolved with all outstanding payments collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Minutes for Friday, June 5th, 2015, 14:00 UTC|url = https://wiki.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/Minutes/20150605|website = The GNOME Wiki|accessdate = 19 September 2015|publisher = The GNOME Project|date = 15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 2014 round had 40 participants and 16 organizations.&lt;ref name="wiki-may2014"/&gt;

The December 2014 round was open to participants of the Ascend Project of any gender,&lt;ref name="gnome-wiki" /&gt; a training program for people from groups underrepresented in open source.&lt;ref name="guardian-mozilla" /&gt;

=== Outreachy ===
In February 2015, the program announced its rename to Outreachy, while management of the program transferred to the Software Freedom Conservancy with the GNOME Foundation participating as a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/feb/04/outreachy-joins/|title = Outreach Program to Join Conservancy from GNOME; Program Renames to Outreachy|date = 4 February 2015|accessdate = 5 March 2015|website = Software Freedom Conservancy|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in September 2015, Outreachy became open to "residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander", as people underrepresented in the technology industry in the US.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Outreachy Expands to People of Color Underrepresented in U.S. Tech|url = http://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/sep/18/outreachy-expands/|website = Software Freedom Conservancy|accessdate = 18 September 2015|date = 18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professional requirements for architects''' vary from place to place, but usually consist of three elements: a university degree or advanced education, a period of [[internship]] or training in an office, and examination for registration with a jurisdiction.

Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they usually carried the title of [[Architect|Master Builder]], or [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/surveyor surveyor], after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir [[Christopher Wren]]). The formal study of architecture in [[academic institution]]s played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.

In Australia, the title of architect is legally limited to those registered through state and territory Architects Registration Boards. These boards are affiliated through the [[Architects Accreditation Council of Australia]] (AACA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaca.org.au/index.html Architect Registration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025175440/http://www.aaca.org.au/index.html |date=2009-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AACA also conducts assessments for architects with overseas qualifications for the purposes of [[Human migration|migration]] and/or registration as an architect in Australia. University Schools of Architecture are accredited by state and territory boards, based on a procedure jointly agreed by the AACA and the [[Australian Institute of Architects]].

There are three key requirements for registration: a [[professional degree]] from an accredited school of architecture; at least two years of practical experience; and the completion of the architectural practice examination.

Architects may also be members of the [[Australian Institute of Architects]] (formerly the Royal Australian Institute of Architects), which is the professional organization. Members use the post-nominal letters RAIA.

All states and territories have legislation to govern the use of the title ''architect'' and make it an offence for anyone other than a registered architect to use the title. As exact requirements can vary, it is essential to check the relevant legislation in each State.

===Canada===
In Canada, architects are required to meet three common requirements for registration: education, experience, and [[Test (assessment)|examination]]. Educational requirements generally consist of an M.Arch. degree and are certified by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB). For degreed candidates, the experience requirement is typically the [[Intern Architect Program]] (IAP). The provincial associations of architects, by the authority granted under their respective provincial Architects Act, require that Interns gain a minimum of 5,600 hours of work experience. The fundamental purpose of the pre-registration/licensing employment period is to ensure that the Intern is provided with sufficient experience to meet the standards of practical skill and level of competence required to engage in the practice of architecture. This experience is diversified into four main categories and 16 sub-categories, and must be completed working under the direct supervision of a registered architect. At present, all jurisdictions use the [[Architect Registration Examination]] (ARE), a series of seven computerized exams administered by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB). As well, all jurisdictions recognize the [[Examination for Architects in Canada]] (ExAC), administered by the [[Pan Canadian ExAC Committee]]. Upon completion of the educational requirements, IAP, and examinations, one can apply for registration/license with their respective provincial architectural institute.  Architects must pay an annual fee and meet continuing education requirements to maintain their license to practice.

The [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] (RAIC) was established in 1907 and is a voluntary national association representing more than 3,600 architects and Faculty and graduates of accredited Canadian Schools of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raic.org/Royal Architectural Institute of Canada ]&lt;/ref&gt; The RAIC aims to be "the voice of Architecture and its practice in Canada". Members are permitted to use the suffix MRAIC after their names. The suffix FRAIC (Fellow of the RAIC) is used by members of the RAIC College of Fellows. Not all members of the RAIC hold accredited degrees in architecture, and not all Canadian architects are members of the RAIC.

===France===

==== Professional Requirements ====

To practice as a project manager (maître d'oeuvre in French), an architect must meet the following requirements :
* hold a M.Arch or [[Master's degree]] in Architecture, (the M.Arch solely doesn't allow to hold the "Architect Title" in France) 
* hold the "Capacitation for project management in its own name" certificate (HMONP, Habilitation à la Maîtrise d'Oeuvre en Nom Propre, in French) 
* being registered to the [[:fr:Conseil national de l'ordre des architectes|National Architects Order Board]], the French institution that protects the ''architect'' title and profession. 
* have a Professional Liability insurance coverage

==== Legal References &amp; background ====
In France the profession is defined and regulated by the 1977 Law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=396AE8E5B5888812ECBCB4AFC0575A80.tpdjo07v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006175989&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006074075&amp;dateTexte=20140504 Law n°77-2 01/03/1977 about architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; which defines architecture as follows:

''"Architecture is an expression of culture. Architectural design, quality of buildings, their harmonious incorporation into their surroundings, respect for natural and urban landscapes and architectural heritage are of public interest. The authorities responsible for issuing building permits and authorizations to subdivide ensure, during the processing of applications, compliance with this interest"''

This law, amongst others, sets the educational requirements to practice as an architect, and the rules under which exercise of the profession of architecture, in Titles III and IV.

According to the 1977 law,''"Anyone wishing to undertake a construction subject to an application for a building permit, shall resort to an architect in order to establish the architectural project,"'' But the "Code for Urbanism" sets the actual conditions and limits of mandatory resorting to the architect.
Contracting with an architect is mandatory solely if the construction project is in excess of 170 sqm flooring surface /or footprint on the parcel (this threshold rise up to 800 sqm for any farming building).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=396AE8E5B5888812ECBCB4AFC0575A80.tpdjo07v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006175989&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006074075&amp;dateTexte=20140504 Article R*431-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture in France fully depends on the Culture Department of the French government, so does The National Superior Schools of Architecture, and the National Architects Order Board.

==== Education ====
Education is provided by one of the 20 ENSA (National Superior School of Architecture) schools spread across the French territory, which are public schools. Tuition fees rise around 700 euros per year. See [[:fr:etudes d'architecture en France|Etudes d'Architecture en France]](in French).

===Germany===
In Germany, the title of architect is legally limited to those registered with a provincial Chamber of Architects (Architektenkammer http://www.architektenkammern.net/).  Admission to a German chamber of architects is required for someone to be a professional architect. The chambers also register interior designers, landscape architects, and urban planners.(http://www.architekten-thueringen.de/english/)

There are three general requirements for registration, which vary from chamber to chamber: successful completion of a four-year architectural program, continuing professional education, and several years of practical experience under a registered architect. The registration with a chamber of architects is based on either place of residence of the architect or their workplace.

All provincial Chambers of Architects are members of the Federal Chamber of Architects (BAK - Bundesarchitektenkammer) located in Berlin. The federal chamber does not provide professional registration.

===India===
For carrying professional practice in [[India]], architects are required to register with [http://www.coa.gov.in/ Council of Architecture], which is constituted by the Government of India under the provisions of the Architects Act, 1972. The profession of an [[architect]] is governed by the Architects Regulations, 1989 (as amended in 2003).

The [http://www.coa.gov.in/ COA] registration service also provides accreditation for [[:Category:Architecture schools in India|institutions]] providing the degree of architecture, which is minimum five years duration including professional practice for 16 working weeks (one semester). There are about 280 institutions including constituent colleges/departments of universities, deemed universities, affiliated colleges/schools, IITs, NITs and autonomous institutions that impart architectural education in India leading to recognized qualifications. Indian law recognizes equal rights to [[Civil Engineer]] registered with the appropriate order. The under graduate degree program in Civil Engineering is of four year duration with out professional practice.

===Ireland===
The main body for Architecture in Ireland is the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, RIAI. Members may use the [[affix]] MRIAI and are registered to use the title "Architect" in company stationery. The title has only recently been protected.

To become a registered Architect, it usually takes five years' full-time study in the recognised schools of Architecture, followed by a minimum of two years approved experience, and one of the recognised Professional Practice qualifications [http://www.riai.ie/admissions/professional_practice_exam] to gain admission to the RIAI . In all, it takes a minimum of seven years to gain registration. More details can be found on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100928211424/http://www.riai.ie/about_the_riai RIAI website].

An alternate route to the Register is available through the ARAE (Architects Register Admission Examination) [http://www.arae.ie]- this provides an opportunity for those without the required educational and professional qualifications to enter the Register in Ireland. This examination has operated successfully since 2009.

[[Architects' Alliance of Ireland]] is a group of long-established self-trained architects created in response to Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007.  The Act seeks for the first time to control the use of the term 'architect' in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environ.ie/en/Legislation/DevelopmentandHousing/BuildingStandards/FileDownLoad,5078,en.pdf The Building Control Act 2007], Irish Legislation&lt;/ref&gt; The group is lobbying for an amendment of the legislation to restore the prior status of [[Autodidacticism|self-trained]] architects in the profession.

===Italy===
To enter the profession in Italy, individuals are required to first obtain a degree in Architecture, or a degree in Building Engineering/ Architecture, then to receive professional qualification, obtained by passing a state exam with four tests (three written and one oral). To practice, the architect must register with the ''Ordine degli architetti'' (Order of Architects), which following a recent reform also includes planners, landscape architects and conservationists (architectural heritage). The Orders are organised by province, and registration is based on place of residence of the architect. Within the order there are currently several classes and categories, depending on specific qualifications.

Italian law recognises equal rights to [[Building engineer]]s registered with the appropriate order. Other professionals in the construction industry are the ''geometra'' ([[Surveying|surveyor]]) and the ''perito industriale'' (technical expert) specialising in construction; these professionals have several limitations compared to architects and engineers, as they follow a different and shorter course of study aimed at learning basic and complementary aspects of work in construction.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, every profession is regulated by the [[Secretariat of Public Education]], including architecture. The Secretariat expedes a Professional License (in Spanish ''cédula profesional''), only after a recognized undergraduate degree is successfully achieved. Therefore, it is legally sufficient for an architect to hold an undergraduate diploma and a Professional License to practice. Registration to an official college or association of architects is completely optional.

Nevertheless, other norms regulate the building industry. In Mexico, it is common for constructions to be developed by individuals other than architects, these regulations are quite unrelated to the architecture profession. For a major construction, it is necessary for a professional to act as a Director Responsible of Construction (in Spanish, ''Director Responsable de Obra'' or ''DRO''). This position does require a minimum of two years of professional experience in construction, as well as further evaluation and/or training. However, it is uncommon for architects to assume this role; this is generally a position preferred by and reserved to [[civil engineers]].

===Singapore===
In [[Singapore]], university study is required (such as the five-year course of study at the [[National University of Singapore]] or certain approved foreign universities). Upon completion of university, additional training by working for a minimum of two years under a registered architect is required to become registered. Singaporean law governs the use of the term "architect" and prescribes the requirements to be listed in the Register of Architects. Membership in the [[Singapore Institute of Architects]] is a voluntary professional credential.

===South Africa===
{{See also|List of architecture schools in South Africa}}
In South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Sourced from: [http://www.saia.org.za/education_careers.php The South African Institute of Architects]; [http://www.sacapsa.com The South African Council for the Architectural Profession], with the document [http://www.sacapsa.com/sacap/action/media/downloadFile?media_fileid=303 "Registering Persons With Qualifications"]; [http://www.saidraughting.com/online.asp The South African Institute of Draughting].&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture can be practiced in one of four categories, depending on qualification: professional architect (Pr.Arch.), professional senior [[architectural technologist]] (Pr.S.Arch.T.), professional technologist (Pr.Arch.T.), or professional [[draughtsperson]] (Pr.Arch.Draught.).  The possibility of progression from one category to the next has been provided for in the Regulations, and is under review.

When studied through a University, the programme is structured in two parts: the first is a three-year course leading to a [[Bachelor of Architectural Studies]] or [[BSc|BSc (Architecture)]]. The second is an additional two-year postgraduate, [[professional degree]]—either the [[Bachelor of Architecture]] or [[Master of Architecture]], depending on University—which qualifies an individual to become an architect.  A student can exit university after obtaining the first degree, and can become a senior architectural technologist.  When studied through a [[University of Technology]] (or a [[comprehensive university]]), the courses in architecture are a three-year [[National Diploma (South Africa)|National Diploma]], and, after an additional year of study, the [[Bachelor of Technology#South Africa|B.Tech degree]]. These enable a student to become an architectural technologist or senior technologist, respectively.  To become a draughtsperson, one requires a (two year) National Certificate.

After graduating, one enters a two-year period of [[Internship|in service training]] as a "candidate", and sits a [http://www.sacapsa.com/sacap/view/sacap/en/page254 Professional Practice entrance examination]; one must also register with the [[South African Council for the Architectural Profession]]. Qualified architects can become members of the [[South African Institute of Architects]].

===Sri Lanka===
Term "Architect" and "Chartered Architect" are protected titles in [[Sri Lanka]] under the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects law (act) no. 1 of 1976 and the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (Amendment) Act, No. 14 of 1996.

In Sri Lanka, architects are required to meet three common requirements for registration: education, experience, and examination. The Education can be from one of the two available institutions; the degree course held by [[University of Moratuwa]] or by the part-time course held by the City School of Architecture (owned by the Sri Lanka institute of Architects) or by any foreign university recognized by the SLIA.

The University of Moratuwa has been offering a "3+2" program recognized by both the [http://www.slia.lk/ SLIA] and [http://www.architecture.com/ RIBA]; a three-year B.Sc. (Built Environment) degree and a two-year masters, M. Sc. (Architecture). This with the 2 years of appropriate work experience and successful completion of SLIA Part III examination would lead to the charter and the Architectural Registration Board (ARB) registration.

Recently, the University of Moratuwa has changed the "3+2" program to a continuous five-year B.Arch. program.

City School of Architecture offers a part-time course of seven years during which the students should be working continuously under the supervision of a Chartered Architect while attending the school on a part-time basis. Completion of the first four years of this program qualifies for SLIA part I and completion of the balance after 3 years qualifies for SLIA part II. Successful completion of this program with the 1 year of appropriate work experience and successful completion of SLIA Part III examination would lead to the charter and the Architectural Registration Board (ARB) registration.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, practicing under the name, style or title "architect" is restricted by law to those registered at the [[Architects Registration Board]]. It usually takes a minimum of seven years to obtain the necessary [[professional certification|qualification]]s and experience for registration. Those wishing to become registered must first study at a recognised university-level school of architecture. Though there are some variations from university to university, the basic principle is that to qualify as an architect, a candidate must pass through three stages administered by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]:

*On completing an initial degree in architecture (usually three or four years, usually either a BA, BSc, or BArch) the candidate receives exemption from RIBA Part I. There then follows a period of a minimum of one year, which the candidate spends in an architect's office gaining work experience.
*The candidate must then complete a post-graduate university course, usually two years, to receive either a graduate diploma (Dip Arch), Masters (MArch) or B(Arch). On completing that course, the candidate receives exemption from Part II of the RIBA process.
*The candidate must then spend a further period of at least one year gaining experience before being allowed to take the RIBA Part III examination in Professional Practice and Management.

===United States===
In the United States, people wishing to become licensed architects are required to meet the requirements of their respective state. Each state has a registration board to oversee that state's [[licensure]] laws. [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] is a non-profit professional association created in 1919 to help ensure parity between the states' often conflicting rules. The registration boards of each of the 50 states (and 5 territories), member boards.  NCARB issues a national certificate to qualified licensed architects. The NCARB certificate is recognized in most licensing jurisdictions for the purpose of granting licensure by endorsement or [[:wikt:reciprocity|reciprocity]].

Requirements vary among jurisdictions, and there are three common requirements for registration: education, experience and examination. About half of the States require a professional degree from a school accredited by the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB) to satisfy their education requirement; this would be either a [[Bachelor of Architecture|B.Arch]] or [[Master of Architecture|M.Arch]] degree. The experience requirement for degreed candidates is typically the Architectural Experience Program (AXP), a joint program of and the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA). AXP creates a framework to identify for the [[intern architect]] base skills and core-competencies. The intern architect needs to earn roughly three years worth of experience across six specified divisions (Practice Management, Project Management, Programming &amp; Analysis, Project Planning &amp; Design, Project Development &amp; Documentation, and Construction &amp; Evaluation) all while working under the direct supervision of a licensed Architect. The states that waive the degree requirement typically require a full 10 years' experience in combination with the AXP diversification requirements before the candidate is eligible to sit for the examination. California requires C-IDP (Comprehensive Intern Development Program), which builds upon the seat time requirement of IDP with the need to document learning having occurred. All jurisdictions use the [[Architect Registration Examination]] (ARE), a series of six (formerly seven) computerized exams administered by NCARB. The NCARB also has a certification for those architects meeting NCARB's model standard: NAAB degree, AXP and ARE passage. This certificate facilitates reciprocity between the member boards should an architect desire registration in a different jurisdiction. All architects licensed by their respective states have professional status as Registered Architects (RA).

Depending on the policies of the registration board for the state in question, it is sometimes possible to become licensed as an Architect in other ways: reciprocal licensure for over-seas architects and working under an architect as an intern for an extended period of time. Length of the typical licensure process depends on the particular combination of education, experience and pace of examination of a candidate. It is typical that the entire licensure process takes at least 7 to 11 years to complete; including five years of study (5 years for B.Arch, 3 years for M.Arch, 6 years for a "four-plus-two" program), three-plus years of experience (meeting exact IDP requirements in each category), and often a year or more to take and pass the seven ARE 4.0 exams.

He performed with [[Complexions Contemporary Ballet]] and Alpha Omega Theatrical Dance Company before founding BalaSole Dance Company.

== Early life and career ==
Born and raised in Manila, after graduating early from [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] Villanueva moved to New York to study accounting at the [[University of Buffalo]]. Taking an introductory dance class to fulfill physical education requirements led him to switch his concentration to dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/pinoyabroad/252310/balasole-a-dance-company-where-size-does-not-matter/story/|title=BalaSole: A dance company where 'size' does not matter|work=GMA News Online|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he won the Dance Masters of America Competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://buffalonews.com/1992/07/19/behind-the-scenes-437/|title=BEHIND THE SCENES|date=1992-07-19|work=The Buffalo News|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a special scholarship to the school of [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]].

The '''Royal Hibernian Military School''' was founded in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], to educate orphaned children of members of the British armed forces in Ireland. In 1922 the Royal Hibernian Military School moved to Shorncliffe, in Folkestone, Kent, and in 1924 it was merged with the Duke of York's Royal Military School which last, by then, was in its current location atop 'Lone Tree Hill' above Dover Castle.

==General==
The foundation of the School came about in 1769 when [[King George III]] granted a [[Charter of Incorporation]] on 15 July, the School [[Governors]] holding their inaugural meeting on 6 November in [[Dublin Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achart.ca/hibernian/index.html |title=Delta Tech Systems : Welcome |website=Achart.ca |quotation=This is the site of choice for histories of the Duke of York's and Hibernian military schools, opposing views on 19th Century Army education, dedicated military history, and journalism of interest. |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings housing the school were erected in 1771 in the [[Phoenix Park]], overlooking the village of [[Chapelizod]] in the Liffey valley (in full view of [[Wicklow]] mountains). The chapel was designed by [[Thomas Cooley (architect)|Thomas Cooley]], while thirty years later [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]] designed the extensions to the buildings. It first took in 90 boys and 50 girls as pupils (in the charge of an Inspector and Inspectress, assisted by the Chaplain and an assistant mistress) in March 1770.  The site originally occupied {{convert|3|acre|m2}} but by 1922 its boundary walls enclosed thirty three acres.

By 1808 the system and organisation of the school followed closely that of its sister school, the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]] (then at [[Chelsea, London]], [[England]]). By 1816, when Thomas Le Fanu (father of [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]) took over as chaplain, there were 600 children at the school.

In 1853 the school's first [[Regimental Colour|"stand of colours"]] were presented by the then [[Prince of Wales]] and, in the same year, the girls at the school left to join their own separate establishment, the Drummond School, which was founded for them at [[Chapelizod]].

The school acted as a feeder to the British Army, where In the mid-19th century, children as young as 12 could enlist in the Army but generally enlistment began at 14. By the 1900s 50 per cent of pupils were going straight into the army. By this stage the school was not only an orphanage; for instance, the Army Non-Commissioned Officer father of [[Liam Mellows]] entered him there to get a good basic military training which he hoped would lead to an army career, instead it was used during the [[Easter Rising]] and the [[Irish War of Independence]], both in fighting and in training the flying columns in guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0779%20Section%201.pdf#page=72 |format=PDF |title=Witness Statement : Robert Brennan |page=45 |website=Bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Fuller''' (February 15, 1836 – August 1, 1927) was an
[[United States|American]] [[educator]].

==Biography==
She was born in [[Weston, Massachusetts]] to Harvey and Celynda (Fiske) Fuller, and was educated at Allan English and Classical School, located in [[West Newton, Massachusetts|West Newton]]. After graduating in 1855, she taught in Newton and [[Boston]]. In 1869, she trained at the Clarke School for the Deaf under Harriet B. Rogers, then became principal at the newly formed Boston School for Deaf-Mutes; a school founded on the behest of Rev. Dexter S. King. In 1871, the school staff was trained in the skill of teaching deaf children how to speak by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. Sarah became an advocate of this practice, as well as the promotion of education for deaf children starting at the earliest age possible. She was also present when the first message was sent over the telephone. 

In 1890, Fuller applied the methods she learned and developed from Bell in giving the first speech lessons to [[Helen Keller]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r5oWAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=%22sarah+fuller%22+%22helen+keller%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rm_gS7X6HZHsNLzs3c8J&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sarah%20fuller%22%20%22helen%20keller%22&amp;f=false ''Dumb no longer: romance of the telephone''] By Fred De Land&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, she published ''An Illustrated Primer'' for teachers of the deaf. She helped found the ''American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf'' in 1890, and became director of that association in 1896. She founded the Home for Little Deaf Children in 1902, and retired as a principal in 1910. Sarah died in [[Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts]], and is buried in [[Saint Mary's Cemetery (Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts)|Saint Mary's Cemetery]]. She was a poetic writer.

==Legacy==
The Sarah Fuller Foundation for Little Deaf Children (1888-1972) was named after her.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2972">'''Scene study''' is a technique used to teach [[acting]]. One or more [[actor]]s perform a [[drama]]tic [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] and are then offered feedback from teachers, classmates, or each other.

Scene Study is a very broad description for an acting class that will vary depending on the teacher or school that teaches it.  Its foundation is in the performance of a "scene" or a segment of a play by the students.  From this performance the instructor gives notes and suggestions to improve the student’s acting. Scene Study is instrumental for actors to get experience being directed.   For beginning actors the Scene Study class may also include acting exercises that help them develop their technique. In actor Uta Hagen's novel, ''Respect for Acting'' she mentions the three entrances in Part Two, chapter twelve. The moment before is the first entrance, the actor must think of the scene before if it is his or her first time entering. If the actor enters in scene one, then he or she must think of what the character's circumstances before the play would be. These exercises may help with skills such as emotional connection or character development and for the real novice it may be used to teach the vocabulary of acting (for example terms like down stage and subtext). Other acting vocabulary includes objective, tactics, essential action, character, scene, acts, costumes, setting, and literal action. Objective, essential action, and literal action relates to what the character wants, as well as what the character is doing. Tactics are what the character does in order to get what they want. The other terms are design elements or basic elements that one sees on stage. It is the job of the actor to implement all of these terms in order to create a believable moment. However, most Scene Study classes are used for actors who already have their training and technique and now need the opportunity to take their skills and apply them towards performing on stage or on set.  The best Scene Study classes will be able to keep improving an actor’s technique, as well as give them the opportunity to be directed and see if they are able to perform to a director’s specification.  Scene Study is important because it allows an actor to see if all the techniques and exercises they use in class can be harnessed to create an honest and dynamic performance. Scene study is also important because the actor needs to focus on the other actor. Reacting is just as important as acting, if the actor fails to react to their scene partner then the believability diminishes. Scene study gives the actors the opportunity to work together and remember that it is not "all about them."

==History==
In 1927, [[Alois Benjamin Saliger]] invented the Psycho-Phone for sleep learning, stating that "It has been proven that natural sleep is identical with hypnotic sleep and that during natural sleep the unconscious mind is most receptive to suggestions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Psycho-Phone |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlUQAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Saliger+psycho-phone&amp;dq=Saliger+psycho-phone&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iorlTL2SDMmr8Aa5s-i6DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA |quote=Well, sir, since 1927, Mr. Saliger has sold more than 2500 Psycho-phones ... |work=[[The New Yorker]] |year=1933 |accessdate=2010-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[electroencephalography]] studies by [[Charles W. Simon]] and [[William H. Emmons]] in 1956, learning by sleep has not been taken seriously. The researchers concluded that learning during sleep was "impractical and probably impossible". They reported that stimulus material presented during sleep was not recalled later when the subject awoke unless [[alpha wave]] activity occurred at the same time the stimulus material was given. Since alpha activity during sleep indicates the subject is about to awake, the researchers felt that any learning occurred in a waking state.&lt;ref name = "hyp"&gt;{{cite book

In 2012, research from the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] indicated that [[classical conditioning]] can occur during sleep by using odor recognition. "During sleep, humans can strengthen previously acquired memories, but whether they can acquire entirely new information remains unknown. The nonverbal nature of the olfactory sniff response, in which pleasant odors drive stronger sniffs and unpleasant odors drive weaker sniffs, allowed us to test learning in humans during sleep."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Arzi | first1 = A. | last2 = Shedlesky | first2 = L. | last3 = Ben-Shaul | first3 = M. | last4 = Nasser | first4 = K. | last5 = Oksenberg | first5 = A. | last6 = Hairston | first6 = I.

==In fiction==
The idea of sleep-learning is found in influential [[science fiction]] and other literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sleepdex.org/hypnopaedia.htm|title=Hypnopaedia - sleep learning|work=sleepdex.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following examples are listed chronologically by publication or original air date, when known.

* In [[Hugo Gernsback]]'s 1911 story ''[[Ralph 124C 41+]]'', one finds the Hypnobioscope, a sleep learning device.
* In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1932 novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', it is used for the [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] of children into the novel's fictional future culture. In the novel, sleep-learning was discovered by accident when a Polish boy named Reuben Rabinovitch was able to recite an entire radio broadcast in English after a radio receiver was left on in his sleep. The boy was unable to comprehend what he had heard via hypnopædia, but it was soon realized that hypnopædia could be used to effectively make suggestions about morality.
* In Robert Heinlein's 1948 novel ''[[Space Cadet]]'', the character Matt Dodson is taught to speak Venutian (the language of the planet Venus) while under drug-aided hypnosis. He surprises his Venus-born friend Oscar by spontaneously reproving him when Oscar utters a curse in Venutian. (Later in the novel Matt appears to have forgotten what he learned and relies on Oscar for translation.)
* In the [[BBC Radio]] series ''[[Journey into Space]]'' (1953–1958), during the second and third parts of the trilogy, there were said to be [[Martian]]s abducting people from the Earth and [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] them to obey instructions or to make them believe things that were not true. The inception of this conditioning involved putting the subject into a [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] sleep and appraising them of a certain situation; once they awoke they would believe it, regardless of the validity.
* In a 1961 episode of ''[[My Three Sons]]'', "A Lesson In Any Language", Mike connects a [[phonograph]] to an automatic timer to play [[Spanish language|Spanish]] lessons while he sleeps. Steve and Bub ultimately end up sleeping in the room and are able to speak fluent Spanish the following day.
* In [[Anthony Burgess]]'s 1962 novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', it is used to reverse the effects of the Ludovico Technique, a form of [[classical conditioning]], which was used on the main character Alex to make him incapable of violent behavior. The conditioning was a new technique which was supposed to rehabilitate violent criminals in a short period of time, but which resulted in Alex attempting to commit [[suicide]]. This reflected very badly on the government, which had sanctioned the experiment, so hypnopædia was used to undo the conditioning.
* In a 1963 episode of ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]'', "The Conquering Hero", Cathy tries to help a failing basketball player pass a quiz. She suggests that the latest scientific method of "[[subconscious]] learning" will help. She records the lessons on a tape which plays repeatedly while he is asleep. He passes the quiz after the answers "come to him" while looking at the questions.
* In the 1965 episode of "I Spy" titled Chrysanthemum, the assigned partner of Bill Cosby and Robert Culp's characters, Maximilian de Broget claims to have learned Mandarin Chinese in his sleep.
* In the 1965 movie ''[[The Monkey's Uncle]]'', a college student connects a phonograph to an automatic timer, which plays to sleeping students the voice of a girl reading their lessons aloud. This backfires in class, however — when asked to give an oral report, the students speak, but in the girl's voice.

'''SparkNotes''', originally part of a website called The Spark, is a company started by [[Harvard]] students [[Sam Yagan]], Max Krohn, Chris Coyne, and Eli Bolotin in 1999 that originally provided [[study guide]]s for [[literature]], [[poetry]], [[history]], [[film]], and [[philosophy]]. Later, SparkNotes expanded to provide study guides for a number of other subjects, including [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[health]], [[math]], [[physics]], and [[sociology]]. SparkNotes does not charge users but instead earns revenue from advertising.

[[Barnes &amp; Noble]] acquired SparkNotes.com in 2001 for approximately $3.5 million.&lt;ref name="Barnes-&amp;-Noble-inc-Jun-2001-10-Q"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1142/95012301503532/filing-main.htm |title=Barnes &amp; Noble inc, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Jun 18, 2001 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=May 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515112509/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1142/95012301503532/filing-main.htm |archive-date=May 15, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
TheSpark.com was a literary website launched by four [[Harvard]] students on January 7, 1999. Most of TheSpark's users were high school and college students. To increase the site's popularity, the creators published the first six literature study guides (called "SparkNotes") on April 7, 1999.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stacy |last=Martin |title=SITE SPECIFIC-www.sparknotes.com |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/09/05/LVGE88I6RA1.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc. |location=San Francisco |date=5 September 2004 |accessdate=2006-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050131025114/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F09%2F05%2FLVGE88I6RA1.DTL |archive-date=31 January 2005 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite news |first=Anais |last=Borja |author2=Lester, Amelia |title=The Rise and Success of Sparknotes |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=121750 |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=The Harvard Crims0n Inc. |location=Harvard |date=18 October 2001 |accessdate=2008-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081213002244/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=121750 |archive-date=13 December 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the creators sold the site to iTurf Inc. The following year, [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]&lt;ref name="harvard" /&gt; purchased SparkNotes and selected fifty literature study guides to publish in print format. When Barnes &amp; Noble printed SparkNotes, they stopped selling their chief competitor, [[CliffsNotes]].&lt;ref name="wall"&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Bowman |title=Murder Most Foul |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110003858 |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. |date=8 August 2003 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812124524/http://opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110003858 |archive-date=12 August 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003, SparkNotes developed a practice test service called SparkNotes Test Prep. This project was followed by the release of SparkCharts, reference sheets that summarize a topic; No Fear Shakespeare, transcriptions of Shakespeare's plays into modern language; and No Fear Literature, transcriptions of literary classics like ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' and ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' into modern language.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/about/history/|title=A Brief History of SparkNotes|accessdate=2008-02-04|work=SparkNotes|publisher=SparkNotes LLC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212022748/http://www.sparknotes.com/about/history/|archive-date=2008-02-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other features==
SparkNotes Test Prep provides content and services related to the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], and [[Advanced Placement|AP]], [[GRE]] and [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]]/[[SAT]] I and II standardized tests. Barnes &amp; Noble sells printed versions of the test prep study guides, as well as SparkCharts and other printed study materials, in the United States and at [[Chapters]] in Canada.

The SparkNotes.com website also includes a section students can use to search for colleges.

SparkNotes has moved into educational publishing with books, such as ''Poetry Classics'' and ''FlashKids'', a series of educational books for Kindergarten to grade 8 students. They also provide exercises for high school teachers.

SparkNotes also has a section called SparkLife, a social section focused on non-educational topics for teens and young adults. This section of the site includes blogs, advice columns (most notably by "Auntie Sparknotes"), contributed posts, and Open Threads, which members can use to chat with one another without commenting on a specific post. The regular users of Sparknotes are called "Sparklers". Other features include "Blogging Twilight" by Dan Bergstein, movie reviews, articles about current events, and helpful tips and facts.

The free SparkNotes mobile app for the [[iPhone]]/[[iPod]] and [[Android OS|Android]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/mobile-apps/|title=SparkNotes Mobile Apps|accessdate=12 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919211842/http://www.sparknotes.com/mobile-apps/|archive-date=19 September 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers:
*50 pre-installed study guides in the app library
*Hundreds of study guides available for viewing online
*The ability to download any study guide to the mobile device for offline use
*The ability to share what one is studying and one's status by checking in with a customized post to [[Facebook]]

==Criticism==
{{criticism section|date=September 2015}}
Because SparkNotes provides study guides for literature that include chapter summaries, many teachers see the website as a cheating tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauren |last=Simnauer |author2=Dumler, Christie |title=There's room for sparknotes, too |url=http://www.theviewnewspapers.com/article.asp?article=9154&amp;paper=91&amp;cat=199 |work=The View |publisher=Zip Publishing |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071221212928/http://www.theviewnewspapers.com/article.asp?article=9154&amp;paper=91&amp;cat=199 |archive-date=21 December 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These teachers argue that students can use SparkNotes as a replacement for actually completing reading assignments with the original material&lt;ref name="tulsa"&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrea | last=Eger | title=Students love study guides | date=22 February 2008 | publisher=World Publishing Co | url =http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080222_1_A1_hTeac07026 | work =Tulsa World| accessdate = 2008-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Competition for CliffsNotes arrives on the scene.

'''''Star Wars: Tiny Death Star''''' was a business [[simulation video game]] developed by [[Disney Mobile]] and [[NimbleBit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/disney-lucasarts-to-launch-star-wars-tiny-death-star-with-tiny-tower-creator-nimblebit-1200694453/ |title='Tiny Tower' Turns to Dark Side with 'Star Wars: Tiny Death Star' |date=2013-10-05 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Disney Mobile]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Windows Phone]], and [[Windows 8]]/[[Windows RT|RT]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a521680/star-wars-game-tiny-death-star-announced-for-ios-android.html |title='Star Wars' game 'Tiny Death Star' announced for iOS and Android |date=2013-10-07 |accessdate=2013-10-12 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on NimbleBit's previous game, ''[[Tiny Tower]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/04/tiny-death-star-announced |title=Tiny Death Star Announced |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is set in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/10/04/nimblebit-and-disney-announce-tiny-death-star.aspx |title=NimbleBit And Disney Announce Tiny Death Star |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |publisher=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars: Tiny Death Star'' was announced by [[Disney Interactive Studios]] on October 4, 2013.  It was released in Australia and New Zealand for Android devices on October 11, 2013&lt;ref name="Android release" /&gt; and in Australia for iOS devices on October 15, 2013.&lt;ref name="iOS release" /&gt;  It was released worldwide on November 8, 2013 for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Windows 8 and Windows RT devices.

The game was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store by Disney in October 2014.

==Gameplay==
The goal is to build and expand a [[Death Star]], while attracting virtual people known as ''galactic Bitizens'' to build and run virtual businesses within the Death Star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mixnmojo.com/news/Star-Wars-Tiny-Death-Star-making-its-way-to-your-mobile-soon |title=Star Wars: Tiny Death Star making its way to your mobile soon |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |publisher=[[The International House of Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currency==
The main currency is ''Imperial Credits''. Credits are made by selling products on business levels or by trading ''Imperial Bux'' in for them. Imperial Bux are used in Tiny Death Star to complete construction and product orders instantly, unlock specific floors, unlock specific species, upgrade elevators, unlock costumes, instantly recruit Bitizens into a residential level, hire ''VIP''s and earn money more quickly. Imperial Bux can be purchased by going to the ''Get Bux'' option on the main menu. Using [[Tapjoy]] offers, it is also possible to earn free Imperial Bux by completing offers such as downloading and running apps or signing up for programs.

==Unlockables==
While playing Tiny Death Star, ''Bitizens'', Levels, and Scenes are unlocked in the album. Throughout gameplay, new species of bitzens are unlocked when they appear in the elevator or are found throughout the Death Star. These bitzens are sorted into the following categories: ''Bounty Hunters'', ''Droids'', ''Men of the Rebellion'', ''Ladies of the Rebellion'', ''Rebel Heroes'', ''Rebel Aliens'', ''Outer Rim'', ''Troops'', ''Rebel Forces'', ''The Force'', ''Cantina Crew'', ''Hutt's Henchmen'', ''Limited Edition'', ''Galactic Registry Series 1'' and ''The Deep Core''.

The levels that are built to make your Death Star larger are sorted into six categories: food, service, recreation, retail, residential and imperial. Residential levels are used to house bitzens which can then be put to work making credits in the business levels. The food, service, recreation, and retail levels are built as businesses used to make credits. Credits are used to build new levels. In the businesses, a maximum of three Bitizens which reside in one of the residential floors are assigned to work. They order in products. How long the products take to arrive depends on the Bitizen's skill level at the given job. Imperial levels are used to produce ''Imperial Items'' for missions. When these missions are completed, credits are awarded. Each of the categories of business levels currently have ten possible levels to unlock. As more updates arrive, new levels will be available to unlock.

Scenes are unlocked when the elevator is used to take a specific individual (or sometimes member of a species) to a specific level.

==VIPs==
Apart from just the ordinary Bitizens, there are also VIPs, who randomly appear in the elevator. Up to 5 VIPs can be stored in the lobby at any one time, and they can kept for any period of time. VIPs are used to improve the Death Star. They help attract customers to your levels, complete tasks faster, move levels, upgrade levels, or even fill an entire vacant residential floor with tenants.

The "Holiday Update" (version 1.0.1.4), released on December 17, 2013, featured 'Decorator Droids'. These limited edition VIPs decorate a floor with holiday/Christmas lights. Limited edition rewards were available to those who decorated enough floors. In early January 2014 this promotion expired (decorated floors were brought back to normal) and the Decorator Droids are no longer available.

==Bugs==
When the game was originally released, one major problem was discovered: the "Negative Bux" glitch. This glitch occurs when the player uses Imperial Bux to purchase a specific level (and not a random one, which is the norm, using Imperial Credits). The result is that the player winds up with a negative balance of Bux, otherwise impossible to achieve. The player then has to balance this account before he/she can begin to accumulate Bux and purchase other goods. To make this matter worse, if a player has bought Bux, with real money, they can lose the "in-game currency" to this glitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turi|first=Tim|title=The Empire Strikes Bux: How Tiny Death Star Robbed Me|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/11/22/the-empire-strikes-bux-how-tiny-death-star-robbed-me.aspx|work=gameinformer|publisher=gameinformer|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 17, 2013, this bug has been fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Izlain|title=Tiny Death Star: The Bux Bug and more|url=http://gdub4.wordpress.com/2013/11/17/tiny-death-star-the-bux-bug-and-more/|work=wordpress.com|publisher=wordpress.com|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2014, some users are reporting a new bug, where their Galactic Registry 1 bitizens have changed into random people.&lt;ref&gt;http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/182606/tiny-death-star-assignments-and-the-galactic-registry-changes&lt;/ref&gt; The Besalisk species has disappeared from the album, and existing in-game besalisk bitizens are being erroneously replaced by a character of Lando Calrissian. Cornelius Evazan's appearance has become incorrect. Imperial assignments still do not operate after a certain point early in the game, making the imperial levels mostly pointless. All of the Salvage Droids' "Possible Salvage" screens show the same panoply of ewoks instead of the correct possibilities of the currently scanned areas.

In October 2014, Disney pulled the app from the App Store and Google Play. Co-developer Nimblebit was not given notice prior to the removal. As of December 11, 2015, it is unavailable on both the Windows Store and the App Store. Disney removed the game from all app stores because they wanted to take the Star Wars games in another direction. The developer, Nimblebit, was furious at the removal of the game, because it was a high source of revenue, despite the multitude of bugs that had plagued it since its initial release.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-07-disney-removes-tiny-death-star-without-telling-the-developer&lt;/ref&gt; 

If a user had previously downloaded the game (i.e.: via GooglePlay), said user can re-download the game, despite its being unavailable. Some features  (such as the Tapjoy Bux purchasing) are disabled, but players can still tend to their Bitizens.

'''Waldorf School of San Diego''' ('''WSSD''') is an independent [[Waldorf school]] located in the [[Oak Park, San Diego, California|Oak Park neighborhood]] of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]], United States. It offers preschool/kindergarten through 12th grade, and had an enrollment of 284 in 2011.&lt;ref name=review&gt;[http://www.privateschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/4606 Private School Review: The Waldorf School of San Diego]. Accessed 2011-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1981, it is one of approximately more than 250 independent [[North America]]n and 1,000 worldwide Waldorf schools. The school is an accredited member school of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America].&lt;ref&gt;[http://awsna.org Association of Waldorf Schools of North America]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.members.awsna.org/Public/SchoolListPage.aspx AWSNA Member School List]. Accessed 2011-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the school inaugurated its high school program with Grade 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionmagazine.com/archives/0712/living_arts_waldorf.html High School on the Horizon: Waldorf to Break Ground Soon], ''Vision Magazine'', December 2007. Accessed 2008-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has received financial support and guidance from the [[RSF Social Finance|Rudolf Steiner Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsfsocialfinance.org/projects/new-borrowers-in-2007/ RSF Social Finance: New Borrowers in 2007]. Accessed 2008-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Waldorf School of San Diego also serves as a campus for the Waldorf [[Teacher education|teacher training]] program of the Waldorf Institute of Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waldorfteaching.org/ Waldorf Institute of Southern California]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waldorfteaching.org/waldorf_institute_contact_info.html#campus_locations Campus Locations], Waldorf Institute of Southern California. Accessed 2011-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
The curriculum of the Waldorf School of San Diego is based on the [[Waldorf education|educational philosophy]] developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Each grade provides educational activities that are designed to respond to the physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual needs at that stage of the children's development. The [[visual arts]], [[music]] and other [[performing arts]], and [[Handicraft|handcrafts]] are emphasized, as well as traditional subjects including reading, English, history, mathematics, science, and geography.

The hallmark of a Waldorf education is the schooling of the head, heart and hands.  The school's goal is not only to develop each child's intellect but to ensure that they will engage themselves in the world with an open heart.  Working with the hands is one of the ways to develop the neurological passageways that establish the foundation of thinking.  Conscious development and training of the hands using diverse mediums such as copper work, stained glass, beeswax, woodwork, blacksmithing, and felting, leads to enhanced cognition and understanding for the students. Another hallmark is the integration of an artistic component into every academic subject, even history, math and science.  This keeps the students interested and engaged in the most difficult topics exciting and fun.

The early childhood program is play-based so that each child can develop vital social and emotional skills, as well as artistic and imaginative skills (the foundation for memory and retention). The focus is also on building a strong, healthy physical body through plenty of outdoor play, bio-dynamic gardening, daily movement in circle time with songs, verses and games, and organic food served daily.  The fine and gross motor skills are refined so that a foundation is laid for the academic work that begins in grade 1.
  
In grades 1-8, there is no testing or grading, so the work done by each student comes from a genuine love of learning. The Main Lesson teacher who leads most of the academic work consistently assesses each student's progress throughout the year, and parents receive a substantial year-end report.  There is also a short written report from each of the 7-8 Special Subjects teachers.

The school's [[gardening]] program has included instruction in [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] [[composting]]&lt;ref&gt;Linda C. Puig, [http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et0498/et0498s10.html Kids and composting were made for each other], ''San Diego Earth Times'', April 1998. Accessed 2008-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and a project to plant [[fruit tree]]s on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medinacreative.com/clients/fruittree/accomplishments.htm Planting Fruit Trees for a Healthier Planet], The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation, 2005. Accessed 2008-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Following the strong foundation of early childhood and the elementary grades, the students are well prepared for the rigorous academic work brought in high school, where they receive a broad and rich education. In high school, the students are developmentally ready for testing and grading, which is documented in mid-year and year-end report cards - all closely monitored by the student in conjunction with each subject teacher (up to 14 different teachers, each an expert in their field of study). The social and community service that is an integral part of the high school journey helps the teenager navigate adolescence with a warm heart and a sense of purpose. The end result is an enlivening education which puts a high value on Waldorf students at colleges and universities across the country and abroad.

Curriculum related field trips begin in grade 1 and continue through to grade 12.  There is a particular focus on sustainable outdoor adventure, along with social and community service in the two week trips at the end of grade 8 and grade 11.

The school offers a wide variety of sports, including [[Track and field athletics|track and field]], [[golf]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]], [[water polo]], and [[dance]].&lt;ref name=review/&gt;  Beginning in the 6th grade, students may join the girls' or boys' basketball team, or the co-ed soccer team, all of which compete in local leagues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7336">'''William Hobart Dickey''' (December 15, 1928 &amp;ndash; May 3, 1994) was an [[United States|American]] [[poet]] and professor of English and creative writing at [[San Francisco State University]]. He authored 15 books of poetry over a career that lasted three and a half decades.

==Early life and education==

Dickey was born in 1928 in [[Bellingham, Washington]] and was raised in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. He attended [[Reed College]], graduating in 1951. At Reed he wrote a novel for his bachelor's thesis and was elected to the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]].&lt;ref name=DLB&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]] |volume=5 |editor-first=Donald J. |editor-last=Greiner |chapter=William Dickey |last=Goldstein |first=Thomas |year=1980 |publisher=Gale  |pages=191–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded a [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation|Woodrow Wilson Fellowship]] and went on to study at [[Harvard University]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]], 1955) and the [[University of Iowa]] ([[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]], 1956). As a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholar]] he studied at [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]] at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1959 to 1960.&lt;ref name=DLB/&gt;

Dickey was a student of [[John Berryman]] at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. He later recalled:

{{quote|First to have been at [[Reed College]] as an undergraduate with [[Gary Snyder]], [[Philip Whalen]] and [[Lew Welch]], second to have been in John Berryman's extraordinary and intense poetry workshop with W. D.  Snodgrass, [[Donald Justice]], [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]], [[Paul Petrie]], [[Robert Dana]], [[Constance Urdang]], [[Jane Cooper]], [[Donald Finkel]], [[Henri Coulette]]&amp;mdash;the list continues beyond the capacity of my memory, but it was a course I approached with rapture and fear, owing in part to Berryman's sometimes jagged abruptness, as when, having warned me beforehand that he was going to exhibit the profound mortality of one of my works, he held it out at arm's length in the class, looked at it with loathing, and said, "Now, what are we to say about this ridiculous poem?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seems Like Old Times |editor-first=Ed |editor-last=Dinger |year=1986 |publisher=University of Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Literary and academic career==

Dickey's first collection of poetry, ''Of the Festivity'', was selected by [[W.H. Auden]] as the winner of the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition]] in 1959. In the foreword to the book, Auden wrote:

{{quote|It is possible to show evidence of great intelligence and sensibility but to be lacking in the first power essential to poetry, the power to speak, Mr. Dickey's lines have both.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news |title=William Dickey, Poet and Teacher, Is Dead at 65 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1994-05-11 |accessdate=2009-06-21 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/11/obituaries/william-dickey-poet-and-teacher-is-dead-at-65.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among Dickey's subsequent collections of poetry, ''More Under Saturn''  won a silver medal from the [[Commonwealth Club of California]] in 1972, and ''The Rainbow Grocery'' received the Juniper Prize from the [[University of Massachusetts Press]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=PF&gt;{{cite web |title=William H. Dickey (1928 - 1994) |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=1774 |publisher=[[Poetry Foundation]] |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickey was an instructor in English at [[Cornell University]] from 1956 to 1959, and  an assistant professor of English at [[Denison University]] from 1960 to 1962.  In 1962 he joined the faculty of [[San Francisco State University]] as a professor of English and creative writing, teaching there until his retirement in 1991.&lt;ref name=PF/&gt;

==Personal life==

Dickey lived in [[San Francisco]] with his companion Leonard Sanazaro, a poet who taught English and creative writing at the [[City College of San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

Dickey died in 1994 at [[Kaiser Permanente|Kaiser Hospital]] in San Francisco. The cause was complications from [[HIV]]-related surgeries.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=BAP97&gt;{{cite book |title=The Best American Poetry 1997 |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Lehman |editor1-link=David Lehman |editor2-first=James |editor2-last=Tate |editor2-link=James Tate (writer) |year=1997 |publisher=Scribner |pages=209–210 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tl9KNKvGjfkC&amp;pg=PA209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly before his death, Dickey finished a poem, "The Death of [[John Berryman]]," about the suicide of his former teacher. It was published posthumously in ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' (January 1996) and ''[[The Best American Poetry 1997]]''.&lt;ref name=BAP97/&gt;

In 1996 a collection of Dickey's poems and books was deposited at the Gay and Lesbian Center at the [[San Francisco Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=William Dickey, Poems 1981-1995 |url=http://sfpl.org/librarylocations/main/glc/pdf/William_Dickey.pdf |publisher= [[San Francisco Public Library]] |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
