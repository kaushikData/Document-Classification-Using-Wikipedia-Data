      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11631">Networking device [[hostname]]s ending with '''.local''' are often employed in private networks, where they are resolved either via the [[Multicast DNS|multicast domain name service]] (mDNS) or local [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) servers. The implementation of both approaches on the same network can be problematic.  However, resolving such names via [[unicast]] DNS servers has fallen into disfavor as computers, printers and other devices implementing [[Zero configuration networking|zero-configuration networking]] (zeroconf) have become increasingly common.

==Multicast DNS (mDNS) standard==
The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) standards-track RFC 6762 (February 20, 2013) reserves the use of the domain name label ''local'' as a [[pseudo-top-level domain]] for hostnames in local area networks that can be resolved via the [[Multicast DNS]] name resolution protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762/
  |title=RFC 6762: Multicast DNS
  |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force
  |author =Cheshire, Stuart
  |author2 =Krochmal, Marc
  |last-author-amp =yes
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any DNS query for a name ending with the label ''local'' must be sent to the mDNS IPv4 link-local multicast address 224.0.0.251, or its IPv6 equivalent FF02::FB. Domain name ending in ''local'', may be resolved concurrently via other mechanisms, e.g., unicast DNS.

==mDNS implementations==
RFC 6762 was authored by [[Apple Inc.]] employees Stuart Cheshire and Marc Krochmal, and Apple's [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] zeroconf networking software implements mDNS. That service will automatically resolve the private IP addresses of link-local Macintosh computers running [[MacOS]] and mobile devices running [[iOS]] if ''.local'' is appended to their hostnames. In addition, Bonjour devices will use those ''.local'' hostnames when advertising services to [[DNS Service Discovery]] clients.

Most Linux distributions also incorporate and are configured to use zero configuration networking. By default, each computer’s [[Avahi (software)|Avahi daemon]] will respond to mDNS ''hostname.local'' queries, and most shell commands and application program calls that attempt to resolve such names are routed to that daemon by the default ''hosts:'' line in the [[Name Service Switch]] configuration file. It is also possible to configure the nss-mdns modules and Avahi to resolve hostnames with other pseudo-TLDs.

Although Windows operating systems often do not have built-in mDNS function, it can be added by installing zeroconf software available from Apple and other third parties, and it is beginning to be added in Windows 10.

Finally, many printers and other peripheral devices also implement the mDNS protocol in order to provide simplified connections to them from computers that implement zero configuration networking.

==Microsoft recommendations==
The connection of Macintosh and Linux computers or zeroconf peripherals to Windows networks can be problematic if those networks include name servers that use ''.local'' as a search domain for internal devices.

At one time, Microsoft at least suggested the use of ''.local'' as a pseudo-TLD for small private networks with internal DNS servers, via documents that (as of this writing) are still accessible. For example, support article 296250&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/296250/
  |title=Domain Name System name recommendations for Small Business Server 2000 and Windows Small Business Server 2003 
  |publisher=support.microsoft.com
  |date=2007-12-03
  |quote=Three practical methods to name the DNS domain are: [1/3] [...] private domain name that is used for name resolution on the internal Small Business Server network. [...] usually [...] first-level domain of .local. [...] [2/3] Make the name a sub-domain of a publicly registered domain name. For example, if the publicly registered domain name is Contoso.com, a sub-domain of Corp.contoso.com can be used. [3/3] Make the name the same as a publicly registered domain name. [...] Most Small Business Server customers should use the first method.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; included the following option:

{{quote|Make the name a private domain name that is used for name resolution on the internal Small Business Server network. This name is usually configured with the first-level domain of .local. At the present time, the .local domain name is not registered on the Internet.}}

However, more recent articles have cautioned or advised against such use of the ''.local'' TLD.

Support article 300684&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/300684/
  |title=Information about configuring Active Directory domains by using single-label DNS names
  |publisher=support.microsoft.com
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; listed ''contoso.local'' as an example of a "best-practice Active Directory domain name", but then added:

{{quote|We recommend that you register DNS names for the top-most internal and external DNS namespaces with an Internet registrar.}}

which would of course preclude using that or any other domain ending with ''.local''.

Microsoft TechNet article 708159&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc708159
  |publisher=technet.microsoft.com
  |title=Internal Domain Information (OEM)
  |series=Windows Small Business Server 2003 product documentation
  |quote=[...] it is strongly recommended that you use the .local label for the extension. [...] If your Windows Small Business Server network contains client computers running Mac OS X 10.2 or later, change the .local label for the default domain name to a label other than .local. For example, use .lan or .office as the label.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; suggested ''.local'' for the exact opposite reason:

{{quote|Using the .local label for the full DNS name for the internal domain is a more secure configuration because the .local label is not registered for use on the Internet. This separates your internal domain from your public Internet domain name.}}

but later recommended against it:

{{quote|If you have Macintosh client computers that are running the Macintosh OS X version 10.3 operating system or later, … it is recommended that you do not use the .local label for the full DNS name of your internal domain. If you must use the .local label, then you must also configure settings on the Macintosh computers so they can discover other computers on the network. For more information about how to configure client computers running Macintosh OS X version 10.3 or later, see “Connecting Macintosh Computers to a Windows Small Business Server 2003 Network” on the Microsoft Web site at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID%3D39689].}}

TechNet article 726016&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc726016
  |title=Selecting the Forest Root Domain
  |publisher=technet.microsoft.com
  |date=2012-04-26
  |quote=To select a suffix for the forest root domain: [...] We recommend that you use DNS names that are registered with an Internet authority in the Active Directory namespace. Only registered names are guaranteed to be globally unique. [...] Caution [...] Do not use single-label DNS names. [...] Also, we do not recommend using unregistered suffixes, such as .local.
  |accessdate=2016-01-19
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; cautioned against using ''.local'':

{{quote|…we do not recommend using unregistered suffixes, such as .local.}}

By default, a freshly installed Windows Server 2016 Essentials also adds .local as the default dns-prefix, when a user doesn't select the advanced option. Thus resulting in a domain with .local extension.

==Linux==

Computers running modern{{clarify|date=January 2018}} Linux distributions and using the common &lt;code&gt;nsswitch&lt;/code&gt; system may have &lt;code&gt;/etc/nsswitch.conf&lt;/code&gt; configuration files in which mDNS name resolution was added via the mdns5_minimal plugin to &lt;code&gt;nsswitch&lt;/code&gt;. In this configuration, where mdns5_minimal precedes the standard dns option, which uses &lt;code&gt;/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/code&gt;, the mDNS resolution will block subsequent DNS resolution on the local network.

:: &lt;pre&gt;hosts:    files mdns5_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns&lt;/pre&gt;

This is a configuration choice made by distributions such as Ubuntu/Debian and SuSE and Red Hat, each of which have their own package configuration script that will install the mdns_minimal module as above.

In this way ''.local'' requests are being prevented from leaking to the internet, but also block legitimate ''.local'' requests for configured DNS servers.

==Global DNS queries==
As ''local'' is an officially reserved special-use domain name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}'''Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center''' is an educational institution that documents, explains and commemorates [[Babi Yar|the Babi Yar shootings]] of September 1941 and aims to broaden and sustain the memory of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] in Eastern Europe, taking into account geopolitical changes during the 20th century. In 2016 the discussion of the Memorial project began. The Memorial Center is planned to be created in [[Kiev|Kyiv]], Ukraine, by 2023&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://babiyar.org/en/byhmc/about|title=Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center|website=babiyar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Babi Yar ==
[[Babi Yar]] is one of the most famous places of memory associated with human tragedy. During the Second World War it was the place of the Nazi genocide. On September 29-30, more Jews were slaughtered in two days than in any other single German massacre – the Nazis brutally killed 33 771 Jews. In total, from September 29, 1941 till October 1943, the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Nazi occupation authorities]] killed nearly 100 thousand people in and near the Babi Yar ravine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Babyn_Yar|title=БАБИН ЯР|website=resource.history.org.ua|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Batcave''' is a fictional subterranean location appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. It is the headquarters of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]], whose secret identity is Bruce Wayne, consisting of underground caves beneath his personal residence, [[Wayne Manor]].&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Beatty  | first = Scott | author-link =  | contribution = Batman | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 40–44  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Publication history==
Originally, there was only a secret tunnel that ran underground between Wayne Manor and a dusty old barn where the [[Batmobile]] was kept. Later, in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #12 (August–September 1942), [[Bill Finger]] mentioned "secret underground hangars." In 1943, the writers of the first [[Batman (serial)|Batman]] movie serial, titled ''Batman'', gave Batman a complete underground crime lab and introduced it in the second chapter entitled "The Bat's Cave". The entrance was via a secret passage through a grandfather clock and included bats flying around.

[[Bob Kane]], who was on the movie set, mentioned this to Bill Finger who was going to be the initial scripter on the Batman daily newspaper strip. Finger included with his script a clipping from ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' that featured a detailed cross section of underground hangars. Kane used this clipping as a guide, adding a study, crime lab, workshop, hangar and garage. This illustration appeared in the ''Batman'' "[[comic strip|dailies]]" on October 29, 1943 in a strip entitled "The Bat Cave!"

In this early version the cave itself was described as Batman's underground study and, like the other rooms, was just a small alcove with a desk and [[filing cabinet]]s. Like in the movie serial, the Batman's symbol was carved into the rock behind the desk and had a candle in the middle of it. The entrance was via a bookcase which led to a secret elevator.

The Batcave made its comic book debut in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #83 in January 1944.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Dailies 1943–1944'' by Bob Kane, Kitchen Sink Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the decades, the cave has expanded along with its owner's popularity to include a vast trophy room, supercomputer, and forensics lab. There has been little consistency as to the floor plan of the Batcave or its contents. The design has varied from artist to artist and it is not unusual for the same artist to draw the cave layout differently in various issues.

==Fictional history==
[[Image:BatcaveRoss.jpg|thumb|The Batcave in ''Justice'' #5 (June 2006). Art by Alex Ross.]]
The cave was discovered and used long before by Bruce Wayne's ancestors as a storehouse as well as a means of [[Underground Railroad|transporting escaped slave]]s during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era. The 18th century frontier hero Tomahawk once discovered a gargantuan bat (owned by [[Morgaine le Fey]] of Arthurian legend) inside what can be assumed would become the Batcave. Wayne himself rediscovered the caves as a boy when he fell through a dilapidated well on his estate, but he did not consider the cave as a potential base of operations until he rediscovered it yet again when he returned to Gotham to become Batman. In addition to a base, the Batcave serves as a place of privacy and tranquility, much like [[Superman]]'s [[Fortress of Solitude]].

In earlier versions of the story, Bruce Wayne discovered the cave as an adult. In "The Origin of the Batcave" in ''Detective Comics'' #205 (March 1954), Batman tells Robin he had no idea the cave existed when he purchased the house they live in. He discovered the cave by accident when testing the floor of an old barn on the rear of the property, and the floor gave way. This story also established that a frontiersman named Jeremy Coe used the cave as a headquarters 300 years earlier. Bruce Wayne discovering the cave as an adult remained the case at least through ''Who's Who'' #2 in 1985.

Upon his initial foray into crime-fighting, Wayne used the caves as a sanctum and to store his then-minimal equipment. As time went on, Wayne found the place ideal to create a stronghold for his war against crime, and has incorporated a plethora of equipment as well as expanding the cave for specific uses.

===Access===
[[Image:Bruce Wayne Batcave Batman vol 3 2.png|thumb|[[Bruce Wayne]] accesses the Batcave through a clock. Art by David Finch.]]
The cave is accessible in several ways. It can be reached through a [[secret passage|secret door]] in [[Wayne Manor]] itself, which is almost always depicted as in the main study, often behind a grandfather clock which unlocks the secret door when the hands are set to the time that Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered, 10:47&amp;nbsp;pm. In the 1960s ''Batman'' TV show, the cave entrance is behind a bookcase which was opened when Bruce Wayne activated a control switch hidden in a bust of William Shakespeare; when the secret switch is turned, the bookcase slides to one side, revealing the "Bat-Poles", which allow Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson to change into their Batman and Robin costumes en route as they slide down to the cave. An entrance under Bruce Wayne's chair in his office in Wayne Enterprises, as shown in ''Batman Forever'', connects to a miles-long tunnel which Bruce travels through in a high-speed personal transportation capsule. In ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight Rises'', the cave is accessible through a secret door disguised as part of a large display case and is unlocked by pressing a sequence of keys on the nearby grand piano.

Another secret entrance, covered by a waterfall, pond, hologram, or a camouflaged door, allows access to a service road for the Batmobile. Another alternate entrance is the dry well where Bruce originally discovered the Batcave, highlighted especially during the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' comic book storyline. At one point, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] and [[Dick Grayson]] use the dry well to get into the cave, which they had been locked out of by [[Azrael (comics)|Jean Paul Valley]] during his time as Batman, and Bruce Wayne used it to infiltrate the cave and confront the insane Valley in the final battle between the two men for the title of the Batman. Lured into the narrow tunnel, Valley was forced to remove the massive Bat-armor he had developed, thus allowing Wayne to force Vally to remit his claim to the title.

The location of the cave is known not only to Batman, but to several of his allies. In addition to the so-called "Batman Family", members of the [[Justice League]] and the original [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] are aware of the cave's location. Essentially, anyone who is aware of Batman's secret identity also knows the location of the Batcave, much like how people who have knowledge of Robin's identity have knowledge of Batman's; these, unfortunately, include such villains as [[Ra's al Ghul]], who makes occasional visits to the Batcave to confront his long-time nemesis, and [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], who infiltrated the cave during the ''[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]'' comic book storyline when he framed Bruce Wayne for murder. During ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', Two-Face, the Joker, Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy discovered the Batcave while fleeing through the sewers to escape the attacks of the surviving mobsters, but they had lost their way and were never able to find the cave again after being defeated by Batman and [[Dick Grayson]] (In his "official" debut as Robin), Batman reflecting that he would seal that entrance to prevent such a thing happening again. When the powerful Bedlam took over the world and transferred all adults to a duplicate Earth, Robin attempted to assess the situation from the Batcave with [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]], but it would appear that he avoided revealing the cave's exact location to them, suggesting that he accessed it via an external passage or a teleporter. 

Although Wayne Manor was repossessed and converted into the new Arkham Asylum following the events of ''[[Batman Eternal]]'', Batman maintains the original cave after sealing off the entrance to Wayne Manor, musing that it is a good opportunity to keep his foes contained. After the manor was gifted back to Bruce by Geri Powers. Alfred kept the location of the Batcave a seret from Bruce who had lost his memory of being Batman in his last battle with the Joker. While the manor was being renovated and all the Arkham inmates were removed Bruce and Alfred until then remained in a Brownstone in Gotham itself. Even after Bruce loses all memory of his life as Batman, the cave was still used by other members of the Bat-Family; Alfred took the de-powered Clark Kent to the cave to explain what had happened to Bruce, and Dick Grayson and the various Robins used it as a base of operations while opposing the schemes of the ruthless "Mother" in ''[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]''. When new villain Mr Bloom launches a massive attack on Gotham, Alfred is forced to allow Bruce into the Batcave to access an apparently-disregarded program designed to upload Bruce's memories to a series of Batman clones to maintain his legacy, Bruce overcoming the original project's limitation of being unable to upload the memories to a fresh body by having Alfred take him to the point of brain death and then download the data onto his blank brain.

===Design===
The Batcave serves as Batman's secret headquarters and command center, where he monitors all crisis points in [[Gotham City]], as well as the rest of the world.

The cave's centerpiece is a supercomputer whose specs are on par with any of those used by leading national security agencies; it permits global surveillance and also connects to a massive information network as well as storing vast amounts of information, both on Batman's foes and his allies. A series of satellite link-ups allows easy access to Batman's information network anywhere around the globe. The systems are protected against unauthorized access, and any attempt to breach their security immediately sends an alert to Batman or [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]. Despite the power of Batman's computers, the [[Justice League Watchtower]] is known to have more powerful computers (composed of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]ian, [[Thanagar]]ian and Martian technology), and Batman does occasionally use them if he feels his computers are not up to the task; on occasion he also consults Oracle for assistance.
[[Image:Batman Shadow of the Bat 79.jpg|thumb|175px|The partially destroyed Batcave. Cover to ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #79 (1998). Art by [[Glen Orbik]].]]

Additionally, the cave features state-of-the-art facilities such as a [[forensics|crime lab]], various specialized laboratories, mechanized workshops, personal gymnasium, parking, docking and hangar space (as appropriate) for his various vehicles as well as separate exits for each type, memorabilia of past campaigns, a vast library, a large [[bat]] colony, and a Justice League teleporter. It also has medical facilities as well as various areas used in training exercises for Batman and his allies.

The cave houses Batman's vast array of specialized vehicles, foremost being the famous ''[[Batmobile]]'' in all its incarnations (mostly for nostalgia, but also for contingencies, as all are serviceable and in excellent working condition). Other vehicles within the complex include various motorcycles, [[aircraft|air]]- and [[watercraft]] such as [[Batplane|The Bat-Wing]], a single-occupant [[Jet aircraft|supersonic jet]], and the Subway Rocket (which debuted in ''Detective Comics'' #667).

The cave is sometimes depicted as being powered by a nuclear reactor, but most often by a hydroelectric generator made possible by an underground river.

During the ''Cataclysm'' storyline, the cave was seriously damaged in an earthquake- Bruce Wayne naturally unable to fortify Wayne Manor against such an event despite his precautions with the rest of his property to preserve Batman's secrets- with the Bat-family relocating most of the trophies and equipment in the cave to offsite storage to conceal Batman's identity. During the later reconstruction, the new Wayne Manor incorporates additional safeguards against future quakes and even a potential nuclear catastrophe, outfitting the cave as a virtual [[bomb shelter]] or an enhanced [[panic room]]. The city's earthquake redesigned the caverns of the Batcave, with eight new levels now making up Batman's secret refuge of high-tech laboratory, library, training areas, storage areas, and vehicle accesses. It also includes an "island" computer platform (built on the spot where the Batmobiles' hydraulic turntable once was) with seven linked [[Cray]] T932 mainframes and a state-of-the-art hologram projector. There's also a selection of retractable glass maps within the computer platform. Kevlar shieldings are prepared to protect the cave's computer systems from seismic activity. With the cave's various facilities spread amid limestone stalactites and stalagmites,&lt;ref name="dc-batc"/&gt; Batman built retractable multi-walkway bridges, stairs, elevators, and poles to access its facilities.

There is a containment vault solely for Lex Luthor's [[Kryptonite]] ring.&lt;ref&gt;Action Comics #654 (June 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that Batman built another containment facility within the cave for a collection of variety of forms of Kryptonite.&lt;ref&gt;Superman/Batman 44 to #49&lt;/ref&gt;

What is allegedly the world's last [[Lazarus Pit]] was constructed inside the cave, although this has been contradicted by events in the pages of ''Batgirl'' and the [[Black Adam]] miniseries.

===Security measures===
The Batcave is rigged with the most sophisticated security system in the world in order to prevent all measure of infiltration. The security measures include motion sensors, silent alarms, steel and lead mechanical doors which could lock a person in or out, and a security mode which is specifically designed to stop if not eliminate all Justice League members in the event that any of them go rogue.

After Bruce Wayne's 'death' during the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Two-Face managed to infiltrate the cave with the aid of a psychic analyzing a batarang to 'sense' where it was forged and then hiring [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] to teleport him into it, something that Two-Face had never been able to do before as Batman used various spells and equipment to shield the cave which his allies either never knew about or had discontinued as they no longer used the cave themselves following Bruce's death. Despite Two-Face successfully breaking into the cave, Dick Grayson, acting as the new Batman, is able to convince Dent that he is the same man and has just adopted new methods, preserving Batman's secrets as Dent is rendered unconscious before he can find the location of the cave.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' (vol. 1) #691&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Memorabilia===
[[Image:BatcaveFE4.jpg|thumb|300px|The Batcave in ''Forever Evil'' #4 (Feb. 2014). The animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex, giant Lincoln penny, and oversized Joker playing card are seen on the right. Art by David Finch.]]
The cave stores unique memorabilia items collected from the various cases Batman has worked on over the years. Originally, these were stored in a room designed just for them; it was explained that Batman and Robin took one memento from each case. Later, the trophies were shown to be in the large main area of the cave, residing among the rest of the Batcave's furnishings.

The most famous and prevalently featured trophies are a full-size [[animatronic]] [[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus Rex]], a giant replica of a [[Cent (United States coin)|Lincoln penny]], and an oversized [[Joker (playing card)|Joker]] [[playing card]]. The ''T. Rex'' comes from an adventure on "[[Dinosaur Island]]" (''Batman'' #35, 1946); the penny was originally a trophy from Batman's encounter with a penny-obsessed villain named the [[Penny Plunderer]] (''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #30, 1947), but was later retconned into being from an encounter with [[Two-Face]].  Other "keepsakes" in the cave come from "The Thousand and One Trophies of Batman!" (''[[Detective Comics]]'' #158, 1950). These three stories were reprinted in ''Batman'' #256.

Modern retellings of the items' origins can be found in ''Batman Chronicles'' stories in issue #8 ("Secrets of the Batcave: Dinosaur Island") and issue #19 ("The Penny Plunderers").

A story in ''Batman'' #81 featured [[Two-Face]] tying Batman and Robin to a giant replica of his silver dollar coin. This story was the basis for an episode of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' wherein Batman gains the giant coin from that encounter; this has caused widespread confusion as to the actual origin of the coin trophy.

Other pieces often shown in the Batcave are Two-Face's original coin, [[Deathstroke]]'s sword (the owner of which Batman has fought at least twice), the shroud of the vampiric [[Monk (comics)|Monk]], and oversized ''[[Bowling|ten-pins]]''.

There is also a glass case display of [[Jason Todd]]'s [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] costume as a memorial to him, with the epitaph "A Good Soldier", which remains even after Todd's resurrection. [[Barbara Gordon]]'s [[Batgirl]] costume also remains on display. In the [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] two-part crossover, Grendel/Batman II, the skull of [[Hunter Rose]] is also put on display in the memorabilia room.

After the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' comic book storyline, a letter written by a [[Thomas Wayne]] from an alternate timeline addressed to Bruce Wayne has lain in a display case, as a reminder of Thomas Wayne's love for his son and encouraging him to move on from his tragic past.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justice League#Justice League|''Justice League'' (vol. 2)]] #9 (May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this letter was destroyed by the reborn Eobard Thawne as a way to hurt Bruce for Thomas's attempt to kill him before ''Flashpoint'' ended.

===Other Batcaves===
The Outsiders were, for a time, based out of a Batcave in Los Angeles. When Jean Paul Valley takeover the role of Batman, Tim Drake establishes his own safe house using an abandoned barn nearby Wayne Manor and his own house. After [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s attack during the ''Knightfall'' story arc, Bruce Wayne swore that he'd never be caught unprepared to defend [[Gotham City]] ever again. When Dick Grayson assumed the Batman role during the ''Prodigal'' storyline, Bruce established satellite Batcaves (most of which were not caves in the literal sense that the original one was) throughout the city on areas either owned by him, his company, or unknown or abandoned by the city, in the event that he needed a place to hide and/or resupply, which were pivotal during the ''No Man's Land'' storyline. One such Batcave was given to [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]], below a house owned by Bruce Wayne himself, during a point where her identity was compromised after she saved a man from rogue government agents, meaning that she could not walk around without a mask. The other satellite Batcaves introduced during ''No Man's Land'' were:

*'''Central Batcave''': Located fifty feet below the bottom of Robinson Park Reservoir, it is accessible through a secret entrance at the foot of one of the Twelve Caesars statues at the north of the park. This safehouse was put out of commission by [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], her "Feraks", and [[Clayface]].&lt;ref name="NoMansLand"&gt;''Batman: No Man's Land Secret Files'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Batcave South''': A boiler room of a derelict shipping yard on the docks across from Paris Island. This safehouse is accessible through a number of false manholes planted throughout Old Gotham streets.&lt;ref name="NoMansLand"/&gt;
*'''Batcave South-Central''': Located in the Old Gotham prototype subway station, a four-block stretch of track sealed in 1896 and forgotten.&lt;ref name="NoMansLand"/&gt;
*'''Northwest Batcave''': This safehouse is located in the subbasement of [[Arkham Asylum]]. Batman secretly stocked it with emergency rations, all-terrain vehicles, and battery-powered communication equipment.&lt;ref name="NoMansLand"/&gt;
*'''Batcave East''': An abandoned oil refinery owned by Wayne Enterprises. It fell out of use during a gasoline crisis when the company moved all of its holdings offshore decades ago.&lt;ref name="NoMansLand"/&gt;

Another was introduced in 2002's ''[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive|Fugitive]]'' story arc, this time in the form of an abandoned submarine, which Batman used as a full-time residence when he chose to abandon his life as Bruce Wayne when framed for the murder of [[Vesper Fairchild]].

====Bat Bunker====
[[Image:BatBunker.jpg|thumb|The bunker in ''Batman and Robin'' #1 (August 2009). Art by [[Frank Quitely]].]]
Under the [[Wayne Foundation]] building, there is a secret bunker. As of ''Batman'' #687, [[Dick Grayson]] has taken to using this as his "Batcave", stating that he wishes to embody the role of Batman in a way that is specific to him as well as getting closer to the action in the city. The bunker is as well-equipped as the original Batcave, including the Subway Rocket vehicle stationed beneath the bunker.

===Other versions===
In ''[[Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain]]'', Batman destroys the Batcave in order to eliminate Dracula's followers; having lured them into the cave after a prolonged pursuit through the sewers, he sets off explosive charges to destroy the Batcave's walls at the moment the sun rises, destroying the vampires within it, before setting off additional charges to destroy Wayne Manor in order to preserve his secrets. The first sequel, ''Bloodstorm,'' shows that a cellar beneath a brownstone owned by Alfred Pennyworth serves as a lair/laboratory for Batman. Although Wayne Manor collapses into the remains of the cave, part of the tunnel system is still intact, with the now-vampiric Batman establishing his lair there in the story's second sequel, ''Crimson Mist'', the interior including a deep chasm within walking distance of the areas where Batman kept the giant penny and the [[Batmobile]] when he was human. At the story's conclusion, [[James Gordon (comics)#Vampire Batman|Commissioner Gordon]] sets off explosive charges to destroy the cave's roof, letting the sun into the cave once again in order to destroy the monster that Batman has become once and for all.

In the alternate reality of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', the Batcave- here used by [[Thomas Wayne]] rather than Bruce- is far smaller and more run-down than the traditional version, containing merely a couple of tables for Thomas to work on his equipment and a medical area, with a conventional computer in the upper manor, reflecting Thomas's more brutal and solitary M.O. as Batman as opposed to the more sophisticated training undertaken by his son.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 31st century, the Batcave has been long abandoned, although [[Cosmic Boy]], [[Saturn Girl]] and [[Lightning Lad]] briefly infiltrate the cave while looking for evidence that Krypton existed to counter the xenophobic claims of the [[Justice League of Earth]] that Superman was a human given powers to fight against aliens.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #859&lt;/ref&gt;

In a possible future, Bruce Wayne has used a machine to download his memories and training- up to the point where he witnesses the bat and makes his vow to become Batman- into a series of clones of himself, each one aged to a point where they can act as Batman for around twenty-five years before they need to activate the new clone. By the time that the tenth generation clone is created, the Batcave has become a vast workshop, including a flying Batmobile, a robotic shark as a trophy, and costumes in glass cases, but the older Batman informs the new one that the contents of the cave will be burned upon his death so that the new Batman can make room for his own things while using the recorded memories to keep track of anything important from the past.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' (vol.2) #27&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comic book continuation of the television series ''[[Smallville]],'' Batman has a safe house in the form of a cargo ship, known as "Leviathan", docked at a hub in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. It is registered to a [[shell corporation]] in the [[Caribbean]], thus protecting Bruce Wayne's secret. However, it is compromised by the [[Intergang]], [[Prankster (comics)|Prankster]], and [[Mister Freeze]]. [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] is also aware of Leviathan's location due to his tracking of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Superman]]'s radiation signature with his satellites.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11'' vol. 1 #5–8 (September – December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne is later shown in the Batcave itself with Alfred when the Martian Manhunter infiltrates it to talk with Batman.

===''Batman Beyond''===
In the comic book series ''Batman Beyond 2.0'', Terry no longer uses the Batcave following an argument with Bruce. He now uses Dick Grayson's apartment as his base of operations. When Terry is seriously injured in a battle with Rewire, he wakes up in the Batcave where Bruce has treated his injuries and left information regarding Rewire himself. He arrived there due to a built in subroutine in the suit that if the user is seriously injured or falls unconscious, the suit becomes automated returns the user to the Batcave.

After arriving in the universe controlled by the Justice Lords Terry encounters a version of himself who is a member of the Jokerz known as " T ". Both McGinnis's arrive at Wayne Manor to find that it had been destroyed by the Justice Lords. A gang of Jokerz then proceed to attack them with T giving Terry enough time to make his way to the badly damaged Batcave. After exploring the cave he finds a number of damaged display cases which contain an unknown Batgirl suit, Justice Lord Batman suit and a Red Robin suit. He then discovers an armored and more powerful version of his own Batsuit which is powered by synthetic Kryptonite. After defeating the Jokerz gang he is confronted by Justice Lord Superman.

Following the defeat of Lord Superman, T and Dick Grayson (of the Justice Lords universe) begin repairs to the Batcave and to the suit Terry found with the intention of T taking over as the new Batman and Dick becoming his mentor. They later help send Terry back to his own universe.

==In other media==

===Film===

====Serials====
The Batcave first became part of the Batman mythos in the 1943 15-chapter movie serial ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'' starring [[Lewis Wilson]]. In this version, as later in the comics, it was a small cave with a desk and rock walls lit up by candles. Behind the desk is a large black bat symbol. The cave is connected to a crime lab. Bats were depicted as flying around the cave, although only their shadows were visible. Batman uses these bats as a scare tactic to make an apprehended enemy reveal information. To prevent the enemy from escaping, an iron door covers the exit.

The Batcave was also featured and expanded on in the 1949 serial ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'' starring [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]]. In this serial, there are filing cabinets and the cave now has a crime lab built in. The cave also contains the first incarnation of a batphone.

In both serials, the cave is accessed by walking through a grandfather clock.

====''Batman'' (TV series)====
{{main article|Batman (TV series)}}
The 1960s live-action Batman TV series featured the Batcave extensively, and portrayed it as a large but well-lit cavern containing an atomic power generator, a chemistry lab, punch-card computers, and other electronic crime-fighting devices, almost always prominently labeled with their function. In this incarnation, it primarily served as a crime lab and garage for the Batmobile. Perhaps the most famous aspect of this Batcave is that it is accessed from Wayne Manor via two Bat-Poles (one marked BRUCE and the other marked DICK), which are hidden behind a bookcase that can be opened by turning a switch hidden inside a bust of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. When Bruce and Dick slide down these Bat-Poles, they are instantly outfitted in their costumes before reaching the landing pads at the bottom. It is unknown how they put their costumes on so quickly. The Bat-Poles can also be used to lift Bruce and Dick up from the Batcave to Wayne Manor by use of the steamjet-propelled landing pads. The Batcave is also accessible via a service elevator which is used by Alfred.

The actual cave that the Batmobile is shown emerging from (and sometimes entering) in the TV show is located in the man-made filming location known as the "[[Bronson Canyon|Bronson Caves]]," in [[Griffith Park]], below the [[Hollywood Sign]].

====Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher films====

====='''''Batman'' (film)'''=====
{{main article|Batman (1989 film)}}
The cave is present in [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 ''Batman'' feature film. The cave is shown to house the [[Batmobile (1989)|Batmobile]], which is parked on a turntable-like platform at the edge of a large chasm filled with pipes. The Batmoblie enters the cave from a rock cliff/door. A huge switch turns on the lights in the cave. There are also bats roaming the cave. The cave also features the [[Batcomputer]], which is on a metal platform. There is also an office-like workstation, some unspecified machinery and a large vault for Batman's costume.

====='''''Batman Returns'''''=====
{{main article|Batman Returns}}
The cave is once again seen in ''Batman Returns'', and Bruce gains access to it via a tube/elevator like passage from Wayne Manor, the entrance to which is hidden in an [[iron maiden]], and is activated by flipping a small switch hidden on a small replica of Wayne Manor in the bottom of a fish tank. Alfred also confirms, in a throwaway remark, that there is a staircase to the cave. The cave was huge and well lit and featured a forensics lab, a computer, unspecified machines, a closet for the costumes, the Batmobile, and its repair tools.

====='''''Batman Forever'''''=====
{{main article|Batman Forever}}
In this film, the Batcave is accessed through a rotating shelf which led to a staircase in Wayne Manor's silver closet, the only room in the mansion that is kept locked. The cave can also be reached via a secret tunnel system from Bruce Wayne's office at Wayne Enterprises, through which he rides down in a capsule. The capsule has a communication device Bruce used to communicate with Alfred. The cave features the main computer, as well as a crime lab (most of the machinery is unspecified) as well as a canal, which provides access to the sea for the Batboat. The cave also includes a lengthy tunnel used to launch the Batwing, which emerges from the cliffs underneath Wayne Manor. The cave features a rotating turntable that rises out of the floor, holding the [[Batmobile (Batman Forever)|Batmobile]], and a large dome-like structure where Bruce's Batsuits and gadgets are stored.

During an invasion of Wayne Manor by Riddler and Two Face, Riddler destroys the Batcomputer, the crime lab, every Batsuit except for the sonar prototype, and the Batmobile. In the deleted scenes, the Batcave has a secret section that Bruce fell as a child during the funeral of their parents. After being destroyed the Batcave, Bruce and Alfred come to that place where Bruce fell back to where finding the diary of his father and confronting his biggest fear; the giant bat.

====='''''Batman and Robin'''''=====
{{main article|Batman &amp; Robin (film)}}
This incarnation of the cave features a multitude of flashing lights, mostly in neon. On the whole, this Batcave is similar to that in ''Batman Forever'', only more [[garish]] in its decoration. A capsule containing Robin's [[Redbird (comics)|Redbird]] motorcycle rises out of the floor, and a long tunnel lined with neon lights leads out of the cave. The turntable holding the batmobile returns, but in a more elaborate fashion. The cave features the area used to store Batman's costume and a place to store Robin's.

====''The Dark Knight Trilogy''====

====='''''Batman Begins'''''=====

{{main article|Batman Begins}}
In ''Batman Begins'', the cave is still unfurnished, and the only things inside are a small workshop and a storage space for the Batsuit and its accessories, a medical area, and the [[Batmobile (Batman Begins)|Batmobile]]. The entrance and exit for the Batmobile are on a cliff, behind a waterfall. Alfred reveals to Bruce that during the Civil War, the Waynes used the vast cavern system as part of the [[Underground Railroad]]: after initially abseiling down a well (which Bruce fell down in his childhood) to get into the cave, they discover a hidden Civil War-era mechanical elevator which is still functional and leads to a hidden entrance in the mansion, which they then use as the primary means of entrance to the cave. The elevator is accessed by tapping three keys on a piano. Near the end of the film, when Bruce talks to Alfred about rebuilding the burnt-down main section of Wayne Manor, Alfred suggests they "improve the foundation", which may mean improving and furnishing the cave as they rebuild the mansion.

====='''''The Dark Knight'''''=====

{{main article|The Dark Knight (film)}}
As Wayne Manor is still under construction in ''The Dark Knight'', Batman's base of operations has been relocated to a large bunker beneath a shipping yard. One access point shown is through a shipping container which houses a secret hydraulic lift. The "Bat-bunker" also contains a wire mesh cage for the Batsuit, along with the associated weapons and tools, toolbox, and spare equipment for the Batmobile. In contrast to the Batcave, the large rectangular shaped room is brightly lit by banks of overhead fluorescent lights. Storage areas for the equipment are located both under the ground and within the walls giving the room a very empty appearance with the exception of a large bank of monitors to go with a well-developed computer system. In addition, the room is equipped with furnaces which Alfred uses to burn documents after Bruce decides to turn himself in.

====='''''The Dark Knight Rises'''''=====

{{main article|The Dark Knight Rises }}
The Batcave reappears in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' in full working condition. To access the cave, a similar way to ''Batman Begins'', tapping three keys on the piano will reveal a now modernly built elevator which takes the passenger straight to the cave. The newest addition to the cave is "[[Batplane#Live-action films|The Bat]]", a flying tank aircraft built by Wayne Enterprises' Applied Science Division and a Batcomputer as well numerous landing pads and a locking case which contains the Batsuit. Added features included that the bridges used to gain access to different sections can be submerged as well as the platforms as a form of security measures in case anyone gains unauthorized access to the cave. While submerged the only visible object is a Batcomputer terminal which can only be accessed by either Bruce or Alfred's fingerprints and an access code. The cave from ''The Dark Knight'' appears as well, which contains weapons, supplies, and a back-up [[Batsuit]]. After Bruce Wayne is declared legally dead, his will is amended so that [[Robin in other media#The Dark Knight Rises|John Blake]] inherits GPS coordinates that lead him to the Batcave.

====''DC Extended Universe''====

====='''''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'''''=====

{{main article|Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice}}
In this version, the Batcave is not located directly underneath Wayne Manor, but was originally in the woods on the manor's outskirts, with Bruce discovering the cave when he fell into them after running away during his parents' funeral. After Wayne Manor was destroyed in some unspecified fire, Bruce and Alfred relocated to a glass house built above the Batcave, which consists primarily of a long access passage that leads to a nearby lake and can be used for the [[Batmobile]] or (presumably) the [[Batplane]] to gain access. The elevator leading to the house also includes a chamber with an old Robin costume, apparently a memorial, while an upper level includes the Batcomputer and a workshop where Bruce and Alfred can work on Batman's various weapons, including the synthesiser used to distort his voice in the regular suit and the armour he uses to fight Superman.

====='''''Justice League'''''=====

{{main article|Justice League (film)}}
Following Superman's death, Bruce continues to operate out of the Batcave, which it is revealed also includes a large hangar where he has been working on a secret troop transport for the team he has been planning to create following Superman's death. As he works on the transport, he is visited by [[Wonder Woman|Diana]], and notes that the cave's security cost him millions of dollars. Once the team of himself, Diana, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] and [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] have come together for the first time to confront the powerful [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]], Bruce takes them to the Batcave to plan their next move, with an excited Barry Allen running all around the cave in seconds upon arrival.

====''The Lego Batman Movie''====
{{main article|The Lego Batman Movie}}

The Batcave is featured in ''The Lego Batman Movie''. This version of the Batcave is more larger as it contains many, many versions of the Batmobile, Bat-themed vehicles and Batsuits.

It is controlled by Batman's [[Artificial intelligence|sentient]], [[HAL-9000]]-like, [[Batcomputer]] (voiced by [[Siri]]), nicknamed 'Puter, who, as Batman enters the Batcave through a secret road on Wayne Island, asks him the password, which is "[[Iron Man]] sucks".

===Television===

====Early appearances====
The Bat-Cave was first seen in animation in various episodes of ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'', ''[[Super Friends]]'', and ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''. In these cartoons, the [[Batcomputer]] is present as usual. The voice of the Batcomputer was portrayed by [[Lou Scheimer]] in ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.

====DC animated universe====
{{main article|DC animated universe}}

====='''''Batman: The Animated Series'''''=====
In the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Beware the Gray Ghost", the Batcave is revealed to be an exact replica of the lair used by the [[Gray Ghost (fictional character)|Gray Ghost]], a fiction-within-fiction character and idol to Bruce Wayne.  There's also an exhibit of a collection of the Gray Ghost merchandise Bruce Wayne has collected since childhood. The Batcave gets introduced in this series as a large underground cavern. Bats are seen flying freely in the cave, with large naturally elevated platforms on which his sidekick [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] practices his balance. Batman often utilises the [[Batcomputer]], impressive technology during the time the series was produced (early to mid-1990s), to research information on villains, from an anti-venom to [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]'s plant poison to newspaper articles on the origin of [[Killer Croc]]. Batman's numerous crime-fighting vehicles are seen parked in an adjacent compartment to the Batcave, with an adjoining not-so-secret subterranean garage which stores Bruce Wayne's mammoth collection of vintage and luxury cars.

In the episode "[[Almost Got 'Im]]", Two-Face uses a giant penny in an attempt to either crush Batman or kill him from the impact, depending on whichever side the giant coin landed on. Batman managed to free himself from the coin by slicing open the ropes. While telling the story of this to other Batman villains, Two-Face commented that Batman got to keep the giant coin. It is seen later in the series (and its spin-offs), in the Batcave.

Several entrances to the cave are seen throughout the series. In early episodes, Batman is seen using an elevator that is accessed through a secret door hidden behind a bookcase. In later episodes, he is seen using the classic grandfather clock entrance from the comics. In certain episodes, the clock-entrance is opened by setting the hands of the clock the time Bruce's parents were killed (similar to certain comic book stories), while in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', the pendulum is pulled from behind the face of the clock to unlock the entrance.

====='''''The New Batman Adventures'''''=====
In the 1998 episode "[[Mean Seasons]]" from ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Batman and Batgirl are forced to fight a giant mechanical T-Rex. The comic book tie-in to the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' Batman – ''[[Batman Adventures]]'' #12 – features a short called "The Hidden Display" which tells how a young Dick Grayson persuades Batman into keeping a robot T-Rex early on his career, which eventually leads to the Trophy Room of the Cave. Either one of these tales could be how the animated Batman obtained the dinosaur. An extensive training area allows Barbara Gordon to take on robots as part of her training.

====='''''Batman Beyond'''''=====
This future Batcave of ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' replicas of Batman's enemies (both as wax dummies and robot combat trainers), and a display case with the many permutations of costumes of Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Batman himself. Other items which have been shown to be in the Cave include the Freeze Gun and helmet of [[Mr. Freeze]], the puppet [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Scarface]], a 'shrine' to Bruce Wayne's childhood TV hero, the [[Gray Ghost (fictional character)|Gray Ghost]], and the costumes of [[Harley Quinn]], [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Riddler]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], and [[Catwoman]].

The cave itself throughout the series also projected a shade of purple on person or persons while in the cave, making it appear as if Bruce's black suit was purple and Terry's bat symbol composed of purple and red. During the series, Bruce typically remained in the Batcave to coordinate Terry's efforts over the suit's video-link, giving him information and/or offering advice, although he would enter the field if the situation desperately called for it.

It also contains the original Batmobile and Batcomputer in the two part pilot, however by the subsequent episodes they had been removed and replaced with a new Batmobile which Terry uses throughout the series and feature film. How Bruce was able to refit and upgrade the Batcomputer and all other systems so quickly is never explained.

During her debut, Inque managed to infiltrate the Batcave by latching onto the Batmobile and 'riding' it back to the cave, but Bruce was certain that she would never be able to find the cave again as it was a dark night and Terry drives too fast for Inque to have any hope of retracting her steps. Communications tycoon Robert Vance once managed to essentially infiltrate the cave by transferring his mind into the Batsuit, but he promptly departed to pursue his own agenda and was purged from the suit in the subsequent fight. Gossip reporter Ian Peek was also able to access the cave using stolen technology that allowed him to phase through solid matter, but his discovery proved irrelevant when over-use of the technology caused him to become permanently intangible and fall into Earth's core before he could share that information with anyone else. In ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', the reborn Joker- revealed over the course of the film to be essentially a 'clone' of the deceased villain, his DNA and personality encoded on a microchip in the back of Tim Drake's neck that can take over his body- breaks into the cave and nearly poisons Bruce with the Joker's lethal laughing gas, but his attack provides a clue that helps Terry later determine the true nature of the returned clown, and all evidence suggests that he did not share his knowledge of Batman's true identity even with his new gang.

====='''''Justice League'''''=====
In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, the members of the League seek refuge in the Batcave during the [[Thanagarian]] invasion. Later, they also confront [[Hawkgirl]] in the cave, and use the [[Batcomputer]] to track her movements. When the Batcave comes under siege from the Thanagarians, one attempts to use Mr. Freeze's Freeze Gun on Superman; Superman repels the attack with a gust of wind, freezing the soldier. Flash also tips the infamous giant penny onto some of the attacking Thangarians ("Tails! I win!"). In a humorous scene, he also points to the T-Rex, stating "That's a giant dinosaur!", at which point Alfred states "And I thought Batman was the detective". It is assumed the League used the cave as a headquarters until the new Watchtower is built, as they decide Hawkgirl's fate in Wayne Manor in the wake of the invasion.

====''The Batman''====
''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', the animated series that debuted in 2004, features a much more high-tech Batcave, with large computer displays and flashing blue lights. Among these displays are the "Bat-Wave" warning signals, an alternate way of calling upon the Caped Crusader before the [[Bat-Signal]] went into service. Bruce Wayne is seen mostly without his Batsuit or with his cowl removed while in the cave, unlike in the earlier animated series. As a throwback to the old [[Adam West]] TV show, the cave has assorted 'Bat-poles' for Batman and Robin which allowed them from level to level in a faster manner.  Unlike the old series, it does not allow for instant costume changes.  The elevator system is featured quite a bit as well. A similar trophy room, this time storing memorabilia seen in earlier episodes such as [[The Riddler]]'s giant hourglass and [[The Joker (comics)|The Joker]]'s giant playing card trap, appears in the series. The series also shows that it was [[Alfred Pennyworth]] who started the museum, hoping it would be useful if the city of Gotham ever fully accepted Batman, somewhat like the [[Flash Museum]].

The cave was also the location of Season 3's climatic finale, "Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind", in which the villainous robot [[D.A.V.E.]] attempts to kill Alfred using an array of trophies garnered by the Batman, putting the Dark Knight in a position where he had to choose between revealing his secret identity to all of Gotham City, or allowing Alfred to be killed by the trap. However, even the Batcave isn't impervious to damage. In one episode, a loose raccoon causes a short circuit and subsequent blackout of electricity in the cave. In the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]'', it said that Batman's cave is in fact part of a series of [[Catacombs]] under Gotham City, which Batman uses to lure Dracula to the cave and subsequently kill him with the new solar generator.  On the episode "Joker's Express," it is revealed that the Batcave is also connected to some old mines beneath the city when Gotham was a thriving coal-mining town in the late 19th century.

In the Season 4 episode "Artifacts", archaeologists from the future unearth the Batcave. Its titanium supports are printed with binary code, as the computer information would not survive that long. The archaeologists theorize that Thomas Wayne was Batman and that Bruce Wayne was Robin. In another segment of the episode, set in 2027, Barbara Gordon (as the Oracle) is shown at the Batcomputer in the Batcave. Her wheelchair is also uncovered in the cave by the archaeologists, who believe that it was Alfred who used it.

Unlike in many previous incarnations of the Batcave which show only one exit/entrance, the Batmobile and other vehicles exit the cave through a variety of concealed dead-ends and disguised construction sites scattered around Gotham City. Batman also established a series of satellite Batcaves across Gotham on the show. Batcave South-Central debuted on the episode "[[Strange New World (The Batman)|Strange New World]]". In "[[The Joining, Part One]]", it is revealed that [[Lucius Fox]] helped the Batman in constructing the Batcave, and all of the Dark Knight's other secret safehouses throughout Gotham. Another satellite Batcave debuted on the episode "[[The Batman/Superman Story, Part One]]", under Wayne Industries which served as his new tech lab. In the episode, "The End of The Batman
", the villainous anti-Batman and Robin team, known as [[Wrath (comics)|The Wrath]] and his sidekick, Scorn, break into the Batcave, and attempt to kill Batman and Robin, causing large amounts of damage in the process. By the time of the two part finale involving all members of the Justice League the cave has been fully repaired.

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====
In ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', the Batcave makes its first appearance in the episode "Deep Cover for Batman," when [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]] attacks Batman inside it. In the following episode, "Game Over for Owlman," Batman brings the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], who is at the time partnered with him, to the cave (The Joker accidentally sprayed himself with knockout gas before and after they were in the Batcave, so he couldn't possibly know where the cave's location is). A number of trophies displayed include a giant clam and oversized-slot-machine-themed electric chair, death traps formerly used by the Joker, in reference to the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s TV show]]. The entrance to this Batcave can be seen briefly in ''The Brave and the Bold'' episode "Color of Revenge." It appears to be very similar to the ''Batman'' TV series Batcave. In The Siege of Starro Part 1, [[Faceless Hunter]] attacks Batman in the Batcave. In the episode "Darkseid Descending", a reserve Batcave (very similar to the "Bat-Bunker" in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'') is located inside the [[Lincoln Memorial]].

In "Menace of the Conquer Caveman" [[Booster Gold]] mentions that the Batcave will be converted into a historical attraction with its own built-in [[roller coaster]] in the 25th century. 

In "The Last Bat on Earth", Batman goes to the Batcave to use technology from his era to defeat [[Gorilla Grodd]] and his army of intelligent apes in [[Kamandi]]'s time.  A group of humanoid "Man-Bats" made the cave their home after the Great Disaster and are driven out by Batman and Kamandi.

==== ''Teen Titans'' ====
{{main article|Teen Titans (TV series)}}

In the episode "Haunted", the Batcave makes an appearance when Raven enters Robin's mind.

==== ''Young Justice'' ====
{{main article|Young Justice (TV series)}}

In the episode "Downtime", Alfred and Bruce Wayne are both seen in the Batcave observing [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]'s behavior.

==== ''Beware the Batman '' ====
{{main article|Beware the Batman}}

In this version the entrance to the Bat Cave is hidden behind a large fireplace in Wayne's trophy room. Batman brings unconscious guests in, such as [[Man-Bat]] and [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]], for questioning. The latter was drugged and blindfolded before being brought in for security measures. In the season finale, [[Deathstroke]] infiltrates the Batcave, takes Alfred hostage, and sets up explosives in order to detonate them and destroy the Batcave and everyone in it. Batman has a climatic final showdown against Deathstroke, while [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], [[Metamorpho]], and Man-Bat spread out to take down and dispose of the explosives.
====''Gotham''====
A cave appears in the interior of [[Wayne Manor]] in the five seasons of the FOX TV series [[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]].

===Video games===
Also in the 2008 video game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]],'' the Batcave is one of the fighting arenas.

====''Injustice''====
In the video game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', the Batcave is a level in the game, where the fighters can use Batman's various weapons and vehicles to damage their opponent; [[Green Arrow]] faces a villainous [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Black Adam]] in the Batcave when attempting to acquire a Kryptonite weapon to defeat the corrupted Superman of an alternate reality, and the 'true' Batman faces the alternate Batman in a fight in the Batcave to convince him to go along with the plan of summoning the Superman of their world to defeat the villainous Superman of the alternate world.

A new version of the Batcave appears as a level in ''[[Injustice 2]]''. This version was originally the Gotham Underground Subway built by Bruce's great-grandfather. It's also where Bruce keeps his communications and surveillance hub, Brother Eye. It is currently unknown if Batman reclaimed the original Batcave and Wayne Manor after the fall of Superman and The Regime.

====''Lego Batman''====
{{main article|Lego Batman}}
The Batcave is also featured in the 2012 video game ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes]]'' which features three parking 'areas' for land, sea and air based vehicles and their appropriate exits from the cave, the Batcomputer, used to replay past levels and 'warp' to various landmarks in Gotham and other elements shown in Batman media such as a waterfall, a Lincoln Penny and an animatronic T-Rex.

====''Batman: Arkham''====
{{main article|Batman: Arkham}}
In the 2009 video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]],'' Batman can access a secret auxiliary Batcave hidden within the cave system beneath Arkham Island after the Joker takes control of the asylum. This Batcave is small and fairly spartan (in comparison with Batman's primary Batcave), containing only two small platforms, a [[Batcomputer]], and one of Batman's Batwing planes. Near the end of the game this cave was partially destroyed by Poison Ivy.

Although not featured in the main story, the Batcave does appear as a downloadable challenge map in the 2011 video game sequel ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. During the main story, Batman is able to access the Batcomputer's database via his batsuit and can upload data to Alfred who can analyze it using the Batcomputer back at the Batcave.

The Batcave is accessible in the main campaign of ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]''. From the cave the player can use the Batwing fast travel system, switch to alternate skins and enter the challenge map rooms as opposed to selecting from the main menu as in previous Arkham games. Alfred is also present in the cave, supplying Batman with gadget upgrades. The Batcave is heavily damaged by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] during the game's climax. It is still damaged during the DLC ''Cold, Cold Heart'', set on New Year's Eve, just after the events of the main game. 

Although the Batcave is not accessible in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', Alfred co-ordinates all activity during the mission from the cave. He also activates the Knightfall Protocol from within the cave using Bruce's voice authorization password "Martha". When Wayne Manor was destroyed after Bruce activates the protocol, it is unknown if the Batcave survived the explosion. Throughout the game, both Batman and Robin utilize a Bat-Bunker of sorts underneath Panessa Studios, where Robin works to find a cure for those infected by Joker's blood in the previous game. The bunker contains holding cells for each infected patient, as well as medical equipment and a Bat-computer.

[[Image:Belene Island map.svg|thumb|200px|Map of Belene Island]]
The '''Belene labour camp''', also referred to as '''Belene concentration camp''', was part of the network of [[forced labour camps in Communist Bulgaria]]. It was located on the [[Belene Island]], between two branches of the [[Danube river]]. At the height of [[Valko Chervenkov]]'s repressions in 1952, the camp had 2,323 inmates - 2,248 men and 75 women.

The '''Belene Prison''' is still operating as a [[Prison|penitentiary]] in the western part of the island, while the eastern part is a managed [[natural reserve]].

This camp operated officially from 1949 to 1959, though a break in deportations to Belene occurred from 1954 to 1956. Between 1985 and 1989 [[Turks in Bulgaria]] who resisted the policy of changing Turkish names and surnames to Bulgarian ones, (see [[Assimilation Campaign in Bulgaria]])  were imprisoned in the prison on Belene. During those years, the [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] broadcast a series named "''Belene Adası''" (''Belene Island'') on the policies of the Bulgarian government against Bulgarian Turks.

From 1949 onward, Evangelical Christian pastors in particular were targeted as "enemies of the State" and sent to Belene. In 1949, the infamous "[[Pastors' Trial]]" was conducted, trying 13 Protestant pastors as "spies". The men received sentences of varying lengths. Haralan Popov, who survived and later founded the mission "Door of Hope International" to bring Bibles behind the Iron Curtain, published his autobiography under the Bulgarian title "The Bulgarian Golgotha". It was later released in English as "[[Tortured for His Faith]]".

The camp and some its survivors were the subject of a [[documentary film]] by [[German TV]] program [[ZDF]] ''Vorwärts aber nie vergessen. Ballade über bulgarische Helden'' ("Moving on, but Never Forgetting. A Ballad of Bulgarian Heroes" authored by [[Ilija Trojanow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dokumentation.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/19/0,1872,1021587_idDispatch:7247486,00.html ''Vorwärts und nie vergessen!''] videos of the documentary and the interview with the author Trojanow {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
David, from [[I Am David (film)]] escapes from Belene in 1952. However the camp shown in the film doesn't resemble the real Belene camp, as it is located inland in a mountainous area rather than on a river island.

The '''''Canadian Oxford Dictionary''''' is a [[dictionary]] of [[Canadian English]].  First published by [[Oxford University Press]] Canada in 1998, it became a well-known reference for Canadian English.

The second edition, published in 2004, contains about 300,000 entries, including about 2,200 true [[Canadian English#Vocabulary|Canadianisms]]. It also provides information on Canadian pronunciation and on Canadian spelling, which has features of both [[British English|British]] and [[American English|American]] spelling: ''colour'', ''centre'', and ''travelling'', but ''tire'', ''aluminum'' and ''realize''.

==Editorial staff and development method==
Until September 2008, Oxford maintained a permanent staff of [[lexicographer]]s in Canada, led by editor [[Katherine Barber]]. With its Canadian dictionary division closed, Oxford has since been outsourcing work on Canadian dictionary products to freelance editors.&lt;ref&gt;Canwest News Service, "[http://www.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=c74519ed-c8d5-4312-869b-af7508dd65cc Oxford closes Canadian dictionary division]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", October 1, 2008.  Retrieved 2008-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking and Curing''''' is a [[2005 in books|2005 book]] by [[Michael Ruhlman]] and [[Brian Polcyn]] about using the process of [[charcuterie]] to cure various meats, including [[bacon]], [[pastrami]], and [[sausage]]. The book received extremely positive reviews from numerous food critics and newspapers, causing national attention to be brought to the method of charcuterie. Because of the high amount of interest, copies of the book sold out for a period of a few months at [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]].&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite news |title=This blog is the cure for meat lovers |author=Scott Rowson |url=http://m.columbiatribune.com/news/2011/may/04/this-blog-is-the-cure-for-meat-lovers/ |newspaper=[[Columbia Daily Tribune]] |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119161953/http://m.columbiatribune.com/news/2011/may/04/this-blog-is-the-cure-for-meat-lovers/# |archive-date=2013-01-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The book covers the various methods of charcuterie, including the "brining, dry-curing, pickling, hot- and cold-smoking, sausage-making, confit, and the construction of pâtés" that also involves more than 140 recipes for various dishes that have been made with the described methods.&lt;ref name="Austin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cookbooks Gift Guide |author=Mick Vann |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/2005-12-02/315687/ |newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=December 2, 2005 |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Reviews for the book were overwhelmingly positive. Mick Vann of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' praised the use of "clear and concise instruction and revealing headnotes" and also said that the "realistic illustrations reinforce the text in an especially illuminating style, making it incredibly easy to follow the methods".&lt;ref name="Austin"/&gt; Hilary Hylton of ''[[TIME]]'' called it a "bible among foodie bloggers, eat-local enthusiasts and cooking professionals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Makin' Bacon: Foodies Are Going Hog Wild Over Pig |author=Hilary Hylton |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1918673,00.html |newspaper=[[TIME]] |date=August 28, 2009 |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorraine Eaton of ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'' said that the book "eloquently and patiently walks you through everything from bacon to Spanish chorizo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A shot at charcuterie: making my own bacon at home |author=Lorraine Eaton |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2011/03/shot-charcuterie-making-my-own-bacon-home |newspaper=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alison Arnett of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' described how it is a "detailed, even fussy, manual" and also how the author in an interview with her was surprised at the success of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charcuterie holds cure for run-of-the-mill meals |author=Alison Arnett |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/food/articles/2006/02/08/charcuterie_holds_cure_for_run_of_the_mill_meals/ |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |date=February 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hsiao-Ching Chou of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' said that the book "makes an impassioned case for 'why we still love and need hand-preserved foods in the age of the refrigerator, the frozen dinner, Domino's Pizza, and the 24-hour grocery store.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On Food: Home-cured meat: It's slow good |author=Hsiao-Ching Chou |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/On-Food-Home-cured-meat-It-s-slow-good-1192957.php |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=January 17, 2006 |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chou also stated that the "intellectual cook will delight in reading and, perhaps, 'cooking' from this book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charcuterie |author=Hsiao-Ching Chou |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/books/article/Treat-a-cook-to-a-delicious-fresh-cookbook-1188112.php |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=November 22, 2005 |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adina Steiman of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' said to cooks in her review, "if you love good sausage, quality salami, and honest bacon, you'll find this fascinating reading even if you only make the simpler recipes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Daring To Delve Deeper: 2005's Best Cookbooks |author=Adina Steiman |url=http://www.nysun.com/food-drink/daring-to-delve-deeper-2005s-best-cookbooks/24457/ |newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] |date=December 14, 2005 |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Rowson of the ''[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]'' called it "approachable, yet exhaustively researched".&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40861">'''Comparative genomic hybridization''' is a molecular [[cytogenetic]] method for analysing [[copy number variations]] (CNVs) relative to [[ploidy]] level in the DNA of a test sample compared to a reference sample, without the need for culturing cells.  The aim of this technique is to quickly and efficiently compare two genomic DNA samples arising from two sources, which are most often closely related, because it is suspected that they contain differences in terms of either gains or losses of either whole [[chromosomes]] or [[Chromosome regions|subchromosomal regions]] (a portion of a whole chromosome).  This technique was originally developed for the evaluation of the differences between the chromosomal complements of solid tumor and normal tissue,&lt;ref name="Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi,Sudar,Rutovitz,Gray,Waldman,Pinkel"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kallioniemi A, Kallioniemi OP, Sudar DA, Rutovitz D, Gray JW, Waldman F, Pinkel D | year = 1992 | title = Comparative genomic hybridization for molecular cytogenetic analysis of solid tumors | url = | journal = Science | volume = 258 | issue = 5083| pages = 818–821 | doi=10.1126/science.1359641}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an improved resolution of 5–10 [[megabases]] compared to the more traditional cytogenetic analysis techniques of [[giemsa banding]] and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) which are limited by the resolution of the microscope utilized.&lt;ref name="Strachan"&gt;Strachan T, Read AP (2010) Human Molecular Genetics: Garland Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest"&gt;Weiss M, Hermsen M, Meijer G, Van Grieken N, Baak J, Kuipers E, Van Diest P (1999) Comparative genomic hybridization. Molecular Pathology 52:243–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is achieved through the use of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization. In short, this involves the isolation of DNA from the two sources to be compared, most commonly a test and reference source, independent labelling of each DNA sample with [[fluorophores]] (fluorescent molecules) of different colours (usually red and green), [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of the DNA so that it is single stranded, and the [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] of the two resultant samples in a 1:1 ratio to a normal [[metaphase]] spread of chromosomes, to which the labelled DNA samples will bind at their [[locus (genetics)|locus]] of origin.  Using a fluorescence microscope and computer software, the differentially coloured fluorescent signals are then compared along the length of each chromosome for identification of chromosomal differences between the two sources. A higher intensity of the test sample colour in a specific region of a chromosome indicates the gain of material of that region in the corresponding source sample, while a higher intensity of the reference sample colour indicates the loss of material in the test sample in that specific region. A neutral colour (yellow when the fluorophore labels are red and green) indicates no difference between the two samples in that location.&lt;ref name="Strachan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

CGH is only able to detect unbalanced [[chromosomal abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]].  This is because balanced chromosomal abnormalities such as [[chromosomal translocation|reciprocal translocations]], [[chromosomal inversion|inversions]] or [[ring chromosomes]] do not affect copy number, which is what is detected by CGH technologies. CGH does, however, allow for the exploration of all 46 human chromosomes in single test and the discovery of deletions and duplications, even on the microscopic scale which may lead to the identification of [[candidate gene]]s to be further explored by other cytological techniques.&lt;ref name="Strachan" /&gt;

Through the use of [[DNA microarrays]] in conjunction with CGH techniques, the more specific form of array CGH (aCGH) has been developed, allowing for a locus-by-locus measure of CNV with increased resolution as low as 100 [[kilobase]]s.&lt;ref name="Pinkel,Albertson"&gt;Pinkel D, Albertson DG (2005) Comparative genomic hybridization. Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet 6:331–354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deRavel,Devriendt,Fryns,Vermeesch"&gt;de Ravel TJ, Devriendt K, Fryns J-P, Vermeesch JR (2007) What's new in karyotyping? The move towards array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). European Journal of Pediatrics 166:637–643.&lt;/ref&gt; This improved technique allows for the aetiology of known and unknown conditions to be discovered.

==History==
The motivation underlying the development of CGH stemmed from the fact that the available forms of cytogenetic analysis at the time ([[giemsa banding]] and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]]) were limited in their potential resolution by the microscopes necessary for interpretation of the results they provided. Furthermore, [[giemsa banding]]  interpretation has the potential to be ambiguous and therefore has lowered reliability, and both techniques require high labour inputs which limits the [[locus (genetics)|loci]] which may be examined.&lt;ref name="Pinkel,Albertson" /&gt;

The first report of CGH analysis was by Kallioniemi and colleagues in 1992 at the University of California, San Francisco, who utilised CGH in the analysis of solid tumors. They achieved this by the direct application of the technique to both breast cancer cell lines and [[Bladder cancer|primary bladder tumors]] in order to establish complete copy number [[karyotypes]] for the cells. They were able to identify 16 different regions of amplification, many of which were novel discoveries.&lt;ref name="Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi,Sudar,Rutovitz,Gray,Waldman,Pinkel" /&gt;

Soon after in 1993, du Manoir et al. reported virtually the same methodology. The authors painted a series of individual human chromosomes from a [[Library (biology)|DNA library]] with two different fluorophores in different proportions to test the technique,  and also applied CGH to genomic [[DNA]] from patients affected with either [[Downs syndrome]] or [[T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia]] as well as cells of a renal papillary carcinoma cell line. It was concluded that the fluorescence ratios obtained were accurate and that differences between genomic DNA from different cell types were detectable, and therefore that CGH was a highly useful cytogenetic analysis tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = du Manoir S, Speicher MR, Joos S, Schröck E, Popp S, Döhner H, Kovacs G, Robert-Nicoud M, Lichter P, Cremer T | year = 1993 | title = Detection of complete and partial chromosome gains and losses by comparative genomic in situ hybridization | url = | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 90 | issue = 6| pages = 590–610 | doi=10.1007/bf00202476| pmid = 8444465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the widespread use of CGH technology was difficult, as protocols were not uniform and therefore inconsistencies arose, especially due to uncertainties in the interpretation of data.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt; However, in 1994 a review was published which described an easily understood protocol in detail&lt;ref&gt;Kallioniemi OP, Kallioniemi A, Piper J, Isola J, Waldman FM, Gray JW, Pinkel D (1994) Optimizing comparative genomic hybridization for analysis of DNA sequence copy number changes in solid tumors. Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer 10:231–243.&lt;/ref&gt; and the image analysis software was made available commercially, which allowed CGH to be utilised all around the world.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;
As new techniques such as microdissection and [[degeneracy (biology)|degenerate]] [[oligonucleotide]] primed [[polymerase chain reaction]] (DOP-PCR) became available for the generation of DNA products, it was possible to apply the concept of CGH to smaller chromosomal abnormalities, and thus the resolution of CGH was improved.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

The implementation of array CGH, whereby [[DNA microarrays]] are used instead of the traditional metaphase chromosome preparation, was pioneered by Solinas-Tolodo et al. in 1997 using tumor cells&lt;ref&gt;Solinas‐Toldo S, Lampel S, Stilgenbauer S, Nickolenko J, Benner A, Döhner H, Cremer T, Lichter P (1997) Matrix‐based comparative genomic hybridization: biochips to screen for genomic imbalances. Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer 20:399–407.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pinkel et al. in 1998 by use of breast cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkel D, Segraves R, Sudar D, Clark S, Poole I, Kowbel D, Collins C, Kuo W-L, Chen C, Zhai Y (1998) High resolution analysis of DNA copy number variation using comparative genomic hybridization to microarrays. Nature genetics 20:207–211.&lt;/ref&gt; This was made possible by the [[Human Genome Project]] which generated a library of cloned DNA fragments with known locations throughout the human [[genome]], with these fragments being used as [[hybridization probe|probes]] on the DNA microarray.&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love"&gt;Marquis-Nicholson R, Aftimos S, Hayes I, George A, Love DR (2010) Array comparative genomic hybridization: a new tool in the diagnostic genetic armoury. NZ Med J 123:50–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Now probes of various origins such as cDNA, genomic PCR products and [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs) can be used on DNA microarrays which may contain up to 2 million probes.&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love" /&gt; Array CGH is automated, allows greater resolution (down to 100 kb) than traditional CGH as the probes are far smaller than metaphase preparations, requires smaller amounts of DNA, can be targeted to specific chromosomal regions if required and is ordered and therefore faster to analyse, making it far more adaptable to diagnostic uses.&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inazawa J, Inoue J, Imoto I | year = 2004 | title = Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)‐arrays pave the way for identification of novel cancer‐related genes | url = | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 559–563 | doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb02486.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic methods==

===Metaphase slide preparation===
The DNA on the slide is a reference sample, and is thus obtained from a karyotypically normal man or woman, though it is preferential to use female DNA as they possess two X chromosomes which contain far more genetic information than the male Y chromosome. Phytohaemagglutinin stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes are used. 1mL of heparinised blood is added to 10ml of culture medium and incubated for 72 hours at 37&amp;nbsp;°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Colchicine is added to arrest the cells in mitosis, the cells are then harvested and treated with hypotonic [[potassium chloride]] and fixed in 3:1 [[methanol]]/[[acetic acid]].&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

One drop of the cell suspension should then be dropped onto an ethanol cleaned slide from a distance of about 30&amp;nbsp;cm, optimally this should be carried out at room temperature at humidity levels of 60–70%. Slides should be evaluated by visualisation using a phase contrast microscope, minimal cytoplasm should be observed and chromosomes should not be overlapping and be 400–550 bands long with no separated [[chromatids]] and finally should appear dark rather than shiny. Slides then need to be air dried overnight at room temperature, and any further storage should be in groups of four at −20&amp;nbsp;°C with either [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] beads or [[nitrogen]] present to maintain dryness. Different donors should be tested as hybridization may be variable. Commercially available slides may be used, but should always be tested first.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===Isolation of DNA from test tissue and reference tissue===

Standard [[phenol extraction]] is used to obtain DNA from test or reference (karyotypically normal individual) tissue, which involves the combination of [[Tris]]-[[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] and [[phenol]] with [[aqueous solution|aqueous]]  DNA in equal amounts. This is followed by separation by agitation and centrifugation, after which the [[aqueous solution|aqueous]] layer is removed and further treated using [[ether]] and finally [[ethanol precipitation]] is used to concentrate the DNA.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

May be completed using DNA isolation kits available commercially which are based on [[Affinity chromatography|affinity columns]].&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

Preferentially, DNA should be extracted from fresh or frozen tissue as this will be of the highest quality, though it is now possible to use archival material which is formalin fixed or paraffin wax embedded, provided the appropriate procedures are followed. 0.5-1&amp;nbsp;µg of DNA is sufficient for the CGH experiment, though if the desired amount is not obtained DOP-PCR may be applied to amplify the DNA, however it in this case it is important to apply DOP-PCR to both the test and reference DNA samples to improve reliability.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===DNA labelling===

[[Nick translation]] is used to label the DNA and involves cutting DNA and substituting nucleotides labelled with fluorophores (direct labelling) or biotin or oxigenin to have fluophore conjugated [[Antibody|antibodies]] added later (indirect labelling). It is then important to check fragment lengths of both test and reference DNA by [[gel electrophoresis]], as they should be within the range of 500kb-1500kb for optimum hybridization.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===Blocking===
Unlabelled Life Technologies Corporation's Cot-1 DNA® (placental DNA enriched with repetitive sequences of length 50bp-100bp)is added to block normal repetitive DNA sequences, particularly at [[centromeres]] and [[telomeres]], as these sequences, if detected, may reduce the fluorescence ratio and cause gains or losses to escape detection.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===Hybridization===
8–12µl of each of labelled test and labelled reference DNA are mixed and 40&amp;nbsp;µg Cot-1 DNA® is added, then precipitated and subsequently dissolved in 6µl of hybridization mix, which contains 50% formamide to decrease DNA melting temperature and 10% dextran sulphate to increase the effective probe concentration in a saline sodium citrate (SSC) solution at a pH of 7.0.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

[[Denaturation (biochemistry)|Denaturation]] of the slide and probes are carried out separately.  The slide is submerged in 70% formamide/2xSSC for 5–10 minutes at 72&amp;nbsp;°C, while the probes are denatured by immersion in a water bath of 80&amp;nbsp;°C for 10 minutes and are immediately added to the metaphase slide preparation. This reaction is then covered with a coverslip and left for two to four days in a humid chamber at 40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

The coverslip is then removed and 5 minute washes are applied, three using 2xSSC at room temperature, one at 45&amp;nbsp;°C with 0.1xSSC and one using TNT at room temperature. The reaction is then preincubated for 10 minutes then followed by a 60-minute, 37&amp;nbsp;°C incubation, three more 5 minute washes with TNT then one with 2xSSC at room temperature.  The slide is then dried using an ethanol series of 70%/96%/100% before counterstaining with DAPI (0.35 μg/ml), for chromosome identification, and sealing with a coverslip.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

===Fluorescence visualisation and imaging===
A [[fluorescence microscope]] with the appropriate filters for the [[DAPI]] stain as well as the two fluorophores utilised is required for visualisation, and these filters should also minimise the crosstalk between the fluorophores, such as narrow band pass filters. The microscope must provide uniform illumination without [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] variation, be appropriately aligned and have a “plan” type of objective which is [[apochromat]]ic and give a magnification of x63 or x100.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

The image should be recorded using a camera with spatial resolution at least 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm at the specimen level and give an image of at least 600x600 pixels. The camera must also be able to integrate the image for at least 5 to 10 seconds, with a minimum photometric resolution of 8 bit.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

Dedicated CGH software is commercially available for the image processing step, and is required to subtract background noise, remove and segment materials not of chromosomal origin, [[Normalization (statistics)|normalize]]  the fluorescence ratio, carry out interactive karyotyping and chromosome scaling to standard length. A “relative copy number karyotype” which presents chromosomal areas of deletions or amplifications is generated by averaging the ratios of a number of high quality metaphases and plotting them along an ideogram, a diagram identifying chromosomes based on banding patterns. Interpretation of the ratio profiles is conducted either using fixed or statistical thresholds ([[confidence intervals]]). When using confidence intervals, gains or losses are identified when 95% of the fluorescence ratio does not contain 1.0.&lt;ref name="Weiss,Hermsen,Meijer,VanGrieken,Baak,Kuipers,VanDiest" /&gt;

=== Extra notes ===
Extreme care must be taken to avoid contamination of any step involving DNA, especially with the test DNA as contamination of the sample with normal DNA will skew results closer to 1.0, thus abnormalities may go undetected. FISH, [[PCR]]  and [[flow cytometry]] experiments may be employed to confirm results.&lt;ref name="Pinkel,Albertson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evangelidou,Alexandrou,Moutafi,Ioannides,Antonios,Koumbaris,Kallikas,Velissariou,Sismani,Patsalis"&gt;Evangelidou P, Alexandrou A, Moutafi M, Ioannides M, Antoniou P, Koumbaris G, Kallikas I, Velissariou V, Sismani C, Patsalis PC (2013) Implementation of High Resolution Whole Genome Array CGH in the Prenatal Clinical Setting: Advantages, Challenges, and Review of the Literature. BioMed Research International 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Array comparative genomic hybridization==
{{anchor|Array-CGH}}
Array comparative genomic hybridization (also microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, matrix CGH, array CGH, aCGH) is a molecular [[cytogenetic]] technique for the detection of chromosomal [[Copy-number variation|copy number changes]] on a genome wide and high-resolution scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinkel D, Albertson DG | year = 2005 | title = Array comparative genomic hybridization and its applications in cancer | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 11–17 | doi=10.1038/ng1569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Array CGH compares the patient's genome against a reference genome and identifies differences between the two genomes, and hence locates regions of [[genetic imbalance|genomic imbalances]] in the patient, utilizing the same principles of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization as traditional CGH.

With the introduction of array CGH, the main limitation of conventional CGH, a low resolution, is overcome. In array CGH, the metaphase chromosomes are replaced by [[molecular cloning|cloned]] DNA fragments (+100–200 kb) of which the exact chromosomal location is known. This allows the detection of [[chromosome abnormality|aberrations]] in more detail and, moreover, makes it possible to map the changes directly onto the genomic sequence.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra"&gt;Oostlander AE, Meijer GA, Ylstra B (2004) Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and its applications in human genetics. Clin Genet 66:488–495.&lt;/ref&gt;

Array CGH has proven to be a specific, sensitive, fast and highthroughput technique, with considerable advantages compared to other methods used for the analysis of DNA copy number changes making it more amenable to diagnostic applications. Using this method, [[copy number]] changes at a level of 5–10 [[kilobase]]s of DNA sequences can be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ren H, Francis W, Boys A, Chueh AC, Wong N, La P, Wong LH, Ryan J, Slater HR, Choo KH |title=BAC-based PCR fragment microarray: high-resolution detection of chromosomal deletion and duplication breakpoints |journal=Human Mutation |pmid=15832308 |doi=10.1002/humu.20164 |volume=25 |issue=5 |date=May 2005 |pages=476–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2006}}, even [[high-resolution CGH]] ([[HR-CGH]]) arrays are accurate to detect [[structural variation]]s (SV) at resolution of 200 bp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Urban AE, Korbel JO, Selzer R, Richmond T, Hacker A, Popescu GV, Cubells JF, Green R, Emanuel BS, Gerstein MB, Weissman SM, Snyder M |title=High-resolution mapping of DNA copy alterations in human chromosome 22 using high-density tiling oligonucleotide arrays |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |date=21 March 2006 |volume=103 |issue=12 |pages=4534–4539 |pmid=16537408 |pmc=1450206 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0511340103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method allows one to identify new recurrent chromosome changes such as [[microdeletion]]s and duplications in human conditions such as [[cancer]] and [[birth defect]]s due to chromosome aberrations.

[[File:Array-CGH protocol.svg|right|thumb|Figure 2. Array-CGH protocol]]

===Methodology===

Array CGH is based on the same principle as conventional CGH. In both techniques, DNA from a reference (or control) sample and DNA from a test (or patient) sample are differentially labelled with two different fluorophores and used as [[hybridization probe|probes]]  that are cohybridized competitively onto [[nucleic acid]] targets. In conventional CGH, the target is a reference metaphase spread. In array CGH, these targets can be genomic fragments cloned in a variety of vectors (such as [[Bacterial artificial chromosome|BACs]] or [[plasmids]]), [[Complementary DNA|cDNAs]], or [[oligonucleotides]].&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer"&gt;Bejjani BA, Shaffer LG (2006) Applications of array-based comparative genomic hybridization to clinical diagnostics. J Mol Diagn 8:528–533.&lt;/ref&gt;

Figure 2.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; is a schematic overview of the array CGH technique. DNA from the sample to be tested is labeled with a red fluorophore ([[Cyanine]] 5) and a reference DNA sample is labeled with green fluorophore (Cyanine 3). Equal quantities of the two DNA samples are mixed and cohybridized to a DNA microarray of several thousand evenly spaced cloned DNA fragments or oligonucleotides, which have been spotted in triplicate on the array. After hybridization, digital imaging systems are used to capture and quantify the relative fluorescence intensities of each of the hybridized fluorophores.&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer" /&gt; The resulting ratio of the fluorescence intensities is proportional to the ratio of the copy numbers of DNA sequences in the test and reference genomes. If the intensities of the flurochromes are equal on one probe, this region of the patient's genome is interpreted as having equal quantity of DNA in the test and reference samples; if there is an altered Cy3:Cy5 ratio this indicates a loss or a gain of the patient DNA at that specific genomic region.&lt;ref&gt;Shinawi M, Cheung SW (2008) The array CGH and its clinical applications. Drug Discovery Today 13:760–769.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological approaches to array CGH===

[[File:ACGH profile of the IMR32 neuroblastoma cell line.svg|right|thumb|ACGH profile of the IMR32 neuroblastoma cell line]]
Array CGH has been implemented using a wide variety of techniques. Therefore, some of the advantages and limitations of array CGH are dependent on the technique chosen.
The initial approaches used arrays produced from large insert genomic DNA clones, such as [[bacterial artificial chromosome|BACs]]. The use of BACs provides sufficient intense signals to detect single-copy changes and to locate aberration boundaries accurately. However, initial DNA yields of isolated BAC clones are low and DNA amplification techniques are necessary. These techniques include [[Covalent bond|ligation]]-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR), degenerate primer PCR using one or several sets of primers, and [[rolling circle amplification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiegler H, Carr P, Douglas EJ, Burford DC, Hunt S, Scott CE, Smith J, Vetrie D, Gorman P, Tomlinson IP, Carter NP | year = 2003 | title = DNA microarrays for comparative genomic hybridization based on DOP-PCR amplification of BAC and PAC clones | url = | journal = Genes Chromosomes Cancer | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 361–374 | doi=10.1002/gcc.10155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrays can also be constructed using cDNA. These arrays currently yield a high spatial resolution, but the number of cDNAs is limited by the genes that are encoded on the chromosomes, and their sensitivity is low due to cross-hybridization.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; This results in the inability to detect single copy changes on a genome wide scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pollack JR, Perou CM, Alizadeh AA, Eisen MB, Pergamenschikov A, Williams CF, Jeffrey SS, Botstein D, Brown PO | year = 1999 | title = Genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number changes using cDNA microarrays | doi = 10.1038/12640 | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 41–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest approach is spotting the arrays with short oligonucleotides. The amount of oligos is almost infinite, and the processing is rapid, cost-effective, and easy. Although oligonucleotides do not have the sensitivity to detect single copy changes, averaging of ratios from oligos that map next to each other on the chromosome can compensate for the reduced sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carvalho B, Ouwerkerk E, Meijer GA, Ylstra B | year = 2004 | title = High resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridization analysis using spotted oligonucleotides | url = | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 644–646 | doi=10.1136/jcp.2003.013029}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to use arrays which have overlapping probes so that specific breakpoints may be uncovered.

===Design approaches===

There are two approaches to the design of microarrays for CGH applications: whole genome and targeted.

Whole genome arrays are designed to cover the entire human genome. They often include clones that provide an extensive coverage across the genome; and arrays that have contiguous coverage, within the limits of the genome. Whole-genome arrays have been constructed mostly for research applications and have proven their outstanding worth in gene discovery. They are also very valuable in screening the genome for DNA gains and losses at an unprecedented resolution.&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer" /&gt;

Targeted arrays are designed for a specific region(s) of the genome for the purpose of evaluating that targeted segment. It may be designed to study a specific chromosome or chromosomal segment or to identify and evaluate specific DNA dosage abnormalities in individuals with suspected microdeletion syndromes or subtelomeric rearrangements. The crucial goal of a targeted microarray in medical practice is to provide clinically useful results for diagnosis, genetic counseling, prognosis, and clinical management of unbalanced cytogenetic abnormalities.&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Conventional===

Conventional CGH has been used mainly for the identification of chromosomal regions that are recurrently lost or gained in tumors, as well as for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss MM, Kuipers EJ, Meuwissen SG, van Diest PJ, Meijer GA (2003) Comparative genomic hybridization as a supportive tool in diagnostic pathology. J Clin Pathol 56:522–527.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach can also be used to study [[chromosomal aberrations]] in [[fetal]] and [[neonatal]] genomes. Furthermore, conventional CGH can be used in detecting chromosomal abnormalities and have been shown to be efficient in diagnosing complex abnormalities associated with human genetic disorders.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt;

====In cancer research====
CGH data from several studies of the same tumor type show consistent patterns of non-random genetic aberrations.&lt;ref name="Forozan,Karhu,Kononen,Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forozan F, Karhu R, Kononen J, Kallioniemi A, Kallioniemi OP | year = 1997 | title = Genome screening by comparative genomic hybridization | url = | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 13 | issue = 10| pages = 405–409 | doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(97)01244-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these changes appear to be common to various kinds of malignant tumors, while others are more tumor specific. For example, gains of chromosomal regions lq, 3q and 8q, as well as losses of 8p, 13q, 16q and 17p, are common to a number of tumor types, such as breast, ovarian, prostate, renal and bladder cancer (Figure. 3). Other alterations, such as 12p and Xp gains in testicular cancer, 13q gain 9q loss in bladder cancer, 14q loss in renal cancer and Xp loss in ovarian cancer are more specific, and might reflect the unique selection forces operating during cancer development in different organs.&lt;ref name="Forozan,Karhu,Kononen,Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi" /&gt; Array CGH is also frequently used in research and diagnostics of B cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

====Chromosomal aberrations====
[[Cri du Chat]] (CdC) is a syndrome caused by a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5.&lt;ref name="Levy,Dunn,Kern,Hirschhorn,Kardon"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy B, Dunn TM, Kern JH, Hirschhorn K, Kardon NB | year = 2002 | title = Delineation of the dup5q phenotype by molecular cytogenetic analysis in a patient with dup5q/del 5p (Cri du Chat) | url = | journal = Am J Med Genet | volume = 108 | issue = 3| pages = 192–197 | doi=10.1002/ajmg.10261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that conventional CGH is suitable to detect the deletion, as well as more complex chromosomal alterations. For example, Levy et al. (2002) reported an infant with a cat-like cry, the hallmark of CdC, but having an indistinct karyotype. CGH analysis revealed a loss of chromosomal material from 5p15.3 confirming the diagnosis clinically. These results demonstrate that conventional CGH is a reliable technique in detecting structural aberrations and, in specific cases, may be more efficient in diagnosing complex abnormalities.&lt;ref name="Levy,Dunn,Kern,Hirschhorn,Kardon" /&gt;

===Array CGH===
Array CGH applications are mainly directed at detecting genomic abnormalities in cancer. However, array CGH is also suitable for the analysis of DNA copy number aberrations that cause human genetic disorders.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; That is, array CGH is employed to uncover deletions, amplifications, breakpoints and ploidy abnormalities. Earlier diagnosis is of benefit to the patient as they may undergo appropriate treatments and counseling to improve their prognosis.&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love" /&gt;

====Genomic abnormalities in cancer====
Genetic alterations and rearrangements occur frequently in cancer and contribute to its pathogenesis. Detecting these aberrations by array CGH provides information on the locations of important cancer genes and can have clinical use in diagnosis, cancer classification and prognostification.&lt;ref name="Bejjani,Shaffer" /&gt; However, not all of the losses of genetic material are pathogenetic, since some DNA material is physiologically lost during the rearrangement of immunoglobulin subgenes. In a recent study, array CGH has been implemented to identify regions of chromosomal aberration ([[copy-number variation]]) in several mouse models of breast cancer, leading to identification of cooperating genes during myc-induced oncogenesis.&lt;ref name="aprelikova"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aprelikova O, Chen K, El Touny LH, Brignatz-Guittard C, Han J, Qiu T, Yang HH, Lee MP, Zhu M, Green JE | title = The epigenetic modifier JMJD6 is amplified in mammary tumors and cooperates with c-Myc to enhance cellular transformation, tumor progression, and metastasis | journal = Clin Epigenetics | volume = 8 | issue = 38 | date = Apr 2016 | doi = 10.1186/s13148-016-0205-6 | url = http://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-016-0205-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Array CGH may also be applied not only to the discovery of chromosomal abnormalities in cancer, but also to the monitoring of the progression of tumors. Differentiation between [[metastatic]] and mild lesions is also possible using FISH once the abnormalities have been identified by array CGH.&lt;ref name="deRavel,Devriendt,Fryns,Vermeesch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marquis-Nicholson,Aftimos,Hayes,George,Love" /&gt;

====Submicroscopic aberrations====
[[Prader–Willi syndrome]] (PWS) is a paternal structural abnormality involving 15q11-13, while a maternal aberration in the same region causes Angelman syndrome (AS). In both syndromes, the majority of cases (75%) are the result of a 3–5 Mb deletion of the PWS/AS critical region.&lt;ref&gt;L'Hermine AC, Aboura A, Brisset S, Cuisset L, Castaigne V, Labrune P, Frydman R, Tachdjian G. (2003) Fetal phenotype of Prader–Willi syndrome due to maternal disomy for chromosome 15. Prenat Diagn 23:938–943.&lt;/ref&gt; These small aberrations cannot be detected using [[cytogenetics]] or conventional CGH, but can be readily detected using array CGH. As a proof of principle Vissers et al. (2003) constructed a genome wide array with a 1 Mb resolution to screen three patients with known, FISH-confirmed microdeletion syndromes, including one with PWS. In all three cases, the abnormalities, ranging from 1.5 to 2.9Mb, were readily identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vissers LE, de Vries BB, Osoegawa K, Janssen IM, Feuth T, Choy CO, Straatman H, van der Vliet W, Huys EH, van Rijk A, Smeets D, van Ravenswaaij-Arts CM, Knoers NV, van der Burgt I, de Jong PJ, Brunner HG, Geurts , van Kessel A, Schoenmakers EF, Veltman JA | year = 2003 | title = Array-based comparative genomic hybridization for the genome-wide detection of submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 1261–1270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, array CGH was demonstrated to be a specific and sensitive approach in detecting submicroscopic aberrations.

When using overlapping microarrays, it is also possible to uncover breakpoints involved in chromosomal aberrations.

====Prenatal genetic diagnosis====
Though not yet a widely employed technique, the use of array CGH as a tool for preimplantation genetic screening is becoming an increasingly popular concept. It has the potential to detect CNVs and [[aneuploidy]] in eggs, sperm or embryos which may contribute to failure of the embryo to successfully implant, miscarriage or conditions such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21). This makes array CGH a promising tool to reduce the incidence of life altering conditions and improve success rates of [[IVF]] attempts. The technique involves whole genome amplification from a single cell which is then used in the array CGH method. It may also be used in couples carrying [[chromosome translocations|chromosomal translocations]] such as balanced reciprocal translocations or Robertsonian translocations, which have the potential to cause chromosomal imbalances in their offspring.&lt;ref name="Evangelidou,Alexandrou,Moutafi,Ioannides,Antonios,Koumbaris,Kallikas,Velissariou,Sismani,Patsalis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiorentino F | year = 2012 | title = Array comparative genomic hybridization: its role in preimplantation genetic diagnosis | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 203–209 | doi=10.1097/gco.0b013e328355854d}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee CN, Lin SY, Lin CH, Shih JC, Lin TH, Su YN | year = 2012 | title = Clinical utility of array comparative genomic hybridization for prenatal diagnosis: a cohort study of 3171 pregnancies | url = | journal = BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 614–625 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2012.03279.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of CGH and array CGH==
A main disadvantage of conventional CGH is its inability to detect structural chromosomal aberrations without [[copy number variant|copy number changes]], such as [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]], balanced [[chromosomal translocations]], and [[chromosomal inversion|inversions]]. CGH can also only detect gains and losses relative to the ploidy level.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss MM, Hermsen MAJA, Meijer GA, van Grieken NCT, Baak JPA, Kuipers EJ, van Deist PJ (1999) Comparative genomic hybridization. J Clin Pathol: Mol Pathol 52:243–251.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chromosomal regions with short repetitive DNA sequences are highly variable between individuals and can interfere with CGH analysis.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; Therefore, repetitive DNA regions like centromeres and telomeres need to be blocked with unlabeled repetitive DNA (e.g. Cot1 DNA) and/or can be omitted from screening.&lt;ref&gt;du Manoir S, Schrock E, Bentz M, Speicher MR, Joos S, Ried T, Lichter P, Cremer T (1995) Quantitative analysis of comparative genomic hybridization. Cytometry 19:27–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the resolution of conventional CGH is a major practical problem that limits its clinical applications. Although CGH has proven to be a useful and reliable technique in the research and diagnostics of both cancer and human genetic disorders, the applications involve only gross abnormalities. Because of the limited resolution of metaphase chromosomes, aberrations smaller than 5–10 Mb cannot be detected using conventional CGH.&lt;ref name="Forozan,Karhu,Kononen,Kallioniemi,Kallioniemi" /&gt;
For the detection of such abnormalities, a high-resolution technique is required.
Array CGH overcomes many of these limitations. Array CGH is characterized by a high resolution, its major advantage with respect to conventional CGH. The standard resolution varies between 1 and 5 Mb, but can be increased up to approximately 40 kb by supplementing the array with extra clones. However, as in conventional CGH, the main disadvantage of array CGH is its inability to detect aberrations that do not result in copy number changes and is limited in its ability to detect mosaicism.&lt;ref name="Oostlander,Meijer,Ylstra" /&gt; The level of mosaicism that can be detected is dependent on the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the clones. At present, rearrangements present in approximately 50% of the cells is the detection limit. For the detection of such abnormalities, other techniques, such as SKY (Spectral karyotyping) or FISH have to still be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shaw CJ, Stankiewicz P, Bien-Willner G, Bello SC, Shaw CA, Carrera M, Perez Jurado L, Estivill X, Lupski JR | year = 2004 | title = Small marker chromosomes in two patients with segmental aneusomy for proximal 17p | url = | journal = Hum Genet | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 1–7 | pmid = 15098121 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-004-1119-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''comparison of [[Gaelic football]] and [[rugby union]]''' is possible because of certain similarities between the codes, as well as the numerous dissimilarities.

Until the mid-1990s, both codes were strictly amateur. The highest level of Gaelic Football remains amateur, whereas rugby union now offers professional and semi-professional levels of competition. Players have successfully made the transition to top levels in both codes, and because rugby union is played at the professional level, there is a financial lure for players to [[Players_who_have_converted_from_one_football_code_to_another#Gaelic_football_to_Rugby_Union|switch from Gaelic football to rugby union]]. A small number have made [[Players_who_have_converted_from_one_football_code_to_another#Rugby_union_to_Gaelic_football|the journey the other way]].

Both codes are organised on an all-Ireland basis, with provincial bodies.

Rugby union has a number of set pieces, such as line-outs, scrums and rucks that do not have direct equivalents in Gaelic football. Gaelic football aims at a more open kind of play, and as such falls between rugby and soccer.

Both codes use rectangular grassed fields however the Gaelic football pitch has a larger area. A Gaelic football pitch is 130–145 metres long and 80–90 metres wide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.gaa.ie/coaching-and-games-development/rules-and-specifications/rules-of-specifications/ |title =Rules of specifications |accessdate =11 June 2011 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110603070204/http://www.gaa.ie/coaching-and-games-development/rules-and-specifications/rules-of-specifications |archivedate =3 June 2011 |df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are marked at distances of 13 m, 20 m and 45 m from each end-line whereas the Rugby field is as near as possible to a maximum of 144m long by 70m wide.&lt;ref name="pitch size"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/LawsRegs/0/Law1EN_7709.pdf |title=Law 1: The Ground |page=21 |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219162936/http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/LawsRegs/0/Law1EN_7709.pdf |archivedate=19 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a maximum of 100m between the two try lines.

Another key difference is the goal posts. Rugby union posts consists of two posts with a crossbar but without a net, whereas Gaelic football consists of two posts with crossbar and a net. The area above the crossbar is used for scoring in both codes, however, only in Gaelic football is the area underneath the posts used for scoring kicks. The goal posts in Gaelic football are narrower and the crossbar is lower.

}}

The obvious difference is the ball used.

Rugby union uses an oval ball (a [[prolate spheroid]]). This makes a difference in the variety and style of [[kick (football)|kicking]]. Rugby union is capable of producing a diverse range of kicking styles.

Gaelic football uses a round ball similar to a soccer or volleyball. The round ball can be kicked anyway you like, inside, outside and middle of your boot. The instep is the most popular style based on culture, the drop punt used in Gaelic is a far superior kick in terms of distance and accuracy but is rarely taught. It is made of 18 stitched leather panels, with a circumference of {{convert|69|-|74|cm|in|abbr=on}}, weighing between {{convert|370|-|425|g|oz|abbr=on}} when dry. It may be kicked or ''hand passed''. A hand pass is not a punch but rather a strike of the ball with the side of the closed fist, using the knuckle of the thumb.

==Duration==
The majority of adult Gaelic football and all minor and under-21 matches last for 60 minutes, divided into two-halves of 30 minutes, with the exception of senior inter-county games which last for 70 minutes (two-halves of 35 minutes). Draws are decided by replays or by playing 20 minutes of extra time (two-halves of 10 minutes). The under-12s have a half of 20 minutes or 25 minutes in some cases. Half-time lasts for about 15 minutes.

A rugby union game is divided into two-halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower-grade games) separated by a half time period of up to 15 minutes in an [[Test match (rugby union)|international]] match. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball becomes dead – any occurrence that would have play restart with a scrum or line-out, or when a team scores. This has led to some 'nail-biting' finishes where teams losing by only a small margin work their way towards scoring, and games can go on several minutes over time. The clock is also stopped during substitutions and for injuries, so the referee does not need to add [[stoppage time]].

==Advancing the ball==
In both games, players must dispose of the ball correctly, by hand or by foot. Gaelic football deems the ''open hand tap'' to be legitimate disposal.

Unlike Gaelic football, rugby union has an [[offside (sport)|offside rule]]. In rugby union, it is illegal to throw (pass) the ball in a forward direction:  a player in a position to receive such a pass would in most cases be [[offside (rugby)|offside]] anyway.

==Tackles and blocks==
{{see also|Tackle (football move)}}

Rugby union allows full tackling above the knees and below the shoulders, whereas Gaelic football explicitly disallows tackling. Rugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The attacker must also attempt to wrap his or her arms around the player being tackled: merely pushing the player being tackled to ground with a shoulder is illegal. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not "ram" into the formation without first binding to the players.

The level of tackling allowed in Gaelic football is more robust than in association football, but less than rugby union. Shoulder to shoulder contact and slapping the ball out of an opponent's hand are permitted, but the following are all fouls:
* Blocking a shot with the foot
* Pulling an opponent's jersey
* Pushing an opponent
* Sliding tackles
* Striking an opponent
* Touching the goalkeeper when he/she is inside the small rectangle
* Tripping
* Using both hands to tackle
* Wrestling the ball from an opponent's hands

Gaelic football allows "shepherding" or blocking, limited to use on players in possession of the ball. Blocking is illegal in rugby union.

==Penalties==

In Gaelic football the penalties available (in increasing order of severity) are:
*free kicks (loss of possession)
*distance penalties (often in multiples of 13 metres)
*penalty kicks
*black card (for cynical fouls and dissent, player ejected from the game with a replacement allowed)
*[[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] (cautioning a player, similar to association football (soccer))
*[[Penalty card#Red card|red card]] (player ejected from the game without replacement, similar to association football (soccer))

==Scoring==
Rugby union is played between two teams – the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a [[try]], scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a [[drop goal]] each score 3 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_9_EN.pdf |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |title=Law 9 Method of Scoring |format=PDF |accessdate=15 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61GjIRxGu?url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_9_EN.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |title=Scoring through the ages |work=rugbyfootballhistory.com  |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gaelic football, if the ball goes over the crossbar, a ''point'' is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. A point can be scored by either kicking the ball over the crossbar, or by fisting it over in which case the hand must be closed whilst striking the ball. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a ''goal'', worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal can only be scored by kicking the ball into the net, not by fist passing the ball into the net. However, a player can strike the ball into the net with a closed fist if the ball was played to him by another player or came in contact with the post/crossbar/ground prior to connection. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format Goal Total-Point Total. To determine the score-line goals must be converted to points and added to the other points. For example, in a match with a final score of Team A 0–21 Team B 4–8, Team A is the winner with 21 points, as Team B scored only 20 points (4 times 3, plus 8).

==Players==
{{See also|Rugby union positions|Gaelic football positions}}

There is no ''goalkeeper'' in rugby union, instead there is a ''fullback'', although it must be said that the fullback in rugby union is not required to guard a goal in the same way that a goalkeeper does. A rugby union fullback generally fields the long range kicks, and makes long range attacks.

Both codes have a maximum of 15 players per side on the field at any one time.

==Origins==
{{see also|History of rugby union|Gaelic football#History}}
[[File:Michael cusack portrait.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Michael Cusack]], one of the founders of [[Gaelic Athletic Association]]]]

Both sports have their origins in the [[traditional football]] games of Europe, with a great deal of formal 19th century codification overlaying them.

Gaelic Football was codified by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1887. It is thought Gaelic football is thought to have originated with the ancient Irish game of ''[[caid (sport)|caid]]''. The codification of Gaelic football was partly in response to the growing popularity of Association football and rugby in Ireland.

The code of football later known as [[rugby union]] can be traced to three events which occurred in England: the first set of written rules in 1845, the [[Blackheath R.C.|Blackheath Club]]'s decision to leave the [[The Football Association|Football Association]] in 1863 and the formation of the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1871. The code was originally known simply as "[[rugby football]]." It was not until a schism in 1895, over the payment of players, which resulted in the formation of the separate code of [[rugby league]], that the name "rugby union" was used to differentiate the original rugby code.

[[Michael Cusack]] one of the founders of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] had been known as a rugby player in Ireland, and was involved with the game at [[Blackrock College]] and [[Clongowes Wood College]]. Cusack was a native [[Irish language|Irish]] speaker and had been concerned with the decline of indigenous Irish football codes. Cusack, along with others codified [[Gaelic football]] in 1887.

==Interaction between the two codes==
{{see also|Rule 42|List of non-Gaelic games played in Croke Park}}

Rugby union grounds are used for many other sports, including rugby league, American football and Gaelic football. Rugby union is also notable for promoting the [[British and Irish Lions]], a selection of players from Britain and Ireland rugby team.

[[Rule 42]] (Rule 5.1 in the 2009 rulebook)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/files/official_guides/2009_official_guide_part1.pdf |title=2009 official guide part1 |accessdate=7 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220183429/http://www.gaa.ie/files/official_guides/2009_official_guide_part1.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits the use of GAA property for games with interests in conflict with the interests of the GAA referred to by some as "garrison games" or [[List of Gaelic Games terminology#F|foreign sports]]. Current rules state that GAA property may only be used for the purpose or in connection with the playing of games controlled by the association. Sports not considered 'in conflict' with the GAA [[List of non-Gaelic games played in Croke Park|have been permitted]].

On 16 April 2005 the GAA's congress voted to temporarily relax Rule 42 and allow international Soccer and Rugby to be played in the stadium while Lansdowne Road Football Ground was closed for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrugby.com/Story/0,18259,3551_1902765,00.html |title=Ireland must wait to enjoy Croke craic |accessdate=11 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203757/http://www.planetrugby.com/Story/0%2C18259%2C3551_1902765%2C00.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first soccer and rugby union games permitted in Croke Park took place in early 2007, the first such fixture being [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland's]] home match in the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations Rugby Union Championship]] against [[France national rugby union team|France]].

[[File:Croke park 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Croke Park floodlights in use during a [[Six Nations Championship]]: at previous points in Irish history it was against GAA rules for Gaelic football and rugby union to be associated, as they were seen as rival codes]]
In January 2006, it was announced that the GAA had reached agreement with the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] and [[Irish Rugby Football Union|IRFU]] to stage two Six Nations games and four soccer internationals at Croke Park in 2007 and in February 2007, use of the pitch by the FAI and the IRFU in 2008 was also agreed.&lt;ref name=RTE&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2007/0217/crokepark.html|title=Croker to host rugby and soccer in 2008|accessdate=19 February 2007 | work=RTÉ News|date=17 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agreements were within the temporary relaxation terms, as Lansdowne Road was still under redevelopment until 2010. Although the GAA had said that hosted use of Croke Park would not extend beyond 2008, irrespective of the redevelopment progress,&lt;ref name=RTE /&gt; fixtures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/matchcentre/match-centre_fixtures-results.php|title=official fixture list|accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[2009 Six Nations Championship|2009 Six Nations rugby tournament]] saw the Irish rugby team using Croke park for a third season.
11 February 2007 saw the first Rugby Union international to be played there. Ireland were leading France in a Six Nations clash, but lost 17–20 after conceding a last minute (converted) try. [[Raphael Ibanez]] scored the first try in that match; [[Ronan O'Gara]] scored Ireland's first ever try in Croke Park.

A second match between Ireland and [[England national rugby union team|England]] on 24 February 2007 was politically symbolic because of the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0223/p06s01-woeu.html|title=Symbolic step of peace at Irish stadium |accessdate=25 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable concern as to what reaction there would be to the singing of ''[[God Save the Queen]]'', which was being used as the anthem of the [[England national rugby union team|England team]]. Ultimately the song was sung without interruption or incident, and applauded by both sets of supporters at the match, which Ireland won by 43–13 (their largest ever win over England in rugby).

Rule 27, sometimes referred to as ''The Ban'', banned GAA members from taking part in or watching non-Gaelic games. Punishment for violating this rule was expulsion from the organisation and it remained in place from 1901 until 1971. During that time people such as [[Douglas Hyde]], GAA patron and then President of Ireland, were expelled for attending a soccer international.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goireland.about.com/od/historyculture/qt/gg_gaa.htm|title=The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) – A Governing Body|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To circumvent the ban members such as [[Moss Keane]] would commonly adopt a false name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmersjournal.ie/site/farming-Still-Keane-9320.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721123845/http://www.farmersjournal.ie/site/farming-Still-Keane-9320.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 July 2011 |title=Farming: Still Keane |accessdate=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last person to be suspended from the GAA for violating Rule 27 was Liam Madden, an architect and member of [[Longford GAA]] in 1969&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thephoenix.ie/phoenix/subscriber/library/volume-29/issue-15/contents.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

While much is made of the GAA’s ‘Ban’, it is worth bearing in mind that Rugby Union’s attitude to professionalism was similarly strict. Numerous retired players were ostracised by their clubs and countries for writing books, e.g. Bill Beaumont received royalties for his post-career autobiography “Thanks to Rugby” in 1982 and found himself no longer welcome at Twickenham.
Players who ‘went North’ to play Rugby League were similarly ostracised by Union clubs -- even after retiring.
Bobby Windsor was dropped by the Barbarians because he fouled up his expenses claim.

==International competition==

[[File:International rules.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An international rules football match in [[Melbourne]], between [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]] and [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]]]]
Rugby union has been an international game since 1871, when {{nrut|Scotland}} beat {{nrut|England}} at [[Raeburn Place]] in Edinburgh. {{nrut|Ireland}} entered international competition in 1875, and have played matches continuously ever since. The [[Rugby World Cup]] itself is of much more recent origin, dating back to 1987, when invitations were sent out to various national sides. Entry has been through qualifying rounds ever since.

Gaelic football is mostly domestic, although it remains popular in areas with major [[Irish Diaspora|Irish emigre]] populations. Although the game is formally organised outside Ireland, there are no true national Gaelic football teams.

However, Gaelic footballers do participate in one form of international competition – [[international rules football]]. This is a compromise code between Gaelic football and [[Australian rules football]], so is strictly speaking not Gaelic football, although an Irish national side is picked for it. The earliest game of the [[International Rules Series]] was in 1984. These were prefigured by an Australian tour of Ireland in 1967 organised by Harry Beitzel, which played against domestic sides.

'''Cultural relativism''' is the idea that a person's beliefs, values, and practices should be understood based on that person's own culture, rather than be judged against the criteria of another.

It was established as [[axiom]]atic in [[anthropology|anthropological]] research by [[Franz Boas]] in the first few decades of the 20th century and later popularized by his students.  Boas first articulated the idea in 1887: "civilization is not something absolute, but ... is relative, and ... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes".&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1887 "Museums of Ethnology and their classification" ''Science'' 9: 589&lt;/ref&gt; However, Boas did not coin the term. 

The first use of the term recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was by philosopher and social theorist [[Alain Locke]] in 1924 to describe [[Robert Lowie]]'s "extreme cultural relativism", found in the latter's 1917 book ''[https://archive.org/details/cultureethnology00lowiiala Culture and Ethnology]''.&lt;ref&gt;"cultural, ''adj.'' and ''n.''", ''OED Online'', Sept 2009, Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50055630, citing Locke's article "The Concept of Race as Applied to Social Culture", ''Howard Review'' 1 (1924): pp. 290-299.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term became common among anthropologists after Boas' death in 1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas Boas had developed. Boas believed that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any sub species, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between culture and [[Race (classification of humans)|race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utpa.edu/faculty/mglazer/Theory/cultural_relativism.htm |title=Cultural Relativism |last=Glazer |first=Mark |location=Texas |publisher=University of Texas-Pan American |date=December 16, 1994 |accessdate=June 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613222929/http://www.utpa.edu/faculty/mglazer/Theory/cultural_relativism.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural relativism involves specific [[epistemology|epistemological]] and methodological claims.  Whether or not these claims necessitate a specific [[ethics|ethical]] stance is a matter of debate. This principle should not be confused with [[moral relativism]].

==Epistemological origins==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
[[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 3.38) observes on the relativity of [[mores]] ([[Nomos (sociology)|νόμοι]]):
{{quote|If anyone, no matter who, were given the opportunity of choosing from amongst all the nations in the world the set of beliefs which he thought best, he would inevitably&amp;mdash;after careful considerations of their relative merits&amp;mdash;choose that of his own country. Everyone without exception believes his own native customs, and the religion he was brought up in, to be the best; and that being so, it is unlikely that anyone but a madman would mock at such things. There is abundant evidence that this is the universal feeling about the ancient customs of one's country.|tr. [[Aubrey de Selincourt]]}}

He mentions an anecdote of [[Darius the Great]] who illustrated the principle by inquiring about the [[funeral]] customs of the [[Greeks]] and the [[Callatiae]], peoples from the extreme western and eastern fringes of his empire, respectively. They practiced [[cremation]] and [[funerary cannibalism]], respectively, and were each dismayed and abhorred at the proposition of the other tribe's practices.

The epistemological claims that led to the development of cultural relativism have their origins in the German [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  The [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that human beings are not capable of direct, unmediated knowledge of the world.  All of our experiences of the world are mediated through the human mind, which universally structures perceptions according to ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts of time and space.

Although Kant considered these mediating structures universal, his student [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] argued that human creativity, evidenced by the great variety in national [[culture]]s, revealed that human experience was mediated not only by universal structures, but by particular cultural structures as well.  The philosopher and linguist [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant and Herder's ideas.

Although Herder focused on the positive value of cultural variety, the [[sociologist]] [[William Graham Sumner]] called attention to the fact that one's culture can limit one's perceptions.  He called this principle [[ethnocentrism]], the viewpoint that "one's own group is the center of everything", against which all other groups are judged.

==As a methodological and heuristic device==
According to George Marcus, Michael Fischer, and Sam Bohart,

{{quote|20th century social and cultural anthropology has promised its still largely Western readership enlightenment on two fronts.  The one has been the salvaging of distinct cultural forms of life from a process of apparent global Westernization. With both its romantic appeal and its scientific intentions, anthropology has stood for the refusal to accept this conventional perception of homogenization toward a dominant Western model.&lt;ref name="Michael M.J page 1"&gt;George Marcus and Michael M.J. Fischer 1986 ''Anthropology as Cultural Critique: The Experimental Moment in the Human Sciences'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. page 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cultural relativism was in part a response to Western ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism may take obvious forms, in which one consciously believes that one's people's arts are the most beautiful, values the most virtuous, and beliefs the most truthful.  Franz Boas, originally trained in [[physics]] and [[geography]], and heavily influenced by the thought of Kant, Herder, and von Humboldt, argued that one's culture may mediate and thus limit one's perceptions in less obvious ways.  He understood "culture" to include not only certain tastes in food, art, and music, or beliefs about religion.  He assumed a much broader notion of culture, defined as

{{quote|the totality of the mental and physical reactions and activities that characterize the behavior of the individuals composing a social group collectively and individually in relation to their natural environment, to other groups, to members of the group itself, and of each individual to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1963 [1911] ''The Mind of Primitive Man'' New York: Collier Books.  page 149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture.  The principle of cultural relativism thus forced anthropologists to develop innovative methods and heuristic strategies.

===As a methodological tool===
Between World War I and World War II, "cultural relativism" was the central tool for American anthropologists in this rejection of Western claims to universality, and salvage of non-Western cultures.  It functioned to transform Boas' epistemology into methodological lessons.

This is most obvious in the case of language.  Although language is commonly thought of as a means of communication, Boas called attention especially to the idea that it is also a means of categorizing experiences, hypothesizing that the existence of different languages suggests that people categorize, and thus experience, language differently (this view was more fully developed in the hypothesis of [[Linguistic relativity]]).

Thus, although all people perceive visible radiation the same way, in terms of a continuum of color, people who speak different languages slice up this continuum into discrete colors in different ways.  Some languages have no word that corresponds to the English word "green". When people who speak such languages are shown a green chip, some identify it using their word for blue, others identify it using their word for yellow. Thus, Boas's student [[Melville Herskovits]] summed up the principle of cultural relativism thus: "Judgements are based on experience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation."

Boas pointed out that scientists grow up and work in a particular culture, and are thus necessarily ethnocentric. He provided an example of this in his 1889 article, "On Alternating Sounds"&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1889 "On Alternating Sounds", ''American Anthropologist'' 2:47-53&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of linguists at Boas' time had observed that speakers of some Native American languages pronounced the same word with different sounds indiscriminately. They thought that this meant that the languages were unorganized and lacked strict rules for pronunciation, and they took it as evidence that the languages were more primitive than their own. Boas however noted that the variant pronunciations were not an effect of lack of organization of sound patterns, but an effect of the fact that these languages organized sounds differently from English. The languages grouped sounds that were considered distinct in English into a single [[phoneme|sound]], but also having contrasts that did not exist in English. He then argued the case that Native Americans had been pronouncing the word in question the same way, consistently, and the variation was only perceived by someone whose own language distinguishes those two sounds. Boas's student, the linguist [[Edward Sapir]] later noted that also English speakers pronounce sounds differently even when they think they are pronouncing the same sound, for example few English speakers realize that the sounds written with the letter {{angle bracket|t}} in the words "tick" and "stick" are phonetically different, the first being generally affricated and the other aspirated – a speaker of a language where this contrast is meaningful would instantly perceive them as different sounds and tend not to see them as different realizations of a single phoneme.

Boas's students drew not only on his engagement with German philosophy. They also engaged the work of contemporary philosophers and scientists, such as [[Karl Pearson]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] in an attempt to move, in the words of Boas's student [[Robert Lowie]], from "a naively metaphysical to an epistemological stage" as a basis for revising the methods and theories of anthropology.

Boas and his students realized that if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that would help them escape the limits of their own ethnocentrism.  One such method is that of [[ethnography]]: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture.

In this context, cultural relativism is an attitude that is of fundamental methodological importance, because it calls attention to the importance of the local context in understanding the meaning of particular human beliefs and activities.  Thus, in 1948 Virginia Heyer wrote, "Cultural relativity, to phrase it in starkest abstraction, states the relativity of the part to the whole.  The part gains its cultural significance by its place in the whole, and cannot retain its integrity in a different situation."&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Virginia 1948 "In Reply to Elgin Williams" in ''American Anthropologist'' 50(1) 163-166&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a heuristic tool===
Another method was [[ethnology]]: to compare and contrast as wide a range of cultures as possible, in a systematic and even-handed manner.  In the late nineteenth century, this study occurred primarily through the display of material artifacts in museums. Curators typically assumed that similar causes produce similar effects; therefore, in order to understand the causes of human action, they grouped similar artifacts together &amp;ndash; regardless of provenance.  Their aim was to classify artifacts, like biological organisms, according to families, genera, and species.  Thus organized museum displays would illustrate the evolution of civilization from its crudest to its most refined forms.

In an article in the journal ''Science'', Boas argued that this approach to cultural evolution ignored one of [[Charles Darwin]]'s main contributions to evolutionary theory:

{{quote|It is only since the development of the evolutional theory that it became clear that the object of study is the individual, not abstractions from the individual under observation.  We have to study each ethnological specimen individually in its history and in its medium ... By regarding a single implement outside of its surroundings, outside of other inventions of the people to whom it belongs, and outside of other phenomena affecting that people and its productions, we cannot understand its meanings ... Our objection ... is, that classification is not explanation.&lt;ref name=boas74&gt;Boas, Franz 1974 [1887] "The Principles of Ethnological Classification", in ''A Franz Boas reader'' ed. by George W. Stocking Jr. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-06243-0}}. page 62,62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Boas argued that although similar causes produce similar effects, different causes may also produce similar effects.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, Franz 1887 "Museums of Ethnology and their Classification", in Science 9: 587-589.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, similar artifacts found in distinct and distant places may be the products of distinct causes. Against the popular method of drawing analogies in order to reach generalizations, Boas argued in favor of an inductive method. Based on his critique of contemporary museum displays, Boas concluded:

{{quote|It is my opinion that the main object of ethnological collections should be the dissemination of the fact that civilization is not something absolute, but that it is relative, and that our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes.&lt;ref name=boas74/&gt;}}

Boas's student [[Alfred Kroeber]] described the rise of the relativist perspective thus:&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, Alfred (1948) "Anthropology" p. 11. Harcourt and Brace, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Now while some of the interest in (so called solial culture science) anthropology in its earlier stages was in the exotic and the out-of-the-way, yet even this antiquarian motivation ultimately contributed to a broader result.  Anthropologists became aware of the diversity of culture.  They began to see the tremendous range of its variations.  From that, they commenced to envisage it as a totality, as no historian of one period or of a single people was likely to do, nor any analyst of his own type of civilization alone.  They became aware of culture as a "universe", or vast field in which we of today and our own civilization occupy only one place of many.  The result was a widening of a fundamental point of view, a departure from unconscious ethnocentricity toward relativity.  This shift from naive self-centeredness in one's own time and spot to a broader view based on objective comparison is somewhat like the change from the original geocentric assumption of astronomy to the Copernican interpretation of the solar system and the subsequent still greater widening to a universe of galaxies.}}

This conception of culture, and principle of cultural relativism, were for Kroeber and his colleagues the fundamental contribution of anthropology, and what distinguished anthropology from similar disciplines such as [[sociology]] and [[psychology]].

[[Ruth Benedict]], another of Boas's students, also argued that an appreciation of the importance of culture and the problem of ethnocentrism demands that the scientist adopt cultural relativism as a method.  Her book, ''Patterns of Culture'', did much to popularize the term in the United States. In it, she explained that:

{{quote|The study of custom can be profitable only after certain preliminary propositions have been violently opposed. In the first place any scientific study requires that there be no preferential weighting of one or another items in the series it selects for its consideration. In all the less controversial fields like the study of cacti or termites or the nature of nebulae, the necessary method of study is to group the relevant material and to take note of all possible variant forms and conditions. In this way we have learned all that we know of the laws of astronomy, or of the habits of the social insects, let us say. It is only in the study of man himself that the major social sciences have substituted the study of one local variation, that of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Benedict 1959 [1934] ''Patterns of Culture'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Benedict was adamant that she was not romanticizing so-called primitive societies; she was emphasizing that any understanding of the totality of humanity must be based on as wide and varied a sample of individual cultures as possible. Moreover, it is only by appreciating a culture that is profoundly different from our own, that we can realize the extent to which our own beliefs and activities are culture-bound, rather than natural or universal.  In this context, cultural relativism is a [[heuristic]] device of fundamental importance because it calls attention to the importance of variation in any sample that is used to derive generalizations about humanity.

==As a critical device==
Marcus and Fischer's attention to anthropology's refusal to accept Western culture's claims to universality implies that cultural relativism is a tool not only in cultural understanding, but in cultural critique.  This points to the second front on which they believe anthropology offers people enlightenment:

{{quote|The other promise of anthropology, one less fully distinguished and attended to than the first, has been to serve as a form of cultural critique for ourselves.  In using portraits of other cultural patterns to reflect self-critically on our own ways, anthropology disrupts common sense and makes us reexamine our taken-for-granted assumptions.&lt;ref name="Michael M.J page 1"/&gt;}}

The critical function of cultural relativism is widely understood; philosopher John Cook observed that "It is aimed at getting people to admit that although it may ''seem'' to them that their moral principles are self-evidently true, and hence ''seem'' to be grounds for passing judgement on other peoples, in fact, the self-evidence of these principles is a kind of illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Cook, John, 1978. "Cultural Relativism as an Ethnocentric Notion", in ''The Philosophy of Society''&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cook is misconstruing cultural relativism to be identical to [[moral relativism]], his point still applies to the broader understanding of the term.  Relativism does not mean that one's views are false, but it does mean that it is false to claim that one's views are self-evident.

The critical function was indeed one of the ends to which [[Ruth Benedict|Benedict]] hoped her own work would meet. The most famous use of cultural relativism as a means of cultural critique is [[Margaret Mead]]'s dissertation research (under Boas) of adolescent female sexuality in Samoa. By contrasting the ease and freedom enjoyed by Samoan teenagers, Mead called into question claims that the stress and rebelliousness that characterize American adolescence is natural and inevitable.

As Marcus and Fischer point out, however, this use of relativism can be sustained only if there is ethnographic research in the United States comparable to the research conducted in Samoa. Although every decade has witnessed anthropologists conducting research in the United States, the very principles of relativism have led most anthropologists to conduct research in foreign countries.

==Comparison to moral relativism==
According to Marcus and Fischer, when the principle of cultural relativism was popularized after World War II, it came to be understood "more as a doctrine, or position, than as a method". As a consequence, people misinterpreted cultural relativism to mean that all cultures are both separate and equal, and that all value systems, however different, are equally valid. Thus, people came to use the phrase "cultural relativism" erroneously to signify "moral relativism".

People generally understand moral relativism to mean that there are no absolute or universal moral standards. The nature of anthropological research lends itself to the search for universal standards (standards found in all societies), but not necessarily absolute standards; nevertheless, people often confuse the two. In 1944 [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] (who studied at Harvard, but who admired and worked with Boas and his students) attempted to address this issue:

{{quote|The concept of culture, like any other piece of knowledge, can be abused and misinterpreted. Some fear that the principle of cultural relativity will weaken morality. "If the Bugabuga do it why can't we? It's all relative anyway." But this is exactly what cultural relativity does not mean.

The principle of cultural relativity does not mean that because the members of some savage tribe are allowed to behave in a certain way that this fact gives intellectual warrant for such behavior in all groups. Cultural relativity means, on the contrary, that the appropriateness of any positive or negative custom must be evaluated with regard to how this habit fits with other group habits. Having several wives makes economic sense among herders, not among hunters. While breeding a healthy scepticism as to the eternity of any value prized by a particular people, anthropology does not as a matter of theory deny the existence of moral absolutes. Rather, the use of the comparative method provides a scientific means of discovering such absolutes. If all surviving societies have found it necessary to impose some of the same restrictions upon the behavior of their members, this makes a strong argument that these aspects of the moral code are indispensable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kluckhohn, Clyde 1944 ''Mirror For Man''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/80-241/guided_inquiries/articles/cultural_rel.html | title=Cultural Relativism | author=Caleb Rosado}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Kluckholn was using language that was popular at the time (e.g. "savage tribe") but which is now considered antiquated and coarse by most anthropologists, his point was that although moral standards are rooted in one's culture, anthropological research reveals that the fact that people have moral standards is a universal. He was especially interested in deriving specific moral standards that are universal, although few if any anthropologists think that he was successful.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is an ambiguity in Kluckhohn's formulation that would haunt anthropologists in the years to come. It makes it clear that one's moral standards make sense in terms of one's culture. He waffles, however, on whether the moral standards of one society could be applied to another.  Four years later American anthropologists had to confront this issue head-on.

It was James Lawrence Wray-Miller who provided an additional clarification tool, or caveat as some would call it, of cultural relativism's theoretical underpinnings by dividing it into two binary, analytical continuums: vertical and horizontal cultural relativism. Ultimately, these two analytical continuums share the same basic conclusion: that human morality and ethics are not static but fluid and vary across cultures depending on the time period and current condition of any particular culture. 

Vertical relativism describes that cultures, throughout history ("vertical" meaning passage through past and future), are products of the prevailing societal norms and conditions of their respective historical periods. Therefore, any moral or ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding past cultures' belief systems or societal practices must be firmly
grounded and informed by these norms and conditions to be intellectually useful. Vertical relativism also accounts for the possibility that cultural values and norms will necessarily change as influencing norms and conditions change in the future.

Horizontal relativism describes that cultures in the present ("horizontal" in time – meaning the present period of the culture) are products of the prevailing norms and conditions developed as a result of their unique geographies, histories, and environmental influences. Therefore, moral or
ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding a current culture's belief system or societal practices must account for these unique differences to be intellectually useful.

===Statement on human rights===
The transformation of cultural relativism as a heuristic tool into the doctrine of moral relativism occurred in the context of the work of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission of Human Rights of the United Nations]] in preparing the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

Melville Herskovits prepared a draft "Statement on Human Rights" which Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association revised, submitted to the Commission on Human Rights, and then published.&lt;ref&gt;Executive Board, American Anthropological Association 1947 "Statement on Human Rights" in ''American Anthropologist'' 49(4) 539-543&lt;/ref&gt; The statement begins with a fairly straightforward explanation of the relevance of cultural relativism:

{{quote|The problem is thus to formulate a statement of human rights that will do more than phrase respect for the individual as individual. It must also take into full account the individual as a member of a social group of which he is part, whose sanctioned modes of life shape his behavior, and with whose fate his own is thus inextricably bound.
 
The bulk of this statement emphasizes concern that the Declaration of Human Rights was being prepared primarily by people from Western societies, and would express values that, far from being universal, are really Western:
 
Today the problem is complicated by the fact that the Declaration must be of world-wide applicability. It must embrace and recognize the validity of many different ways of life. It will not be convincing to the Indonesian, the African, the Chinese, if it lies on the same plane as like documents of an earlier period. The rights of Man in the Twentieth Century cannot be circumscribed by the standards of any single culture, or be dictated by the aspirations of any single people. Such a document will lead to frustration, not realization of the personalities of vast numbers of human beings.}}
 
Although this statement could be read as making a procedural point (that the Commission must involve people of diverse cultures, especially cultures that had been or are still under European colonial or imperial domination), the document ended by making two substantive claims:
 
# Even where political systems exist that deny citizens the right of participation in their government, or seek to conquer weaker peoples, underlying cultural values may be called on to bring the peoples of such states to a realization of the consequences of the acts of their governments, and thus enforce a brake upon discrimination and conquest.
# Worldwide standards of freedom and justice, based on the principle that man is free only when he lives as his society defines freedom, that his rights are those he recognizes as a member of his society, must be basic.

These claims provoked an immediate response by a number of anthropologists.  Julian Steward (who, as a student of [[Alfred Kroeber]] and [[Robert Lowie]], and as a professor at [[Columbia University]], was situated firmly in the Boasian lineage) suggested that the first claim "may have been a loophole to exclude Germany from the advocated tolerance", but that it revealed the fundamental flaw in moral relativism: "Either we tolerate everything, and keep hands off, or we fight intolerance and conquest – political and economic as well as military – in all their forms." Similarly, he questioned whether the second principle means that anthropologists "approve the social caste system of India, the racial caste system of the United States, or many other varieties of social discrimination in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Steward, Julian 1948 "Comments on the Statement of Human Rights" in ''American Anthropologist'' 50(2) 351–352&lt;/ref&gt; Steward and others&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, H. G. "On Science and Human Rights" in ''American Anthropologist'' 50(2) 352–355. June 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that any attempt to apply the principle of cultural relativism to moral problems would only end in contradiction: either a principle that seems to stand for tolerance ends up being used to excuse intolerance, or the principle of tolerance is revealed to be utterly intolerant of any society that seems to lack the (arguably, Western) value of tolerance. They concluded that anthropologists must stick to science, and engage in debates over values only as individuals.

==Current debates==
The debates over the Statement on Human Rights, then, was not merely over the validity of cultural relativism, or the question of what makes a right universal. It forced anthropologists to confront the question of whether anthropological research is relevant to non-anthropologists. Although Steward and Barnett seemed to be suggesting that anthropology as such should restrict itself to purely academic affairs, people within and without the academy have continued to debate the ways non-anthropologists have used this principle in public policy concerning ethnic minorities or in international relations.

Political scientist [[Alison Dundes Renteln]] has argued that most debates over moral relativism misunderstand the importance of cultural relativism.&lt;ref&gt;Renteln, Alison 1988 "Relativism and the Search for Human Rights" in ''American Anthropologist'' 90(1) 56–72&lt;/ref&gt; Most philosophers understand the Benedictine–Herskovitz formulation of cultural relativism to mean

{{quote|what is right or good for one individual or society is not right or good for another, even if the situations are similar, meaning not merely that what is thought right or good by one is not thought right or good by another ... but that what is really right or good in one case is not so in another.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Frankena|Frankena, William]] 1973 ''Ethics''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although this formulation clearly echoes the kinds of example anthropologists used in elaborating cultural relativism, Renteln believes that it misses the spirit of the principle. Accordingly, she supports a different formulation: "there are or can be no value judgements that are true, that is, objectively justifiable, independent of specific cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Paul 1955 "Some Criticisms of Cultural Relativism" in ''Journal of Philosophy'' 52: 780–791&lt;/ref&gt;

Renteln faults philosophers for disregarding the heuristic and critical functions of cultural relativism. Her main argument is that in order to understand the principle of cultural relativism, one must recognize the extent to which it is based on enculturation: "the idea that people unconsciously acquire the categories and standards of their culture". This observation, which echoes the arguments about culture that originally led Boas to develop the principle, suggests that the use of cultural relativism in debates of rights and morals is not substantive but procedural. That is, it does not require a relativist to sacrifice his or her values. But it does require anyone engaged in a consideration of rights and morals to reflect on how their own enculturation has shaped their views:

{{quote|There is no reason why the relativist should be paralyzed, as critics have often asserted.&lt;ref&gt;Hartung, Frank 1954 '"Cultural Relativity and Moral Judgements" in ''Philosophy of Science'' 21: 11–125&lt;/ref&gt; But a relativist will acknowledge that the criticism is based on his own ethnocentric standards and realizes also that the condemnation may be a form of [[cultural imperialism]].}}

Renteln thus bridges the gap between the anthropologist as scientist (whom Steward and Barnett felt had nothing to offer debates on rights and morality) and as private individual (who has every right to make value judgements). The individual keeps this right, but the scientist requires that the individual acknowledge that these judgements are neither self-evident universals, nor entirely personal (and idiosyncratic), but rather took form in relation to the individual's own culture.

===Post-colonial politics===
Boas and his students understood anthropology to be a historical, or human science, in that it involves subjects (anthropologists) studying other subjects (humans and their activities), rather than subjects studying objects (such as rocks or stars). Under such conditions, it is fairly obvious that scientific research may have political consequences, and the Boasians saw no conflict between their scientific attempts to understand other cultures, and the political implications of critiquing their own culture.  For anthropologists working in this tradition, the doctrine of cultural relativism as a basis for moral relativism was anathema. For politicians, moralists, and many social scientists (but few anthropologists) who saw science and human interests as necessarily independent or even opposed, however, the earlier Boasian principle of cultural relativism was anathema. Thus, cultural relativism came under attack, but from opposing sides and for opposing reasons.

===Political critique===
On the one hand, many anthropologists began to criticize the way moral relativism, in the guise of cultural relativism, is used to mask the effects of Western colonialism and imperialism. Thus, [[Stanley Diamond]] argued that when the term "cultural relativism" entered popular culture, popular culture coopted [[anthropology]] in a way that voided the principle of any critical function:

{{quote|Relativism is the bad faith of the conqueror, who has become secure enough to become a tourist.

Cultural relativism is a purely intellectual attitude; it does not inhibit the anthropologist from participating as a professional in his own milieu; on the contrary, it rationalizes that milieu. Relativism is self-critical only in the abstract. Nor does it lead to engagement. It only converts the anthropologist into a shadowy figure, prone to newsworthy and shallow pronouncements about the cosmic condition of the human race. It has the effect of mystifying the profession, so that the very term ''anthropologist'' ("student of man") commands the attention of an increasingly "popular" audience in search of novelty. But the search for self-knowledge, which [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] was the first to link to the annihilation of prejudice, is reduced to the experience of culture shock, a phrase used by both anthropologists and the State Department to account for the disorientation that usually follows an encounter with an alien way of life. But culture shock is a condition one recovers from; it is not experienced as an authentic redefinition of the personality but as a testing of its tolerance ... The tendency of relativism, which it never quite achieves, is to detach the anthropologist from all particular cultures. Nor does it provide him with a moral center, only a job.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Diamond 2004 [1974] ''In Search of the Primitive''  New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers page 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[George W. Stocking, Jr.|George Stocking]] summarized this view with the observation that "Cultural relativism, which had buttressed the attack against racialism, [can] be perceived as a sort of neo-racialism justifying the backward techno-economic status of once colonized peoples."&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. Jr., 1982. "Afterward: A View from the Center" in ''Ethnos'' 47: 172–286&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense by Clifford Geertz===
On the other hand, the most common and popular criticisms of relativism come not from anthropologists like Stanley Diamond, but rather from political conservatives. By the 1980s many anthropologists had absorbed the Boasian critique of moral relativism, and were ready to reevaluate the origins and uses of cultural relativism. In a distinguished lecture before the American Anthropological Association in 1984, [[Clifford Geertz]] pointed out that the conservative critics of cultural relativism did not really understand, and were not really responding to, the ideas of Benedict, Herskovits, Kroeber and Kluckhohn.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford, 1984. "Anti-Anti-Relativism" in ''American Anthropologist'' 86 (2) 263–278.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the various critics and proponents of cultural relativism were [[talking past each other|talking past one another]]. What these different positions have in common, Geertz argued, is that they are all responding to the same thing: knowledge about other ways of life.

{{quote|The supposed conflict between Benedict's and Herskovits's call for tolerance and the untolerant passion with which they called for it turns out not to be the simple contradiction so many amateur logicians have held it to be, but the expression of a perception, caused by thinking a lot about Zunis and Dahomys, that the world being so full of a number of things, rushing to judgement is more than a mistake, it is a crime. Similarly, Kroeber's and Kluckholn's verities – Kroeber's were mostly about messy creatural matters like delirium and menstruation, Kluckholn's were mostly about messy social ones like lying and killing within the in-group, turn out not to be just the arbitrary personal obsessions they so much look like, but the expression of a much vaster concern, caused by thinking a lot about ''anthrōpos'' in general, that if something isn't anchored everywhere nothing can be anchored anywhere. Theory here – if that is what these earnest advices about how we must look at things if we are to be accounted as decent should be called – is more an exchange of warnings than an analytical debate.  We are being offered a choice of worries.

What the relativists – so-called – want us to worry about is provincialism – the danger that our perceptions will be dulled, our intellects constricted, and our sympathies narrowed by the overlearned and overvalued acceptances of our own society. What the anti-relativists – self-declared – want us to worry about, and worry about and worry about, as though our very souls depended on it, is a kind of spiritual entropy, a heat death of the mind, in which everything is as significant, and thus as insignificant, as everything else: anything goes, to each his own, you pays your money and you takes your choice, I know what I like, not in the couth, ''tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner''.}}

Geertz concludes this discussion by commenting, "As I have already suggested, I myself find provincialism altogether the more real concern so far as what actually goes on in the world."

Geertz' defense of cultural relativism as a concern which should motivate various inquiries, rather than as an explanation or solution, echoed a comment [[Alfred Kroeber]] made in reply to earlier critics of cultural relativism, in 1949:&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, Alfred, 1949. "An Authoritarian Panacea" in ''American Anthropologist'' 51(2) 318–320&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Obviously, relativism poses certain problems when from trying merely to understand the world we pass on to taking action in the world: and right decisions are not always easy to find. However, it is also obvious that authoritarians who know the complete answers beforehand will necessarily be intolerant of relativism: they should be, if there is only one truth and that is theirs.

I admit that hatred of the intolerant for relativism does not suffice to make relativism true. But most of us are human enough for our belief in relativism to be somewhat reinforced just by that fact. At any rate, it would seem that the world has come far enough so that it is only by starting from relativism and its tolerations that we may hope to work out a new set of absolute values and standards, if such are attainable at all or prove to be desirable.}}

== Use by nations ==
Several nations have used cultural relativism as a justification for limiting the rights in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], despite the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] rejecting it as a refugee of human rights violations. A 2011 study by international legal expert Roger Lloret Blackburn, examining the [[Universal Periodic Review]]s, distinguishes several different groups of nations. One group consists of nations where the current regime has been installed by revolution and that deny the need for political plurality: [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Myanmar]], [[Cuba]] and [[Iran]]. Another group are certain [[Islamic]] nations that adhere to [[sharia]] and certain traditional practices: [[Yemen]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]]. A third possible group is nations that give special rights to specific groups: [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lloret Blackburn, Cultural Relativism in the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council, ICIP Working Papers 2011/3, Institut Català Internacional per la Pau, Barcelona, September 2011, http://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/general-document/pdf/-blackburn_upr_cultural_relativism.09.2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Decima''' was one of the three [[Parcae]], or often known in English as the [[Moirae|Fates]]. [[Nona (deity)|Nona]] and Decima were responsible for birth, while [[Morta]] was charged with overseeing death. They distributed to mankind all the good and bad things in life, and even [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] had to bend to their will.  She measured the thread of life with her rod, like her Greek equivalent [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]. Her mother is the goddess of night and her father is the god of darkness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19849">'''Edge-notched cards''' or '''edge-punched cards''' are an obsolete technology used to store a small amount of binary or logical data on paper [[index cards]], encoded via the presence or absence of notches in the edges of the cards.{{sfn|Casey|1958}} The notches allowed efficient [[sorting]] and selecting of specific cards matching multiple desired criteria, from a larger number of cards in a paper-based [[database]] of information. In the mid-20th century they were also known by commercial names such as Cope-Chat cards, E-Z Sort cards, and McBee Keysort cards.{{sfn|Casey|1958|p=v}}

== Overview ==
[[File:Edge-notched_card.jpg|thumb|Edge-notched card used as a library card. Edges not notched here.]]
[[File:Randlochkarte2.jpg|thumb|A notched card showing two levels of notching.]]
[[File:McBee card notcher.jpg|thumb|Hand tool for notching cards.]]
Edge-notched cards are a manual data storage and manipulation technology used for specialized data storage and cataloging applications through much of the 20th century. An early instance of something like this methodology appeared in 1904.{{sfn|Casey|1958|p=4}} While there were many variants, by the mid-20th century a popular version consisted of {{convert|5|by|8|inch|adj=on|cm}} [[paperboard]] cards with holes punched at regular intervals along all four edges, a short distance in from the edges. The center of the card might be blank space for information to be written, or contain a pre-printed form, or contain a [[microform]] image in the case of edge-notched [[aperture card]]s.{{sfn|Ellsworth|1951}}{{sfn|Cady|1999|p=182}}

To record data, the paper stock between a hole and the nearest edge was removed by a special notching tool. The holes were assigned a meaning dependent upon a particular application. For example, one hole might record the answer to a yes/no question on a survey, with the presence of a notch meaning "yes". More-complex data was encoded using a variety of schemes, often using a [[superimposed code]] which allows more distinct categories to be coded than the number of holes available.

To allow a visual check that all cards in a deck were oriented the same way, one corner of each card was beveled, much like [[Herman Hollerith|Hollerith]] [[punched card]]s. Edge-notched cards, however, were not intended to be read by machines. Instead, they were manipulated by passing one or more slim needles through selected holes in a group of cards. As the needles were lifted, the cards that were notched in the hole positions where the needles were inserted would be left behind as rest of the deck was lifted by the needles. Using two or more needles produced a [[logical and]] function. Combining the cards from two different selections produced a [[logical or]]. Quite complex manipulations, including [[sorting]] were possible using these techniques.

Before the widespread use of computers, some [[public libraries]] used a system of small edge-notched cards in paper pockets in the back of library books to keep track of them.{{sfn|Kilgour|1939}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An old library book card |url=http://plakboek.livejournal.com/149106.html |website=plakboek.livejournal.com |accessdate=2011-03-29}} An example of an edge-notched library card.&lt;/ref&gt; Edge-notched cards were also used for course scheduling in some high schools and colleges during the same era.{{sfn|Anderson|Van Dyke|1963}}

==Needle cards==
'''Needle cards''' (another term for edge-notched cards) are [[index card]]s with text, written by hand or typewriter, that have a line of prepunched holes along one or more sides. By cutting or punching away (notching out) the paper between a hole and the edge of the card, the card is associated with a category. By putting long [[knitting needle]]s through certain holes in a deck of such cards, lifting and shaking gently, cards that belong to a combination of categories can be selected. This tool is less useful for data sets larger than 10,000 records.{{sfn|Kent|Geer|1961|p=273}}

Affectionately referred to as "The Knitting Needle Computer", these [[database]]-like systems were popular sometime in the 1960s and 1970s. Science teachers may still use these as a teaching tool for [[relational database]]s.  Indexed card systems can be made with [[index card]]s and a [[hole punch]].

In her book ''Parti-colored Blocks for a Quilt'', writer [[Marge Piercy]] described how she used needle cards instead of a notebook: {{Quote|I keep neither a journal nor a notebook. I have a memory annex which serves my purposes. It uses edge-notched cards. Edge-notched cards are cards which have holes around the borders as opposed to machine punch cards which are punched through the body. The cards are sorted with knitting needles. I have a nice sophisticated system which I call the "General Practitioner."{{sfn|Piercy|1982}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3888">The '''Flood Studies Report''', published in 1975, is used in relation to [[rainfall]] events in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/5964/1/IH_094.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been replaced by the '''Flood Estimation Handbook''', but the method can still be used.

==Calculation procedure==

[[File:Rain over Woodhead Reservoir, Derbyshire.jpg|thumb|alt=Rainfall in the UK.|Rainfall on a rural catchment in [[Longdendale]], [[Derbyshire]].]]

It is possible to use the FSR to predict the depth of rainfall from a storm of a given duration and return period. The FSR includes values for two key variables mapped across the UK: the M5-60 minutes rainfall, and the ratio "r".
*M5-60 minutes rainfall is the expected depth of rainfall in millimetres (mm) from a storm lasting 60 minutes (1 hour) with a return period of 5 years (hence M5).
*M5-2 days rainfall is the expected depth of rainfall from a storm lasting 2 days (48 hours) with a return period of 5 years.
*The dimensionless ratio "r" is the M5-60 minutes value divided by the M5-2 days value.
*Factor Z1 is interpolated from figures&lt;ref&gt;Design and analysis of urban storm drainage - The Wallingford Procedure, Volume 4, The Modified Rational Method, {{ISBN|0 946466 041}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the values of M5-2 days and "r".
*Factor Z2 (the growth factor) is found from the M5 rainfall depth, and depends on the return period.
*The Areal Reduction Factor (ARF) takes the catchment area into account. For small catchments (below 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) the ARF is not required.

To find the depth of a rainfall of duration D and return period T at a given location in the UK, the following should be carried out:
# Find M5-60 minutes rainfall depth and "r" for the location using FSR maps.
# Divide this rainfall depth by "r" to get the M5-2 days depth.
# Multiply the M5-2 days depth by factor Z1 to find the M5-D depth.
# Multiply the M5-D depth by factor Z2 (the growth factor) to find the MT-D depth.
# Multiply the MT-D depth by the Areal Reduction Factor (ARF).

===Example===
Find the depth of rainfall from a storm of duration 6 hours and return period 10 years on a catchment of 5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in [[Sheffield]].
#From the FSR maps, the M5-60 minutes rainfall is 20.5mm, and "r" = 0.4.
#Divide 20.5mm by 0.4 to get 51.3mm, which is the M5-2 days rainfall depth.
#Factor Z1 = 0.64, so multiply 51.3mm by 0.64 to get 32.8mm.
#Factor Z2 = 1.16, so multiply 32.8mm by 1.16 to get 38.1mm.
#The ARF is 0.96, so multiply 38.1mm by 0.96 to get 36.6mm.

Therefore the expected depth of rainfall from the storm is 36.6mm. The mean intensity of rainfall is given by 36.6mm divided by 6 hours, which is 6.1mm/hour.

===Storm profiles===
The above method is sufficient for finding the overall depth of rainfall during a storm. However, it is often useful from an engineering perspective to predict the intensity of rainfall during the storm, to allow structures such as drains and sewers to be designed with sufficient capacity for stormwater.

In general, the intensity of a storm is highest at the mid-duration point (known as the peak), and lowest at the start and end of the storm. Therefore, peaked profiles are applied to the storm data to provide a more realistic description of the rainfall intensity during the storm.

==Flood Estimation Handbook==
The '''Flood Estimation Handbook''' was published in 1999 and replaces the FSR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceh.ac.uk/feh2/fehintro.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the percentage runoff equation:

&lt;math&gt; PR = 0.829PIMP + 25SOIL + 0.078UCWI - 20.7 &lt;/math&gt;

where PR is percentage runoff, PIMP is percentage [[impervious surface|imperviousness]] of the catchment, SOIL is the soil index and UCWI is urban catchment wetness index.

'''Frederick York Powell''' (4 January 1850 – 8 May 1904), was an [[England|English]] [[historian]] and scholar.

== Biography ==

Frederick York Powell was born in [[Bloomsbury]], [[London]]. Much of his childhood was spent in France and Spain, so that he early acquired a mastery of the language of both countries and an insight into the genius of the people. He was educated at [[Rugby School]], and matriculated at [[university of Oxford|Oxford]] as an unattached student, subsequently joining [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], where he took a first-class in [[law]] and modern history in 1872. Whilst at Oxford, he was a member of the exclusive [[Stubbs Society]]. He was called to the bar at the [[Middle Temple]] in 1874, and married in the same year.

He became law-lecturer and tutor of Christ Church, fellow of [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], delegate of the Clarendon Press, and in 1894 he was made [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] in succession to [[James Anthony Froude|J. A. Froude]]. His contributions to history were not extensive, but he was a particularly stimulating teacher. He had been attracted in his school days to the study of Scandinavian history and literature, and he was closely allied with Professor [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]] (d. 1889), whom he assisted in his ''Icelandic Prose Reader'' (1897), ''Corpus Poeticum Boreale'' (1887), and ''Origines Islandicae'' (1905), and in the editing of the ''Grimm Centenary'' papers (1886).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=POWELL, F. York|magazine=Who's Who|year=1900|volume= 52|page=816|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFooAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took a keen interest in the development of modern French poetry, and [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] and [[Emile Verhaeren]] all lectured at Oxford under his auspices. He was also a connoisseur in Japanese art. In politics his sympathies were with the oppressed of all nationalities; he had befriended refugees after the Commune, counting among his friends [[Jules Vallès]] the author of ''Les Réfractaires''; and he was also a friend of [[Stepniak]] and his circle.

In June 1901 he received an honorary doctorate ([[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]]) from the [[University of Glasgow]] during celebrations for the university´s 450th jubilee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Glasgow University jubilee |day_of_week=Friday |date=14 June 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell was a member of the [[Folklore Society]] and became its President in the year that he died. The Society's journal, which had published his papers, printed an obituary by [[Edward Clodd]]. Part of his collection of artefacts were deposited at the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]].&lt;ref name="Petch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-Frederick-York-Powell.html|title=Frederick York Powell|last=Petch|first=Alison|work=England: the other within|publisher=Pitt Rivers Museum|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2017">'''George Baldwin Dessart''' (August 27, 1925 - October 20, 2012) was an American television producer and executive and served as national chairman of the [[American Cancer Society]] from 1996-98.

Dessart began his career in television at [[WCAU]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and was the producer of ''[[What in the World]]''.  He received an EMMY at the New York EMMY awards in 1965 as producer for "Eye on New York".  His career at [[CBS]] as Vice President of Program Practices ended in 1985.

With William Baker, he co-authored the book, "Down the Tube:  An inside account of the failure of American television" in 1998.

According to Lloyd Morrisett, George Dessart was one of the first candidates to be considered for the position of executive producer of ''[[Sesame Street]]'':

“The executive producer was, from the creative point of view, obviously key. We put together a list of candidates and George Dessart was our first candidate and the one we really went after. We tried to recruit him very strongly. George thought about it, and finally he told us that he just wasn't right for it. We were really despondent over that decision. He was exactly right. He probably would have been terrible. He was a fine producer, but for this job, he was not right for it although we thought he was.”

In Michael Davis’ 2008 book, ''Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street,'' Dessart is credited with the suggestion to use a commercial format (e.g., “Sesame Street is brought to you by the letter “P” and the number “2”) to “sell” letters and numbers to children.

George Dessart was professor emeritus at [[Brooklyn College]] and lived in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].

'''Haussmann's renovation of Paris'''  was a vast public works program commissioned by Emperor [[Napoléon III]] and directed by his [[prefect (France)|prefect]] of the [[Seine (department)|Seine]], [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], between 1853 and 1870.  It included the demolition of medieval neighborhoods that were deemed overcrowded and unhealthy by officials at the time; the building of wide avenues; new parks and squares;  the annexation of the suburbs surrounding [[Paris]]; and the construction of new sewers, fountains and aqueducts. Haussmann's work was met with fierce opposition, and he was finally dismissed by Napoleon III in 1870;  but work on his  projects continued until 1927.  The street plan and distinctive appearance of the center of Paris today is largely the result of Haussmann's renovation.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overcrowding, disease, crime, and unrest in the center of the old Paris==
[[File:Charles Marville, Rue St. Nicolas du Chardonnet, de la rue Traversine, ca. 1853–70.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Rue St. Nicolas du Chardonnet, one of the narrow Medieval streets near the Pantheon on the Left Bank, in the 1850s]]
In the middle of the nineteenth century, the center of Paris was viewed as overcrowded, dark, dangerous, and unhealthy.  In 1845, the French social reformer [[Victor Considerant]] wrote: "Paris is an immense workshop of putrefaction, where misery, pestilence and sickness work in concert, where sunlight and air rarely penetrate. Paris is a terrible place where plants shrivel and perish, and where, of seven small infants, four die during the course of the year."&lt;ref name="Moncan, Patrice p. 10"&gt;cited in de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The street plan on the [[Île de la Cité]] and in the neighborhood called the "quartier des Arcis", between the Louvre and the "Hôtel de Ville" (City Hall), had changed little since the Middle Ages.  The population density in these neighborhoods was extremely high, compared with the rest of Paris;  in the neighborhood of the Champs-Élysées, population density was estimated at {{val|5380|u=km2}};  in the neighborhoods of Arcis and Saint-Avoye, in the present Third Arrondissement, there was one inhabitant for every three square meters.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, a doctor described one building in the Île de la Cité where a single room five meters square on the fourth floor was occupied by twenty-three people, both adults and children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these conditions, disease spread very quickly.  [[Cholera]] epidemics ravaged the city in 1832 and 1848.  In the epidemic of 1848, five percent of the inhabitants of these two neighborhoods died.&lt;ref name="Moncan, Patrice p. 10"/&gt;

Traffic circulation was another major problem. The widest streets in these two neighborhoods were only five meters wide;  the narrowest were only one or two meters wide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Wagons, carriages and carts could barely move through the streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/architecture/Haussmanns-Architectural-Paris.html Haussmann's Architectural Paris – The Art History Archive], checked 21 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The center of the city was also a cradle of discontent and revolution;  between 1830 and 1848,  seven armed uprisings and revolts had broken out in the centre of Paris,  particularly along the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]], around the Hôtel de Ville, and around Montagne Sainte-Geneviève on the left bank. The residents of these neighborhoods had taken up paving stones and blocked the narrow streets with barricades, and had to be dislodged by the army.&lt;ref&gt;Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Earlier attempts to modernize the city==
[[File:Marché du Temple en 1840.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The second-hand clothing market, the Marché du Temple, in 1840, before Haussmann]]
The urban problems of Paris had been recognized in the 18th century; [[Voltaire]] complained about the markets "established in narrow streets, showing off their filthiness, spreading infection and causing continuing disorders."  He wrote that the façade of the Louvre was admirable, "but it was hidden behind buildings worthy of the Goths and Vandals."  He protested that the government "invested in futilities rather than investing in public works."  In 1739 he wrote to the King of Prussia:  "I saw the fireworks which they fired off with such management;  would rather they started to have a Hôtel de Ville, beautiful squares, magnificent and convenient markets, beautiful fountains, before having fireworks."&lt;ref&gt;Maneglier, Hervé,  ''Paris Impérial''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

The 18th century architectural theorist and historian  [[Quatremere de Quincy]] had proposed establishing or widening public squares in each of the neighbourhoods,  expanding and developing the squares in front the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Cathedral of Nôtre Dame]] and the church of Saint Gervais, and building a wide street to connect the Louvre with the Hôtel de Ville, the new city hall.  Moreau, the architect in chief of Paris, suggested paving and developing the embankments of the Seine, building monumental squares,  clearing the space around landmarks, and cutting new streets.  In 1794, during the [[French Revolution]], a Commission of Artists drafted an ambitious plan to build wide avenues, including a street in a straight line from the [[Place de la Nation]] to the [[Louvre]], where the Avenue Victoria is today, and squares with avenues radiating in different directions, largely making use of land confiscated from the church during the Revolution, but all of these projects remained on paper.&lt;ref&gt;Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] also had ambitious plans for rebuilding the city. He began work on a canal to bring fresh water to the city and began work on the Rue de Rivoli, beginning at the Place de la Concorde, but was able to extend it only to the Louvre before his downfall. "If only the heavens had given me twenty more years of rule and a little leisure," he wrote while in exile on [[Saint Helena]], "one would vainly search today for the old Paris; nothing would remain of it but vestiges."&lt;ref&gt;Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval core and plan of Paris changed little during the restoration of the monarchy through the reign of King [[Louis-Philippe]] (1830–1848). It was the Paris of the narrow and winding streets and foul sewers described in the novels of [[Balzac]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. In 1833, the new [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] of the Seine under Louis-Philippe, [[Claude-Philibert Barthelot, comte de Rambuteau|Claude-Philibert Barthelot]], comte de Rambuteau, made modest improvements to the sanitation and circulation of the city.  He constructed new sewers, though they still emptied directly into the Seine, and a better water supply system. He constructed 180 kilometres of sidewalks, a new street, rue Lobau; a new bridge over the Seine, the [[pont Louis-Philippe]]; and cleared an open space around the Hôtel de Ville. He built a new street the length of the Île de la Cité and three additional streets across it: rue d'Arcole, rue de la Cité and rue Constantine.  To access the central market at [[Les Halles]], he built a wide new street (today's [[rue Rambuteau]]) and began work on the Boulevard Malesherbes. On the Left Bank, he built a new street, rue Soufflot, which cleared space around the Panthéon, and began work on the rue des Écoles, between the [[École Polytechnique]] and the [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref&gt;Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial'', pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Rambuteau wanted to do more, but his budget and powers were limited. He did not have the power to easily expropriate property to build new streets, and the first law which required minimum health standards for Paris residential buildings was not passed until April 1850, under Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, then president of the Second French Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte comes to power, and the rebuilding of Paris begins  (1848–1852)==
[[File:Franz Xaver Winterhalter Napoleon III.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Napoléon III in 1855]]
King Louis-Philippe was overthrown in the [[French Revolution of 1848|February Revolution of 1848]].  On 10 December 1848, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], the nephew of Napoléon Bonaparte,  won the first direct presidential elections ever held in France with an overwhelming 74.2 percent of the votes cast.  He was elected largely because of his famous name, but also because of his promise to try to end poverty and improve the lives of ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;Milza, Pierre, ''Napoleon III'',  pp. 189–90&lt;/ref&gt;  Though he had been born in Paris, he had lived very little in the city;  from the age of seven, he had lived in exile in Switzerland, England, and the United States, and for six years in prison in France for attempting to overthrow King Louis-Philippe.  He had been especially impressed by London, with its wide streets, squares and large public parks. In 1852 he gave a public speech declaring:  "Paris is the heart of France. Let us apply our efforts to embellishing this great city.  Let us open new streets, make the working class quarters, which lack air and light,  more healthy, and let the beneficial sunlight reach everywhere within our walls".&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  As soon as he was President, he supported the building of the first subsidised housing project for workers in Paris,  the Cité-Napoléon, on the rue Rochechouart. He proposed the completion of the rue de Rivoli from the Louvre to the Hôtel de Ville, completing the project begun by his uncle Napoléon Bonaparte, and he began a project which would transform the [[Bois de Boulogne]] (Boulogne Forest) into a large new public park,  modelled after [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in London but much larger, on the west side of the city.  He wanted both these projects to be completed before the end of his term in 1852, but became frustrated by the slow progress made by his prefect of the Seine, Berger.  The prefect was unable to move the work forward on the rue de Rivoli quickly enough, and the original design for the Bois de Boulogne turned out to be a disaster;  the architect, [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], who had designed the [[Place de la Concorde]] for Louis-Philippe,  followed Louis-Napoléon's instructions to imitate Hyde Park and designed two lakes connected by a stream for the new park, but forgot to take into account the difference of elevation between the two lakes.  If they had been built, the one lake would have immediately emptied itself into the other.&lt;ref&gt;George-Eugène Haussmann, ''Les Mémoires'', Paris (1891), cited in Patrice de Moncan, ''Les jardins de Baron Haussmann, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1851,  shortly before Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's term expired, neither the rue de Rivoli nor the park had progressed very far.  He wanted to run for re-election in 1852, but was blocked by the new Constitution, which limited him to one term.  A majority of members of parliament voted to change the Constitution, but not the two-thirds majority required.  Prevented from running again, Napoléon, with the help of the army, staged a [[coup d'état]] on 2 December 1851 and seized power.  His opponents were arrested or exiled.  The following year, on 2 December 1852, he declared himself Emperor, adopting the throne name Napoléon III.&lt;ref&gt;Milza, Pierre, ''Napoleon III'', pp. 233–84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haussmann begins work – the Croisée de Paris (1853–59)==
[[File:Rue-de-Rivoli-1855.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Rue de Rivoli]], shown here in 1855, was the first boulevard built by Haussmann, and it served as the model for the others.]]
[[File:RéalisationsUrbaines2ndEmpire.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The boulevards and streets built by Napoléon III and Haussmann during the Second Empire are shown in red. They also built the [[Bois de Boulogne]] park (green area on the left), the [[Bois de Vincennes]] park containing a zoo (green area on the right), the [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]], the [[Parc Montsouris]] and dozens of smaller parks and squares.]]
Napoléon III dismissed Berger as the Prefect of the Seine and sought a more effective manager.  His minister of the interior, [[Victor de Persigny]], interviewed several candidates, and selected Georges Eugène Haussmann, a native of Alsace and Prefect of the [[Gironde]] (capital: Bordeaux), who impressed Persigny with his energy, audacity, and ability to overcome or get around problems and obstacles. He became Prefect of the Seine on 22 June 1853, and on 29 June the Emperor showed him the map of Paris and instructed Haussmann to ''aérer, unifier, et embellir'' Paris:  to give it air and open space, to connect and unify the different parts of the city into one whole,  and to make it more beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Haussmann went to work immediately on the first phase of the renovation desired by Napoléon III;  completing the ''grande croisée de Paris'', a great cross in the centre of Paris that would permit easier communication from east to west along the rue de Rivoli and rue Saint-Antoine, and north-south communication along two new Boulevards,  Strasbourg and Sébastopol. The grand cross had been proposed by the Convention during the Revolution, and begun by Napoléon I;  Napoléon III was determined to complete it.  Completion of the rue de Rivoli was given an even higher priority, because the Emperor wanted it finished before the opening of the [[Paris Universal Exposition of 1855]], only two years away,  and he wanted the project to include a new hotel, the [[Grand Hôtel du Louvre]], the first large luxury hotel in the city, to house the Imperial guests at the Exposition.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp.  41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Emperor, Haussmann had greater power than any of his predecessors.  In February 1851 the French Senate had simplified the laws on expropriation, giving him the authority to expropriate all the land on either side of a new street;  and he did not have to report to the Parliament, only to the Emperor. The French parliament, controlled by Napoléon III, provided fifty million francs, but this was not nearly enough.  Napoléon III appealed to the [[Péreire brothers]], Émile and Isaac, two bankers who had created a new investment bank, [[Crédit Mobilier]].  The Péreire brothers organised a new company which raised 24 million francs to finance the construction of the street, in exchange for the rights to develop real estate along the route.  This became a model for the building of all of Haussmann's future boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp.  48–52&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet the deadline,  three thousand workers laboured on the new boulevard twenty-four hours a day.  The rue de Rivoli was completed, and the new hotel opened in March 1855, in time to welcome guests to the Exposition.  The junction was made between the rue de Rivoli and rue Saint-Antoine;  in the process Haussmann restyled the Place du Carrousel, opened up a new square, Place Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois facing the colonnade of the Louvre;  reorganized the space between the Hôtel de Ville and the [[place du Châtelet]].&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p.  40&lt;/ref&gt;  Between the Hôtel and Ville and the [[Place de la Bastille|Bastille square]], he widened the rue Saint-Antoine;  he was careful to save the historic [[Hôtel de Sully]] and Hôtel de Mayenne, but many other buildings, both medieval and modern, were knocked down to make room for the wider street, and several ancient, dark and  narrow streets, rue de l'Arche-Marion, rue du Chevalier-le-Guet and rue des Mauvaises-Paroles, disappeared from the map.&lt;ref&gt;Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, work began on the north-south axis, beginning with Boulevard de Strasbourg and Boulevard Sébastopol, which cut through the center of some of the most crowded neighborhoods in Paris, where the cholera epidemic had been the worst, between the rue Saint-Martin and rue Saint-Denis. "It was the gutting of old Paris,"  Haussmann wrote with satisfaction in his ''Memoires'':  of the neighborhood of riots, and of barricades, from one end to the other."&lt;ref&gt;Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The Boulevard Sébastopol ended at the new Place du Châtelet;  a new bridge, the Pont-au-Change, was constructed across the Seine, and crossed the island on a newly built street.  On the left bank, the north-south axis was continued by the Boulevard Saint-Michel, which was cut in a straight line from the Seine to the Observatory, and then, as the rue d'Enfer, extended all the way to the route d'Orléans.  The north-south axis was completed in 1859.

The two axes crossed at the Place du Châtelet, making it the center of Haussmann's Paris.  Haussmann widened the square, moved the [[Fontaine du Palmier]], built by Napoléon I, to the center and built two new theaters, facing each other across the square;  the Cirque Impérial (now the Théâtre du Châtelet) and the Théâtre Lyrique (now Théâtre de la Ville).&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The second phase – a network of new boulevards (1859–1867)==
[[File:Avenue Foch à Paris avec au bout, l'arc de Triomphe..jpg|thumb|right|250px|The tree-lined {{lang|fr|avenue de l'Impératrice}} (now {{lang|fr|avenue Foch}}) was designed by Haussmann as the grand entrance to the {{lang|fr|[[Bois de Boulogne]]}}.]]
[[File:gobelins-pantheon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The new {{lang|fr|avenue des Gobelins}} on the left bank opened a view to the {{lang|fr|[[Panthéon]]}}.]]
[[File:Boulevard Saint-Germain, Paris June 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Haussmann's {{lang|fr|[[Boulevard Saint-Germain]]}} was designed as the main east-west axis of the left bank.]]
[[File:Paris-cite-haussmann.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The {{lang|fr|[[Île de la Cité]]}} transformed by Haussmann: new transverse streets (red), public spaces (light blue) and buildings (dark blue).]]
In the first phase of his renovation Haussmann constructed {{convert|9467|m|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} of new boulevards, at a net cost of 278 million francs. The official parliamentary report of 1859 found that it had "brought air, light and healthiness and procured easier circulation in a labyrinth that was constantly blocked and impenetrable, where streets were winding, narrow, and dark."&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, {{lang|fr|Le Paris d'Haussmann,}} p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; It had employed thousands of workers, and most Parisians were pleased by the results.  His second phase, approved by the Emperor and parliament in 1858 and begun in 1859, was much more ambitious.  He intended to build a network of wide boulevards to connect the interior of Paris with the ring of grand boulevards built by [[Louis XVIII]] during the restoration, and to the new railroad stations which Napoleon III considered the real gates of the city.  He planned to construct {{convert|26294|m|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=off}} of new avenues and streets, at a cost of 180 million francs.&lt;ref name="Moncan, Patrice p. 64-65"&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, {{lang|fr|Le Paris d'Haussmann,}} pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Haussmann's plan called for the following:

On the right bank:
* The construction of a large new square, {{lang|fr|place du Chateau-d'Eau}} (the modern {{lang|fr|[[Place de la République]]}}).  This involved demolishing the famous theater street known as "{{lang|fr|le boulevard du Crime}}", made famous in the film {{lang|fr|[[Les Enfants du Paradis]]}}; and the construction of three new major streets: the {{lang|fr|boulevard du Prince Eugène}} (the modern {{lang|fr|boulevard Voltaire}}); the {{lang|fr|boulevard Magenta}} and {{lang|fr|rue Turbigo}}.  Boulevard Voltaire became one of the longest streets in the city, and became the central axis of the eastern neighborhoods of the city. It would end at the {{lang|fr|place du Trône}} (the modern {{lang|fr|[[Place de la Nation]]}}).
* The extension of {{lang|fr|boulevard Magenta}} to connect it with the new railway station, the {{lang|fr|[[Gare du Nord]]}}.
* The construction of {{lang|fr|boulevard Malesherbes}}, to connect the {{lang|fr|place de la Madeleine}} to the new {{lang|fr|Monceau}} neighborhood.  The construction of this street obliterated one of the most sordid and dangerous neighborhoods in the city, called {{lang|fr|la Petite Pologne}}, where Paris policemen rarely ventured at night.
* A new square, {{lang|fr|[[place de l'Europe]]}}, in front of the {{lang|fr|[[Gare Saint-Lazare]]}} railway station.  The station was served by two new boulevards, {{lang|fr|rue de Rome}} and {{lang|fr|rue Saint-Lazaire}}.  In addition, the {{lang|fr|rue de Madrid}} was extended and two other streets, {{lang|fr|rue de Rouen}} (the modern {{lang|fr|[[rue Auber]]}}) and {{lang|fr|rue Halevy}}, were built in this neighborhood.
* {{lang|fr|[[Parc Monceau]]}} was redesigned and replanted, and part of the old park made into a residential quarter.
* The {{lang|fr|rue de Londres}} and {{lang|fr|rue de Constantinople}}, under a new name, {{lang|fr|[[avenue de Villiers]]}}, was extended to {{lang|fr|porte Champerret}}.
* The {{lang|fr|[[Place de l'Étoile|Étoile]]}}, around the {{lang|fr|[[Arc de Triomphe]]}}, was completely redesigned.  A star of new avenues radiated from the {{lang|fr|Étoile}}; {{lang|fr|avenue de Bezons}} (now {{lang|fr|[[avenue de Wagram|Wagram]]}}); {{lang|fr|avenue Kleber}}; {{lang|fr|avenue Josephine}} (now {{lang|fr|Monceau}}); {{lang|fr|avenue Prince-Jerome}} (now Mac-Mahon and Niel); {{lang|fr|avenue Essling}} (now {{lang|fr|Carnot}}); and a wider {{lang|fr|avenue de Saint-Cloud}} (now {{lang|fr|[[Avenue Victor-Hugo (Paris)|Victor-Hugo]]}}).
* {{lang|fr|Avenue Daumesnil}} was built as far as the new {{lang|fr|[[Bois de Vincennes]]}}, a huge new park being constructed on the east edge of the city.
* The hill of {{lang|fr|[[Trocadéro|Chaillot]]}} was leveled, and a new square created at the {{lang|fr|Pont d'Alma}}.  Three new boulevards were built in this neighborhood: {{lang|fr|avenue d'Alma}} (the present [[Avenue George V|George V]]); {{lang|fr|avenue de l'Empereur}} (the present {{lang|fr|avenue du President-Wilson}}), which connected the {{lang|fr|places d'Alma}}, {{lang|fr|d'Iena}} and {{lang|fr|du Trocadéro}}.  In addition, four new streets were built in that neighborhood: {{lang|fr|rue Francois-I&lt;sup&gt;er&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{lang|fr|rue Pierre Charron}}, {{lang|fr|rue Marbeuf}} and {{lang|fr|rue de Marignan}}.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, {{lang|fr|Le Paris d'Haussmann,}} p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the left bank:
* Two new boulevards, {{lang|fr|avenue Bosquet}} and {{lang|fr|avenue Rapp}}, were constructed, beginning from the {{lang|fr|pont de l'Alma}}.
* The {{lang|fr|avenue de la Tour Maubourg}} was extended as far as the {{lang|fr|[[pont des Invalides]]}}.
* A new street, {{lang|fr|boulevard Arago}}, was constructed, to open up {{lang|fr|place Denfert-Rochereau}}.
* A new street, {{lang|fr|boulevard d'Enfer}} (today's {{lang|fr|boulevard Raspail}}) was built up to the intersection {{lang|fr|[[Sèvres – Babylone (Paris Métro)|Sèvres–Babylone]]}}.
* The streets around the {{lang|fr|Panthéon}} on {{lang|fr|[[Montagne Sainte-Geneviève]]}} were extensively changed.  A new street, {{lang|fr|avenue des Gobelins}}, was created, and part of {{lang|fr|rue Mouffetard}} was expanded. Another new street, {{lang|fr|rue Monge}}, was created on the east, while another new street, {{lang|fr|rue Claude Bernard}}, on the south.  {{lang|fr|Rue Soufflot}}, built by {{lang|fr|Rambuteau}}, was entirely rebuilt.

On the {{lang|fr|[[Île de la Cité]]}}:

The island became an enormous construction site, which completely destroyed most of the old streets and neighborhoods.  Two  new government buildings, the [[Tribunal de Commerce]] and the {{lang|fr|[[Paris Police Prefecture|Prefecture de Police]]}}, were built, occupying a large part of the island.  Two new streets were also built, the {{lang|fr|boulevard du Palais}} and the {{lang|fr|rue de Lutèce}}.  Two bridges, the {{lang|fr|[[pont Saint-Michel]]}} and the {{lang|fr|[[pont au Change|pont-au-Change]]}} were completely rebuilt, along with the embankments near them. The {{lang|fr|[[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]]}} and {{lang|fr|place Dauphine}} were extensively modified.  At the same time, Haussmann preserved and restored the jewels of the island; the square in front of the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Cathedral of Notre Dame]] was widened, the spire of the Cathedral, pulled down during the Revolution, was restored, and {{lang|fr|[[Sainte-Chapelle]]}} and the ancient {{lang|fr|[[Conciergerie]]}} were saved and restored.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, {{lang|fr|Le Paris d'Haussmann,}} pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand projects of the second phase were mostly welcomed, but also caused criticism.  Haussmann was especially criticized for his taking large parts of the {{lang|fr|[[Jardin du Luxembourg]]}} to make room for the present-day {{lang|fr|boulevard Raspail}}, and for its connection with the {{lang|fr|boulevard Saint-Michel}}.  The [[Medici Fountain]] had to be moved further into the park, and was reconstructed with the addition of statuary and a long basin of water.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, {{lang|fr|Le Paris d'Haussmann,}} p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Haussmann was also criticized for the growing cost of his projects; the estimated cost for the {{convert|26290|m}} of new avenues had been 180 million francs, but grew to 410 million francs;  property owners whose buildings had been expropriated won a legal case entitling them to a larger payments,  and many property owners found ingenious ways to increase the value of their expropriated properties by inventing non-existent shops and businesses, and charging the city for lost revenue.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, {{lang|fr|Le Paris d'Haussmann,}} p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris doubles in size – the annexation of 1860==
[[File:Adolphe Yvon - Haussmann présente à l'Empereur le plan d'annexion des Communes.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Haussmann presents Emperor Napoleon III the documents for the annexation of the Paris suburbs]]
On 1 January 1860 Napoleon III officially annexed the suburbs of Paris out to the ring of fortifications around the city.  The annexation included eleven communes;  Auteuil, Batignolles-Monceau, Montmartre, La Chapelle, Passy, La Villette, Belleville, Charonne, Bercy, Grenelle and Vaugirard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://fernandbournon.free.fr/paris/livre-1-chapitre-18.php#titre5|title=Annexion des communes suburbaines, en 1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with pieces of other outlying towns.  The residents of these suburbs were not entirely happy to be annexed;  they did not want to pay the higher taxes,  and wanted to keep their independence, but they had no choice;  Napoleon III was Emperor, and he could arrange boundaries as he wished.  With the annexation Paris was enlarged from twelve to twenty arrondissements, the number today.  The annexation more than doubled the area of the city from 3,300 hectares to 7,100 hectares,  and the population of Paris instantly grew by 400,000 to 1,600,000 persons.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 58–61&lt;/ref&gt;  The annexation made it necessary for Haussmann to enlarge his plans,  and to construct new boulevards to connect the new arrondissements with the center.  In order to connect Auteuil and Passy to the center of Paris, he built rues Michel-Ange, Molitor and Mirabeau.  To connect the plain of Monceau, he built avenues Villers, Wagram, and boulevard Malesherbes.  To reach the northern arrondissements he extended boulevard Magenta with boulevard d'Ornano as far as the Porte de la Chapelle, and in the east extended the rue des Pyrénées.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The third phase and mounting criticism (1869–70)==
The third phase of renovations was proposed in 1867 and approved in 1869, but it faced much more opposition than the earlier phases.  Napoleon III had decided to liberalize his empire in 1860, and to give a greater voice to the parliament and to the opposition.  The Emperor had always been less popular in Paris than in the rest of the country, and the republican opposition in parliament focused its attacks on Haussmann. Haussmann ignored the attacks and went ahead with the third phase, which planned the construction of twenty eight kilometers of new boulevards at an estimated cost of 280 million francs.&lt;ref name="Moncan, Patrice p. 64-65"/&gt;

The third phase included these projects on the right bank:
* The renovation of the gardens of the Champs-Élysées.
* Finishing the place du Château d'Eau (now Place de la Republique), creating a new avenue des Amandiers and extending avenue Parmentier.
* Finishing the place du Trône (now Place de la Nation) and opening three new boulevards: avenue Philippe-Auguste, avenue Taillebourg, and avenue de Bouvines.
* Extending the rue Caulaincourt and preparing a future Pont Caulaincourt.
* Building a new rue de Châteaudon and clearing the space around the church of Notre-Dame de Lorette, making room for connection between the gare Saint-Lazare and the gare du Nord and gare de l'Est.
* Finishing the place in front of the Gare du Nord.  Rue Maubeuge was extended from Montmartre to the boulevard de la Chapelle, and rue Lafayette was extended to the porte de Pantin.
* The place de l'Opéra had been created during the first and second phases;  the opera itself was to be built in the third phase.
* Extending boulevard Haussmann from the place Saint-Augustin to rue Taitbout, connecting the new quarter of the Opera with that of Etoile.
* Creating the place du Trocadéro,  the starting point of two new avenues,  the modern President-Wilson and Henri-Martin.
* Creating the place Victor Hugo, the starting point of avenues Malakoff and Bugeaud and rues Boissière and Copernic.
* Finishing the Rond-Point of the Champs-Élysées, with the construction of avenue d'Antin (now Franklin Roosevelt) and rue La Boétie.

On the left bank:
* Building the boulevard Saint-Germain from the pont de la Concorde to rue du Bac;  building rue des Saints-Pères and rue de Rennes.
* Extending the rue de la Glacière and enlarging place Monge.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, "Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haussmann did not have time to finish the third phase, as he soon came under intense attack from the opponents of Napoleon III.

==The downfall of Haussmann (1870) and the completion of his work (1927)==
In 1867, one of the leaders of the parliamentary opposition to Napoleon, [[Jules François Camille Ferry|Jules Ferry]], ridiculed the accounting practices of Haussmann as ''Les Comptes fantastiques d'Haussmann'' ("The fantastic (bank) accounts of Haussmann"), a play-on-words based on the "Les Contes d'Hoffman" [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] operetta popular at the time.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Haussmann, Georges Eugène, Baron |volume=13 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the parliamentary elections of May 1869, the government candidates won 4.43 million votes, while the opposition republicans won 3.35 million votes.  In Paris, the republican candidates won 234,000 votes to 77,000 for the Bonapartist candidates, and took eight of the nine seats of Paris deputies.&lt;ref&gt;Milza, Pierre, ''Napoleon III'', pp. 669–70.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time Napoleon III was increasingly ill,  suffering from [[gallstone]]s which were to cause his death in 1873,  and preoccupied by the political crisis that would lead to the Franco-Prussian War. In December 1869 Napoleon III named an opposition leader and fierce critic of Haussmann,  [[Emile Ollivier]], as his new prime minister.  Napoleon gave in to the opposition demands in January 1870 and asked Haussmann to resign.  Haussmann refused to resign, and the Emperor reluctantly dismissed him on 5 January 1870.  Eight months later, during the [[Franco-Prussian War]],  Napoleon III was captured by the Germans, and the Empire was overthrown.

In his memoirs,  written many years later, Haussmann had this comment on his dismissal: "In the eyes of the Parisians, who like routine in things but are changeable when it comes to people, I committed two great wrongs:  Over the course of seventeen years, I disturbed their daily habits by turning Paris upside down, and they had to look at the same face of the Prefect in the Hotel de Ville.  These were two unforgivable complaints."&lt;ref&gt;Haussmann, ''Mémoires'', cited in Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haussmann's successor as prefect of the Seine appointed [[Jean-Charles Alphand]],  the head of Haussmann's department of parks and plantations, as the director of works of Paris.  Alphand respected the basic concepts of his plan.  Despite their intense criticism of Napoleon III and Haussmann during the Second Empire,  the leaders of the new Third Republic continued and finished his renovation projects.
* 1875 –  completion of the Paris Opéra
* 1877 – completion of the boulevard Saint-Germain
* 1877 – completion of the avenue de l'Opéra
* 1879 – completion of the boulevard Henri IV
* 1889 – completion of the avenue de la République
* 1907 – completion of the boulevard Raspail
* 1927 – completion of the boulevard Haussmann&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green space – parks and gardens==
[[File:Bois de Boulogne.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Bois de Boulogne]] (1852–1858) was inspired by [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in London, and was designed to provide rest and relaxation for families of all classes of Parisians.]]
Prior to Haussmann, Paris had only four public parks:  the [[Jardin des Tuileries]], the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]], and the [[Palais Royal]], all in the center of the city, and the Parc Monceau, the former property of the family of King Louis Philippe, in addition to the [[Jardin des Plantes]], the city's botanical garden and oldest park.  Napoleon III  had already begun construction of the Bois de Boulogne, and wanted to build more new parks and gardens for the recreation and relaxation of the Parisians, particularly those in the new neighborhoods of the expanding city.&lt;ref name="Jarrasse, Dominique 2007"&gt;Jarrasse, Dominique (2007), ''Grammaire des jardins parisiens'',  Parigramme.&lt;/ref&gt;  Napoleon III's new parks were inspired by his memories of the parks in London, especially [[Hyde Park (London)|Hyde Park]], where he had strolled and promenaded in a carriage while in exile;  but he wanted to build on a much larger scale.  Working with Haussmann, [[Jean-Charles Alphand]], the engineer who headed the new  Service of Promenades and Plantations, whom Haussmann brought with him from Bordeaux, and his new chief gardener, [[Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps]],  also from Bordeaux, laid out a plan for four major parks at the cardinal points of the compass around the city.  Thousands of workers and gardeners began to dig lakes, build cascades, plant lawns, flowerbeds and trees. construct chalets and grottoes. Haussmann and Alphand created  the [[Bois de Boulogne]] (1852–1858) to the west of Paris: the [[Bois de Vincennes]] (1860–1865) to the east; the [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]] (1865–1867) to the north, and  [[Parc Montsouris]] (1865–1878) to the south.&lt;ref name="Jarrasse, Dominique 2007"/&gt;  In addition to building the four large parks,  Haussmann and Alphand redesigned and replanted the city's older parks,  including [[Parc Monceau]], and the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]].  Altogether, in seventeen years, they planted six hundred thousand trees and added two thousand hectares of parks and green space to Paris. Never before had a city built so many parks and gardens in such a short time.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 107–09&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Louis Philippe, a single public square had been created, at the tip of the Ile-de-la-Cité.  Haussmann wrote in his memoirs that Napoleon III instructed him: "do not miss an opportunity to build, in all the arrondissements of Paris,  the greatest possible number of squares, in order to offer the Parisians, as they have done in London, places for relaxation and recreation for all the families and all the children, rich and poor."&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;  In response Haussmann created twenty-four new squares;  seventeen in the older part of the city,  eleven in the new arrondissements, adding 150,000 square meters of green space.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Alphand termed these small parks  "green and flowering salons."  Haussmann's goal  was to have one park in each of the eighty neighborhoods of Paris, so that no one was more than ten minutes' walk from such a park.  The parks and squares were an immediate success with all classes of Parisians.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrasse, Dominque (2007), Grammmaire des jardins Parisiens, Parigramme. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==The architecture of Haussmann's Paris==
[[File:Paris Opera full frontal architecture, May 2009.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Palais Garnier]] or Paris Opera (1875), then the largest theater in the world,  begun by Napoleon III but not finished until 1875.  The style was described by its architect, [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], simply as "Napoleon III."]]
Napoleon III and Haussmann commissioned a wide variety of architecture, some of it traditional, some of it very innovative, like the glass and iron pavilions of [[Les Halles]]; and some of it, such as the [[Opéra Garnier]],  commissioned by Napoleon III, designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] but not finished until 1875, is difficult to classify. Many of the buildings were designed by the city architect, [[Gabriel Davioud]], who designed everything from city halls and theaters to park benches and kiosks.

His architectural projects included:
* The construction of two new railroad stations, the [[Gare du Nord]] and the [[Gare de l'Est]];  and the rebuilding of the [[Gare de Lyon]].
* Six new mairies, or town halls, for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th and 12th arrondissements, and the enlargement of the other mairies.
* The reconstruction of [[Les Halles]], the central market,  replacing the old market buildings with large glass and iron pavilions, designed by [[Victor Baltard]].  In addition, Haussmann built a new market in the neighborhood of the Temple, the Marché Saint-Honoré; the Marché de l'Europe in the 8th arrondissement; the Marché Saint-Quentin in the 10th arrondissement; the Marché de Belleville in the 20th; the Marché des Batignolles in the 17th; the Marché Saint-Didier and Marché d'Auteuil in the 16th; the Marché de Necker in the 15th; the Marché de Montrouge in the 14th; the Marché de Place d'Italie in the 13th; the Marché Saint-Maur-Popincourt in the 11th.
* The Paris Opera (now Palais Garnier), begun under Napoleon III and finished in 1875;  and five new theaters; the Châtelet  and Théâtre Lyrique on the Place du Châtelet; the Gaîté, Vaudeville and Panorama.
* Five lycées were renovated, and in each of the eighty neighborhoods Haussmann established one municipal school for boys and one for girls, in addition to the large network of schools run by the Catholic church.
* The reconstruction and enlargement of the city's oldest hospital, the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris]] on the Île-de-la-Cité.
* The completion of the last wing of the [[Louvre]], and the opening up of the Place du Carousel and the Place du Palais-Royal by the demolition of several old streets.
* The building of the first railroad bridge across the Seine;  originally called the Pont Napoleon III, now called simply the [[Pont National]].
Since 1801, under Napoleon I, the French government was responsible for the building and maintenance of churches.  Haussmann built, renovated or purchased nineteen churches.  New churches included the Saint-Augustin, the Eglise Saint-Vincent de Paul, the Eglise de la Trinité.  He bought six churches which had been purchased by private individuals during the French Revolution.  Haussmann built or renovated five temples and built two new synagogues, on rue des Tournelles and rue de la Victoire.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 89–105&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides building churches, theaters and other public buildings, Haussmann paid attention to the details of the architecture along the street;  his city architect, Gabriel Davioud, designed garden fences, kiosks, shelters for visitors to the parks, public toilets, and dozens of other small but important structures.

==The Haussmann building==
[[File:Place-saint-georges.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Place Saint-Georges.]]
[[File:Blv-haussmann-lafayette.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boulevard Haussmann, lined by typical Haussmann buildings.]]
The most famous and recognizable feature of Haussmann's renovation of Paris are the Haussmann apartment buildings which line the boulevards of Paris.  Street [[City block|blocks]]  were designed as homogeneous architectural wholes.  He treated buildings not as independent structures, but as pieces of a unified urban landscape.

In 18th-century Paris, buildings were usually narrow (often only six meters wide);  deep (sometimes forty meters) and tall—as many as five or six stories. The ground floor usually contained a shop,  and the shopkeeper lived in the rooms above the shop. The upper floors were occupied by families;  the top floor, under the roof, was originally a storage place, but under the pressure of the growing population, was usually turned into a low-cost residence.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 19th century, before Haussmann, the height of buildings was strictly limited to 22.41 meters, or four floors above the ground floor.  The city also began to see a demographic shift;  wealthier families began moving to the western neighborhoods, partly because there was more space, and partly because the prevailing winds carried the smoke from the new factories in Paris toward the east.

In Haussmann's Paris, the streets became much wider, growing from an average of twelve meters wide to twenty-four meters, and in the new arrondissements, often to eighteen meters wide.

The interiors of the buildings were left to the owners of the buildings, but the façades were strictly regulated, to ensure that they were the same height, color, material, and general design, and were harmonious when all seen together.

The reconstruction of the [[rue de Rivoli]] was the model for the rest of the Paris boulevards.  The new apartment buildings followed the same general plan:
* ground floor and basement with thick, [[load-bearing wall]]s, fronts usually parallel to the street.  This was often occupied by shops or offices.
* [[mezzanine]] or entresol intermediate level, with low ceilings; often also used by shops or offices.
* second, [[piano nobile]] floor with a balcony.  This floor, in the days before elevators were common, was the most desirable floor, and had the largest and best apartments.
* third and fourth floors in the same style but with less elaborate stonework around the windows, sometimes lacking balconies.
* fifth floor with a single, continuous, undecorated balcony.
* [[mansard]] roof, angled at 45°, with [[garret]] rooms and [[dormer]] windows.  Originally this floor was to be occupied by lower-income tenants, but with time and with higher rents it came to be occupied almost exclusively by the concierges and servants of the people in the apartments below.

The Haussmann façade was organized around horizontal lines that often continued from one building to the next: [[balconies]] and [[cornice]]s  were perfectly aligned without any noticeable alcoves or projections, at the risk of the uniformity of certain quarters. The [[rue de Rivoli]] served as a model for the entire network of new Parisian boulevards. For the building façades, the technological progress of stone sawing and (steam) transportation allowed the use of massive stone blocks instead of simple stone facing. The street-side result was a "monumental" effect that exempted buildings from a dependence on decoration; sculpture and other elaborate stonework would not become widespread until the end of the century.

Before Haussmann, most buildings in Paris were made of brick or wood and covered with plaster.  Haussmann required that the buildings along the new boulevards be either built or faced  with cut stone, usually the local cream-colored [[Lutetian limestone]], which gave more harmony to the appearance of the boulevards.  He also required, using a decree from 1852, that the façades of all buildings be regularly maintained, repainted, or cleaned, at least every ten years. under the threat of a fine of one hundred francs.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underneath the streets of Haussmann's Paris – the renovation of the city's infrastructure==
[[File:PARIS SOUTERRAIN - Les égouts, service de l'assainissement ; collecteur du Boulevard Sébastopol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The new water pipes and sewers built under the Boulevard Sebastopol.]]
While he was rebuilding the boulevards of Paris, Haussmann simultaneously rebuilt the dense labyrinth of pipes, sewers and tunnels under the streets which provided Parisians with basic services. Haussmann wrote in his mémoires: "The underground galleries are an organ of the great city, functioning like an organ of the human body, without seeing the light of day; clean and fresh water, light and heat circulate like the various fluids whose movement and maintenance serves the life of the body; the secretions are taken away mysteriously and don't disturb the good functioning of the city and without spoiling its beautiful exterior."&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haussmann began with the water supply. Before Haussmann, drinking water in Paris was either lifted by steam engines from the Seine, or brought by a canal, started by Napoleon I, from the river [[Ourcq]], a tributary of the river [[Marne]]. The quantity of water was insufficient for the fast-growing city, and, since the sewers also emptied into the Seine near the intakes for drinking water, it was also notoriously unhealthy. In March 1855 Haussmann appointed [[Eugene Belgrand]], a graduate of the [[École Polytechnique]], to the post of Director of Water and Sewers of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The European Cities and Technology Reader: Industrial to Post-industrial City |author=Goodman, David C. |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-20079-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgrand first addressed the city's fresh water needs, constructing a system of [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] that nearly doubled the amount of water available per person per day and quadrupled the number of homes with running water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Walks Through Lost Paris: A Journey Into the Hear of Historic Paris |author=Pitt, Leonard |year=2006 |publisher=Shoemaker &amp; Hoard Publishers |isbn=1-59376-103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}} These aqueducts discharged their water in reservoirs situated within the city. Inside the city limits and opposite [[Parc Montsouris]], Belgrand built the largest water reservoir in the world to hold the water from the River [[Vanne]].

At the same time Belgrand began rebuilding the water distribution and sewer system under the streets. In 1852 Paris had 142 kilometers of sewers, which could carry only liquid waste. Containers of solid waste were picked up each night by people called ''vidangeurs'', who carried it to waste dumps on the outskirts of the city. The tunnels he designed were intended to be clean, easily accessible, and substantially larger than the previous Parisian underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Building New York's Sewers: Developing Mechanisms of Urban Management |author=Goldman, Joanne Abel |year=1997 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=1-55753-095-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his guidance, Paris's sewer system expanded fourfold between 1852 and 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Private Life |author=Perrot, Michelle |year=1990 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-40003-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haussmann and Belgrand built new sewer tunnels under each sidewalk of the new boulevards. The sewers were designed to be large enough to evacuate rain water immediately; the large amount of water used to wash the city streets; waste water from both industries and individual households; and water that collected in basements when the level of the Seine was high. Before Haussmann, the sewer tunnels (featured in Victor Hugo's ''Les Miserables'') were cramped and narrow, just 1.8 meters high and 75 to 80 centimeters wide. The new tunnels were 2.3 meters high and 1.3 meters wide, large enough for men to work standing up. These flowed into larger tunnels that carried the waste water to even larger collector tunnels, which were 4.4 meters high and 5.6 meters wide. A channel down the center of the tunnel carried away the waste water, with sidewalks on either side for the ''égoutiers'', or sewer workers. Specially designed wagons and boats moved on rails up and down the channels, cleaning them. Belgrand proudly invited tourists to visit his sewers and ride in the boats under the streets of the city.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 138–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underground labyrinth built by Haussmann also provided gas for heat and for lights to illuminate Paris. At the beginning of the Second Empire, gas was provided by six different private companies. Haussmann forced them to consolidate into a single company, the ''Compagnie parisienne d'éclairage et de chauffage par le gaz'', with rights to provide gas to Parisians for fifty years. Consumption of gas tripled between 1855 and 1859. In 1850 there were only 9000 gaslights in Paris; by 1867, the Paris Opera and four other major theaters alone had fifteen thousand gas lights. Almost all the new residential buildings of Paris had gaslights in the courtyards and stairways; the monuments and public buildings of Paris, the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] of the Rue de Rivoli, and the squares, boulevards and streets were illuminated at night by gaslights. For the first time, Paris was the City of Light.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics of Haussmann's Paris==

==="Triumphant vulgarity"===
Haussmann's renovation of Paris had many critics during his own time.  Some were simply tired of the continuous construction.  The French historian [[Léon Halévy]] wrote in 1867,  "the work of Monsieur Haussmann is incomparable.  Everyone agrees. Paris is a marvel, and M. Haussmann has done in fifteen years what a century could not have done. But that's enough for the moment. There will be a 20th century. Let's leave something for them to do."&lt;ref&gt;Halevy, ''Carnets'', 1862–69.  Cited in Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial'', p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;  Others regretted that he had destroyed a historic part of the city. The brothers Goncourt condemned the avenues that cut at right angles through the center of the old city,  where "one could no longer feel in the world of Balzac."&lt;ref&gt;cited in de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jules Ferry]], the most vocal critic of Haussmann in the French parliament, wrote:  "We weep with our eyes full of tears for the old Paris, the Paris of Voltaire, of Desmoulins, the Paris of 1830 and 1848,  when we see the grand and intolerable new buildings, the costly confusion, the triumphant vulgarity, the awful materialism, that we are going to pass on to our descendants."&lt;ref&gt;cited in de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century historian of Paris René Héron de Villefosse shared the same view of Haussmann's renovation:  "in less than twenty years, Paris lost its ancestral appearance, its  character which passed from generation to generation... the picturesque and charming ambiance which our fathers had passed onto us was demolished, often without good reason."  Héron de Villefosse denounced Haussmann's central market, Les Halles, as "a hideous eruption" of cast iron.  Describing Haussmann's renovation of the Île de la Cité, he wrote: "the old ship of Paris was torpedoed by Baron Haussmann and sunk during his reign. It was perhaps the greatest crime of the megalomaniac prefect and also his biggest mistake...His work caused more damage than a hundred bombings. It was in part necessary, and one should give him credit for his self-confidence, but he was certainly lacking culture and good taste...In the United States, it would be wonderful, but in our capital, which he covered with barriers, scaffolds, gravel, and dust for twenty years, he committed crimes, errors, and showed bad taste."&lt;ref&gt;Héron de Villefosse, René, ''Histoire de Paris'', Bernard Grasset, 1959. pp. 339–55&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paris historian, Patrice de Moncan,  in general an admirer of Haussmann's work,  faulted Haussmann for not preserving more of the historic streets on the Île de la Cité, and for clearing a large open space in front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame, while hiding another major historical monument, [[Sainte-Chapelle]],  out of sight within the walls of the Palais de Justice,  He also criticized Haussmann for reducing the Jardin de Luxembourg from thirty to twenty-six hectares in order to build the rues Medici, Guynemer and Auguste-Comte;  for giving away a half of [[Parc Monceau]] to the Pereire brothers for building lots, in order to reduce costs;  and for destroying several historic residences along the route of the Boulevard Saint-Germain, because of his unwavering determination to have straight streets.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 201–02&lt;/ref&gt;

===The debate about the military purposes of Haussmann's boulevards===
[[File:Barricades pres de Ministere de la Marine et l'Hötel Crillon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|During the [[Paris Commune]], the Communards built an impressive fort where the [[Rue de Rivoli]] met the [[Place de la Concorde]]. The army used side streets to move around it, and captured it from behind.]]
Some of Haussmann's critics said that the real purpose of Haussmann's boulevards was to make it easier for the army to maneuver and suppress armed uprisings; Paris had experienced six such uprisings between 1830 and 1848, all in the narrow, crowded streets in the center and east of Paris and on the left bank around the Pantheon. These critics argued that a small number of large, open intersections allowed easy control by a small force. In addition, buildings set back from the center of the street could not be used so easily as fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Gate of Paris |work= New York Times |date= 14 May 1871 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1871/05/14/78999917.pdf |accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emile Zola]] repeated that argument in his early novel, ''La Curée''; "Paris sliced by strokes of a saber: the veins opened, nourishing one hundred thousand earth movers and stone masons; criss-crossed by admirable strategic routes, placing forts in the heart of the old neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Zola, Emile, L''a Curée''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some real-estate owners demanded large, straight avenues to help troops manoeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;Letter written by owners from the neighbourhood of the Pantheon to prefect Berger in 1850, quoted in the ''Atlas du Paris Haussmannien''&lt;/ref&gt; The argument that the boulevards were designed for troop movements was repeated by 20th century critics, including the French historian, René Hérron de Villefosse, who wrote, "the larger part of the piercing of avenues had for its reason the desire to avoid popular insurrections and barricades.  They were strategic from their conception."&lt;ref&gt;Héron de Villefosse, René, ''Histoire de Paris'', p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was also popularized by the American architectural critic, [[Lewis Mumford]].

Haussmann himself did not deny the military value of the wider streets. In his memoires, he wrote that his new boulevard Sebastopol resulted in the "gutting of old Paris, of the quarter of riots and barricades."&lt;ref name="Moncan, p. 34"&gt;Le Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted he sometimes used this argument with the Parliament to justify the high cost of his projects, arguing that they were for national defense and should be paid for, at least partially, by the state. He wrote: "But, as for me, I who was the promoter of these additions made to the original project, I declare that I never thought in the least, in adding them, of their greater or lesser strategic value."&lt;ref name="Moncan, p. 34"/&gt; The Paris urban historian Patrice de Moncan wrote: "To see the works created by Haussmann and Napoleon III only from the perspective of their strategic value is very reductive. The Emperor was a convinced follower of Saint-Simon. His desire to make Paris, the economic capital of France, a more open, more healthy city, not only for the upper classes but also for the workers, cannot be denied, and should be recognised as the primary motivation."&lt;ref&gt;'de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was only one armed uprising in Paris after Haussmann, the [[Paris Commune]] from March through May 1871, and the boulevards played no important role. The Communards seized power easily, because the French Army was absent, defeated and captured by the Prussians. The Communards took advantage of the boulevards to build a few large forts of paving stones with wide fields of fire at strategic points, such as the meeting point of the Rue de Rivoli and Place de la Concorde. But when the newly organized army arrived at the end of May, it avoided the main boulevards, advanced slowly and methodically to avoid casualties, worked its way around the barricades, and took them from behind.  The Communards were defeated in one week not because of Haussmann's boulevards, but because they were outnumbered by five to one, they had fewer weapons and fewer men trained to use them, they had no hope of getting support from outside Paris, they had no plan for the defense of the city; they had very few experienced officers; there was no single commander; and each neighborhood was left to defend itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rougerie, Jacques, ''La Commune de 1871'', (2014), pp. 115–17&lt;/ref&gt;

As Paris historian Patrice de Moncan observed,  most of Haussmann's projects had little or no strategic or military value;  the purpose of building new sewers,  aqueducts, parks, hospitals, schools, city halls, theaters, churches, markets and other public buildings was, as Haussmann stated, to employ thousands of workers, and to make the city more healthy, less congested, and more beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'',  pp. 203–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social disruption===
Haussmann was also blamed for the social disruption caused by his gigantic building projects.  Thousands of families and businesses had to relocate when their buildings were demolished for the construction of the new boulevards.  Haussmann was also blamed for the dramatic increase in rents, which increased by three hundred percent during the Second Empire,  while wages, except for those of construction workers, remained flat, and blamed for the enormous amount of speculation in the real estate market. He was also blamed for reducing the amount of housing available for low income families, forcing low-income Parisians to move from the center to the outer neighborhoods of the city, where rents were lower.  Statistics showed that the population of the first and sixth arrondissements, where some of the most densely populated neighborhoods were located, dropped, while the population of the new 17th and 20th arrondissements, on the edges of the city, grew rapidly.

Haussmann's defenders noted that he built far more buildings than he tore down:  he demolished 19,730 buildings, containing 120,000 lodgings or apartments,  while building 34,000 new buildings, with 215,300 new apartments and lodgings.  French historian Michel Cremona wrote that, even with the increase in population, from 949,000 Parisians in 1850 to 1,130,500 in 1856, to two million in 1870, including those in the newly annexed eight arrondissements around the city, the number of housing units grew faster than the population.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have also shown that the proportion of Paris housing occupied by low-income Parisians did not decrease under Haussmann, and that the poor were not driven out of Paris by Haussmann's renovation. In  1865 a survey by the prefecture of Paris showed that 780,000 Parisians, or 42 percent of the population, did not pay taxes due to their low income. Another 330,000 Parisians or 17 percent, paid less than 250 francs a month rent.  Thirty-two percent of the Paris housing was occupied by middle-class families, paying rent between 250 and 1500 francs. Fifty thousand Parisians were classified as rich, with rents over 1500 francs a month, and occupied just three percent of the residences.&lt;ref&gt;de Moncan, ''Le Paris d'Haussmann'', pp. 172–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics blamed Haussmann for the division of Paris into rich and poor neighborhoods, with the poor concentrated in the east and the middle class and wealthy in the west.  Haussmann's defenders noted that this shift in population had been underway since the 1830s, long before Haussmann, as more prosperous Parisians moved to the western neighborhoods, where there was more open space, and where residents benefited from the prevailing winds, which carried the smoke from Paris's new industries toward the east.  His defenders also noted that Napoleon III and Haussmann made a special point to build an equal number of new boulevards,  new sewers, water supplies, hospitals, schools, squares, parks and gardens in the working class eastern arrondissements as they did in the western neighborhoods.

A form of vertical stratification did take place in the Paris population due to Haussmann's renovations.  Prior to Haussmann,  Paris buildings usually had wealthier people on the second floor (the "etage noble"), while middle class and lower-income tenants occupied the top floors.  Under Haussmann, with the increase in rents and greater demand for housing,  low-income people were unable to afford the rents for the upper floors;  the top floors were increasingly occupied by concierges and the servants of those in the floors below.  Lower-income tenants were forced to the outer neighborhoods, where rents were lower.&lt;ref&gt;Maneglier, Hervé,  "Paris Impérial", p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{History of Paris}}
The Baron Haussmann's transformations to Paris improved the quality of life in the capital. Disease epidemics (save [[tuberculosis]]) ceased, traffic circulation improved and new buildings were better-built and more functional than their predecessors.

The [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] renovations left such a mark on Paris' urban history that all subsequent trends and influences were forced to refer to, adapt to, or reject, or to reuse some of its elements. By intervening only once in Paris's ancient districts, pockets of insalubrity remained which explain the resurgence of both hygienic ideals and radicalness of some planners of the 20th century.

The end of "pure Haussmannism" can be traced to urban legislation of 1882 and 1884 that ended the uniformity of the classical street, by permitting staggered façades and the first creativity for roof-level architecture; the latter would develop greatly after restrictions were further liberalized by a 1902 law. All the same, this period was merely "post-Haussmann", rejecting only the austerity of the Napoleon-era architecture, without questioning the urban planning itself.

A century after Napoleon III's reign, new housing needs and the rise of a new voluntarist [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] began a new era of Parisian urbanism. The new era rejected Haussmannian ideas as a whole to embrace those represented by architects such as [[Le Corbusier]] in abandoning unbroken street-side façades, limitations of building size and dimension, and even closing the street itself to automobiles with the creation of separated, car-free spaces between the buildings for pedestrians. This new model was quickly brought into question by the 1970s, a period featuring a reemphasis of the Haussmann heritage: a new promotion of the multifunctional street was accompanied by limitations of the building model and, in certain quarters, by an attempt to rediscover the architectural homogeneity of the Second Empire street-block.

The Parisian public now has a generally positive opinion of the Haussmann legacy,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} to the extent that certain suburban towns, for example [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]] and [[Puteaux]], have built new quarters that even by their name claim "Quartier Haussmannien", the Haussmanian heritage.

'''Hendrik Adriaan van Rheede tot Drakenstein''' (Amsterdam, 13 April 1636 – at sea, 15 December 1691) was a military man and a colonial administrator of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and [[natural history|naturalist]]. Between 1669 and 1676 he served as a governor of [[Dutch Malabar]] and employed twenty-five people on his book ''[[Hortus Malabaricus]]'', describing 740 plants in the region. As Lord of Mydrecht, he also played a role in the governance of the Cape colonies. Many plants such as the vine ''[[Entada rheedii]]'' are named for him.

== Biography ==
Van Rheede was born into a family of noblemen that played a leading role in the political, administrative and cultural life of the province of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. His mother, Elisabeth van Utenhove, died in 1637 while his father, Ernst van Rheede, Council at the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]], died when he was four. Hendrik Adriaan, the youngest of seven children, left home at the age of fourteen. In 1656 he joined as a soldier in the [[Dutch East India Company]] (V.O.C., Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) and served alongside [[Johan Bax van Herenthals]] (who would also take an interest in natural history).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The origins of Clifford's herbarium|first1=D. Onno|last1=Wijnands|first2=Johannes|last2=Heniger|year=1991|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1991.tb02288.x |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=106|issue=2|pages=129–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Rheede served under Admiral [[Rijcklof van Goens]] in campaigns against the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] on the west coast of India in erstwhile [[Dutch Malabar]]. He gained rapid promotion becoming an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]]. &lt;!--In 1662 he was kept prisoner on Van Goens first and failing attack.&lt;ref&gt;Pol, B. van der (2008) Mallabaarse Brieven. De brieven van de Friese predikant Jacobus Canter Visscher (1717–1723), p. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; In 1663, during a siege of [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], he was ordered to arrest the queen there and this act saved her life from the massacre of the royal family. The subsequent king of Cochin maintained cordial relations with him and Van Rheede was the Dutch captain who mediated with the Kingdom of Cochin. In 1665 he was appointed as commander in [[Jaffna]] and had [[Johan Nieuhof]] locked up for smuggling [[pearls]].&lt;ref&gt;Heniger (1986):22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1669 Van Rheede seems to have been forced to resign from the Dutch East India Company by Van Goens.&lt;ref name=currsci&gt;Ram (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The resignation was made as he opposed the repressive measures of Van Goens and instead favoured negotiation, but in 1670 he is appointed as commander of Dutch Malabar. In 1671 he fought with the [[Zamorin|Zamorin of Calicut]]. In 1672 he had to deal with the former VOC-employee [[François Caron]], then serving the [[French East India Company]].

In 1677 Van Rheede moved to Jakarta, being appointed in the Counsel of India. He stayed for about six months but the conflict with Van Goens grew fiercer. He returned to [[Amsterdam]] in June 1678. Since 1680 he could call himself Lord of [[Mijdrecht]] (Mydrecht). In 1681 he signed a contract with the botanists [[Jan Commelin]] and [[Johannes Munnicks]] and began work on the manuscript of the [[Hortus Malabaricus]].

In 1684 he was empowered by the "directors" (Council of Seventeen) of the Company to inspect the [[Cape Colony]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Dutch India]] to combat corruption within their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed Isaac Soolmans to accompany him. They visited [[Simon van der Stel]] in [[Cape of Good Hope]], and [[Groot Constantia]]; the area [[Drakenstein Local Municipality|Groot Drakenstein]] was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Mentzel (1944):61.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Rheede recommended measures for [[forestry]] and [[viniculture]]. Rheede, the Lord of Mydrecht, also made rules on how slaves would be treated and he decreed that slave children had to be taught to read and write with any flogging requiring permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofsouthaf00fairuoft#page/56/mode/2up|page=56|author=Fairbridge, Dorothea|title=A history of South Africa|year=1918|publisher=Oxford University Press|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1687 Governor Van der Stel opened this region to farmers. Van Rheede was a bachelor, but had adopted a girl from Malabar with an unknown Dutch father.&lt;ref&gt;Heniger (1986):87, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; He met with Van Goens junior, an ambitious administrator on his way to Batavia. Both men didn't like each other at all. Some time before Van Goens had given orders—afraid for competition anywhere else in the world—to extirpate all the acclimatizating [[cinnamon tree]]s which were destined for the Amsterdam Municipal Garden. It is possible that the rare trees for the [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Gaspar Fagel]] were then also destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Heniger (1986):72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Rheede sailed to [[Colombo]] and after two months to Bengal. He visited many VOC trading posts, especially around [[Hooghly (town)|Hooghly]]. His next destination was the [[Dutch Coromandel|Coromandel]] and he stayed for one year in [[Nagapattinam]]. In 1690 he founded a seminary in [[Jaffna]]. Then he went to [[Tuticorin]] and the Malabar. In the end of November 1691 he sailed to [[Dutch Suratte]], but died at sea, off the coast of [[Bombay]] on December 15, 1691. Some authors suggest that he was poisoned by VOC employees while others that he was sick already for a while.&lt;ref&gt;Heniger (1986):81.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Rheede was buried at [[Surat]] on 3 January 1692 in the presence of his daughter Francine and many notables. Among the attendants was also Van Rheede's secretary [[Hendrick Zwaardecroon]], the future [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/detail.aspx?page=dafb&amp;lang=en&amp;id=1947 Drawing of ''the funeral procession of [[Esquire]] van Rheede] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927100608/http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/detail.aspx?page=dafb&amp;lang=en&amp;id=1947 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrik van Rheede's work on the plants of the [[Malabar region]] began in 1674&lt;ref&gt;Heniger (1986):145.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was around 1675 that the draft of the first volume of the ''[[Hortus Malabaricus]]'' was produced. Since 1660, the Dutch East India Company had encouraged publication of scientific work and the documentation of the useful plants by Van Rheede would help in the fight against local diseases. The first volume of the ''Hortus Malabaricus'' was published in 1678, a compendium of the plants of economic and medical value in the south Indian Malabar region, was undertaken when "[[Jonkheer]]" Hendrik van Rheede was the Dutch Governor of Cochin and continued for the next three decades. It was published in twelve volumes and in four languages: Latin, [[Sanskrit]], Arabic and [[Malayalam]].&lt;ref name=anh&gt;Fournier (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Mentioned in these volumes are plants of the Malabar region which in his time referred to the stretch along the [[Western Ghats]] from [[Goa]] to [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]]. The ethno-medical information presented in the work was extracted from [[palm leaf manuscript]]s by a famous practitioner of herbal medicine named [[Itty Achudan|Itty Achuden]]. Achuden was an vaiydan ("healer") of the local Ezhava tradition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Subaltern Medicine and Social Mobility: The experience of the Ezhava in Kerala|first= Burton |last=Cleetus| journal=Indian Anthropologist| volume=37| issue=1| year=2007| pages=147–172| jstor=41920032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (that has in recent times been included under the label of Kerala Ayurveda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medicine as Culture: Indigenous Medicine in Cosmopolitan Mumbai| first=Leena| last= Abraham| journal =Economic and Political Weekly| volume= 44| issue=16 |year=2009|pages=68–75| jstor=40279158}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The compilations were edited by a team of nearly a hundred including physicians, professors of medicine and botany, amateur botanists (such as professor [[Arnold Seyn]], [[Theodorus Janssonius van Almeloveen|Theodore Jansson of Almeloveen]], [[Paul Hermann (botanist)|Paul Hermann]], [[Johannes Munnicks]], [[Jan Commelin]], [[Abraham Poot]], the translator of a Dutch version), Indian scholars and ''vaidyas'' (physicians) of Malabar and adjacent regions, and technicians, illustrators and engravers, together with the collaboration of company officials, clergymen (Johannes Casearius and Father Mathew of St. Joseph). He was also assisted by the King of Cochin and the ruling Zamorin of Calicut.&lt;ref name=currsci /&gt;

[[Carl Linnaeus]] made use of Rheede's work,&lt;ref name=anh/&gt; noting in the preface of his ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'' (1737) that he did not trust any authors except ''[[Johann Jakob Dillenius|Dillen]]'' in ''Hortus Elthamensis'', Rheede in ''Hortus Malabaricus'' and [[Charles Plumier]] on American plants and further noted that Rheede was the most accurate of the three.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller-Wille &amp; Reeds (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Linneaeus' specific epithets based on Rheede originate from Malayalam names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Carl Linnaeus's Acquaintance with Tropical Plants|author=Stearn, W.T.|journal=Taxon|volume=37| issue=3|series=Symposium Tropical Biology: Principles and Practice|year=1988|pages=776–781|doi=10.2307/1221114}}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting the Cape in 1685, van Rheede considered a work on African plants of economic importance, ''Hortus Africanus'', but this idea was never realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=G. |last1=Scott|first2=M.L.|last2=Hewett|title=Pioneers in ethnopharmacology: The Dutch East India Company (VOC) at the Cape from 1650 to 1800|journal= Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=115|issue=3|year=2008|pages= 339–360|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2007.10.020|pmid=18079078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Human Protein Reference Database''' ('''HPRD''') is a [[protein]] [[database]] accessible through the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Peri S, etal |title=Development of human protein reference database as an initial platform for approaching systems biology in humans |journal=Genome Research |year=2003 |volume=13 |pages=2363–71 |doi=10.1101/gr.1680803 |pmid=14525934 |pmc=403728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The HPRD is a result of an international collaborative effort between the Institute of Bioinformatics in Bangalore, India and the Pandey lab at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Baltimore, USA. HPRD contains manually curated scientific information pertaining to the biology of most human proteins. Information regarding proteins involved in human diseases is annotated and linked to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. The National Center for Biotechnology Information provides link to HPRD through its human protein databases (e.g. Entrez Gene, RefSeq protein pertaining to genes and proteins.

This resource depicts information on human protein functions including [[protein–protein interactions]], [[post-translational modifications]], enzyme-substrate relationships and disease associations. Protein annotation information that is catalogued was derived through manual curation using published literature by expert biologists and through bioinformatics analyses of the protein sequence. The protein–protein interaction and subcellular localization data from HPRD have been used to develop a human protein interaction network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gandhi T.K.B. | year = | title = Analysis of the human protein interactome and comparison with yeast, worm and fly interaction datasets | url = | journal = Nature Genetics | volume =  38| issue = 3| pages = 285–293 | doi=10.1038/ng1747 | pmid=16501559 | date=March 2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlights of HPRD as follows:

* From 10,000 protein–protein interactions (PPIs) annotated for 3,000 proteins in 2003, HPRD has grown to over 36,500 unique PPIs annotated for 25,000 proteins including 6,360 isoforms by the end of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mathivanan S. | year = | title = An evaluation of human protein–protein interaction data in the public domain | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 2006 | issue = 7| page = S19 | doi=10.1186/1471-2105-7-s5-s19|display-authors=etal | pmid=17254303 | pmc=1764475}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* More than 50% of molecules annotated in HPRD have at least one PPI and 10% have more than 10 PPIs.
* Experiments for PPIs are broadly grouped into three categories namely in vitro, in vivo and [[yeast two hybrid]] (Y2H). Sixty percent of PPIs annotated in HPRD are supported by a single experiment whereas 26% of them are found to have two of the three experimental methods annotated.
* HPRD contains 18,000 manually curated PTMs data belonging to 26 different types. [[Phosphorylation]] is the leading type of modification of protein contributing to 63% of PTM data annotated in HPRD. [[Glycosylation]], [[proteolytic cleavage]] and [[disulfide bridge]] events are the next leading contributors of PTM data.
* HPRD data is available for download in tab delimited and [[XML]] file formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mishra G. | year = | title = Human protein reference database—2006 update | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34| pages = 411–414 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkj141|display-authors=etal | pmid=16381900 | pmc=1347503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HPRD also integrates data from [[Human Proteinpedia]], a community portal for integrating human protein data.  The data from HPRD can be freely accessed and used by academic users while commercial entities are required to obtain a license for use. Human Proteinpedia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mathivanan S. | year = 2008| title = Human Proteinpedia enables sharing of human protein data | pmid = 18259167| journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 26| pages = 164–167 | doi=10.1038/nbt0208-164|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; content is freely available for anyone to download and use.

==PhosphoMotif Finder==

PhosphoMotif Finder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Amanchy R. | year = | title = A compendium of curated phosphorylation-based substrate and binding motifs | url = | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 2007 | issue = 25| pages = 285–286 | doi=10.1038/nbt0307-285|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains known kinase/phosphatase substrate as well as binding motifs that are curated from the published literature. It reports the PRESENCE of any literature-derived motif in the query sequence. PhosphoMotif Finder does NOT PREDICT any motifs in the query protein sequence using any algorithm or other computational strategies.

== Comparison of protein data ==

There are other databases that deal with human proteome (e.g. BioGRID, BIND, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, MINT, MIPS, PDZBase and Reactome). Each database has its own style of presenting the data. It is a difficult task for most investigators to compare the voluminous data from these databases in order to conclude strengths and weaknesses of each database. Mathivanan and colleagues &lt;ref name="pmid17254303"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mathivanan S |title=An evaluation of human protein-protein interaction data in the public domain |journal=[[BMC Bioinformatics]] |volume=7 Suppl 5 |issue= |pages=S19 |year=2006 |pmid=17254303 |pmc=1764475 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-7-S5-S19 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/S5/S19 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Periaswamy B |author3=Gandhi TK |display-authors=3 |last4=Kandasamy |first4=Kumaran |last5=Suresh |first5=Shubha |last6=Mohmood |first6=Riaz |last7=Ramachandra |first7=YL |last8=Pandey |first8=Akhilesh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023316/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/S5/S19 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to address this issue while analyzing protein data by asking various questions. This analysis will help biologists to choose among these databases based on their needs.

Reported abuses of human rights in Tibet include restricted [[freedom of religion]], belief, and association. Specifically, Tibetans have faced arbitrary arrest and maltreatment in custody, including torture at the hands of Chinese authorities. [[Media of the People's Republic of China|Freedom of the Press in the PRC]] is still absent, and Tibet's media is tightly controlled by the Chinese leadership,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;Regions and territories: Tibet bbc http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/4152353.stm&lt;/ref&gt; making it difficult to determine accurately the scope of human rights abuses.&lt;ref name=statedept09&gt;US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, ''[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eap/119037.htm#tibet 2008 Human Rights Report: China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau)]'', February 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A series of reports published in the late 1980s claimed that China was forcing Tibetans to adhere to strict birth control programs that included [[forced abortion]]s, [[Forced sterilization|sterilizations]], and even [[infanticide]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein 1991 285–303"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=China's Birth Control Policy in the Tibet Autonomous Region|journal=[[Asian Survey]]|authorlink=Melvyn Goldstein|first=Melvyn|last=Goldstein|first2=Beall|last2=Cynthia|date=March 1991|volume=31|issue=3|pages=285–303|jstor=2645246|doi=10.1525/as.1991.31.3.00p0043x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights in pre-1950 Tibet==

===The social system===
{{Main|Serfdom in Tibet controversy}}
Likewise, to journalist and writer [[Israel Epstein]], a foreign-born Chinese citizen and member of the Chinese communist party, "the old society" in Tibet "had nothing even remotely resembling human rights." He explains:  "High and low, the belief had for centuries been enforced on the Tibetans that everyone's status was predetermined by fate, as a reward for virtues or penalty for faults on one's past incarnations. Hence it was deemed senseless for the rich (even though compassion was abstractly preached) to have qualms about sitting on the necks of the poor, and both criminal and blasphemous for the poor not to patiently bear the yoke. ‘Shangri-La’ the old Tibet was definitely not."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Israel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJYMNghbX0wC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''My China Eye: memoirs of a Jew and a journalist''], Long River Press, 2005, 358 p., p. 277 {{ISBN|1-59265-042-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient form of slavery preceding the development of the feudal system, was still extant in a small number of manors in old Tibet (prior to 1959): the ''nanggzan'' manors (''nanggzan'' meaning "family slave" in Tibetan). In these, according to Chinese sociologist Liu Zhong, "exploitation was not through land-rent but through enslavement" to the manor's owner. In return for working the land, the slaves were provided with lodging, clothing and food, albeit minimal. "Some slaves had their families [with them]  while others did not." This residual form of slavery was finally abolished in Central Tibet in 1959 by the Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region.&lt;ref&gt;Liu Zhong, [http://bic.cass.cn/English/InfoShow/Arcitle_Show_Forum2_Show.asp?ID=260&amp;Title=The%20Humanities%20Study&amp;strNavigation=Home-%3EForum-%3ENationalities&amp;BigClassID=4&amp;SmallClassID=8 On the K'ralpa Manors of Tibet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724021653/http://bic.cass.cn/English/InfoShow/Arcitle_Show_Forum2_Show.asp?ID=260&amp;Title=The%20Humanities%20Study&amp;strNavigation=Home-%3EForum-%3ENationalities&amp;BigClassID=4&amp;SmallClassID=8# |date=2011-07-24 }}, ''The Humanities Study'', 2003-5-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of [[serfdom]] and its applicability to Eastern societies is contested amongst academics. Tibetologist [[Melvyn Goldstein]] wrote in 1971 that "Tibet was characterized by a form of institutionalized inequality that can be called pervasive serfdom".&lt;ref name="Goldstein, 1971, pp. 521-34"&gt;Goldstein, ''Journal of Asian Studies'', May 1971, pp. 521-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However some academics have questioned the applicability of the concept to Tibet, a recent example being Heidi Fjeld who in 2003 argued that [[feudalism]] and the use of the term 'serf' was misleading in relation to the social system of Tibet and instead described it as "a caste-like social hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fjeld|first= Heidi|title=Commoners and Nobles:Hereditary Divisions in Tibet |publisher= Nordic Institute of Asian Studies|year=2003|page=5|isbn=978-87-91114-17-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0V5lV_M-SYC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the political debate concerning the legitimacy of Communist Party rule in the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]], official Chinese sources assert that the Communist invasion was justified in order to end the practice of "feudal serfdom" and other alleged [[human rights]] abuses under the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm|title=100 Questions and Answers About Tibet|publisher=China Tibet Information Center|accessdate=2008-06-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331121008/http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm#|archive-date=2006-03-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan Government in Exile and supporters of the free Tibet movement contend that efforts had been underway in the first half of the 20th century to modernise the country, and argue that human rights abuses under the Communist Party have inflicted greater suffering and repression of the [[Tibetan people]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights by the Tibetan Government in Exile http://tibet.net/en/index.php?id=149&amp;rmenuid=11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Why Tibet? Why Be Concerned? by the Friends of Tibet India http://www.friendsoftibet.org/main/concerns.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimes and punishments===
Trader Gyebo Sherpa was subjected to the severe ''corca'' whipping for selling cigarettes. He died from his wounds 2 days later in the Potala prison.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn C. Goldstein, ''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'', London/Berkeley, University of California Press, 1989, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Tashi Tsering, a self-described critic of traditional Tibetan society, records being whipped as a 13-year-old for missing a performance as a dancer in the Dalai Lama's dance troop in 1942, until the skin split and the pain became excruciating.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Tsering, and Siebenschuh, 1997, pp. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, incidents of mutilation have been recorded in Tibet in the period between the start of the 20th Century and the Chinese occupation. Tibetan communist Phuntso Wangye recalled his anger at seeing freshly severed human ears hanging from the gate of the county headquarters in Damshung north of Lhasa in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Sherap, Siebenschuh 2004 p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The top level Tibetan official [[Lungshar]]'s eyes were gouged out by direct order of the Kashag or Tibetan Government was carried out in 1934.&lt;ref name="GoldHist208"&gt;A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951, Melvyn C. Goldstein pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt was made at anesthetizing the alleged criminal with intoxicants before performing the punishment, which unfortunately did not work well.&lt;ref name="GoldHist208" /&gt;

In 1950, the six Tibetan border guards that had been involved in the killing or wounding of [[Frank Bessac]]'s companions (one of them [[Douglas Mackiernan]]) as they were fleeing into Tibet from the Communist advance, were tried and sentenced to mutilation in Lhasa's military court: "The leader was to have his nose and both ears cut off. The man who fired the first shot was to lose both ears. A third man was to lose one ear, and the others were to get 50 lashes each." (The punishment was subsequently changed to lashings on Bessac's request).&lt;ref&gt;These Tibetans killed an American... and get the lash for it. This was the perilous trek to tragedy by Frank Bessac, as told to James Burke, Time-Life correspondent in New Delhi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ksEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Life''], November 1950, pp. 130-136: "Just before we left Lhasa, I was told that the six border guards had been tried and sentenced in Lhasa's military court. The leader was to have his nose and both ears cut off. The man who fired the first shot was to lose both ears. A third man was to lose one ear, and the others were to get 50 lashes each. (...) Since the Tibetan Buddhists do not believe in capital punishment, mutilation is the stiffest sentence given in Tibet. But I felt that this punishment was too severe, so I asked if it could be lightened. My request was granted. The new sentences were: 200 lashes each for the leader and the man who fired the first shot, 50 lashes for the third man and 25 each for the other.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hostility to Western missions and churches===
Western missionaries, in past centuries, took the perilous and time-consuming journey to Tibet, only to be frustrated by the poor number of native converts, to be expelled from the area, or even to be killed or to die. But at different stages of Tibetan history secular rulers and religious leaders such as the [[Dalai Lama]] have been eager to protect Western [[missionaries]] and their tasks of [[preaching]] [[Christian beliefs]] to the local [[Tibetans]]. The first Western [[missionary]] known to have reached [[Lhasa]] was the [[Jesuit]] Father [[Antonio de Andrade]], accompanied by Fratello Manuel Marques, and their first encounter with the Tibetans was cordial, with the Tibetans greeting Andrade and Marques with friendliness.&lt;ref name="Hsiao-ting Lin"/&gt;

However, Christians endured a number of persecutions in old Tibet. In 1630, the [[Tsaparang]] Jesuit mission in the [[Guge]]  Kingdom (presently the [[Gantok]] district of West Tibet) fell victim to an uprising by dissident local Yellow Hat lamas, led by the king's brother and abetted by the king of [[Ladakh]], against the King who had lavished favours on the alien mission. Many Christian converts were carried off by force to Ladakh as slaves. The church and properties at Tsaparang and [[Rudok]] were sacked, and five resident Jesuits became virtual prisoners of the king of Ladakh who had become the de facto ruler of Guge.
A 1640 effort to reestablish the mission in Guge collapsed when a party of three new priests was attacked as it entered Tibet before reaching Tsaparang and was forced to retreat to India.&lt;ref name="Hsiao-ting Lin"&gt;Hsiao-ting Lin, [http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html ''When Christianity and Lamaism Met: The Changing Fortunes of Early Western Missionaries in Tibet''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715115605/http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html |date=2012-07-15 }}, esp. chapters « Christianity and Tibetan Politics » and « The Fate of Western Missionaries in Tibet ».&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1850 and 1880, after the Qing court's decree allowing Western missionaries to purchase lands and construct churches in Chinese provinces, as many as a dozen lower ranking priests of the Paris Foreign Mission Society were killed or injured during their journeys to missionary outposts in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands. In 1881, Father Brieux, then head of the Paris Foreign Mission Society in [[Batang, Batang County|Batang]] in eastern Tibet, was reported to have been murdered on his way to Lhasa. After proper investigations, Qing officials discovered that the murder cases were covertly supported and even orchestrated by local lamaseries and native chieftains. Feeling threatened by the increasing number of new Christian converts in eastern Tibet, as well as by the imperial decree allowing the missionaries to openly purchase and possess land, the lamaistic monastic communities and their political patrons felt the need to take drastic measures to secure their religious, financial, and political interests.&lt;ref name="Hsiao-ting Lin" /&gt;

In 1904, Qing official Feng Quan sought to curtail the influence of the Gelugpa Sect and ordered the protection of Western missionaries and their churches. Indignation over Feng Quan and the Christian presence escalated to a climax in March 1905, when thousands of the Batang lamas revolted, killing Feng, his entourage, local Manchu and Han Chinese officials, and the local French Catholic priests. The revolt soon spread to other cities in eastern Tibet, such as Chamdo, Litang and Nyarong, and at one point almost spilled over into neighboring Sichuan Province. The missionary stations and churches in these areas were burned and destroyed by the angry Gelugpa monks and local chieftains. Dozens of local Westerners, including at least four priests, were killed or fatally wounded. The scale of the rebellion was so tremendous that only when panicked Qing authorities hurriedly sent 2,000 troops from Sichuan to pacify the mobs did the revolt gradually come to an end. The lamasery authorities and local native chieftains' hostility towards the Western missionaries in Tibet lingered through the last throes of the Manchu dynasty and into the Republican period.&lt;ref&gt;Hsiao-ting Lin, [http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html ''When Christianity and Lamaism Met: The Changing Fortunes of Early Western Missionaries in Tibet''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715115605/http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html |date=2012-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex McKay (ed), ''The History of Tibet'', London: RoutledgeCurzon (2003), p640-1,643 Christian missionaries banned.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hsiao-ting Lin, it was neither 'anti-imperialism' nor 'patriotism' – contrary to what is asserted by the 'standard' Chinese historical narratives – that led the Tibetans to expel the Western missionaries, but "the fact that Tibetan religious and political figures were desperate to prevent any possible intrusion into their local interests and privileges by Christian authorities."&lt;ref name="Hsiao-ting Lin" /&gt;

===Reform===
According to supporters of the Tibetan Government in Exile, in his reforms the 13th Dalai Lama banned capital punishment, making Tibet one of the first countries to do so.&lt;ref name="acme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tibetwrites.org/?Acme-of-Obscenity |title=Acme of Obscenity |accessdate=2010-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704094653/http://www.tibetwrites.org/?Acme-of-Obscenity |archivedate=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tibet.ca"&gt;[http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=2005&amp;m=10&amp;p=11_6 The third World day against Death Penalty, Jean-François Leclere]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La répression est féroce"&gt;Florence Perret, [http://archives.24heures.ch/VQ/LA_COTE/-/article-2008-03-2282/les-manifestations-qui-embrasent-les-regions-tibetaines-prennent-une-ampleur-jamais-vue-explique La répression est féroce]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''24 heures'' (interview with [[Katia Buffetrille]]), 26 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is acknowledged by [[Sir Charles Bell]], a friend of the Dalai Lama's, with the reservation, however, that "the punishment for deliberate murder is usually so severe that the convict can hardly survive for long."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bell, ''Tibet Past and Present'', Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1992, 326 pages, p. 143 (1st published: 1927): "The Dalai informed me that he had not allowed any capital sentence to be inflicted since he assumed power. This no doubt is so, but the punishment for deliberate murder is usually so severe that the convict can hardly survive for long."&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, historian [[Alex C. McKay]] notes that isolated cases of capital punishment did take place in later years, such as the death of one Padma Chandra and the execution of a youth involved in stealing the western Tibetan administrator's horse. McKay also stresses the fact that corporal punishment continued to be inflicted for numerous offences and often proved fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Alex McKay, Introduction, in ''The History of Tibet: the modern period: 1985–1959, the encounter with modernity'', edited by Alex McKay, RoutledgeCurzon, 2003, p. 32: "Note 2: The death penalty was abolished around 1898. Isolated cases of capital punishment did, however, take place in later years; see, for example, M. Goldstein, ''a History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' (London/Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), pp. 126-30 in regard to the death of Padma Chandra. But for an example of a more despotic kind, see Oriental and India Office Collection (hereafter OIOC), L/P&amp;5/7/251, in regard to the execution of a youth involved in stealing the western Tibetan administrator's horse. It must not be forgotten that corporal punishment continued to be inflicted for numerous offences and often proved fatal".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of China invasion===
The [[Kuomintang]]'s [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government supported Muslim [[warlord]] [[Ma Bufang]] when he launched seven expeditions into [[Golog]], causing the deaths of thousands of Tibetans.&lt;ref name="Uradyn Erden Bulag 2002 54"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&amp;dq=ma+bufang+son&amp;q=genocidal#v=snippet&amp;q=ma%20bufang's%20seven%20genocidal%20golog&amp;f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=|page=54|isbn=0-7425-1144-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights in post-1950 Tibet==

===Reforms===
The 14th Dalai Lama's brother [[Jigme Norbu]] reports that, along with these reforms, living conditions in jails were improved, with officials being designated to see that these conditions and rules were maintained."&lt;ref&gt;Jigme Norbu, ''Tibet is My Country'', second edition, 1987, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the reforms that were enacted [[1959 Tibetan uprising|after 1959]], Italian marxist philosopher [[Domenico Losurdo]] sees a chance for the Tibetan populace to access the human rights they were previously denied, besides gaining considerably improved living conditions and a significantly increased average life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Losurdo, ''Fuir l'histoire ? La révolution russe et la révolution chinoise aujourd'hui, Paris:Le temps des cerises'', 2007 : "Les réformes et la révolution ont signifié pour les masses populaires tibétaines un accès aux droits de l'homme auparavant complètement inconnus, une augmentation très forte des conditions de vie et un prolongement sensible de la durée moyenne de la vie."&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts the view of [[Choekyi Gyaltsen]], the 10th Panchen Lama, who criticised the situation in [[Tibet]] with a 70,000 character document that dealt with the brutal suppression of the Tibetan people during and after the [[People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|Chinese invasion of Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savetibet.org/campaigns/pl/10th.php The 10th Panchen Lama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123035502/http://www.savetibet.org/campaigns/pl/10th.php |date=2008-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this document, he criticized the suppression that the Chinese authorities had conducted in retaliation for the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;Hostage of Beijing: The Abduction of the Panchen Lama, Gilles Van Grasdorff, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-86204-561-3}} [[:fr:Pétition en 70 000 caractères]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulties===
According to an Asia Watch Committee report in 1988, the question of human rights in a minority area of the People's Republic of China is inherently difficult to research and address.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Watch Committee, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_aD5n_rgGqkC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=asia+watch+human+rights+in+tibet&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=8XqtS-_eMpDZ-Qbtu9y7Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Human Rights in Tibet"], February 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Official sensitivity around the Tibet issue compounds the problem. Government measures to prevent information about Tibetan protests and protesters from leaving China have hindered human rights monitoring organizations from providing an adequate account of protests and their consequences, according to the CECC.&lt;ref&gt;CECC 2009 report, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the Communist Party that any discussion of the issue by foreigners is "unacceptable interference in China's internal affairs" is itself an obstacle to scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Asia Watch report, p. 1"&gt;Asia Watch report, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government has also linked negative remarks about human rights in Tibet with damage to Sino-American relations. This relates to questions about political prisoners, population transfer, and more, which are "hidden in secrecy," according to the report. Thus, gathering information on such subjects with regard to Tibet is a difficult undertaking.&lt;ref name="Asia Watch report, p. 1"/&gt;

===Types of abuses===
[[File:Drapchi-prison.jpg|thumb|262x262px|An aerial shot of [[Drapchi Prison]] in [[Chengguan District, Lhasa|Lhasa]], which, according to the Central Tibetan Administration, has gained a notorious reputation for its violent treatment of prisoners.]]
Human rights abuses documented in Tibet include the deprivation of life, disappearances, torture, poor prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, denial of fair public trial, denial of freedom of speech and of press and Internet freedoms.&lt;ref name=usstate2009/&gt; They also include political and religious repression,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; forced abortions, sterilisation,&lt;ref name="crin.org"/&gt; and even infanticide.&lt;ref name="Goldstein 1991 285–303"/&gt;

The security apparatus has employed torture and degrading treatment in dealing with some detainees and prisoners, according to the U.S. State Department's 2009 report.&lt;ref name=usstate2009/&gt; Tibetans repatriated from Nepal have also reportedly suffered torture, including electric shocks, exposure to cold, and severe beatings, and been forced to perform heavy physical labor. Prisoners have been subjected routinely to "political investigation" sessions and punished if deemed insufficiently loyal to the state.&lt;ref name=usstate2009/&gt;

====Physical abuses====

Tears of the Lotus: Accounts of Tibetan Resistance to the Chinese Invasion, 1950–1962. Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp;, 1997.

According to a secret PLA document purportedly captured by the guerrillas fighting the Chinese army, 87,000 deaths were recorded in Lhasa between March 1959 and September 1960.&lt;ref name="friendsoftibet.org"/&gt; Regarding this document, Chinese demographer Yan Hao wonders why "it took six years for the PLA document to be captured, and 30 years for it to be published" ("by a Tibetan Buddhist organisation in India in 1990"), adding that it was "highly unlikely that a resistance force could ever exist in Tibet as late as in 1966."&lt;ref&gt;Yan Hao (Institute of Economic Research, State Department of Planning Commission, Peking), [http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/tibetan.population.in.china.pdf Tibetan Population in China: Myths and Facts Re-examined], p. 20, note 21:  "See also the footnote in Warren Smith, Tibetan Nation: A History of Tibetan Nationalism and Sino-Tibetan Relations (Westview Press, Boulder, 1996), p. 451, which claims that the figures reportedly come from a secret 1960 PLA document captured by the Tibetan Resistance in 1966, and were published first by a Tibetan Buddhist organisation in India in 1990. It is said that 87,000 enemies were eliminated in the original document, and Smith believes that `eliminated’ does not necessarily mean killed. However, it is hard to understand why it took 6 years for the PLA document to be captured, and 30 years for it to be published. It is also highly unlikely that a resistance force could ever exist in Tibet as late as in 1966."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[10th Panchen Lama]] said in relation to atrocities by Chinese forces: "If there was a film made on all the atrocities perpetrated in [[Qinghai Province]], it would shock the viewers. In [[Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Golok area]], many people were killed and their dead bodies rolled down the hill into a big ditch. The soldiers told the family members and relatives of the dead people that they should celebrate since the rebels have been wiped out. They were forced to dance on the dead bodies. Soon after, they were also massacred with [[machine guns]]...In [[Amdo]] and [[Kham]], people were subjected to unspeakable atrocities. People were shot in groups of ten or twenty... Such actions have left deep wounds in the minds of the people"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsoftibet.org/main/concerns.html |title=Why Concerned About Tibet? &amp;#124; Friends of Tibet (INDIA) |publisher=Friends of Tibet |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 10, 2008, exiled Tibetan sources have documented that 228 Tibetans have died under the crackdown, 1,294 have been injured, 4,657 arbitrarily detained, 371 sentenced and 990 disappeared. Four Tibetans were executed in Lhasa on 20 October 2009, while the Chinese authorities confirmed only two.&lt;ref name="13UNHRC"&gt;http://www.tibetcustom.com, [http://www.tibetcustom.com/article.php/2010031708590256 "Tibet's human rights issues raised at the 13th session of UN Human Rights Council,"] March 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 11 Tibetans were sentenced to life imprisonment. In the majority of cases the defendants had no independent legal counsel and when a lawyer of choice represented the defendants, the authorities blocked representations either through intimidation or on procedural grounds.&lt;ref name="13UNHRC"/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] have stated that there have been a number of [[detainee]]s in [[prison]]s and [[Youth detention center|detention centres]] in Tibet have "reported to have died in custody, or within weeks of their release, apparently as a result of ill-treatment or lack of [[medical care]] in [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]]."&lt;ref name=aiamnesty&gt;Amnesty International, [http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/un/un8annex2.1.html Amnesty International: "China - Amnesty International's concerns in Tibet"], Secretary-General's Report: Situation in Tibet, E/CN.4/1992/37&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case a Tibetan from Sichuan province, Paltsal Kyab, died five weeks after he had been detained by police in connection with the 2008 protests. His family was not allowed to visit him while he was detained, and received no news until being informed of his death. When claiming his body, family members found it bruised and covered with blister burns; they discovered later that he also had internal injuries, according to Amnesty International. The police told the family that he had died of an illness, though relatives claimed he was healthy when detained.&lt;ref name=amnesty2009/&gt;

In another case a Tibetan, Jamyang Samten, said he was given [[electric shock]]s with a [[cattle prod]], chained to a wall and hit in the stomach by a Chinese guard wearing a metal glove, and if he made a minor mistake in his [[interrogation]], he would be beaten with a chain, saying that "The way the Chinese [[torture]]d was terrifying, they beat us using their full strength. Sometimes they forced us to take off our clothes. We were locked up in a room with our arms and legs handcuffed and they beat us. The chain injured the surface but not the inside of the body. If they hit us with the [[Electric shock baton|electric baton]], our entire body trembled and gradually we were unable to speak." Jamyang Samten was eventually released and [[Tibetans in exile|fled]] to [[Kathmandu]] in Nepal.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;Torture, hunger, mobile sterilisation units ... the brutal reality of Tibet 2008 By CLAUDIA JOSEPH http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-549310/Torture-hunger-mobile-sterilisation-units---brutal-reality-Tibet-2008.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Director Jezza Neumann, who spent three months undercover in Tibet, said that "There are spies everywhere," and that "There are the uniformed police and army, the secret police in their suits and dark glasses and then a spy network of Chinese and Tibetans. It's like the [[Stasi]] in [[East Germany]].&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

====Allegations of physical genocide====
According to Friends of Tibet, an organization that defines itself as a "people's movement for an Independent Tibet", the number of Tibetans killed after the Chinese occupation—a period marked by torture and starvation—now exceeds a million.&lt;ref name="friendsoftibet.org"/&gt; The 14th Dalai Lama has alleged that 1.2&amp;nbsp;million Tibetans were killed under Chinese rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/4152353.stm Regions and territories: Tibet], ''BBC''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book “People who Count” (1995), Dorothy Stein indicates just how the deaths for which the Chinese are held responsible were arrived at by “Tibetan nationalists” (her words): “they are attributed to ‘figures published by the Information Office of the Central Tibetan Secretariat' in India.” "A letter to Tibetan Review by Jampel Senge (April, 1989, p. 22) says 'The census which resulted in the figure of 1.2 was conducted by the Government in Exile through exiled Tibetans who travelled to meet their relations, and through new arrivals from Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Stein, ''People Who Count. Population and Politics, Women and Children'', Earthscan Publications, London, 1995, XI + 239 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of 1.2&amp;nbsp;million dead is challenged by Chinese demographer Yan Hao who says that the methodoloy used by the TGIE is defective. “How can they come to these exact death figures by analysing documents,” he questions, “if they have problems in working out an exact figure of Tibet’s total population alive at present?” “How can they break down the figures by regions” “when they have a problem in clearly defining the boundary of the greater Tibet as well as its provinces?” Yan Hao stresses that “knowledge of statistics tells us that random sampling is necessary for acquiring reliable data in any surveys” and “those conducted entirely among political refugees could produce anything but objective and unbiased results.”&lt;ref&gt;Yan Hao (Institute of Economic Research, State Department of Planning Commission, Beijing), [http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/tibetan.population.in.china.pdf Tibetan Population in China: Myths and Facts Re-examined], pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick French, the former director of Free Tibet Campaign in London, states that there is "no evidence" to support the figure of 1.2&amp;nbsp;million Tibetans killed as a result of Chinese rule.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/opinion/22french.html|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He estimates that as many as half a million Tibetans died from repression and famine under Chinese rule.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick French, ''Tibet, Tibet: A Personal History Of A Lost Land'' (HarperCollins, 2003), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a « Writenet » report prepared for the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] in 2005, Professor [[Colin P. Mackerras]] writes that the claims such as that the Chinese are swamping Tibetans in their own country and that 1.2&amp;nbsp;million Tibetans have died due to Chinese occupation should be treated with the deepest scepticism. The figures show that since the early 1960s, the Tibetan population has been increasing, probably for the first time for centuries. What seems to follow from this is that the TGIE’s allegations of population reduction due to Chinese rule probably have some validity for the 1950s but are greatly exaggerated. However, since the 1960s, Chinese rule has had the effect of increasing the population of the Tibetans, not decreasing it, largely due to a modernization process that has improved the standard of living and lowered infant, maternity and other mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?docid=423ea9094 People’s Republic of China: Background paper on the situation of the Tibetan population], A Writenet Report by Professor Colin P. Mackerras.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay ''[[Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation]]'' published by the [[Library of Tibetan Works and Archives]] at Dharamsala, historian [[Sergius L. Kuzmin]] provided detailed analysis of human losses in Tibet, varying from 3 to 30% population when using different sources&lt;ref&gt;[http://savetibet.ru/img/2010/tibet-book-eng.pdf Kuzmin, S.L. ''Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation''. Dharamsala, LTWA, 2011, pp. 334-345].&lt;/ref&gt; He indicated inadequacy of demography-based results and noted that local-level data was generalized and has only been published by the Tibetan emigrants. He concluded that, according to International Law, actions of Maoists in Tibet can be qualified as genocide, regardless of which of the above estimates of population losses one considers to be credible.

====Allegations of forced abortions, sterilisations and infanticide====
In ''The Making of Modern Tibet'', historian [[A. Tom Grunfeld]] observes that "in the years following the [1960] publication of the LIC's report, the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]], [[Purshottam Trikamdas]] and the ICJ" ([[International Commission of Jurists]]) "all claimed to have found proof of sterilization; yet they failed to produce a single person who could be clinically examined to verify these claims."&lt;ref&gt;A. Tom Grunfeld, ''The Making of Modern Tibet'', 2nd edition, M.E. Sharpe, 1996, 352 p., p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

A demographical survey of Pala – an area located in Western [[Changtang]] about 300 miles north-west of Lhasa – conducted by tibetologist [[Melvyn Goldstein]] brings to light that from 1959 to 1990 large families remained the norm and that no reproductive restraints were imposed on nomadic herders: "Despite repeated claims in the West that the Chinese had imposed a strict policy of birth control in Tibet, where ‘forced abortions, sterilisations and infanticides are everyday occurrences’ ([[New York Times]], 31 January 1992), there was no policy of restricting reproduction in Pala, let alone evidence of forced abortions, sterilisations or infanticide." An analysis of the fertility histories collected from 71 females aged from 15 to 59 provides strong evidence in support of the conclusion that no population control policy restricting couples to 2 or even 3 births was or is operative. Besides, no Pala nomads have ever been fined for any subsequent children, and all such children and their families enjoy full rights in the community&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn C. Goldtein, [http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/tibetanNomads/documents/Goldstein_M.C._Change_Conflict_and_Continuity_Among_A_Community_of_Nomadic_Pastoralists..pdf Change, conflict and continuity among a community of nomadic pastoralists. A case study from Western Tibet], 1950–1990, in ''Resistance and Reform in Tibet'', Robert Barnett and Shirim Akiner eds., 1994, p. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of fertility and family planning in rural Tibet published in 2002, [[Melvyn C. Goldstein]], Ben Jiao, [[Cynthia Beall|Cynthia M. Beall]] and Phuntsog Tsering claim that there was no evidence in any of the sites surveyed that Lhasa was applying a two-child birth rule in rural Tibet. Although a Tibet Information Network report stated this policy was in place, when [[Ngamring]] county, which was cited in the report, was visited, no such policy was evident. The Ngamring county government had striven to increase the use of family planning in the 1990s, but in the summer of 2000 no local nomads or officials in the area of study had heard anything about a two-child limit, nor had any of the officials interviewed at the Ngamring country seat. And finally, no fines had been imposed for fourth and subsequent births. For its authors, "the study highlights the dangers of using refugee reports and anecdotal evidence to interpret highly politicized situations."&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Goldstein, Ben Jiao, C.M. Beall, Phuntsog Tsering, [http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/fertility.and.family.planning.in.rural.tibet.pdf Fertility and Family Planning in Rural Tibet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114084018/http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/fertility.and.family.planning.in.rural.tibet.pdf |date=November 14, 2015 }}, in ''The China Journal'', 2002, Vol. 47, Issue 1, p. 19-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China's Birth Control Policy in the Tibet Autonomous Region - Myths and Realities, Melvyn C. Goldstein and Cynthia M. Beall report that "A series of published reports claim that China was and is compelling Tibetans to adhere to a strict birth control program that includes forced abortions, sterilizations, and even infanticide.&lt;ref name="Goldstein 1991 285–303"/&gt;

In 1992, Paul Ingram, speaking on behalf of an [[NGO]] group for the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] claimed that "Few people or organisations seem willing to admit that the Chinese FORCE [sic] Tibetan women to be sterilised, or to have abortions, or will entertain the perspective that their policy is one of planned [[cultural genocide]] against the Tibetan people, supplemented by an [[Sinicization of Tibet|enormous influx of Chinese settlers]]. Yet there is a great deal of evidence and detailed testimony, which indicates that this has been Chinese policy in Tibet for many years," saying that it was "Nazi-like".&lt;ref&gt;NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child Database of NGO Reports presented to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Genocide in Tibet - Children of Despair - Introduction by Paul Ingram http://www.crin.org/docs/resources/treaties/crc.12/China_CFT2_NGO_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jezza Neumann]], director of ''Undercover in Tibet'' (aired on ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]''), interviewed a Tibetan woman who described her agony at an alleged forced sterilisation operation without [[anaesthetic]], saying that "I was forcibly taken away against my will. I was feeling sick and giddy and couldn't look up. Apparently they cut the [[fallopian tubes]] and stitched them up. It was agonisingly painful. They didn't use [[anaesthetic]]. They just smeared something on my [[stomach]] and carried out the sterilisation. Apart from [[aspirin]] for the [[pain]], there were no other drugs. I was so frightened, I can't even remember how I felt. Some people were even physically damaged by the operation. They have [[limp]]s and have to drag their hips."&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; Unconfirmed reports also suggest mobile sterilisation units are inserting a new type of contraceptive coil into village women that cannot be removed by them.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

====Infringements on freedom of religion====

Tibetans in Tibet state that there are clear limits on their right to practice Buddhism. The most stringently enforced are the ban on public prayers for the [[14th Dalai Lama]]. Also, permission from authorities is required for any large public gathering, Buddhist gatherings not exempted.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Watch report, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, [[Yang Jiechi]], told a press conference in March 2009 that the Dalai Lama is "by no means a religious figure but a political figure."&lt;ref name="CECC31"&gt;CECC Tibet paper, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Xinhua]]'', quoting a [[Tibetologist]], echoed this theme, referring to the Dalai Lama's efforts in establishing a [[government in exile]], establishing a Constitution, and other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/04/content_8096455.htm|title=Tibetologist: 14th Dalai Lama political figure bent on "Tibet independence"|date=2008-05-04|accessdate=2010-08-23|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ending the "Dalai clique"'s use of [[monasteries]] for subversion against the state is a core part of the campaign that promotes the CCP's “stability and harmony in the religious field”.&lt;ref name="CECC31"/&gt; The state supervisory organ for Buddhism, the [[Buddhist Association of China]], changed their charter in 2009 to denounce the Dalai Lama for agitating for Tibetan independence.&lt;ref name=CECC32&gt;CECC Tibet paper, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central People's Government]] has asserted a right to approve the next Dalai Lama, according to "historical conventions" used in the [[Qing Dynasty]] since 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/12/content_11000802.htm|title=Tibetan official: Dalai Lama's reincarnation needs nod from central gov't|date=2009-03-12|accessdate=2010-08-24|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|location=[[Beijing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy]] (TCHRD) reported instances of "patriotic education" in 2005, from the testimony of "young Tibetan monks who escaped from Tibet". In them, monks were given political literature and a script to recite to County Religious Bureau officials when they were due to visit. They were instructed to practice denouncing the Dalai Lama as a "[[separatist]]" and to pledge allegiance to China, and were quizzed on the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tchrd.org/publications/hr_updates/2005/hr200509.html#campaign|title=China recommences "patriotic education" campaign in Tibet’s monastic institutions|work=Human Rights Update and Archives|publisher=[[Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy]]|date=September 2005|accessdate=2010-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227112006/http://www.tchrd.org/publications/hr_updates/2005/hr200509.html#campaign#campaign|archive-date=2012-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials also extolled the monks to accept the legitimacy of [[Gyaincain Norbu]], the government choice for [[11th Panchen Lama]].&lt;ref name=CECC33-34&gt;CECC Tibet paper, p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China|CECC]], educational, legal, and propaganda channels are used to pressure [[Tibetan Buddhists]] to change their religious beliefs into a doctrine that promotes government positions and policy. This has resulted instead in continuing Tibetan demands for freedom of religion and the Dalai Lama’s return to Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;CECC Tibet paper, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, a monastic official who also holds the vice chairmanship of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|CPPCC]] for Tibet, told monks at [[Galden Jampaling Monastery]] in [[Qamdo Prefecture|Qamdo]] that their freedom of religion was a result of the Party's benevolence.&lt;ref name=CECC33-34/&gt; The TCHRD has claimed that Chinese authorities in 2003 threatened residents of a Tibetan-inhabited county with [[Confiscation|expropriation]] if they did not hand over portraits of the Dalai Lama within a month.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, "Anti-Dalai Lama Campaign intensifies in Kardze and Lithang County", 14 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCP further increased its influence over the teaching and practice of Tibetan Buddhism in 2009, including intensifying a media campaign to discredit the Dalai Lama as a religious leader and preventing Tibetans from respecting him as such. Chinese official statements also indicated that the government would select a successor to the [[Dalai Lama]], currently aged 74, when he passes away. Tibetans are expected to "embrace such a development."&lt;ref name=cecctibet&gt;Congressional-Executive Committee on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/tibet/tibet_2008-2009.pdf Tibet Special Report 2008-2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106015954/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/tibet/tibet_2008-2009.pdf |date=2010-01-06 }}, October 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===='Reshaping' Tibetan Buddhism====
In February 2009 The “Tibet Branch” of the Buddhist Association of China changed their charter to pressure Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns to treat the Dalai Lama as a "de facto criminal" and threat to Tibetan Buddhism, according to a report in China’s state-controlled media. The revised charter urged monks and nuns to “see clearly that the 14th Dalai Lama is the ringleader of the separatist political association which seeks ‘Tibet independence,’ a loyal tool of anti-China Western forces, the very root that causes social unrest in Tibet and the biggest obstacle for Tibetan Buddhism to build up its order.”&lt;ref name=CECC32&gt;CECC Tibet paper, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The CECC argues that incorporating language classifying the Dalai Lama as a “separatist” into the charter of a government-designated religious organization increases the risk of punishment for monks and nuns who maintain religious devotion to the Dalai Lama even if they do not engage in overt political activity.&lt;ref name=CECC32/&gt;

On March 10, 2010, the Dalai Lama stated that "the Chinese authorities are conducting various political campaigns, including patriotic re-education campaign, in many monasteries in Tibet. They are putting the monks and nuns in prison-like conditions, depriving them the opportunity to study and practice in peace. These conditions make the monasteries function more like museums and are intended to deliberately annihilate Buddhism."&lt;ref name="13UNHRC"/&gt;

The CCP continued to state that Chinese policies in Tibetan areas are a success, and in 2008 and 2009 took a stance of pressuring other governments to abandon support of the Dalai Lama and instead to support the Party line on Tibetan issues.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional-Executive Committee on China, Annual report, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]]'s advocacy on behalf of the Tibetan people and culture is used in official propaganda to argue that he is not a legitimate religious leader, but a political actor.&lt;ref name="CECC31"&gt;CECC Tibet paper, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Ending the Dalai Lama’s role as supreme religious leader is a core part of the campaign that promotes the CCP's “stability” and “harmony” in the Tibetan areas of China.&lt;ref name="CECC31"/&gt; This was carried out by state-run media and senior government officials. Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi, for example, told a press conference in March 2009 that the Dalai Lama is “by no means a religious figure but a political figure.”&lt;ref name="CECC31"/&gt;

The official response to continued criticism of CCP policy from Tibetans includes "aggressive campaigns" of “patriotic education” (“love the country, love religion”) and legal education. Patriotic education sessions require monks and nuns to pass examinations on political texts, affirm that "Tibet is historically a part of China," accept the legitimacy of the Panchen Lama installed by the Chinese government, and denounce the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="CECC33-34"/&gt;

In June 2009, a monastic official who also holds the rank of Vice Chairman of the TAR Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) spoke to monks at Jampaling (Qiangbalin) Monastery in Changdu (Chamdo) prefecture, TAR, and emphasized the dependency of “freedom of religion” on Party control and patriotism toward China. “Without the Party’s regulations,” he told the monks, “there would be no freedom of religion for the masses. To love religion, you must first love your country.”&lt;ref name=CECC33-34/&gt;

According to the CECC, Chinese officials justify such campaigns as "legitimate and necessary" by seeking to characterize and conflate a range of Tibetan objections to state policy as threats to China’s unity and stability.&lt;ref name=CECC33-34/&gt; An example given to substantiate this is comments made by Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) Party Secretary Zhang Qingli and Vice Minister of Public Security [[Zhang Xinfeng]], speaking during a February 2009 teleconference on “the work of maintaining social stability.”&lt;ref name=CECC33-34/&gt; They called for “large numbers of party, government, military, and police personnel in Tibet to immediately go into action” and “resolutely smash the savage attacks by the Dalai clique and firmly win the current people’s war against separatism and for stability.” Principal speakers at the teleconference stressed the importance of "education campaigns" in achieving such objectives.&lt;ref name=CECC33-34/&gt;

A Tibetan activist group reported that Chinese authorities in Kardze County and Lithang County in Kardze Tibet Autonomous Prefecture ("TAP"), Sichuan Province, as part of the anti-Dalai Lama campaign, threatened the local populace with confiscation of their land if they do not hand over portraits of the Dalai Lama within a month.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Writing in 2005, jurist Barry Sautman asserts that the ban on the public display of photos of the 14th Dalai Lama began in 1996 in the TAR but is not enforced in the Tibetan areas of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Sautman, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/2272481/Tibet-Research China's strategic vulnerability to minority separatism in Tibet], in ''Asian Affairs: An American Review'', 32, 2 (Summer 2005), 87 (32): "the ban on public display of Dalai Lama photos in the TAR [...] began in 1996. The ban is not enforced in Tibetan areas of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan, however."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence===
In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Tension between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule in Qinghai such as [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]]. In the past riots have broken out between Muslims and Tibetans. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims.&lt;ref name="Demick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China |last=Demick |first=Barbara |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |date=23 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013126/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |archivedate=June 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking [[Kache]] minority of Muslims).&lt;ref name="Mayaram 2009 75"&gt;{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| accessdate = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 0-415-99194-3| page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repercussions of 2008 unrest===
{{Main|2008 Tibetan unrest}}

In March 2008, what began as routine monastic commemorations of [[Tibetan Uprising Day]] descended into riots, beatings, and arson by Tibetans against [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Hui people|Hui]], and even other Tibetans, killing 18 civilians and 1 police officer.&lt;ref name=usstate2009/&gt; Casualties sustained during the subsequent police crackdown are unknown, according to the U.S. Department of State.&lt;ref name=usstate2009/&gt; Many members of the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP) remained in communities across the [[Tibetan Plateau]] during the year, and the fallout from the protests continued to impact on human rights outcomes for Tibetan people.&lt;ref name=usstate2009/&gt;

According to numerous sources, the U.S. Department of State says, many detained after the riots were subject to extrajudicial punishments such as severe beatings and deprivation of food, water, and sleep for long periods.&lt;ref name=usstate2009/&gt; In some cases detainees sustained broken bones and other serious injuries at the hands of PAP and Public Security Bureau (PSB) officers. According to eyewitnesses, the bodies of persons killed during the unrest or subsequent interrogation were disposed of secretly rather than returned to their families.&lt;ref name=usstate2009/&gt; Many monasteries and nunneries remained under virtual lock-down, while the authorities renewed the “Patriotic Education” campaign, according to Amnesty International, involving written denunciations against the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name=amnesty2009&gt;Amnesty International, [http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/asia-pacific/china International report 2009 on China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204221017/http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/asia-pacific/china |date=2009-12-04 }}, no publish date given.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan members of the CCP were also targeted, including being forced to remove their children from Tibet exile community schools where they obtain religious education.&lt;ref name=amnesty2009/&gt; In March 2010 as many as 50 Tibetans were arrested for sending reports, photos, and video abroad during the unrest, according to [[Reporters Without Borders]] (RSF). One individual received a 10-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Michael J., "Fifty Tibetans allegedly caught over info leaks," Taipei Times, Wednesday, March 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Chinese government and Communist Party interference with the norms of Tibetan Buddhism, and "unremitting antagonism toward the Dalai Lama," that were key factors behind the protests, according to a special report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China.&lt;ref name=cecctibet/&gt;

Many members of the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP) remained in communities across the [[Tibetan Plateau]] during the year, and the fallout from the protests continued to impact on human rights outcomes for Tibetan people.&lt;ref name=usstate2009/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] was "deeply concerned at the human rights violations" that occurred during these events and called on the [[Human Rights Council]] to address the human rights situation during the 2008 unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Our statement to UN Human Rights Council regarding Tibet https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/11342/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verifiabilty of exile pronouncements===
{{Disputed section|date=February 2011}}
Psychologist and writer [[Colin Goldner]]&lt;ref&gt;Colin Goldner is director of the Forum of Critical Psychology in Munich and author of ''Dalai Lama: Fall eines Gottkönigs'' (''Dalai Lama: The Fall of the God King''), Alibri Verlag, 2005, 733 p.&lt;/ref&gt; alleges that although human rights abuses carried out by the [[People's Liberation Army]], especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]], cannot be justified, the pronouncements of Tibetan exiles cannot be trusted, because "These are, if not totally invented out of thin air, as a rule hopelessly exaggerated and/or refer to no longer actual happenings. The contention of the [[Central Tibetan Administration|Dalai Lama's exiled government]] that 'the daily life of the Tibetans in their own land' are dictated by 'torture, mental terror, discrimination and a total disrespect for of human dignity' is pure propaganda meant to collect sympathy points or monetary contributions; such accusations do not reflect today's realities in Tibet. Likewise, the accusations of forced abortions and blanket area sterilizations of Tibetan women, of a flooding of the land by Chinese colonists, of systematic destruction of the Tibetan cultural heritage do not agree with the facts."&lt;ref&gt;Colin Goldner, [http://www.eunacom.net/DalaiLama_E.htm The Myth of Tibet. How a dictatorial regime of monks is romantically transfigured], translation into English of a German article published in the EUNACOM website under the title ''Mythos Tibet'' [# 49/1999, pp. 14-15].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] have stated that there have been "consistent reports", including "testimonies by former detainees and relatives of detainees who left Tibet illegally" that indicated that people held in police stations and detainees in prisons and detention centres in Tibet have been "systematically tortured and ill-treated."&lt;ref name=aiamnesty&gt;Amnesty International, [http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/un/un8annex2.1.html Amnesty International: "China - Amnesty International's concerns in Tibet"], Secretary-General's Report: Situation in Tibet, E/CN.4/1992/37&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] stated that "allegations of torture were numerous and mutually corroborative: torture did not seem like an isolated phenomenon." China's report on its implementation of the Convention Against Torture did not address these allegations that torture had occurred in Tibet, with many of the questions the members of the Committee Against Torture had relating to this towards China "remained largely unanswered".&lt;ref name=aiamnesty&gt;Amnesty International, [http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/un/un8annex2.1.html Amnesty International: "China - Amnesty International's concerns in Tibet"], Secretary-General's Report: Situation in Tibet, E/CN.4/1992/37&lt;/ref&gt;

American sinologist [[Allen Carlson]] is of the opinion that it is nearly impossible, without substantial field research in Tibet, to verify the numerous allegations of violations advanced by China critics. He does, however, state, "my analysis of Beijing’s policies and practices has left me with the impression that the Chinese leadership has no reservations about using whatever means necessary to secure Chinese rule over Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;Allen Carlson, ''[http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS004.pdf Beijing's Tibet Policy: Securing Sovereignty and Legitimacy]'', Policy Studies 4, East-West Center, Washington, 71 p., p. 25 : "Without substantial field research in Tibet, it is nearly impossible to verify the numerous allegations of violations advanced by China critics."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/unrest-tibet-continues-human-rights-violations-escalate-20090310 |title=Unrest in Tibet continues as human rights violations escalate &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Chinese authorities have turned down as “inconvenient” requests for visits to the TAR by several UN human rights experts."

===Reported sentencings of Tibetans in Chinese courts===

Tibetans are often punished by Chinese authorities for activities that would not be considered crimes under international law, such as exercising their freedom of speech.

'''The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens''' (or '''The Huntington'''&lt;ref&gt;''The common appellation of ''The Huntington'' may also refer to the [[Huntington Hospital]].''&lt;/ref&gt;) is a collections-based educational and research institution established by [[Henry E. Huntington]] (1850–1927) and located in [[Los Angeles County]] in [[San Marino, California]]. In addition to the library, the institution houses an extensive art collection with a focus in 18th- and 19th-century [[European art|European]] art and 17th- to mid-20th-century [[American art]]. The property also includes approximately 120 acres of specialized botanical landscaped gardens, most notably the "Japanese Garden", the "Desert Garden", and the "Chinese Garden" (Liu Fang Yuan).

==History==
As a landowner, businessman and visionary, [[Henry Edwards Huntington]] (1850–1927), played a major role in the growth of [[southern California]]. Huntington was born in 1850, in [[Oneonta, New York]], and was the nephew and heir of [[Collis P. Huntington]] (1821–1900), one of the famous [[Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|"Big Four"]] railroad tycoons of 19th century [[History of California|California history]]. In 1892, Huntington relocated to [[San Francisco]] with his first wife, Mary Alice Prentice, and their four children. He divorced Mary Alice Prentice in 1906, and in 1913, married his uncle's widow, [[Arabella Huntington]] (1851–1924), relocating from the financial and political center of northern California, [[San Francisco]], to the state's newer southern major metropolis, [[Los Angeles]]. He purchased a property of more than 500 acres that was then known as the "[[San Marino Ranch]]", and went on to purchase other large tracts of land in the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[Los Angeles]] areas of [[Los Angeles County]] for urban and suburban development. As president of the [[Pacific Electric Railway Company]], the regional [[streetcar]]/public transit system for the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area and [[southern California]] and also of the [[Southern California Railway|Los Angeles Railway Company]], (later the [[Southern California Railway]]), he spearheaded urban and regional transportation efforts to link together far-flung communities, supporting growth of those communities as well as promoting commerce, recreation, and tourism. He was one of the founders of the [[San Marino, California|City of San Marino]], incorporated in 1913.

Huntington's interest in art was influenced in large part by his second wife, [[Arabella Huntington]] (1851–1924), and with art experts to guide him, he benefited from a post-[[World War I]] European market that was "ready to sell almost anything". Before his death in 1927, Huntington amassed "far and away the greatest group of [[Art of the United Kingdom|18th-century British portraits]] ever assembled by any one man". In accordance with Huntington's will, the collection, then worth $50 million, was opened to the public in 1928.&lt;ref name="life1938012433"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=life%20magazine%20jan%2024%201938&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;f=true | title=$50,000,000 Huntington Collection was Amassed by One Man in 17 Years | work=Life | date=1938-01-24 | accessdate=November 24, 2011 | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 1985, a fire erupted in an elevator shaft of the Huntington Art Gallery and destroyed [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]]'s 1777 portrait of [[Edwin Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood|Mrs. Edwin Lascelles]]. After a year-long, $1 million refurbishing project, the Huntington Gallery reopened in 1986, with its artworks cleaned of soot and stains. Most of the funds for the cleanup and refurbishing of the Georgian mansion and its artworks came from donations from the Michael J. Connell Foundation, corporations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Management==

===Library===
The library building was designed in 1920, by the southern California architect [[Myron Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cityofpasadena.libanswers.com/a.php?qid=73881|title=What buildings did Myron Hunt design?|access-date=2014-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224514/http://cityofpasadena.libanswers.com/a.php?qid=73881|archive-date=2014-02-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] style. Hunt's previous commissions for Mr. and Mrs. Huntington included the Huntington's residence in [[San Marino, California|San Marino]] in 1909, and the [[The Langham Huntington, Pasadena|Huntington Hotel]] in 1914. The library contains a substantial collection of rare books and manuscripts, concentrated in the fields of British and American history, literature, art, and the history of science. Spanning from the 11th century to the present, the library's holdings contain 7 million items, over 400,000 rare books, and over a million photographs, prints, and other [[ephemera]]. Highlights include one of eleven vellum copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] known to exist, the [[Ellesmere manuscript]] of [[Chaucer]] ca. 1410, and letters and manuscripts by [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]]. It is the only library in the world with the first two quartos of ''[[Hamlet]]''; it holds the manuscript of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s autobiography, Isaac Newton′s personal copy of his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' with annotations in Newton′s own hand, the first seven drafts of [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'', [[John James Audubon]]'s ''[[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'', and first editions and manuscripts from authors such as [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Jack London]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[William Blake]], [[Mark Twain]], and [[William Wordsworth]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Huntington Library ''In Fact'', 2012–2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library's Main Exhibition Hall showcases some of the most outstanding rare books and manuscripts in the collection, while the West Hall of the Library hosts rotating exhibitions. The Dibner Hall of the History of Science is a permanent exhibition on the history of science with a focus on astronomy, natural history, medicine, and light.

With the 2006 acquisition of the [[Burndy Library]], a collection of nearly 60,000 items, the Huntington became one of the top institutions in the world for the study of the [[history of science and technology]].

====Research====
Use of the collection for research is restricted to qualified scholars, generally requiring a doctoral degree or at least candidacy for the PhD, and two letters of recommendation from known scholars. Through a rigorous peer-review program, the institution awards approximately 150 grants to scholars in the fields of history, literature, art, and the history of science. The Huntington also hosts numerous scholarly events, lectures, conferences, and workshops.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In September 1991, then-director William A. Moffett announced that the library's photographic archive of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] would be available to all qualified scholars, not just those approved by the international team of editors that had so long limited access to a chosen few. The collection consists of 3,000 photographs of all the original scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John Noble|last=Wilford|date=September 22, 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/22/us/monopoly-over-dead-sea-scrolls-is-ended.html|title=Monopoly Over Dead Sea Scrolls Is Ended|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|access-date=2017-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822120602/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/22/us/monopoly-over-dead-sea-scrolls-is-ended.html|archive-date=2017-08-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John Noble|last=Wilford|date=February 22, 1995|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/obituaries/william-a-moffett-62-is-dead-opened-door-to-dead-sea-scrolls.html|title=William A.

Through a partnership with the [[University of Southern California]], The Huntington has established two research centers: the [[USC-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute]] and the [[Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West]].

===Art collections===
The Huntington's collections are displayed in permanent installations housed in the Huntington Art Gallery and Virginia Steele Scott Gallery of American Art. Special temporary exhibitions are mounted in the MaryLou and George Boone Gallery, with smaller, focused exhibitions displayed in the Works on Paper Room in the Huntington Art Gallery and the Susan and Stephen Chandler Wing of the Scott Galleries. In addition the gallery also hosts different exhibitions of photography throughout the year including those about different social and political subjects.

====European art====
[[File:The Blue Boy.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Blue Boy]]'' by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], c.&amp;nbsp;1770]]
[[File:Pinkie detailed.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Pinkie (Lawrence painting)|Pinkie]]'' by [[Thomas Lawrence]], c.&amp;nbsp;1794]]
The European collection, consisting largely of 18th- and 19th-century British &amp; French paintings, sculptures and decorative arts, is housed in The Huntington Art Gallery, the original Huntington residence. The permanent installation also includes selections from the Arabella D. Huntington Memorial Art Collection, which contains Italian and Northern Renaissance paintings and a spectacular collection of 18th-century French tapestries, porcelain, and furniture. Some of the best known works in the European collection include ''[[The Blue Boy]]'' by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], ''[[Pinkie (Lawrence painting)|Pinkie]]'' by [[Thomas Lawrence]], and ''[[Madonna and Child]]'' by [[Rogier van der Weyden]].

====American art====
Complementing the European collections is the Huntington's American art holdings, a collection of paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, and photographs dating from the 17th to the mid-20th century. The institution did not begin collecting American art until 1979, when it received a gift of 50 paintings from the Virginia Steele Scott Foundation. Consequently, The Virginia Steele Scott Gallery of American Art was established in 1984. In 2009, the Virginia Steele Scott Galleries were expanded, refurbished, and reinstalled. The new showcase, a $1.6 million project designed to give the Huntington's growing American art collection more space and visibility, combines the original, 1984 American gallery with the Lois and Robert F. Erburu Gallery, a modern classical addition designed by Los Angeles architect [[Frederick Fisher (architect)|Frederick Fisher]].&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (May 30, 2009), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-huntington30-2009may30,0,1251148.story American art gets a higher profile in U.S. museums] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205153731/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-huntington30-2009may30,0,1251148.story |date=2012-12-05 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights among the American art collections include ''Breakfast in Bed'' by [[Mary Cassatt]], ''The Long Leg'' by [[Edward Hopper]], ''Small Crushed Campbell's Soup Can (Beef Noodle)'' by [[Andy Warhol]], and ''Global Loft (Spread)'' by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. As of 2014, the collection numbers some 12,000 works, ninety percent of them drawings, photographs and prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Christopher|last=Knight|date=July 19, 2014|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ca-knight-huntington-review-20140720-column.html|title=Huntington's new gallery rooms show promise|newspaper=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|access-date=2014-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720133345/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ca-knight-huntington-review-20140720-column.html|archive-date=2014-07-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the library acquired the [[Millard Sheets]] mural ''Southern California landscape'' (1934), the dining room wall painting originally painted for homeowners Fred H. and Bessie Ranke in the [[Hollywood Hills]] of [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Wada, [http://www.laobserved.com/intell/2014/11/millard_sheets_mural_moving_to.php Millard Sheets mural moving to the Huntington] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105182800/http://www.laobserved.com/intell/2014/11/millard_sheets_mural_moving_to.php |date=2014-11-05 }}, LA Observed, November 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acquisitions====

In 1999, the Huntington acquired the collection of materials relating to Arts and Crafts artist and designer [[William Morris]] amassed by Sanford and Helen Berger, comprising stained glass, wallpaper, textiles, embroidery, drawings, ceramics, more than 2,000 books, original woodblock prints, and the complete archives of Morris's decorative arts firm [[Morris &amp; Co.]] and its predecessor [[Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.]] These materials formed the foundation for the 2002 exhibit "William Morris: Creating the Useful and the Beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080416232041/http://www.huntington.org/ArtDiv/morris.html Huntington Library; "William Morris: Creating the Useful and the Beautiful"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, actor [[Steve Martin]] gave $1 million to the Huntington to support exhibitions and acquisitions of American art, with three-quarters of the money to be spent on exhibitions and the rest on purchases of artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Muchnic (February 8, 2005), [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/08/entertainment/et-quick8.4 Huntington gets arts endowment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016103115/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/08/entertainment/et-quick8.4 |date=2012-10-16 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Andy Warhol]]'s painting ''Small Crushed Campbell's Soup Can (Beef Noodle)'' (1962) as well as group of the artist's ''Brillo Boxes'' were donated by the estate of Robert Shapazian, the founding director of [[Gagosian Gallery]] in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=8506 Pop Art Comes to The Huntington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021082231/http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary.aspx?id=8506 |date=2011-10-21 }} The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a $1.75 million acquisition fund for post-1945 American art was established by unidentified patrons in honor of the late Shapazian. The first purchase from the fund was the painting ''Global Loft (Spread)'' (1979) by [[Robert Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Jori Finkel (June 7, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-huntington-buys-a-rauschenberg-spread-painting-20120607,0,1128813.story Huntington buys a Robert Rauschenberg Spread painting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611143130/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-huntington-buys-a-rauschenberg-spread-painting-20120607,0,1128813.story |date=2012-06-11 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the museum acquired its first major work by an African-American artist when it purchased a 22-foot-long carved redwood panel from 1937 by sculptor [[Sargent Claude Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Carol Pogash, (February 20, 2012).

===Botanical gardens===
[[File:HuntingtonCorpseFlower2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Amorphophallus titanum]] at Huntington Library, August 24, 2014]]
The Huntington's [[botanical garden]]s cover {{convert|120|acre|ha}} and showcase plants from around the world. The gardens are divided into more than a dozen themes, including the Australian Garden, Camellia Collection, Children's Garden, [[Huntington Desert Garden|Desert Garden]], Herb Garden, [[Japanese Garden]], Lily Ponds, North Vista, Palm Garden, [[Rose garden|Rose Garden]], the [[Shakespeare Garden]], Subtropical and Jungle Garden, and the [[Chinese Garden]] (Liu Fang Yuan 流芳園 or the Garden of Flowing Fragrance).

The Rose Hills Foundation Conservatory for Botanical Science has a large tropical plant collection, as well as a [[carnivorous plant]]s wing. The Huntington has a program to protect and propagate endangered plant species. In 1999, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2014, and 2018, specimens of ''[[Titan arum|Amorphophallus titanum]]'', or the odiferous "corpse flower", bloomed at the facility.

The Camellia Collection, recognized as an International Camellia Garden of Excellence, includes nearly eighty different [[camellia]] species and some 1,200 cultivated varieties, many of them rare and historic. The Rose Garden contains approximately 1,200 [[cultivars]] (4,000 individual plants) arranged historically to trace the development of roses from ancient to modern times.

====Chinese Garden (Liu Fang Yuan 流芳園)====
[[File:Huntington Library Chinese garden.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese Garden Liu Fang Yuan 流芳園 (the Garden of Flowing Fragrance)]]
A [[Chinese garden]], the largest outside of China,&lt;ref name="reimagined"&gt;{{cite news|first=Edward|last=Rothstein|date=December 20, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/arts/design/the-library-re-imagined-at-the-huntington.html|title=A Treasure House of Shifting Aspirations: 'The Library Re-Imagined,' at the Huntington|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|access-date=2017-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121104337/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/arts/design/the-library-re-imagined-at-the-huntington.html|archive-date=2016-11-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated on February 26, 2008 after artisans from [[Suzhou|Suzhou, China]] spent some six months at Huntington to construct the first phase of the newest facility. On 12 acres at the northwest corner of the Huntington, the garden features man-made lakes ("Pond of Reflected Greenery" and "Lake of Reflected Fragrance") with pavilions connected by bridges. Unique Chinese names are assigned to many of the facilities in the garden, such as the [[tea house]], known as the "Hall of the Jade Camellia". Other pavilions are the "Love for the Lotus Pavilion", "Terrace of the Jade Mirror", and "Pavilion of the Three Friends". The initial phase cost $18.3 million to build.

The second phase, which includes the "Clear and Transcendent Pavilion (Qing Yue Tai 清越臺)", "Lingering Clouds Peak (Liu Yun Xiu 留雲岫)" (with a waterfall), "Waveless Boat (Bu Bo Xiao Ting 不波小艇)", "Crossing through Fragrance" bridge and the "Cloud Steps" bridge, opened on March 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://huntington.org/WebAssets/Templates/content.aspx?id=15363#images New Section of The Huntington's Chinese Garden Debuts as Phase II Takes Shape] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304190436/http://huntington.org/WebAssets/Templates/content.aspx?id=15363#images |date=2014-03-04 }}, The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, February 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; There are other pavilions, including the "Flowery Brush Studio", and structures planned for phase two. A place to display its large collections of [[penjing]] and [[bonsai]] is another project to be completed.

====Desert Garden====
[[File:Desert garden.JPG|thumb|left|Desert Garden]]
The [[Huntington Desert Garden|Desert Garden]], one of the world's largest and oldest outdoor collections of [[cacti]] and other [[succulents]], contains plants from extreme environments, many of which were acquired by Henry E. Huntington and William Hertrich (the garden curator). One of the Huntington's most botanically important gardens, the Desert Garden, brings together a plant group largely unknown and unappreciated in the beginning of the 1900s. Containing a broad category of [[xerophyte]]s ([[arid]]ity-adapted plants), the [[Desert]] Garden grew to preeminence and remains today among the world's finest, with more than 5,000 species.

====Japanese Garden====
[[File:Japanese Garden by slonecker.jpg|thumb|right|The Japanese Garden bridge]]
The garden was completed in 1912 and opened to the public in 1928. It features the [[Moon bridge|drum or moon bridge]], a large bell, the authentic ceremonial teahouse Seifu-an (the Arbor of Pure Breeze), a fully furnished Japanese house, [[koi]]-filled ponds, the Zen Garden, and the bonsai collections with hundreds of trees. The Bonsai Courts at the Huntington is the home of the Golden State [[Bonsai]] Federation Southern Collection. Another ancient Japanese art form can be found at the Harry Hirao [[Suiseki]] Court, where visitors can touch the suiseki or viewing stones.

'''Image and Scanner Interface Specification''' ('''ISIS''') is an industry standard interface for [[image scanner|image scanning]] technologies, developed by Pixel Translations in 1990 (which became [[EMC Corporation]]'s [[Captiva Software]] and later acquired by [[OpenText]]).

ISIS is an open standard for scanner control and a complete image-processing framework. It is currently supported by a number of application and scanner vendors.

==Functions==
The modular design allows the scanner to be accessed both directly or with built-in routines to handle most situations automatically.

A message-based interface with [[Tag (metadata)|tags]] is used so that features, operations, and formats not yet supported by ISIS can be added as desired without waiting for a new version of the specification.

The standard addresses all of the issues that an application using a scanner needs to be concerned with. Functions include but are not limited to selecting, installing, and configuring a new scanner; setting scanner-specific parameters; scanning, reading and writing files, and fast [[image scaling]], rotating, displaying, and printing. Drivers have been written to dynamically process data for operations such as converting grayscale to binary image data.

An ISIS interface can run scanners at or above their rated speed by linking drivers together in a pipe so that data flows from a scanner driver to compression driver, to packaging driver, to a file, viewer, or printer in a continuous stream, usually without the need to buffer more than a small portion of the full image. As a result of using the piping method, each driver can be optimised to perform one function well. Drivers are typically small and modular in order to make it simple to add new functionality to an existing application.

The country in which a [[motor vehicle]]'s [[vehicle registration plate]] was issued may be indicated by an '''international licence plate country code''', formerly known as an '''International Registration Letter'''&lt;ref&gt;See Georgano, G. N. and Andersen, Thorkil Ry; ''The New encyclopedia of motorcars, 1885 to the present''; p. 18 {{ISBN|0525932542}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''International Circulation Mark.'''&lt;ref&gt;See Harding, Anthony and Bird, Anthony; ''Guinness Book of Car Facts and Feats: A Record of Everyday Motoring and Automotive Achievements''; p. 243. {{ISBN|0851122078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. The sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate, or be incorporated into the [[vehicle registration plate]].

The allocation of codes is maintained by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] as the ''Distinguishing Signs Used on Vehicles in International Traffic''&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/conventn/Distsigns.pdf ''Distinguishing Signs Used on Vehicles in International Traffic''], 15 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes abbreviated to DSIT), authorised by the UN's [[Geneva Convention on Road Traffic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention of Road Traffic signed at Geneva September, 19 1949 - Annex 4.

Many vehicle codes created since the adoption of [[ISO 3166]] coincide with ISO two- or three-letter codes.

The 2004 South-East Asian ''Agreement&amp;nbsp;... for the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People'' uses a mixture of ISO and DSIT codes: Myanmar uses MYA, China CHN, and Cambodia KH (ISO codes), Thailand uses T (DSIT code), Laos LAO, and Vietnam VN (coincident ISO and DSIT codes).&lt;ref name="Annex2_2004"&gt;[http://www1.mt.gov.vn/hotrovantai/uploads/2006/E_annex_2.pdf ''Agreement between and among the Governments of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Union of Myanmar, the Kingdom of Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People, Annex 2: Registration of Vehicles in International Traffic'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071234/http://www1.mt.gov.vn/hotrovantai/uploads/2006/E_annex_2.pdf |date=March 4, 2012 }}, 2004 (also here {{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Others/GMS-Agreement/annex2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607012937/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Others/GMS-Agreement/annex2.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }} and here {{cite web|url=http://www.news.mot.go.th/iba_website/fileupload/Annex2_Registration%20of%20Vehicles%20in%20International%20Traffic.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731055859/http://www.news.mot.go.th/iba_website/fileupload/Annex2_Registration%20of%20Vehicles%20in%20International%20Traffic.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-31 |df= }})&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] was concluded in Vienna on 8 November 1968. Since its entry into force on 21 May 1977, in signatory countries it replaces previous road traffic conventions, notably the 1949 [[Geneva Convention on Road Traffic]], in accordance with its Article 48. One of the main benefits of the convention for motorists is the obligation on signatory countries to recognize the legality of vehicles from other signatory countries. When driving in other signatory countries, the distinguishing sign of the country of registration must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. The sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate as a white oval plate or sticker, or be incorporated in the [[vehicle registration plate]]. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated in the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle.
* The physical requirements for the separate sign are defined in Annex 3 of the Vienna Convention, which states that the letters shall be in black on a white background having the shape of an [[ellipse]] with the [[major axis]] horizontal. The distinguishing sign should not be affixed in such a way that it could be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility.
* When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs. The distinguishing sign should be displayed on the far left or far right of the registration plate. When a symbol, flag or emblem is also displayed, the distinguishing sign shall be placed on the far left of the plate. The distinguishing sign shall be positioned so as to be easily identifiable and so that it cannot be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility. The distinguishing sign shall therefore be at least a different colour from the registration number, or have a different background colour from that reserved for the registration number, or be clearly separated from the registration number, preferably with a line.
The requirement to display a separate distinguishing sign is not necessary within the [[European Economic Area]], for vehicles with license plates in [[Vehicle registration plates of the European Union|the common EU format]] which satisfy the requirements of the Vienna Convention, and so are also valid in non-EU countries signatory to the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:299:0001:0003:EN:PDF|title=Council Regulation (EC) No 2411/98|date=3 November 1998|publisher=Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate signs are also not needed for Canada, Mexico and the United States, where the province, state or district of registration is usually embossed or surface-printed on the vehicle registration plate.

[[File:Brittany country code sticker on motorbike.jpg|thumb|The unofficial code for Brittany, Bzh]]
; '''Note'''

There are unofficial codes in common use, such as "CYM" for [[Wales]], "BZH" for [[Brittany]], "VL" for [[Flanders]], "V" for [[Vojvodina]]/[[Vajdaság]], "TS" for [[Transylvania]],"PR" for [[Puerto Rico]], "SIC" for [[Székely Land]] (from Latin ''Terra Siculorum'') and "CD" for "Corps Diplomatique".

In addition, in some areas, vehicle-style stickers have been used to denote and promote other entities, such as towns, islands, businesses, and even associations.  These irregular stickers almost always bear an explanation of the code in small print near the edge of the sticker, as the codes used are so unknown.

==Diplomatic licence plate codes==
A separate system is used for vehicles belonging to the diplomats of foreign countries with license plate from the host country. That system is host country-specific and varies largely from country to country. For example '''TR''' on a diplomatic car in the USA indicates Italian, not Turkish. Such markings in Norway are indicated with numbers only, again different from international standards (e.g. '''90''' means Slovakian.

'''LIBRIS''' (''Library Information System'') is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] national [[union catalogue]] maintained by the [[National Library of Sweden]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="ne"/&gt; It is possible to freely search about 6.5 million titles nationwide.&lt;ref name="libris-help"/&gt;

In addition to bibliographic records, one for each book or publication, LIBRIS also contains an [[authority file]] of people. For each person there is a record connecting name, birth and occupation with a unique identifier.{{citation needed|date=August 2012|reason=These records are linked by VIAF but not accessible via the LIBRIS user interface, so it would be useful to have a reliable source mentioning them.}}

The [[MARC standards|MARC Code]] for the Swedish Union Catalog is SE-LIBR, normalized: selibr.&lt;ref name="LOC-MARC"/&gt;

The development of LIBRIS can be traced to the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="Olsson"/&gt; While rationalization of libraries had been an issue for two decades after World War II, it was in 1965 that a government committee published a report on the use of computers in research libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''Databehandling i forskningsbibliotek'' (1965; [http://libris.kb.se/bib/8210948 in LIBRIS]), cited in Olsson (1995), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The government budget of 1965 created a research library council (''Forskningsbiblioteksrådet'', FBR).&lt;ref&gt;Olsson (1995), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary design document, ''Biblioteksadministrativt Information System (BAIS)'' was published in May 1970, and the name LIBRIS, short for Library Information System, was used for a technical subcommittee that started on 1 July 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Olsson (1995), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The newsletter ''LIBRIS-meddelanden'' ({{ISSN|0348-1891}}) has been published since 1972&lt;ref&gt;Olsson (1995), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and is online since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.se/libris/aktuellt/LIBRIS-meddelanden/ LIBRIS-meddelanden]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cinémathèque Méliès - Les Amis de Georges Méliès''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] French organisation (under French law  “[[Association without lucrative purpose|association]] Loi de 1901") created in 1961 to locate, gather, [[Film preservation|preserve]] and promote the work of [[Georges Méliès]] and restore a French cultural heritage which, in 1945, was considered [[Lost film|lost]]. The [[Rediscovered film|rediscovered]] work is promoted through [[Lecture|lectures]], "ciné-concerts" (cinema screenings with live music) as in the [[Silent film|early days of cinema]] (explanation, [[Accompaniment|musical accompaniment]], [[movie projector]]), exhibitions, publications, a documentary and DVDs. So far, the association has managed to collect about 200 films, 145 of which were given to the [[Cinémathèque française]]. 

==Creation==

[[Magic (illusion)|Illusionnist]] Georges Méliès (1861-1938), director of Théâtre Robert-Houdin, is a figure of the early days of cinema. Left penniless in 1923, Méliès destroyed all his films (about 520 made between 1896 and 1912)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malthête |first=Jacques |last2=Mannoni |first2=Laurent |date=2008 |title=L'Œuvre de Georges Méliès |language=French |location=Paris |publisher=la Martinière /Cinémathèque française |pages=334-356 |isbn=978-2-7324-3732-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A big part of what was left of his work (drawings, production stills, magical objects, etc.) was stolen in 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malthête-Méliès |first=Madeleine |date=2011 |title=Georges Méliès l'Enchanteur |language=French |location=Grandvilliers |publisher=La Tour Verte,  coll. « La muse Celluloïd » |pages=501 |others=Préf. René Clair |format=12,5x19,5 cm , 536 pages|isbn=978-2-917819-12-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet his films were [[Film distribution|distributed]] abroad. His main customers at the time were [[Travelling Showmen|travelling showmen]] who toured the world with his films.

In May 1961, Georges Méliès' granddaughter, [[Madeleine Malthête-Méliès]]&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Malthête-Méliès (1923-2018), Méliès’ grandaughter, lived with her grandfather from 1928 to 1938. She travelled around the world to find the lost films and reintroduce them in France. So, she held a collection of 192 films. From 2011 to 2014,  she gave a major part of her collection (152 films) to the Cinémathèque française.&lt;/ref&gt;, and her husband Dr René Malthête, created an association called "Les Amis de Georges Méliès" ("Georges Méliès's Friends"), with the support of family members and of people who knew Méliès&lt;ref&gt;Voir l'article de Madeleine Malthête-Méliès, « La Cinémathèque Méliès : son histoire et ses activités », Journal of Film Preservation, no 48, avril 1994 (ISSN 1609-2694)&lt;/ref&gt;. It was officially registered as an association in the French “Journal Officiel” on the 16th of June 1961&lt;ref&gt;Under number 61/570, now 61/0005701&lt;/ref&gt;. On the same year, they all contributed to the exhibition held at the Cinémathèque française to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Georges Méliès’ birth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/expositions-virtuelles/langlois/#!/point/24|title=Henri Langlois|website=www.cinematheque.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Before 1961===
In 1936, [[Henri Langlois]], [[Georges Franju]], [[Jean Mitry]] and [[Paul-Auguste Harlé]] created the Cinémathèque française. Méliès was likely to become honorary president. Only 9 of his films had been shown in France. From 1949 onwards, with the help of her husband and of the [[French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Madeleine Malthête-Méliès started giving lectures abroad. Her first lecture took place in Sweden where [[Einar Lauritzen]] gave her [[The_Witch_(1906_film)|''The Witch'']] (''La Fée Carabosse ou le Poignard fatal''), a [[Film colorization|hand-coloured film]] shot in [[1906]]. This was how the film collection started. From the 1950s onwards, Georges’ son André Méliès started giving lectures and film screenings like Madeleine.

As a [[screenwriter]], [[film director]], [[theatre director]], [[production designer]], [[film distributor]], and [[camera operator]], Méliès owned a vast number of [[movie rights]]. After his death, André Méliès and Madeleine Malthête-Méliès inherited his rights.

===From 1961 to 2009: Locating, gathering and screening the lost films===
The rights heirs decided that the royalties they received from screenings or exhibitions would be used to [[Film restoration|restore]] negatives prints, while positive copies would be screened by the association during shows with projectors running at 18 images per second, patter, accompaniment and [[sound-effects]] to recreate the atmosphere of the time. With screenings and exhibition rentals, the renewal of copies or exhibited photos could be paid by the association.

In March 1961, 113 members attended the first founding meeting. Actors (like [[Françoise Rosay]], [[Noël-Noël]], [[Pierre Blanchar]]), politicians (such as President [[Albert Sarraut]], and minister [[Henri Ulver]]), cinema historians ([[Georges Sadoul]]), and institutions (international film libraries and the French Federation of Magic) were present. Filmmaker [[René Clair]] was the honorary president of the association registered with the Préfecture de Paris in 1961.

In late 1961, the association could project 18 film copies bought by Dr Malthête from the [[British Film Institute]], [[Travelling Showmen|travelling showmen]], collectors, descendants of [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], or coming from donations. 16 more were expected from international film libraries which the association had swapped copies with or bought copies from.
As a private archive, the association was supported from the start by the F.I.A.F. ([[International Federation of Film Archives]], founded in 1938). In 1961, the Malthête-Méliès represented France when they attended the F.I.A.F. Congress in [[Budapest]], and then in [[Moscow]] in 1964 (many archives were already members of Les Amis de Georges Méliès). From 1964, the association remained an "Observer Member" of the F.I.A.F. until 1992, when this member status was cancelled.

Thanks to solid and long-lasting relationships with film library directors (like [[Ernest Lindgren]] at the [[BFI National Archive|National Film Archive]] (N.F.A.) and [[David Francis (film archivist)|David Francis]] at the BFI (British Film Institute) in [[London]], Margareta Akermak and [[Eileen Bowser]] in [[New York City]], Dr Breitenbach and [[Paul Spehr]] at the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Myrtil Fryda and O. Svoboda in [[Prague]] as well as [[Jerzy Toeplitz]] ([[Poland]]), President of the F.I.A.F., and many others like [[Paolo Cherchi Usaï]]), films were identified, retrieved and exchanged.

In 1962, as they were touring the USA, Dr Malthête and Madeleine located 31 films by Méliès deposited as [[Paper print]] in the Library of Congress in Washington. In 1977, [[Leon Schlesinger]]’ widow authorised [[Blackhawk Films]] to restore and copy some films: 49 were then added to the collection. In 1979, the Library of Congress (Washington) bought the whole Schlesinger's collection: Les Amis de Georges Méliès acquired 8 new films.

With those additions, the association put together a few programmes screened in Paris (at [[Movie theater|cinemas]] like Le Ranelagh, Le Seine, Studio 43, at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]), in France and abroad. The accompanying pianists were Albert Lévy, Éric Le Guen and Jacques Pailhès.

In 1981 the association organised at [[Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle]]  (CCIC), a colloquium dedicated to Georges Méliès (and led by Madeleine Malthête-Méliès), gathering enthusiasts and French and international historians&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Malthête-Méliès (dir.), Méliès et la naissance du spectacle cinématographique, Paris, Édition Klincksieck, 1984 ({{ISBN|2-86563-077-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;. The association screened the whole collection of films - 140 - several times. Before the symposium and on request of the Archives françaises du film of the [[Centre national du cinéma|C.N.C]], the association catalogued all data available about Georges Méliès' films in France in ''Analyse catalographique des films de Georges Méliès recensés en France''. In addition to a thorough filmography put together by [[Jacques Malthête]], this work examines each of the 140 films and locates their sources&lt;ref&gt;Essai de reconstitution du catalogue français de la Star Film : suivi d'une Analyse catalographique des films de Georges Méliès recensés en France, Édition du service des Archives du Film du CNC ({{ISBN|2-903053-07-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;. A precious corpus of documents was then available to researchers.

In 1982, the association published a liaison bulletin deposited at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] (BNF).

In 1986, the association published ''158 scénarios de films disparus de Georges Méliès'' by Jacques Malthête. It compiled 158 lost screenplays and enabled several researchers to identify films belonging to archives or collectors.

In 1988, "Cinémathèque Méliès" was added to the name of the association for Méliès' contemporaries had been passing away. It is under this denomination that the association started gaining attention from the public.

In addition to her activities in France, Madeleine Malthête-Méliès carried on touring North and South America, Africa and Europe. From the 1990s onwards, [[Marie-Hélène Lehérissey]] (André Méliès' granddaughter) stood in for her and toured the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. Musicians Jacques Pailhès and Lawrence Lehérissey accompanied the screenings on piano.

In 1996, a second Méliès colloquium took place at CCIC (led by Jacques Malthête and Michel Marie). The association took this opportunity to publish a supplement to the 1981 catalogue record analysis called ''Analyse descriptive des films de Georges Méliès rassemblés entre 1981 et 1996 par la Cinémathèque Méliès'' (27 films). 167 films were then part of the collection. This symposium led to a collaborative project with [[Arte TV]] channel:  a boxset containing a documentary by Jacques Mény and a musical screening of 15 films by Méliès with an introduction by Madeleine Malthête-Méliès and accompanied by pianist Éric Le Guen.

Later, 17 previously unreleased films were found at a French collector's place and 6 more at the [[Filmoteca de Catalunya|Filmoteca de Cataluña]] ; others were found in surprising (headquarters of the [[French Communist Party]]) or unlikely places (New Zealand, Australia). In 2002, Cinémathèque Méliès was official partner of the exhibition organised by [[Électricité de France|EDF]] and the Cinémathèque Française. The association gave about a hundred musical screenings at EDF Espace Electra&lt;ref&gt;Commissaires : Jacques Malthête et Laurent Mannoni Méliès, Magie et Cinéma, Paris Musée, 2002, ({{ISBN|2-87900-598-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; and made a 25-minute documentary about the exhibition. 

In 2008, the Cinémathèque Française organised an exhibition about Méliès &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Malthête (dir.) et Laurent Mannoni (dir.), L'Œuvre de Georges Méliès, Paris, la Martinière /Cinémathèque française, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-2-7324-3732-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dai.ly/xf27sj|title=Jacques Malthête et Laurent Mannoni : Méliès, magie et cinéma - Vidéo dailymotion|date=4 October 2010|website=Dailymotion}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hosted Cinémathèque Méliès' ciné-concerts for over a year. On the same year, the association made 2 DVDs featuring 30 films (music by Lawrence Lehérissey), gathered in a box set produced by [[Christian Fechner|Fechner Productions]] and distributed by [[Studio Canal]].

In 2009, 211 Méliès' films had been preserved. Some are available in various versions, which in terms of footage represents half his production. This is one of the best-preserved collections of works by a cinema pioneer.

===After 2009===
Still uncovering nitrate films in acceptable condition over a century after they were made is a miracle. Archives all over the world have been working hand in hand and the elements enabling the identification of a  “Star Film” are known all over the world. Finding lost Méliès' films has now become highly unlikely. Yet film libraries from some countries can still hold some good surprises.

Méliès' films are copyright free in the United States and easily available on the Internet. In Europe (excluding Spain) his work has been in the public domain since January 2009 and therefore many musical screenings  (ciné-concerts) have been organised all over the world.

In 2011, the Cinémathèque Méliès participated in the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Méliès' birth. It organised and made a great contribution to a third colloquium at the CCIC in Cerisy-la-Salle: Méliès, carrefour des attractions (led by André Gaudreault and Laurent Le Forestier)&lt;ref&gt;Directeurs : André Gaudreault et Laurent Le Forestier, Presses universitaires de Rennes ({{ISBN|978-2-7535-3394-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;. The Cinémathèque Méliès decided to work with Studio-Canal again and gave them a batch of never before digitised films. A book was born from this collaboration: ''Georges Méliès à la conquête du cinématographe''&lt;ref&gt;Auteur Julien Dupuy, Préface de Serge Toubiana, Éditions Studio Canal, Cinémathèque française, Fechner Productions, Issy-les-Moulineaux, EAN 505-0-582862-01-0&lt;/ref&gt; containing the 2 previously released DVDs and a third one featuring unreleased films (music by Lawrence Lehérissey). Last but not least, the Cinémathèque Méliès contributed to publish a revised edition of Madeleine Malthête-Méliès' ''Georges Méliès l’enchanteur''&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Malthête-Méliès (préf. René Clair), Georges Méliès l'Enchanteur, Grandvilliers, La Tour verte, coll. « La muse Celluloïd », 2011, 536 p., 12,5x19,5 cm ({{ISBN|978-2-917819-12-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In 2014, it became far too difficult for the Cinémathèque Méliès to preserve the films at the right temperature and humidity level. Therefore, the association gave the Cinémathèque Française 16 mm positive and negative elements (441 elements from 145 different films). But it has kept the ciné-concert programmes (some of which are digitalised) and many 35 mm elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2491">'''Marc Blanchard''' (12 October 1942 – 8 November 2009) was a professor of [[Comparative Literature]] and [[Critical Theory]] at the [[University of California, Davis]]. 

He was born in 1942 to a French father and French Jewish mother who were fleeing Nazi persecution and was brought up in Argentina and Egypt. The family returned to Paris after the war, where he earned a degree at the Sorbonne in 1965, in Agrégation de lettres classiques (Romance Languages, Comparative Literature, and Classics-“Sciences Humaines”). &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://complit.ucdavis.edu/obituary-distinguished-professor-marc-blanchard|title=Obituary for Distinguished Professor Marc Blanchard|publisher=UCDavis|accessdate= 29 November 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to joining the University of California campus in 1971, Blanchard taught at [[Yale]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]]. Though he was trained as a classics scholar, Blanchard's longstanding research interests were in [[Semiotics]] and the Critique of Culture.

His articles and books included: ''La Révolution et les Mots'', ''Description: Sign, Self, Desire: Critical Theory in the Wake of Semiotics'', ''In Search of the City'' and ''Trois portraits de Montaigne''. He published more than seventy articles in major journals on topics of Theory, European, Latin American, Caribbean and especially Cuban Literature. 

He lectured at New York University (NYU), [[CCNY]], [[UNC Chapel Hill]], [[Stanford]], [[Ruhr University Bochum]], Germany and received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1985.

Blanchard also ran a [[study abroad]] course in [[Cuba]], one of the few programs in the country which go to this embargoed country. Students must file special waivers through the [[U.S. State Department]]. Blanchard and Raquel Scherr created and taught a program entitled Americans in Paris, a month-long program in Paris run through the UC Davis Summer Abroad program. The program educated hundreds of students and was last taught by Blanchard/Scherr in 2008.

Marc Blanchard died on November 8, 2009 after a long battle with cancer. He was married with one daughter.

'''''Mrs. Munger's Class''''' is two seasons of brief, 90-second skits on [[ABC Kids (United States)|''Disney's One Saturday Morning'']] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] that featured the talking heads of a middle school yearbook page.  The kids in the photos would often exchange silly dialogue and insults, while Mrs. Munger would tell them to "Simmer down! Simmer! Simmer!"  The camera would focus on whoever was speaking on one part of the yearbook page and quickly pan to follow the dialogue.  Students would move between the pictures to interact with one another.  The show was in black and white, but color was used on occasion (on field trips or to show cosmetics).

==Technical details==
Directed by animator [[Tim Maloney]], and produced by Disney for the ''One Saturday Morning'' children's programming block on ABC, the skits used [[Corel]] computer software to manipulate photographs from a school yearbook.  With the aid of computer animation that superimposed facial expressions, the photographs would appear to move their lips as the characters spoke dialogue, creating an effect similar to the [[Syncro-Vox]] cartoons of the 1960s.  The skits ran for 18 months during the 1997-98 season, and during the fall of 1998, until a class action lawsuit was brought against Disney over the use of actual school portraits used to create the characters.

==Controversy==
Although the school portraits used in the show were manipulated, collaged, and otherwise altered, the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit felt that there was still too much resemblance.  As such, the plaintiffs claimed the photographs were used for entertainment without [[personality rights]] clearance.  Mrs. Munger turned out to be Mrs. Kathleen Foresman, who had taught at Woodbridge Middle School in the Washington, D.C. suburb of [[Woodbridge, Virginia]], in 1975 when her picture and those of her 6th grade students were taken for a page in a yearbook.  She, and four of her former students, filed suit against Disney on December 23, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"Disney sued for using photos without permission," ''Syracuse Post-Standard'', December 26, 1998, p A-5&lt;/ref&gt;  Edward Jackson, a computer engineer in San Diego, had learned that his likeness was being used after his 10-year-old niece brought the similarity to his attention.  Jackson, an African-American, was outraged not only at the use of his photo, but at the "[[Billie Thomas|Buckwheat]]"-like speech pattern of the character.&lt;ref&gt;"Defamation suit filed," ''The Stars and Stripes'', December 27, 1998, p13&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuit was settled for undisclosed damages.

==Adult characters==
*Mrs. Munger (voiced by Peter Hastings): The teacher. She regularly urges the class to "simmer" when things get out of hand. Although often expressing frustration toward the class, she generally manages to take things in stride.
*Susan Weiner: The field hockey coach. Appears as a substitute teacher in one episode and attempts to teach fire safety in another.
*Fern Berkowitz: A woman who teaches creative movement to the students. Mrs. Munger and Fern were roommates at Chunkin College.
*Mrs. Yamaguchi: An Asian-American teacher from the next room, whom Rock mischievously telecommunicates with the class in the episode "Class Computer".
*Sven: A somewhat effeminate man with a European accent. He gives Mrs. Munger a makeover in one episode.

==Students==
In order from top left to bottom right:

*Lance (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): Speaks only in [[Pig Latin]]. Apart from Cissy tattling, no one acknowledges this.
*Gordon (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]): Gordon generally makes sarcastic comebacks and one-liners. He finishes his quotes with "ole!"
*Karyn (voiced by C.J. Arabia): She is obsessed with death.
*Artie (voiced by Brett Baer): A New Jersey kid. Most of his statements are very simple, or even unrelated to the topic at hand. When asked to interpret an art piece, for example, he responds with "I'm hungry and my feet hurt".
*Dawn (voiced by Melissa Samuels): The class kiss-up, who reveals that she is overcompensating for her parents that travel a lot.  She often refers to her fellow students as "the children". Her portrait is located directly next to Mrs. Munger's. She is also implied to be [[Jewish]] during the Christmas episode.
*Cissy (voiced by C.J. Arabia): The tattletale. In field trip episodes, she often wears her girl scout uniform, numbered "666".
*Yvonne (voiced by Cree Summer): A black liberal [[feminist]], in tune with modern art and high culture. Her responses usually pertain to oppression, social injustice and other common feminist complaints.
*Grace (voiced by Melissa Samuels): She is the figurative punching bag of the class. She generally says "Cut it out!"
*Theodore (voiced by Peter Hastings): A generally clueless student who stalls, stutters and takes forever to answer a question, even then almost always giving the wrong answer.
*Rock (voiced by Rob Paulsen): The class nerd. He doesn't talk until late season 1, but only in [[object–subject–verb]]-style (Yoda speak). Rock is friends with Lance and in the "Creative Movement" episode implies that he believes himself to be from another planet.
*Amanda (voiced by C.J. Arabia): A [[flower child]]. She likes to sing or recite poetry. Most of her lines are sung.
*Phoebe (voiced by Melissa Samuels): Prone to random outbursts, stares the rest of the time.  She brings her mom's cosmetics to school in several Season 2 episodes.
*George and George (voiced by Brett Baer): The trouble-makers who are both named George and look alike. When people call them twins, they always say, "We're not twins!"
*Mahoot (voiced by Brett Baer): Mahoot's only usual line of dialog is a brief, throaty "what" whenever he is addressed. In 'Good Will Mahoot', he said an actual sentence, followed by "What" when a stunned Mrs. Munger asks him to repeat himself. In "Simmer Minute", the thoughts inside his head are radio interference noises.

==Class pets==
*Gerald the Gerbil is a deceased class pet. 
*Rupert is a turtle. on his first day in the class, some of the students annoy him, and he retaliates by biting them.

==One-time students==
*Darryl: Mahoot's cousin, who appeared only once in one episode. He also says only "What?" (albeit in a low, croaky voice similar to that of [[Mr. Bean]]) and is apparently dumber and weirder than Mahoot. He has a crush on Phoebe.
*Farquhar: A [[foreign exchange student]] from [[Sri Lanka]]. Ironically, he speaks in a blatantly stereotypical American dialect. Only seen in one episode.

==Centerville==
After Mrs. Munger's Class ended its run, a spinoff short series called Centerville aired, based upon the same student-photo premise. Unlike its predecessor, the characters in ''Centerville'' were not bound to the page of a yearbook and appeared in various settings. This series, however, was short lived.

===Centerville adults===
*Murph: The lunchlady. She gets annoyed by students not moving, so she generally says: "Move it along!"
*Brad (Voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): A high school student who works at Taco Freeze (which sells neither tacos nor ice cream, only hamburgers). He is also the guitar player for his garage rock band. He will often say, "Alright, alright".  When he's in his garage band, he says, "This band is gonna rock!"
*Mitch (Voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): The bus driver. He's always in a bad mood and generally says "In your seats!"

===Centerville students===
*Boyd (voiced by [[Tara Strong]])- Boyd generally makes sarcastic remarks. He's also the drummer of Brad's garage rock band.
*Doight (voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]])- He always brings stuff he thinks are interesting, much to Boyd's annoyance. He generally says "Pretty cool, huh?" after he shows his stuff to everyone.
*Fran (voiced by [[Ellen Ray Hennessey ]])- She always talk about feeling sick. She also plays clarinet in Brad's garage rock band.
*Lily- A student with a lisp. She also thinks bus rides are boring.
*Seth- A student who's annoying and rude and speaks in rhyme. For example, "I'm sitting here, go plant your rear!" He annoys Brad and is rude to Sigourney; Boyd mentions that he was held back, likely because of this behavior.
*Sigourney- The valley girl. She's also the singer of Brad's garage rock band. Her trademark catchphrase is "cha", which she inserts in each one of her statements.

Other students include:

*One student who answers every question with a clueless "I......" Possibly inspired by Mahoot in Mrs. Munger's Class. 
*One student who likes to talk only about video games. 
*One girl who's the compulsive liar of the group; she always brags about her dad, making up tall tales about his many accomplishments, never telling the same story twice. (e.g. "My dad is the president of the United States.")
*One girl with a stereotypical Slavic accent seen riding in some of the bus segments.

The '''''Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitan''''' is one of the sources for the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] dating from the 16th century, one of the many surviving contemporary [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] accounts from the period of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Aztec Empire]] and central [[Mexico]] (1519&amp;ndash;1521). However, conqueror accounts which highlight individual deeds worthy of rewards from the Spanish crown (a genre called ''probanzas'' or ''relaciones de méritos y servicios,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Altman |first=Ida |year=2003 |title=The Early History of Greater Mexico |publication-place=Upper Saddle River, NJ |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Anonymous Conqueror's account is descriptive of indigenous life at the time of the conquest.

The author of the document is unknown, and is referred to as '''a Companion of [[Hernán Cortés]]''' (or simply "The Anonymous Conqueror" or "Gentleman of Cortés").  The account in Spanish has been translated to English in Patricia de Fuente's 1993 University of Oklahoma Press publication, ''The Conquistadors: First-person Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico.''

The ''Narrative'' provides descriptions of the life and culture of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Aztec|Aztec/Mexica]] and surrounding peoples of the [[Valley of Mexico]], as they were first encountered by the expedition of ''[[Conquistador]]es'' under [[Hernán Cortés]]. This narrative describes everything from the land and animals, to military concerns, to food and drink, to religion and government, to architecture and beyond.  Historians are divided as to whether the ''Narrative'' is a genuine narrative or merely based on reports from returning Conquistadors. It also contains information on the weapons of the Aztecs in comparison to those of the Spaniards.

The '''National Gallery and Tate Gallery Act 1954''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (2 &amp; 3 Eliz II c. 65). The Act came into force in 1955 and created a legal separation between the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] and the [[Tate Gallery]] and established the Tate as an independent institution. 

The Act was repealed on 1 September 1992 by the [[Museums and Galleries Act 1992]], which created a board of trustees to operate the Tate.

A '''rookie card''' is a [[trading card]] that is the first to feature an athlete after that athlete has participated in the highest level of competition within his or her sport.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportscards.about.com/od/sportscardglossary/g/rookie_card.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Collectors may value these first appearances more than subsequent card issues. Athletes are often commemorated on trading cards which are highly collected based on the popularity of the athlete. Prices for rookie cards fluctuate based on consumer interest, supply and demand and other factors.

==Definition==
A '''rookie card''' is a [[trading card]] that is the first to feature an athlete after that athlete has participated in the highest level of competition within his or her sport..&lt;ref&gt;http://sportscards.about.com/od/sportscardglossary/g/rookie_card.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Collectors may value these first appearances more than subsequent card issues.

A rookie card is not necessarily always produced during a player's rookie season because there could have been cards that fit the definition printed in previous years. It is generally agreed that to be a true rookie card, the card must be numbered as part of a product's base set. Thus, insert cards of any type are generally not considered to be rookie cards. 
&lt;ref&gt; name="definition"&gt;[http://sportscards.about.com/od/sportscardglossary/g/rookie_card.htm http://sportscards.about.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Major League Baseball instituted a set of guidelines which dictated what cards could and could not bear the official MLB rookie card logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |work        = The Cardboard Connection
 |title       = Baseball Rookie Cards Defined
 |url         = http://www.cardboardconnection.com/whats-rookie-card
 |deadurl     = yes
 |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609131339/http://www.cardboardconnection.com/whats-rookie-card
 |archivedate = June 9, 2012
 |df          = 
}} &lt;/ref&gt; Despite these guidelines, many collectors still regard a player's "true" rookie card as being their first officially licensed prospect card.

==Debate==
Debate within the hobby exists, as some believe that an athlete's first appearance on any trading card qualifies as his rookie card. Others believe that a rookie card is the first licensed issue from a major manufacturer that is widely distributed. There can be more than one rookie card for a player. In 2006, Major League Baseball added a "RC" logo to rookie cards, and prohibited cards of players who have not yet appeared in a Major League game from being in the base set.

This debate was exemplified when in 2001, [[Upper Deck]], a trading card company, created a set of golf cards which featured [[Tiger Woods]]. However, Woods already had many cards from other manufacturers such as [[Sports Illustrated]] which included a young Tiger in a 1996 edition of their [[Sports Illustrated for Kids]] periodical, which routinely contains trading cards of various athletes. SI Kids cards have perforated edges and are normally unlicensed by the athlete. Hobby publication Beckett gave the 2001 Upper Deck Golf card a rookie card designation despite its arrival five years after the SI Kids release, sparking controversy.

The market, it appears, gives far greater credence and value to the 1996 Sports Illustrated for Kids release which sells for exponentially more. As it remains, there is no formal definition of a "rookie card," though some players do have cards that are considered "rookies" by all.

==Famous rookie cards==
===1989 Upper Deck Ken Griffey, Jr.===
In the 1989 Upper Deck baseball set, Ken Griffey, Jr. was selected to be featured on card number one.&lt;ref&gt;Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, p.167, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At press time, Griffey had not yet played a major league game, so Upper Deck used an image of Griffey in a [[San Bernardino Spirit]] uniform.&lt;ref&gt;Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, p.168, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors such as Score and Topps neglected to include a card of Griffey in its 1989 base set, but later included him in their traded issues. Such neglect helped Upper Deck gain exposure due to the popularity of Griffey in the [[1989 MLB season]].  Donruss and Fleer included Griffey rookie cards in their respective base sets, but they were never as popular as the Upper Deck issue. Also an afterthought was Griffey's 1989 Bowman Rookie Card. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= The Cardboard Connection
  |title= Ken Griffey Rookie Card Profile
  |url= http://www.cardboardconnection.com/player/ken-griffey-jr
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989 Bowman Ken Griffey Jr. Rookie Card|url=http://www.mybaseballcardspace.info/1989_bowman_ken_griffey_jr.html|publisher=My Baseball Card Space}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the popularity of the Griffey card, it was not a scarce card. The card was situated in the top left hand corner of the uncut sheets and was more liable to be cut poorly or have its corners dinged. Company policy was that if a customer found a damaged card in its package, the company would replace it.&lt;ref&gt;Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, p.168, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Griffey cards were returned and the result was that Upper Deck printed many uncut sheets (sheets consisting of 100 cards) of just Ken Griffey, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, p.168, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professional Sports Authenticator, the Ken Griffey, Jr. would become the most graded card of all time with the company. PSA graded over 50,000 of the cards. The Beckett Grading card service has evaluated over 25,000 of the Ken Griffey, Jr. rookie cards.&lt;ref&gt;Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, p.168, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Répertoire de vedettes-matière de l'Université Laval''' ('''RVM''') is a [[controlled vocabulary]] made up of four mostly bilingual [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesauruses]]. It is designed for document indexers, organizations that want to describe the content of their documents or of their products and services, as well as anyone who wants to clarify vocabulary in English and French as part of their work or research.

RVM was created and is updated by the Répertoire de vedettes-matière section of the [[Université Laval]] Library in [[Quebec City|Québec City]], and it contains over 300,000 authority records. It is used by over 200 public and private libraries and documentation centres in Québec, across Canada and some other countries, mostly in Europe.

== History ==
The Répertoire de vedettes-matière was created in 1946, when Université Laval [[librarians]] took the initiative to reuse the catalogue records from the Library of Congress's [[National Union Catalog]] to describe the documents in their collection. Before the copy cataloguing movement, the practice of reusing these records provided considerable savings despite the time needed to translate them. A list of [[Index term|subject headings]] was gradually compiled in French to provide descriptions of and access to local documentary resources.

After the first official edition of the Répertoire was published in 1962, RVM attracted the attention of major documentary institutions in Québec and across Canada that recognized it as an essential tool for systemizing and standardizing methods for representing the content of their collections. The [[Library and Archives Canada|National Library of Canada]] adopted RVM in the French version of [[Canadiana]], the National Bibliography of Canada, and gave it national standard status in 1974. A formal collaboration agreement between the two institutions was signed, and the first team of librarians dedicated solely to the intellectual management of RVM was established at Université Laval.

It was also in 1974 that the Bibliothèque publique d'information in Paris started using RVM, which was emerging on the scene both in French-speaking countries and around the world. In 1980 the Université Laval Library signed a collaboration agreement with France's National Library, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (BnF), allowing it to use RVM as the basic corpus for creating its subject headings authority index, known as Répertoire d'autorité matière encyclopédique et alphabétique unifié (RAMEAU), the only French-language equivalent of RVM still in use today.

RVM's content and structure reflect its close relationship to the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] (LCSH), but RVM has nonetheless maintained its independence. In addition to developing original headings, RVM has expanded by adding subject headings whose English equivalents come from other source files more specialized than the LCSH. This expansion began in 1978 with the [[Canadian Subject Headings]], followed in 1994 by the [[Medical Subject Headings]] from the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] and the [[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT) from the [[J. Paul Getty Trust|J. Paul Getty Trust.]]

The 9th and final paper edition of RVM was published in 1983 and was the first user manual. In 2008 Université Laval and ASTED (Association pour l'avancement des sciences et des techniques de la documentation) jointly published a practical guide on the Répertoire de vedettes-matière.

In 2010 the first RVM website was launched. In 2017 it launched its new Web platform, which provides access to more powerful search and display features, new indexing support tools, and translations and adaptations of three new thesauruses developed by the [[Library of Congress]] : the Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms (LCGFT), the Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music (LCMPT), and the Library of Congress Demographic Group Terms (LCDGT).

== The thesauruses ==

=== RVM (Topics) ===
RVM (Topics) is an encyclopedic thesaurus whose terms are classified according to a specific syntax. It is a translation and adaptation of the following thesauruses :

* [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] (LCSH)
* [[Canadian Subject Headings]] (CSH) of [[Library and Archives Canada]]
* [[Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH) of the [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]]
* [[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT) of the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]]

It also contains original authorities exclusive to RVM, as well as equivalence with RAMEAU of [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].

RVM (Topics) includes:

* Subject headings (topical and geographic names, buildings, events, and certain other categories of proper names : gods, dukes, last names, programming languages, fictional and legendary characters, sects, etc.). A subject heading is an indexing [[Index term|term]] (consisting of a heading by itself or a heading followed by one or more subdivisions) used to accurately represent the topic of a document.
* Subdivisions (topical, form, chronological, and geographic). A subdivision is a component of a subject heading that supplements the main heading to clarify the concept or topic it represents.

Here are a few examples of subject headings used in the Université Laval Library catalogue. These headings appear as is in the topic field in the [[Bibliographic record|bibliographic records]] :

* ''Réseaux sociaux--Histoire--21e siècle'' (Social networks--History--21st century)
* ''Agriculture--Aspect économique--Modèles mathématiques'' (Agriculture--Economic aspects--Mathematical models)
* ''Canada--Accords commerciaux--Mexique--Congrès'' (Canada--Commercial treaties--Mexico--Congresses)
* ''Écriture--Philosophie--Ouvrages avant 1800'' (Writing--Philosophy--Early works to 1800)
* ''Personnes âgées--Services communautaires de santé'' (Community health services for older people)
* ''Génie nucléaire--Sécurité--Mesures'' (Nuclear engineering--Safety measures)

=== RVMGF ===
RVMGF is a translation and adaptation of Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms (LCGFT). It includes genre/form terms that make it possible to identify resources by their genre or form, thereby providing more options for indexing and identifying various kinds of documents.

Some examples :
* ''Romans historiques'' (Historical fiction)
* ''Films d'horreur'' (Horror films)
* ''Bandes dessinées de science-fiction'' (Science fiction comics)
* ''Jeux de plateaux'' (Board games)
* ''Cartes topographiques'' (Topographic maps)
* ''Données géospatiales'' (Geospatial data)
* ''Catalogues d'exposition'' (Exhibition catalogs)
* ''Rapports annuels'' (Annual reports)

=== RVMMEM ===
RVMMEM is a translation and adaptation of the Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music (LCMPT). It includes medium of performance terms for music designed to represent the instruments, performers, and ensembles involved in a musical score or sound recording. These terms make it possible to describe and identify [[Musical composition|musical pieces]] based on specific criteria with regard to the number of performance media involved in the performance of the piece being searched.

Some examples :
* ''cithare'' (zither)
* ''djembé'' (djembe)
* ''clarinette sopranino'' (sopranino clarinet)
* ''harpe celtique'' (irish harp)
* ''ensemble de flûtes'' (flute choir)
* ''chœur d'enfants'' (children's chorus)
* ''baryton'' (baritone voice)

=== RVMGD ===
RVMGD is a translation and adaptation of the Library of Congress Demographic Group Terms (LCDGT). It includes demographic group terms that make it possible to define the characteristics of the intended audiences of resources, and also the creators of, and contributors to, those resources.

Some examples :
* ''Adolescents'' (Teenagers)
* ''Guadeloupéens'' (Guadeloupians)
* ''Doctorants'' (Doctoral students)
* ''Écologistes'' (Ecologists)
* ''Mères'' (Mothers)
* ''Ingénieurs'' (Engineers)
* ''Locuteurs du catalan'' (Catalan speakers)
* ''Archéologues'' (Archaeologists)
* ''Bibliothécaires de référence'' (Reference librarians)

===World Wrestling Federation (1980)===
In January 1980, The Wild Samoans debuted in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] with [[Lou Albano]] as their manager, quickly establishing themselves as a force in the tag team division through a series of decisive victories. In addition to competing in the tag division, the brothers wrestled as singles, with Anoa'i unsuccessfully challenging [[Bob Backlund]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] in March 1980.&lt;ref name="Shields2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ktv7Nj2C9QUC&amp;pg=PA143|date=15 June 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-0467-2|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon2010B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BacklundMiller2015"/&gt;

On April 12, 1980, The Wild Samoans defeated [[Ivan Putski]] and [[Tito Santana]] to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]]. Their reign lasted until August 9, 1980, when they lost to Backlund and [[Pedro Morales]] at [[Showdown at Shea#1980|Showdown at Shea]]. As Backlund was the then-WWF Champion, he and Morales were forced to vacate the championship, and The Wild Samoans regained the championship on the September 9, 1980, episode of ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling]]'', defeating [[Tony Garea]] and [[Rene Goulet]] in the finals of a tournament. Their second reign lasted until November 8, 1980, when they lost to Garea and [[Rick Martel]].&lt;ref name="Shields2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=taghistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the World Tag Team Championship|work=[[WWE]].com|publisher=[[WWE]]|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/worldtagteam|accessdate=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zbyszko2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Larry Zbyszko]]|title=Adventures in Larryland!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oi6NlcvsOkC&amp;pg=PT51|date=15 December 2010|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-322-1|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lentz2003B"/&gt; The Wild Samoans left the WWF in December 1980.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1981)===
In January to February 1981, The Wild Samoans toured Japan with [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]], performing as "The Samoan #1" (Afa) and "The Samoan #2" (Sika) respectively. They competed in the New Year Golden Series, repeatedly facing [[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Seiji Sakaguchi]]. The Wild Samoans made a second tour of Japan in November and December 1981, competing in the [[G1 Tag League|Madison Square Garden Tag League]].

===Mid-South Wrestling (1981–1982)===
In April 1981, The Wild Samoans debuted in the [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]-based promotion [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]]. They were initially managed by [[Ernie Ladd]] before betraying him to align themselves with [[Skandor Akbar]]. The Wild Samoans held the 
[[UWF Tag Team Championship|Mid-South Tag Team Championship]] on three occasions between June 1981 and May 1982, feuding with [[Junkyard Dog]] and his partners. They left the promotion in May 1982.&lt;ref name="Lentz2003"/&gt;

===Georgia Championship Wrestling (1982)===
In March 1982, The Wild Samoans began competing for the [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based promotion [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], where they were [[manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by [[Sonny King (wrestler)|Sonny King]]. In August 1982, they defeated [[The Fabulous Freebirds]] to win the [[NWA National Tag Team Championship]]. They held the championship for several months, vacating it in December 1982 upon leaving the promotion to return to the WWF.&lt;ref name="Lentz2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lentz2003B"/&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation (1983–1985)===
The Wild Samoans returned to the WWF in January 1983, once again adopting Lou Albano as their manager. They won the WWF World Tag Team Championship for a third and final time on March 8, 1983, defeating [[Chief Jay Strongbow]] and [[Jules Strongbow]]. During their reign, Anoa'i sustained an injury, with his nephew [[Samula Anoa'i|Samu]] substituting for him in several title defences. The Wild Samoans' reign ended on November 15, 1983, when they lost to Soul Patrol ([[Rocky Johnson]] and [[Tony Atlas]]) after Albano accidentally hit Afa with a chair.&lt;ref name=taghistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lentz2003B"/&gt;

After splitting from Albano, The Wild Samoans challenged Soul Patrol on several occasions but were unable to regain the championship. In April 1984, Anoa'i unsuccessfully challenged Hogan for the WWF Championship in one of Hogan's earliest title defences. In mid-1984, The Wild Samoans [[turn (professional wrestling)|turned]] [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] and began a lengthy feud with The North-South Connection ([[Adrian Adonis]] and [[Dick Murdoch]]). They left the WWF once more in January 1985.&lt;ref name="Hunter2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matt Hunter|title=Hulk Hogan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8ZbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1972|date=2013|publisher=Infobase Learning|isbn=978-1-4381-4647-8|pages=1,972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Various promotions (1985-1986)===
The Wild Samoans appeared with multiple different promotions in 1985 and 1986, among them the [[American Wrestling Association]], [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], and [[International World Class Championship Wrestling|International Championship Wrestling]].

===World Wrestling Federation (1986–1988)===
With Afa now semi-retired, Anoa'i returned to the WWF in August 1986 as a singles wrestler. Managed by [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Wizard]], he spent several weeks undefeated before losing to Pedro Morales in November 1986.

In March 1987, Anoa'i formed a tag team with [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]], aligning himself with Kamala's manager, [[Mr. Fuji]], and "handler", [[Steve Lombardi|Kim Chee]]. The duo wrestled a series of matches against [[The Can-Am Connection]] and took part in several tournaments. The team was dissolved in August 1987 when Kamala left the WWF. In September 1987, Anoa'i competed in the [[King of the Ring#1987|King of the Ring]] tournament, losing in the first round to [[S.D. Jones]]. On the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XII|October 3, 1987 episode of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'']] (recorded September 23, 1987), Anoa'i unsuccessfully challenged WWF Champion Hulk Hogan in the main event. He went on to wrestle a series of matches against [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and then against [[Jake Roberts]]. At the [[Slammy Award#1987 Slammy Awards|Slammy Awards]] ceremony on December 16, 1987, the "Song of the Year" category ended with no winner after Anoa'i ate the envelope containing the winner's name.&lt;ref name="Guttman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Guttman|title=World Wrestling Insanity Presents: Shoot First...Ask Questions Later|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFSvQaUVSIwC&amp;pg=PT136|date=15 December 2010|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-328-3|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1988, Anoa'i's regular opponents included [[Lanny Poffo]], [[George Steele]], and [[Hillbilly Jim]]. On March 27, 1988, he appeared on his first [[pay-per-view]], competing in a [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] at [[WrestleMania IV]]. Anoa'i left the WWF once more following the bout.

He formed a short-lived tag team with his nephew [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Kokina]] in [[Continental Championship Wrestling|Continental Wrestling Federation]], where they were managed by Alan Martin. He retired later that year.

===Retirement (1988–present)===
Following his retirement, Anoa'i remained active in wrestling. He trained wrestlers at the Wild Samoan Training Center, a [[professional wrestling school]] run by Afa in [[Minneola, Florida]]. In 1999, he founded XW 2000, an independent wrestling promotion based in [[Pensacola, Florida]].

On March 31, 2007, The Wild Samoans were inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by Sika's son [[Rosey (wrestler)|Matt]] and Afa's son [[Samula Anoa'i|Samu]].&lt;ref name="WWEbio"/&gt;

Anoa'i is married to Patricia Hooker but they are currently separated.&lt;ref name="Sutter1989"/&gt; The couple have four children, two boys, [[Rosey (wrestler)|Matthew]] and [[Roman Reigns|Leati Joseph]], both of whom also became professional wrestlers. Matthew, who was best known for competing for [[WWE]] as "Rosey", died on April 17, 2017.

'''''The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book''''', first published in 1954, is one of the bestselling cookbooks of all time. [[Alice B. Toklas]], writer [[Gertrude Stein]]'s [[life partner]], wrote the book to make up for her unwillingness at the time to write her memoirs, in deference to Stein's 1933 book, ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

This work is as much of an autobiography as it is a cookbook, in that it contains as many personal recollections as it does recipes. The most famous culinary experiment is a concoction called "[[Hashish]] Fudge". Made from [[spice]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit]], and [[cannabis]], Hashish Fudge quickly became a sensation in its own right. In the recipe, Toklas says it is called "the food of paradise" and goes on to suggest places where the cook might find the cannabis. She adds that the fudge can liven up any gathering and is "easy to whip up on a rainy day." She cautions two pieces are quite enough and that one should be prepared for hysterical fits of laughter and wild floods of thoughts on "many simultaneous planes."

Although Toklas later said that this recipe was given to her by her friend [[Brion Gysin]], her name is forever linked with [[marijuana]] brownies due to its great success.

'''The Art of the Motorcycle''' was an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] that presented 114&lt;ref&gt;There were about 19 pre-20th century motorcycles shown in NYC along with the 95 in the official catalog, totaling 114 by most accounts.  Some news media gave varying reports of the exact count (from 105 to as high as 140).  Later exhibitions in other venues made substitutions, additions and deletions from the original collection.&lt;/ref&gt; motorcycles chosen for their historic importance or design excellence&lt;ref name=Sawetz&gt;Sawetz.  "The Art of the Motorcycle is curated by Thomas Krens, Director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, with the help of a team of experts: curatorial advisors Ultan Guilfoyle of the Solomon Guggenheim Museum and University of Arizona Physics Professor Charles Falco; exhibition co-ordinator Manon Slome, and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao Curatorial Department. Works displayed are on loan from the Barber Vintage Motorsport Museum, the Munich Deutsches Museum, and the Otis Chandler Museum of Transportation and Wildlife, among others. [...] The exhibition brings together motorbikes renowned for their extraordinary design and innovative use of technology."&lt;/ref&gt; in a display designed by [[Frank Gehry]] in the curved rotunda of the [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-designed [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City, running for three months in late 1998.&lt;ref name=Kinsella1&gt;Kinsella (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCraw1998/&gt;  The exhibition attracted the largest crowds ever at that museum,&lt;ref name=Plagens1998&gt;Plagens (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and received mixed but positive reviews in the art world, with the exception of some art and social critics who rejected outright the existence of such a show at an institution like the Guggenheim,  condemning it for excessive populism, and for being compromised by the financial influence of its sponsors.&lt;ref name="Kinsella1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Packer2008/&gt;

The unusual move to place motorcycles in the Guggenheim came from director [[Thomas Krens]], himself a motorcycling enthusiast, supported by a novel corporate tie-in with [[BMW]].&lt;ref name="Kinsella1"/&gt;  The motorcycles were chosen by experts including Krens, physicist and motorcycling historian [[Charles Falco]], Guggenheim advisers Ultan Guilfoyle and Manon Slone, and others.&lt;ref name=Sawetz/&gt;   The exhibition was described by historian Jeremy Packer as representing the end of a cycle of demonization and social rejection of motorcyclists, followed by acceptance and reintegration that had begun with the mythologized [[Hollister riot]] of 1947 and ended with the high-end marketing of motorcycles and the newly fashionable biker image of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=Packer2008&gt;Packer (2008) pp 154-159&lt;/ref&gt;   Or at least the show served as "a long-overdue celebration of the sport, the machines and the pioneers they love."&lt;ref name=McCraw1998&gt;McCraw (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was the beginning of a new trend in profitable, blockbuster museum exhibits,&lt;ref name=Overholser2008&gt;Overholser (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; foreshadowed by [[The Treasures of Tutankhamun]] tour of 1972-1979.&lt;ref name=Weisberg1998/&gt;  Questions over the museum's relationship with corporate financial sponsors, both in this show and the tribute to the work of fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]] (on the heels of a $15&amp;nbsp;million pledge to the museum from Mr. Armani) that followed shortly after, contributed to soul searching and the drafting of new ethical guidelines by the [[Association of Art Museum Directors]].&lt;ref name=Vogel1999&gt;Vogel (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2001&gt;''The Economist'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green2005&gt;Green (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibition ==

[[File:Postcard - The Art of the Motorcycle - Guggenheim - low res.jpg|left|thumb|Postcard promoting the exhibition depicting a 1965 [[Kreidler]] Florett motorcycle.|alt=Postcard with legends saying "The Art of the Motorcycle" and "Guggenheim", and a top view of the gas tank, handlebars and front fender of an Art Deco styled motorcycle.]] 
The catalog of the exhibition covered a broad range of historic motorcycles starting from pre-20th century steam-powered [[velocipede]]s and tricycles, covering the earliest production motorcycles, [[Art Deco]] machines of the 20s and 30s, iconic [[Harley-Davidson]]s and [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indians]], British roadsters, and on up to the striking race replica street bikes of the 80s and 90s, ending with the [[MV Agusta F4]].&lt;ref name=Plagens1998/&gt;  The idea of the show was to use motorcycles as a way of surveying the 20th century, exploring such themes as mobility and freedom in a way that cars can no longer do because they are too commonplace and utilitarian, while motorcycles retain a unique romance.&lt;ref name=Albertson/&gt;

The interior of the Guggenheim's spiral ramp was covered in reflective stainless steel, a design by [[Frank Gehry]], with a stylized pavement under the tires of the exhibits, and the bikes not leaned over on their kickstands, but rather standing up, as if in motion, held by thin wires and small clear plastic chocks under the wheels.&lt;ref name=McCraw1998/&gt;  Early examples from the 19th century, steam cycles and three wheelers mostly, were in a single room near the entrance.  The first series produced motorcycle, and the first motorcycle included in the exhibition catalog proper, the 1894 [[Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller]] stood outside the gallery.&lt;ref name=McCraw1998/&gt;  The exhibition also featured a film exhibit, "The Motorcycle on Screen," with [[Easy Rider]] director [[Dennis Hopper]] speaking, and clips from that film as well as the [[Buster Keaton]] silent film [[Sherlock, Jr.]], [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Bike Boy]], and the TV show [[CHiPs]].&lt;ref name="Kinsella1"/&gt;

The year 1998 coincided with the 50th anniversary of [[Honda]] motorcycles, the 75th of [[BMW Motorrad|BMW motorcycles]] and the 95th of [[Harley-Davidson]].&lt;ref name=McCraw1998/&gt;  Fifty-four collections loaned motorcycles,&lt;ref name=McCraw1998/&gt; with the greatest number lent by the [[Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum]],&lt;ref name=Patton2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Albertson/&gt;  and the [[Chandler Vintage Museum of Transportation and Wildlife]].&lt;ref name=Edwards2007/&gt;

BMW's interest in the world of fine art was not unprecedented, as that company had experimented with commissioning prominent artists to paint some of their race cars in the 1970s, leading to the collection, the [[BMW Art Car]]s,&lt;ref&gt;BMW in the Community (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; becoming an ongoing project exhibited in the [[Louvre]], [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], and in 2009, at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and New York's [[Grand Central Terminal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=BMW Art Cars; February 12–24, 2009 |title=[[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|&amp;#91;LACMA:Los Angeles County Museum of Art&amp;#93;]]|chapter-url=http://www.lacma.org/artcars.aspx |publisher=Museum Associates dba the Los Angeles County Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Powell2009&gt;Powell (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago [[Field Museum]] exhibition presented 72 of the original collection's motorcycles, and added details such as coverage of the [[Motor Maids]] women's motorcycling club founded after WWII.  That show also added a participatory group motorcycle ride open to 2,000 bikers at a cost of US$50.&lt;ref name=deLaFuente1998/&gt;
&lt;!-- Originally called the '''Museum of Non-Objective Painting''', the charter of the museum included the “promotion and encouragement of art and education in art and the enlightenment of the public.”&lt;ref&gt;http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Guggenheim__Solomon.html&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Popularity==

Average attendance was at 45 percent higher than normal, with over 4,000 visitors daily,&lt;ref name=Weisberg1998&gt;Weisberg (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 5,000 people a day visiting on the weekends.&lt;ref name=Vogel1/&gt;  Total attendance at the New York museum was 301,037, the largest in the history of the Guggenheim,&lt;ref name=Falco&gt;Falco&lt;/ref&gt; prompting the ad-hoc show at the Chicago Field Museum,&lt;ref name=Packer2008/&gt; where advance tickets were sold for the first time.&lt;ref name=deLaFuente1998&gt;de LaFuente (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  That show was followed by runs at Guggenheim Bilbao and Guggenheim Las Vegas.  The name ''The Art of the Motorcycle'' and some associated media content was subsequently licensed for shows at Wonders: The Memphis International Cultural Series and the Orlando Museum of Art.&lt;ref name=Falco/&gt;  Many of the same bikes appeared at these venues.  Attendance at the Chicago exhibition was 320,000, the highest since [[The Treasures of Tutankhamun]] two decades before.&lt;ref name=Falco/&gt;  Attendance at the next venue, Bilbao, was over 3/4 million, and at Las Vegas, over 250,000, making the tour's total attendance among the top 5 exhibitions ever in a museum.&lt;ref name=Falco/&gt;  Many attendees attracted to these shows had never been to any museum before.&lt;ref name=Packer2008/&gt;  Copies of the exhibition's lavish, large-format 427-page color catalog outsold any museum catalog yet,&lt;ref&gt;Kammen (2007) p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; with over 250,000 copies in print as of 2005.&lt;ref name=Falco/&gt;

In 1969  [[Thomas Hoving]] made a splash at the beginning of his career as director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name=Bilwise1999&gt;Bilwise (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; with a blockbuster exhibition "Harlem on My Mind," featuring the previously overlooked art of African Americans in [[Harlem, New York City]] and was buffeted by criticism from many quarters.  Regardless of what final judgments were made on that show, the impact of the large-scale, media extravaganza art museum exhibition had been felt widely in the museum world.  Hoving would go on to a successful career as director of the Met that would reach a high point with the even larger [[The Treasures of Tutankhamun]] show, setting attendance records that are still unbroken.&lt;ref name=Kammen2007&gt;Kammen (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoving is credited with inventing modern museum populism in his King Tut show.&lt;ref name=Weisberg1998/&gt;

Other trends were at work as well, with a succession of public museum controversies over shocking art reaching back to the sixties, but coming to a head in the 1980s and 1990s with battles over art financed by the US [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA).  The fights over financing of shows by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and others drew bitter battle lines, with most artists, museum directors, gallery owners, and critics lining up to defend free expression and public financing of art with no restrictions on content.  Opponents of this art were generally focused on cutting off funding for and evicting offensive art from public spaces, but there was also a positive side to their arguments, that the proper financing of art was in private sector and art which could successfully attract private financing was by definition deserving of being shown.&lt;ref name=Kammen2007/&gt;  Jacob Weisberg of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' saw the efforts of directors like Krens to drive overflowing museum attendance, at the cost of showing something other than, in Weistberg's view, real art, as a demonstration that they are not an elitist institution, a direct answer, and capitulation, to conservative attacks on museums and the NEA for shows like Mapplethorpe's.&lt;ref name=Weisberg1998/&gt;

It was in 1989 and 1990, one decade before ''The Art of the Motorcycle'', that Mapplethorpe's ''The Perfect Moment'' exhibition was hounded from one venue to another by outraged conservatives.  It was at this point also when performance artist [[Karen Finley]] was denied NEA funding, and [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' became another center of controversy.&lt;ref name=Kammen2007/&gt;   The 1990s saw one victory after another for the conservative movement in public art and museums.&lt;ref name=Plagens1998a&gt;Plagens (1998) "And in a society where the political climate discourages public funding of 'elitist' cultural institutions, museums are thinking more about box office. So now they're selling tickets to bike lovers. Isn't 'diversity' supposed to be a good thing in America?"&lt;/ref&gt;  The economy was booming, and a kind of optimism was felt and expressed by such colorful figures as [[Malcolm Forbes]], whose "Capitalist Tools Motorcycle Club" toured exotic venues celebrating both wealth and a love of fine motorcycles.

In the summer of 1999, the [[Brooklyn Museum]] did battle with then-New York Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]] over the exhibition "Sensation," with charges of presenting sexually and religiously offensive art.  In the face of all this, and the series of battles in the American [[culture war]], ''The Art of the Motorcycle'' stood as a counterpoint, and possibly the high-water mark for the other kind of museum show:  not offensive, not exclusive, but welcoming to the sensibilities of the general public.  People who were baffled and irritated by modern and postmodern art could feel good about this show.  The financing, while critics cried foul, was private.  The show was by nature consented to directly by those who paid the bills, rather than passive taxpayers, and it was aimed at keeping the audience happy, rather than inciting rage with, say, US flags stuffed into toilets, as had been done in one famous museum exhibit decades earlier.&lt;ref name=Kammen2007/&gt;

One decade after ''The Art of the Motorcycle'' opened, Thomas Krens has stepped aside from the top position at the Guggenheim.&lt;ref name=NYTstaff&gt;''The New York Times'' staff (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The New York Times''' Holland Cotter has declared the blockbuster exhibition dead, victim of a weak economy that cannot afford such expensive excess, though this was on a positive note, suggesting a new and exuberant role for independent artists and smaller venues.&lt;ref name=Cotter2009&gt;Cotter (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Reaction to the exhibition came from two distinct camps of critics, with few having views from both.  One camp rejected the very idea of ''The Art of the Motorcycle'', having nothing to do with the machines on display in the Guggenheim or Thomas Krens' way of displaying them, nor his way of financing such a show. The other camp accepted in principle that such a show was acceptable, as art, or at least as subject for a museum like the Guggenheim, and from that basis formed a range of opinions about the quality of the show itself.

=== Outright condemnation ===

The exhibition was condemned outright by some art critics and social commenters who rejected the very existence of an exhibition of motorcycles at the Guggenheim.&lt;ref name=Overholser2008/&gt;  They saw it as a failure of the museum to carry out its social role as a leader and educator of the public's understanding of art.  Rather than guide the masses toward works they might not have considered or been aware of, ''The Art of the Motorcycle'' showed them things they already were familiar with, and already liked; in other words, pandering to the lowest common denominator by giving people more of what they wanted and none of what they needed.  To the extent that the exhibition responded to desires other than what made the  public feel good, the Guggenheim was catering to the marketing needs of the shows sponsors, in particular BMW.  They saw a great cultural institution renting itself out as an exhibition hall for a mere trade show.&lt;ref name=Hyde1998/&gt;

In his book ''[[The Future of Freedom]]'', journalist and author [[Fareed Zakaria]] argued that the Guggenheim's motorcycle exhibition, and other populist shows, were indicative of the downfall of American civilization in general, due to the undermining of traditional centers of authority and intellectual leadership.&lt;ref name=Zakaria2004&gt;Zakaria (2004) pp. 216-219&lt;/ref&gt;   Zakaria writes that Thomas Krens' "gimmicks are flamboyant and often upstage the art itself,"&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria (2004) pp. 218&lt;/ref&gt; and that the point is not to get the public to look at the art anyway, but only to get them into the museum.  While not rejecting that modern and commercial work should be included in modern art shows, Zakaria says, with ''[[The New Republic]]'s'' Jed Perl, that the show fails to "define a style or period" and instead merely parrots current taste, giving the public validation.  Due to the overly dependent relationship with BMW, the show is driven by non-aesthetic criteria, and is too politically correct and uncontroversial.  Zakaria goes on to point out that, indeed, the Guggenheim gave up plans for a show "Picasso and the Age of Iron" because it was too old-fashioned to attract a sponsor, and that BMW turned down a request to sponsor a show "Masterworks from Munich" because Munich isn't sexy.&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria (2004) pp. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Zakaria equates sexiness and buzz with popularity, which drives profit, pointing to a connection between democratization and marketization.  This means bad aesthetic choices will be made by the people,&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria (2004) pp. 220&lt;/ref&gt; rather than having informed, aesthetically sound leadership by aristocratic arbiters of taste whose wealth frees them from ulterior motives, enabling them to lead a reluctant public to perhaps challenging and unenjoyable art, that is nonetheless good for them.&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria (2004) pp. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

These misgivings were cemented for many when the Guggenheim followed a few months later with an homage to fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]] in a show whose financing was even more suspect.  Armani had pledged US$15 million to the Guggenheim Foundation and appeared to be rewarded in a quid pro quo manner with an uncritical and otherwise unjustified marketing coup at one of New York's most prestigious venues.

This type of criticism was described by Jeremy Packer as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' attack on the stereotypical biker in service of a "rear-guard line of defense" of Western cultural and aesthetic values, perceived to be overrun by the "spiritually poor, oversexed, and insane."&lt;ref name=Packer2008/&gt;  Such criticism was rebuked by ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist Geneva Overholser as "dusty foolishness," a foot-dragging reaction to progress, in which some critics were hypocritically denouncing popular works in public while, in private, secretly enjoying the greater accessibility and relevance that was bringing in huge crowds, to the benefit of both museums and the public.&lt;ref name=Overholser2008/&gt;  Curator and Guggenheim director [[Thomas Krens]] defended the premise of the show saying, "We can't focus on Monet and minimalism too much. We have to keep the intellectual vitality of the institution sharp, and I think the bikes do that. They vary the rhythm of the museum and pique your curiosity about what the next show might be. This show isn't meant to be a thumb of the nose at art."&lt;ref name=Plagens1998/&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' critic Peter Plagens defended motorcycles as art by arguing that, "Just as aerodynamic airplanes are simple and streamlined, a motorcycle--which manages to balance an engine and a seat between two wheels--has a mechanical integrity, with intertwining pipes, chains and springs, that is fascinating to behold," comparing the aesthetic to the modernist, minimalist sculptures of [[Brâncuși]].  Patrons need not feel guilty for enjoying themselves, because not all visits to a museum must be endured as grim ordeals of self-improvement.&lt;ref name=Plagens1998/&gt;

=== Criticism of content ===

Among critics who accepted the premise of the show and the legitimacy of motorcycles under the Guggenheim's roof, since museums have included design exhibitions before, and shown, for example, utilitarian bowls or ancient chariots as art,&lt;ref name=Plagens1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kimmelman1/&gt; many still had misgivings about the way in which it was financed.&lt;ref name="Kinsella1" /&gt; While appreciative of Thomas Krens' innovative museum direction, ''[[New York Times|The New York Times]]'' mused that, "one can't help wondering which came first, the idea for the exhibition or the realization that money &lt;nowiki&gt;[from BMW]&lt;/nowiki&gt; would be available for such a show."&lt;ref name=Kimmelman1/&gt;  A number of times the Guggenheim answered critics of BMW's involvement by ticking off the total number of Harley-Davidsons and Hondas, which were greater than BMWs included.  But it was suggested that even at that, there were BMWs shown that were not significant enough to be present.

  }} With regard to the content, the concept that the motorcycle could serve as a metaphor for the 20th century was received with interest, but some wondered whether the claim was fulfilled by the appearance of the motorcycles chosen and the way they were presented.   The motorcycles shown did, at least, "illustrate technology and taste as they have evolved together in the 20th century, which is an issue basic to modern art."&lt;ref name=Kimmelman1/&gt; While there were many who lauded Frank Gehry's spare design, with only the reflective stainless steel and a terse string of words  on the walls behind the bikes to evoke the decade they came from,&lt;ref name=McCraw1998-2&gt;McCraw (1998) "The presentation is simple, straightforward and uncluttered. There are no rails, cables or cordons between the viewer and the motorcycles.  &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; The walls are stark white, and bare, with the exception of a historic-placement blurb at the start of each section, and there is plenty of light on the subjects.&lt;br&gt;Mr. Gehry and his colleagues could have slathered the walls with film stills, advertising and poster art, but they didn't, and the exhibition is better for it. These are elsewhere, mounted in display cases along the rails of the walkways."&lt;/ref&gt; others saw this as shallow or a failure to offer as much insight as the show could have.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Some of the text was criticized as flippant, and the connection between the social and historical context and the motorcycle designs produced from that was left unexplained.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Packer contends this "buzzword approach to context forces the viewer to fill in the blanks, and it also reveals the extent to which the museum display is predicated upon the assertion of a naturalized link between [[Essentialization#Essentialism and society|essentialized culture]]&lt;ref name=Sahlins1993&gt;Sahlins (1993) '''essentialized culture:''' a supposedly unchanging inheritance, sheltered from the contestation of a true social existence.&lt;/ref&gt; and the artifacts that are said to emanate from it," so ''The Art of the Motorcycle'' was constructing the illusion that motorcyclists are a monolithic subculture rather than being different kinds of riders having "numerous relationships to motorcycling."&lt;ref name=Packer2008/&gt;

Packer also argues that "progressivist, developmentalist logic was underpinned by the chronological ordering" of the exhibits themselves, with the clean, productive member of the establishment image of motorcyclists found at the end of the progression.&lt;ref name=Packer2008/&gt;

''&lt;nowiki&gt;The New York Times'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' Jim McCraw was satisfied that, "All the great bikes of the 20th century are represented," and the catalog is "impressive in its depth, breadth and purpose, worth several visits for avid motorcyclists."  However, McCraw pointed out the following omissions:  the [[Wankel engine|Wankel-engined]] [[Suzuki RE5]], the [[inline-6]] [[Honda CBX1000]] (instead the less popular but antecedent [[Benelli 750 Sei]] was included), any of the Japanese turbocharged motorcycles of the 1980s-1990s, the world's fastest motorcycle in the [[Dragstrip|quarter mile]] at the time, the [[Yamaha R1#1998-2000|Yamaha R1]], the motorcycle with greatest top speed at the time, the [[Honda CBR1100XX]], and no [[police motorcycle]]s at all.&lt;ref name=McCraw1998/&gt;  James Hyde of ''[[Art in America]]'' pointed to the omission of the [[Moto Guzzi V8]].&lt;ref name=Hyde1998/&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s'' [[Jacob Weisberg]] found 114 motorcycles in the catalog to be too many, and too boring for the non-motorcycle aficionado.  In contrast to critics like Zakaria, Perl, and [[Hilton Kramer]], who want museums to challenge and educate the public with difficult art like [[abstract expressionism]], which might require a little homework to learn to like, Weisberg complained that the information accompanying the motorcycle exhibits was too technical and bewildering to the non-gearhead, with talk of self-aligning bearings, compression ratios and near-hemispherical combustion chambers.  That is, he wrote, "the approach is design-technical rather than design-aesthetic or design-cultural," and thus it failed to make the case that [[industrial design]] is more than just the "stepchild of fine art" and that "the cross-fertilization of high and pop is an important part of the story of artistic modernism."&lt;ref name=Weisberg1998/&gt;

The selection of motorcycles was overwhelmingly Western, and mostly limited to motorcycles of the United States market, and mostly of the high end, leaving out utilitarian examples.&lt;ref name=Hyde1998/&gt;  One scooter is present, and one motorcycle truly for the masses, the [[Honda Super Cub]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  That motorcycles are the number one mode of transport in a great many countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;Iles (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and thus central to the lives of most of the world's population was completely ignored by ''The Art of the Motorcycle'', and little mention was made of the design context of creating motorcycles for this market. Creative uses of motorcycles in the developing world, such as the [[tuk tuk]] and similar vehicles, was overlooked.&lt;ref name=Hyde1998/&gt;  Even the critical role that motorcycles played as utilitarian transport prior to the advent of the [[Ford Model T]] was left largely out.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Instead, motorcycling was seen through the lens of the late 20th century American:  a form of recreation, and most of all, a form of self-expression.  There were critics, such as ''The New York Times''' [[Michael Kimmelman]], who, somewhat playfully, shared this US-centric point of view, in that "motorcycles are frivolous to begin with: they're about irresponsibility, about not conforming, about getting away. Or at least they're about embracing the image of nonconformity."&lt;ref name=Kimmelman1/&gt;

==Legacy==
In the year following the opening of the Guggenheim motorcycle exhibition, [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] presented ''Rock Style'', featuring music performance costumes,  sponsored by [[Tommy Hilfiger]], [[Condé Nast Publications]], and [[Estée Lauder Companies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Press_Room/full_release.asp?prid={CCCA3C9A-C358-11D3-936E-00902786BF44}|title=ROCK STYLE IS THEME FOR METROPOLITAN MUSEUM'S DECEMBER COSTUME INSTITUTE EXHIBITION  |date=3 December 1999|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; seen by ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' Michael Ellison as corporate-museum interdependency similar to the BMW and Armani shows at the Guggenheim.  In addition to touring their Art Cars in various museums, BMW has continued to find new ways to be a major player in the arts, in accordance with their marketing goals, for example in the 2006  "BMW Performance Series"  featuring jazz music and black filmmakers, all overtly targeted at black car buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=BMW arts series aims at black consumers |periodical=Automotive News |volume=80 |issue=6215 |date=August 7, 2006 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Las Vegas exhibit, derivative versions of ''The Art of the Motorcycle'' were presented at [[Wonders: The Memphis International Cultural Series]] and [[Orlando Museum of Art]].  The [[Legend of the Motorcycle]] [[Concours d'Elegance|concours]] was in part inspired by the success of the Guggenheim's exhibit.  A group of celebrity movie actors, friends of the "consummate showman" Thomas Krens&lt;ref name=Vogel1/&gt; named themselves the "Guggenheim Motorcycle Club" and rode motorcycles on various adventures in Spain and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Lieberman2000&gt;Lieberman (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wadler2003&gt;Wadler (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  The  [[Motorcycle Hall of Fame]] museum's 2008 ''MotoStars'' event, designed to "go even further" than the Guggenheim shows, was anchored by celebrity appearances, and included Krens and co-curator [[Charles Falco]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  A forthcoming exhibition at the [[Bermuda National Gallery]], inspired by ''The Art of the Motorcycle'',  will use the identical concept of the  motorcycle as "possible metaphor for the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;Bermuda National Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Penrith Regional Gallery]]'s curator was inspired in part by the Krens' success in New York City to create the 2009 ''Born To Be Wild: The Motorcycle In Australia'', an examination of the motorcycle in contemporary art.&lt;ref name=Meacham1&gt;Meacham (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roger Ebert cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=Roger Ebert|"One of the gifts a movie lover can give another is the title of a wonderful film they have not yet discovered. Here are more than 300 reconsiderations and appreciations of movies from the distant past to the recent past, all of movies that I consider worthy of being called 'great.'" &amp;mdash; Roger Ebert]]

'''''The Great Movies''''' is the name of several publications, both online and in print, from the film critic [[Roger Ebert]]. The object was, as Ebert put it, to "make a tour of the landmarks of the first century of cinema."&lt;ref name="GreatMovies1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ebert |first= Roger|date= November 2003|title= The Great Movies |url= |location= New York |publisher= Three Rivers Press|page= xvi |isbn=978-0767910385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Great Movies'' was published as four books:

*''The Great Movies'', published in November 2003 (544 pages, [[Three Rivers Press]], {{ISBN|978-0767910385}})
*''The Great Movies II'' published in February 2006 (517 pages, [[Three Rivers Press]], {{ISBN|978-0767919869}})
*''The Great Movies III'', published in October 2011 (440 pages, [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|978-0226182094}})
*''The Great Movies IV'', published in September 2016 (288 pages, [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|978-0226403984}})

Ultimately, Ebert recommended '''383''' films he designated as "Great Movies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/roger+ebert+the+great+movies/ "Roger Ebert: The Great Movies"] on the ''iCheckMovies'' website&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This number includes individual installments of series he recommended (like the ''[[Up Series]]'', ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'', [[The Three Colors Trilogy]], etc.).}}{{efn|The list on this citation counts 409, but ICheckMovies counted 26 additional films by [[Buster Keaton]] because Ebert had written a career retrospective on Keaton's cinematic work and legacy in ''The Great Movies II'', and they made the decision that meant he meant to include every directorial work Keaton completed as "Great Movies." For the sake of this article, those 26 films do not count as official selections of The Great Movies.}}

The '''Unique Domain Authentication Identifier''' (UDAI) is a [[Case sensitivity|case-sensitive]], eight-character-long "[[password]]" which is a randomly generated unique identifier for every Internet NZ [[domain name]] (code "[[.nz]]").&lt;ref name=SH/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNC/&gt; The UDAI is made up of letters in both upper and lower case as well as numbers.

The UDAI is the password for the domain and can be used to [[Domain name registrar#Domain name transfer|transfer]] the ownership of the domain.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt;

When an Internet domain name is registered, the related UDAI is initially generated. However, a new UDAI can be requested by the owner at any time.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt; Registrars are obliged to promptly make UDAIs available to registrants upon request and may not withhold them to prevent a domain name from being transferred under any circumstances.&lt;ref name=DNC/&gt;

The term UDAI is a term only used in New Zealand.  Other countries still require a unique code to transfer a domain, but refer to it as an Auth code or EPP code.

Over five decades, beginning when he was a boy, Edey assembled a significant collection of clocks, watches and associated research materials that he donated to the Frick after his death.  He was a noted scholar of timepieces, and executed repairs on his collection himself.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit /&gt;  Edy wrote the catalogue to the 1982 Frick exhibition ''French Clocks in North American Collections''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edey|first1=Winthrop|title=French Clocks in North American Collections|date=1982|publisher=Frick Collection|location=New York|isbn=9780912114118|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/French_Clocks_in_North_American_Collecti.html?id=rLWzQwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His bequest to the Frick includes 39 timepieces, including [[André Charles Boulle]]'s famed [[Barometer Clock (Boulle)|Barometer Clock]], together with his library of horological and other materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrewes|first1=William J.H.|title=The Art Of the Timekeeper: Masterpieces from the Winthrop Edey Bequest (exh. cat.)|date=2001|publisher=The Frick Collection|location=New York|isbn=9780912114194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edey also collected and conducted research in other areas, notably Egyptology and Classical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reist|first1=Inge|title=Kelly Edey: In LIfe and In Memoriam, exhibition brochure|date=2001|publisher=Frick Art Reference Library|url=https://www.frick.org/sites/default/files/pdf/library/Edey_Brochure.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave several works to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] when he died, including sculptures by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winthrop Edey bequest search|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection#!?q=bequest%20of%20winthrop%20edey|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edey was gay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrisroe|first1=Patricia|title=Mapplethorpe : A Biography|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780394576503|pages=236; 242; 293|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=La3bAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and part of New York City's cultural and artistic life; he was friendly [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and [[Andy Warhol]], among others.  Warhol's first ''[[Screen Tests]]'' were likely filmed at Edey's townhouse on West 83rd Street, Manhattan.
