'''Aid effectiveness''' is the effectiveness of [[development aid]] in achieving [[economic development|economic]] or [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] (or development targets). Following the Cold War in the late 1990s, donor governments and [[Aid agency|aid agencies]] began to realize that their many different approaches and requirements for conditioning aid were imposing huge costs on developing countries and making aid less effective. They began working with each other, and with developing countries, to harmonize their work to improve its effect. Aid agencies are always looking for new ways to improve aid effectiveness, including [[conditionality]], [[capacity building]] and support for improved [[governance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx ''Aid Effectiveness and Governance: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009071531/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx |date=2009-10-09 }}, Daniel Kaufmann, Brookings Institution, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==

===Cold War era===


The international aid system was born out of the ruins of the Second World War, when the United States used their aid funds to help rebuild Europe. The system came of age during the Cold War era from the 1960s to the 1980s. During this time, foreign aid was often used to support client states in the developing world. Even though funds were generally better used in countries that were well governed, they were instead directed toward allies.

===Post Cold War===


After the end of the Cold War, the declared focus of official aid began to move further towards the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of development. The countries that were in the most need and poverty became more of a priority. Once the Cold War ended, Western donors were able to enforce aid conditionality better because they no longer had geopolitical interests in recipient countries. This allowed donors to condition aid on the basis that recipient governments make economic changes as well as democratic changes.&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, Thad. "Conditioning the Effects of Aid: Cold War Politics, Donor Credibility, and Democracy in Africa." International Organization 58.02 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; It is against this background that the international aid effectiveness movement began taking shape in the late 1990s as donor governments and aid agencies began working together to improve effectiveness. 

===Progression in movement===


The aid effectiveness movement made progress in 2002 at the International Conference on Financing for Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffdconf |title=International Conference on Financing for Development |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Monterrey, Mexico, which established the [[Monterrey Consensus]]. There, the international community agreed to increase its funding for development—but acknowledged that more money alone was not enough. Donors and developing countries alike wanted to know that aid would be used as effectively as possible. They wanted it to play its optimum role in helping poor countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals |publisher=Un.org |date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the set of targets agreed by 192 countries in 2000 which aimed to halve world poverty by 2015. A new paradigm of aid as a partnership, rather than a one-way relationship between donor and recipient, was evolving.

In 2003, aid officials and representatives of donor and recipient countries gathered in Rome for the High Level Forum on Harmonization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidharmonization.org aidharmonization.org]&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting, convened by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org oecd.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (OECD), donor agencies committed to work with developing countries to better coordinate and streamline their activities at the country level. They agreed to take stock of concrete progress before meeting again in Paris in early 2005. In Paris, countries from around the world endorsed the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]], a more comprehensive attempt to change the way donor and developing countries do business together, based on principles of partnership. Three years on, in 2008, the Third High Level Forum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accrahlf.net accrahlf.net]&lt;/ref&gt; in Accra, Ghana took stock of progress and built on the Paris Declaration to accelerate the pace of change. The principles agreed upon in the declarations are, however, not always practiced by donors and multilateral bodies. In the case of Cambodia, two experts have assessed donor misbehaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/162850/index.en.shtml Dinosaurs at work] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706053940/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/162850/index.en.shtml |date=2010-07-06 }}, ''Development and Cooperation'', Vol. 36, 2009, No. 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

====''High level forums on aid effectiveness''====
The results and details of these meetings have been documented to show the progression aid effectiveness from the various [[High level forums on aid effectiveness]].

===Improvement and critiques===


Efforts to improve aid effectiveness have gained significant momentum in the health sector, due in large part to the work of the [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+). Created in 2007, IHP+&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/ |title=IHP+ The International Health Partnership |publisher=Internationalhealthpartnership.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of partners committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries. These partners work together to put international principles for aid effectiveness and development cooperation into practice. IHP+ mobilizes national governments, development agencies, civil society and others to support a single, country-led national strategy in a well-coordinated way.

Critiques of the effect of aid have become more vociferous as the global campaigns to increase aid have gained momentum, particularly since 2000. There are those who argue that aid is never effective. Most aid practitioners agree that aid has not always worked to its maximum potential but that it has achieved significant effect when it has been properly directed and managed, particularly in areas such as health and basic education. There is broad agreement that aid is only one factor in the complex process needed for poor countries to develop and that economic growth and good governance are prerequisites. For aid to be maximized efficiently and most optimally, donations need to be directed to areas such as local industries, franchises, or profit centers in developing countries. By doing so, these actions can sustain health related spending and result in growth in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Laurie. 2007. The Challenge of Global Health. ''Foreign Affairs'' 86 (1):14-38]&lt;/ref&gt;

The OECD has explored—through peer reviews and other work by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC)—the reasons why aid has and has not worked. This has resulted in a body of best practices and principles that can be applied globally to make aid work better. The ultimate aim of aid effectiveness efforts today is to help developing countries build well functioning local structures and systems so that they are able to manage their own development and reduce their dependency on aid.

==Need for effectiveness==

As recognized by the [[OECD]]'s Working Party on Aid Effectiveness, at the beginning of the 21st century it became apparent that promoting widespread and sustainable development was not only about amounts of aid given, but also about ''how'' aid was given.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness Working Party on Aid Effectiveness, "Transforming Global Partnership for Development, March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aid flows have significantly increased over the last decade, but at the same time aid has become increasingly fragmented. There has been an explosion in the number of donors, and while the number of projects has multiplied, their average size has dropped. Small projects being often limited in size, scope and duration, they result in little lasting benefit beyond the immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;Fengler, M.G and Kharas, H. ''Delivering Aid Differently: Lesson from the Field''. Brookings Institution, Washington D.C. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; With more players, aid has become less predictable, less transparent and more volatile.&lt;ref&gt;Kharas, H., Makino, K., Jung, W. ''Catalizing Development''. Brookings Institution Press, Washington D.C. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Information, at the donors' as well at the recipients' level, is often poor, incomplete and difficult to compare with other data, and beneficiaries' feedback and formal project evaluations are rare. Aid is predictable when partner countries can be confident about the amount and the timing of aid disbursement. Not being predictable has a cost: The [[deadweight loss]] associated with volatility has ranged on average from 10% to 20% of a developing country's programmable aid from the European Union in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Kharas, H. "Measuring the Cost of Aid Volatility". Wolfensohn Centre for Development, Working Parper 3, Brookings Institution, Washington D.C. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past decade, the aid environment has dramatically changed. [[Emerging economies]] (China, India, Saudi Arabia, Korea, Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela, etc.), which are still receiving aid from Western countries, have become donors themselves. Multinational corporations, philanthropists, international NGOs and civil society have matured into major players as well. Even though the rise of new development partners had the positive effect of bringing an increased variety of financing, know-how and skills to the development community, at the same time it has shaken up the existing aid system. This is particularly true in the case of emerging economies, as they do not feel compelled to conform to traditional donors’ norms.&lt;ref&gt;Park, K., "New Development Partners and a Global Development Partnership". In Kharas, H., Makino, K., Jung, W. ''Catalizing Development'', Brooking Institution Press, Washington D.C. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally demanding [[conditionality]] in return for assistance, which means tying aid to the procurement of goods and services, they are challenging traditional development aid standards.&lt;ref&gt;Kragelund, P. "The Potential Role of Non-Traditional Donors' Aid in Africa", International Center for Trade and Sustainable Development, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The governance of aid presents itself as complex, bureaucratized and fragmented, with evident diseconomies of numbers and coordination, which have meant an increase in transaction costs. This is true for recipient countries, forced to neglect their domestic obligations to cope with requests and meetings with donors&lt;ref&gt;As an example, in 2005, government authorities in Vietnam received 791 missions from donors, which means more than two a day, including weekends and holidays. See, for example, OECD, DAC, "The Challenge of Capacity Development: Working Towards Good Practice", Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (given the lack of capacity at the country level and the precedence given to responding to donor demands) but also for donors and, ultimately, for beneficiaries. In fact, each project has fixed costs of design, negotiation and implementation, which reduce dollars available for final beneficiaries.

Despite the fact that the international community addressed the effectiveness issue through the Paris Declaration and the subsequent Accra Agenda for Action, the implementation of this agenda has been difficult. Governments and [[aid agencies]] have made commitments at the leadership level, but for the moment have done little more than pursuing top-down, aggregate targets. Decades of development have shown that if countries are to become less dependent on aid, they must follow a bottom-up approach, where they determine their own priorities and rely on their own systems to deliver that aid.&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher, E., and Fyson, S., "Improving the Effectiveness of Aid", ''Finance and Development'', Vol. 25, n. 3, The International Monetary Fund, September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There is broad consensus that aid could be managed more effectively,&lt;ref name="Killen, B. 2011"&gt;Killen, B., "How Much Does Aid Effectiveness Improve Development Outcomes? Lessons from Recent Practice", Busan Background Papers, OECD/DAC, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; answering a call for program quality and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar, N., "UN Poverty Goals face accountability questions," ''The New York Times'', on line, September 18, 2010. Available at  &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/world/19nations.html&gt; [accessed on 24 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

With more than $2.32 trillion spent in foreign aid over the last half-century and no equivalent effect in reducing poverty and conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Easterly, W., ''The White Man’s Burden: Why the West's efforts to aid the rest have done so much ill and so little good''. Penguin Press, New York, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and new crisis such as the recent famine in the horn of Africa,&lt;ref&gt;As Jeffrey Sachs wrote in the ''Guardian'', “the Horn of Africa crisis is a warning to the World.” See Sachs, J., "The Horn of Africa crisis is a warning to the world.", ''The Guardian'', [on line] July 28, 2011. [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jul/28/horn-africa-drought-warning Accessed on 24 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; this call becomes particularly desperate. The publication on September 21, 2011 of the [[OECD]]-[[Development Assistance Committee]]'s “Aid Effectiveness 2005-2010: Progress in Implementing the Paris Declaration” report, clearly demonstrates that only one out of the 13 targets established for 2010 was met.

The 4th High Level Forum (HLF) on Aid Effectiveness held in [[Busan]], Korea, from November 29 to December 1, 2011, arrived at a crossroads in the context of international development cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, "Aid Effectiveness 2005-10: Progress in implementing the Paris Declaration", OECD Publishing, Paris, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; HLF-4 was expected to make recommendations on a future aid quality framework, at least for the period up to the [[MDG]] date of 2015.&lt;ref name="Killen, B. 2011"/&gt;

==The OECD's work on aid effectiveness (2003 to present)==
{{News release|section|date=April 2010}}
The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/|title=OECD.org - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the primary function of coordinating the international community’s efforts for effective distribution of aid through the [[Development Assistance Committee]] or DAC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/development/developmentassistancecommitteedac.htm|title=Development Assistance Committee (DAC) - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Under this committee is the Working Party on Aid Effectiveness which facilitates donor efforts to improve aid effectiveness in various related areas&lt;ref name="Oecd.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness |title=Aid effectiveness - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.odi.org/projects/1448-dac-working-party-aid-effectiveness|title=DAC working party on aid effectiveness|work=ODI|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; .The major international forum allows developing countries to collaborate with multilateral and bilateral donors. WP-EFF became instrumental in pushing initiatives geared toward the Millennium Development Goals. It also organized the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra in September 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/theaccrahighlevelforumhlf3andtheaccraagendaforaction.htm|title=Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Working Party on Aid Effectiveness was tasked to measure and encourage progress for implementing commitments of the 2005 Paris Declaration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/parisdeclarationandaccraagendaforaction.htm|title=Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda for Action - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided guidance on policy and good practice. The Working Party is composed of  senior policy advisers from the 23 DAC member-nations, 23 developing countries, and 11 multilateral organisations. It has a unique “tripartite” chairing arrangement, including representatives of a bilateral donor organisation, multilateral organization and developing-country partner. This reflects the partnership commitments embodied in the Paris Declaration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/paris-declaration|title=Paris Declaration {{!}} Open Government Partnership|website=www.opengovpartnership.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The WP-EFF also coordinates actively with civil society organisations. To effectively cover its broad mandate, it established a number of Joint Ventures to examine particular areas of interest, including monitoring the Paris Declaration, public financial management, procurement, and managing for development results.

The DAC maintains and makes available unique and definitive statistics on the global aid effort. Its Working Party on Statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats |title=Aid statistics - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; tracks official development assistance over time, providing a firm basis for analytical work on aid trends and for assessments of aid effectiveness. Beyond the traditional OECD aid donors, its data collection also includes other official and private flows to developing countries.

===Development Assistance Committee's networks===

Other aid effectiveness work is carried out by the DAC’s networks—global foray that bring together experts.

The Network on Development Evaluation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation |title=Evaluation of development programmes - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; supports robust, informed and independent evaluation of aid activities. This Network promotes joint reviews of the effectiveness of aid, such as the Evaluation of the Implementation of the Paris Declaration. It also works to improve the standards and norms used in evaluations. The 30 Evaluation Network members include heads of evaluation from all DAC member countries and from the African Development Bank (AfDB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank.

The DAC’s Network on Gender Equality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/gender |title=Gender equality and development - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |publisher=Oecd.org |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; GENDERNET, produces practical tools to help integrate [[gender equality]] and women’s empowerment into all aspects of development co-operation. It is currently focusing on the implementation of the Paris Declaration, designing a set of guiding principles to show how women’s empowerment can be clearly integrated into aid effectiveness efforts to increase their impact.

The  Network on Environment and Development Co-operation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/environment |title=Environment and development - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ENVIRONET,  promotes and facilitates the integration of environment and climate change into all aspects of development co-operation, as called for by the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action. Building on lessons learned and best practices, the Network works towards enhancing policy co-ordination and coherence to achieve more rapid progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and creating a successful shift towards “green growth”.

The DAC’s Network on Poverty Reduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/poverty |title=Poverty reduction - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; POVNET, promotes economic growth for poverty reduction, stressing the importance of both the rate and the pattern of growth, and works to ensure that growth is broad-based and inclusive. Subjects of workshops held by this network have included applying Paris Declaration principles in agriculture and infrastructure.

The Network on Governance and Capacity Development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/governance |title=Governance and development - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOVNET, helps donors to be more effective in supporting democratic governance. It offers a forum to exchange experiences and lessons, identify and disseminate good practice, and develop policy and analytical tools. It has produced important publications on themes such as fighting corruption, building institutions and ensuring human rights are placed at the centre of aid effectiveness efforts.

The Network on Situations of Conflict and Fragility&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dac/conflict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517043810/http://www.oecd.org/dac/conflict|date=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; brings together experts on governance and conflict prevention from bilateral and multilateral development co-operation agencies, including the EC, the UN system, the IMF, the World Bank and regional banks. It helps to improve development co-operation and coherent international action in situations where the Millennium Development Goals are undermined by threats of violent conflict, human insecurity, fragility, weak governance and instability.

The DAC also works on emerging issues in aid effectiveness. In 2008, it published the first in a new series of yearly surveys to tackle two major information gaps that hinder increased aid effectiveness: future spending intentions of donors, and the proliferation of aid donors. The results of these surveys will help donors make more informed decisions about where they should focus their aid, and to improve aid predictability at the country level. New analyses of historical information are also showing where there is donor fragmentation within a country, prompting donors to seek a better division of labour amongst themselves.

The DAC is working to build recognition among the development community that trade is an important tool for development. Its aim is to increase support for “aid for trade” activities—aid that helps build poor countries’ capacity to trade successfully. Experts from the DAC and the OECD Trade Committee are disseminating evidence of trade’s impact on development and creating an analytical toolbox for improving the design and implementation of aid-for-trade programmes. This includes strengthening the application of the Paris Declaration principles to trade-related aid activities.

==Findings and critiques on aid effectiveness==
{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}
{{See also|Aid#Criticism}}
'''Organization of Disaster Aid Delivery'''

How aid is delivered can affect the quality and quantity of aid. Often in disaster situations, international aid agencies work in hand with local agencies. There can be different arrangements on the role these agencies play, and such arrangement affects that quality of hard and soft aid delivered. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/ecdecc/doi10.1086-681277.html|title=Organization of Disaster Aid Delivery}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Micro-Macro Paradox'''

The major findings by Paul Mosley and others conclude that it is impossible to establish any significant correlation between aid and growth rate of GNP in developing countries. One reason for this is the fungibility and the leakage of the aid into unproductive expenditure in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Foreign Aid: Its Defense and Reform
|last= Mosley|first= Paul
|year= 1987

|accessdate= December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at a micro level, all donor agencies regularly report the success of most of their projects and programs. This contrast is known as the micro-macro paradox.

Mosley’s result was further confirmed by Peter Boone who argued that aid is ineffective because it tends to finance consumption rather than investments. Boone also affirmed the micro-macro paradox.

One challenge for assessing the effectiveness of aid is that not all aid is intended to generate economic growth. Some aid is intended for humanitarian purposes; some may simply improve the standard of living of people in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The micro-macro paradox has also been attributed to inadequate assessment practices. For example, conventional assessment techniques often over-emphasize inputs and outputs without taking sufficient account of societal impacts. The shortcomings of prevalent assessment practices have led to a gradual international trend towards more rigorous methods of impact assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Dead Aid'''

Noted Zambian economist [[Dambisa Moyo]] has been a fierce opponent to development aid, and calls it “the single worst decision of modern developmental politics”. Her book, [[Dambisa Moyo|Dead Aid]] describes how aid has encouraged kleptocracies, corruption, aid-dependency and a series of detrimental economic effects and vicious downward spirals of development in Africa. She argues that foreign aid provides a windfall to governments which can encourage extreme forms of [[rent-seeking]] and through providing a positive shock of revenue, lead to [[Dutch Disease]]. Furthermore, this easy money offers governments an exit from the contract between them and their electorate: the contract that states that they must provide public goods in exchange for taxes.  In short, it "allows the state to abdicate its responsibilities toward its people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moyo|first=Dambisa|title=Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa.|year=2009|publisher=Douglas &amp; Mcintyre|isbn=978-1-55365-542-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Moyo alludes specifically to government bilateral and multilateral aid and not small-holder charity, humanitarian or emergency aid.
Her prescriptions call for increased trade and foreign direct investment, emphasizing China’s burgeoning role in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moyo|first=Dambisa|title=Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa|year=2009|publisher=Douglas &amp; Mcintyre|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moyo also makes a case for micro-financing schemes, as popularized by the widespread success of Grameen Bank, to spark entrepreneurship within the continent on the ground level, thus building from the bottom-up as opposed to the top-down approach aid takes.

'''Research by Burnside and Dollar (2000)'''

Burnside and Dollar provide empirical evidence that the effect of aid on GDP growth is positive and significant in developing countries with "sound" institutions and economic policies (i.e. open trade, fiscal and monetary discipline); but aid has less or no significant effect in countries with "poor" institutions and policies. As economists at the World Bank, Burnside and Dollar advocated selectivity in aid allocation. They argue that aid should be systematically allocated to countries conditional on "good" policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|last=Burnside|first=Craig|author2=Dollar, David|journal=The American Economic Review|date=September 2000|volume=90|issue=4|pages=847–868|doi=10.1257/aer.90.4.847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnside and Dollar’s findings have been placed under heavy scrutiny since their publication. Easterly and others re-estimated the Burnside and Dollar estimate with an updated and extended dataset, but could not find any significant aid-policy interaction term. New evidence seems to suggest that Burnside and Dollar’s results are not statistically robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roodman|first=David|title=The Anarchy of Numbers: Aid, Development and Cross-Country Empirics|journal=The World Bank Economic Review|year=2007|volume=21|issue=2|pages=255–277|doi=10.1093/wber/lhm004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aid in the Absence of Accountable Governance'''

Revenue generation is one of the essential pillars for developing state capacity. Effective taxation methods allow a state to provide public goods and services, from ensuring justice to providing education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bräutigam|first=Deborah|date=2002|title=Building Leviathan: Revenue, State Capacity and Governance|url=https://deborahbrautigam.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2002-building-leviathan.pdf|journal=IDS Bulletin|volume=Vol 33 No 3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxation simultaneously serves as a government accountability mechanism, building state-citizen relationships, as citizens can now expect such service provisions upon their consent to taxation. For developing and fragile states that lack such revenue capabilities, while aid can be a seemingly necessary alternative, it has the potential to undermine institutional development. States that rely on higher percentages of aid for government revenue are less accountable to their citizens by avoiding the state-citizen relationships that taxation builds and face fewer incentives to develop public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cgdev.org/publication/aid-institutions-paradox-review-essay-aid-dependency-and-state-building-sub-saharan|title=An Aid-Institutions Paradox? A Review Essay on Aid Dependency and State Building in Sub-Saharan Africa- Working Paper 74|work=Center For Global Development|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited government capacity resulting from subpar institutional presence and effectiveness leads to: “ubiquitous corruption of state officials, large gaps between the law and actual practice in business regulation, workers who do not even show up, doctors that do not doctor, teachers who do not teach.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pritchett|first=Lant|last2=Woolcock|first2=Michael|last3=Andrews|first3=Matt|date=2013-01-01|title=Looking Like a State: Techniques of Persistent Failure in State Capability for Implementation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00220388.2012.709614|journal=The Journal of Development Studies|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/00220388.2012.709614|issn=0022-0388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of healthy institutions or accountable governance, [[Nathan Nunn]] and [[Nancy Qian]] establish a positive, causal link between U.S. food aid to African countries and the incidence of civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nunn|first=Nathan|author2=Nancy Qian|title=Aiding Conflict: The Unintended Consequences of U.S. Food Aid on Civil War|journal=paper presented at the BREAD/NBER Conference|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their hypothesis reasons that food aid is fungible and a positive shock to government revenues, increasing the returns to the controlling government and therefore the potential for civil war as food can be easily monetized and used to fund conflict. The authors measured incidences of insurgency and conflict in East and Central Africa and their correlation with food aid, showing a positive and statistically significant relationship between the two. 

'''Studies and Literature on Aid Effectiveness'''

One problem of the studies on aid is that there is a lack of differentiation between the different types of aid. Some type of aids such as short-term aid do not affect economic growth while other aids used for infrastructure and investments will result in a positive economic growth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemens MA|first=et al.|date=2011|title=Counting Chickens when they Hatch: Timing and the Effects of Aid on Growth|url=https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/122/561/590/5079624|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=122|pages=590-617|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Different types of aid have also been shown to be more or less conditioned in their effects by recipients' quality of governance. For example, bilateral aid, aid in loans, and aid to the agricultural sector have been found to be mediated in their potentially positive effects on food security significantly more than multilateral aid, aid in grants, and aid to sectors other than agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrikova|first=Ivica|date=2015|title=Aid for food security: does it work?|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/IJDI-07-2014-0058?journalCode=ijdi|journal=International Journal of Development Issues|volume=14|pages=41-59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The emerging stories from aid-growth literature are that aid is effective under a wide variety of circumstances and that nonlinearities in the effect of aid reduce the significance of the aid-growth relationship. However, returns to aid show diminishing returns possibly because of absorption capacity and other constraints. Also, geographically-challenged countries would display lower effectiveness with respect to aid and that should be taken into account in allocation.

Therefore, the challenge to aid allocation is to identify and eliminate the overriding institutional and policy constraints that will reduce the effect of aid on growth. The real challenge is thus to develop a framework of ‘growth and development’ diagnostics to help identify the constraints. Stefan Schmitz believes that reporting duties, results-orientated action and ongoing performance assessments are essential for the sake of aid effectiveness, but political will must be already there for this to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/167079/index.en.shtml |title=Comprehensive thinking |access-date=2010-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706045452/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/167079/index.en.shtml |archive-date=2010-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars have debated whether foreign aid can result in regime change, either democratizing autocracies or turning democratic states into autocracies. Some of these scholars argue that when western donors condition aid so that recipient countries have to make democratic changes that these changes then lead to economic growth. Jakob Svensson found instead that governmental foreign aid can only be an effective source of economic growth in recipient countries who are already democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Svensson, Jakob. "Aid, Growth and Democracy." Economics and Politics 11.3 (1999): 275-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aid has quadrupled in the last 25 years, with the majority of aid still coming from official donors, and emerging giants such as [[China]] and India. In addition, money is being spent in different ways, for example on global programmes to combat specific issues, such as the control of malaria or measles.  [[Overseas Development Institute]] work argues for a redress of the way in which aid is provided through:
* Redesigning aid architecture and improving aid effectiveness
* Reforming public finance management
* Strengthening resource allocation and use at sector and local levels
* Improving national policy and planning processes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.org.uk/themes/aid Research on aid from the Overseas Development Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Research on the Accra Agenda for Action and Paris Declaration'''

Research by the Overseas Development Institute based on in-person interviews with senior politicians and government officials in Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and Zambia suggests that the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) and [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]]'s indicators are too narrowly defined and lack depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/2746.pdf Wathne, Cecilie and Hedger, Edward 2009. Aid effectiveness through the recipient lens]&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of "predictability" and "transparency" are highlighted as lacking depth and important sub-dimensions not given enough emphasis, for instance on adaptation to local contexts. The interviews revealed recipient governments felt "predictability" meant donors should provide funding within the quarters scheduled, the Paris Declaration work on an annual basis and makes no distinction between the first and fourth quarter. Also mentioned, were the differences between pledges and actual commitments, the need to speed up the approval process and the need to make explicit and achievable conditions on the aid, to prevent withholding of funds when minor conditions are not fully achieved. Transparency in the reasons for donors' decisions was also seen as very important, the need to be 'frank' about why less funding was disbursed than committed, why feedback from the recipient government was not taken on board, and why a given percentage of funds was earmarked for certain activities such as technical assistance (TA). The resulting conclusion from these interviews and other studies is that repeatedly, the three most important issues for donor recipients are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4800&amp;title=effective-multilateral-donor Cecilie Wathne and Edward Hedger 2010. What does an effective multilateral donor look like? London: Overseas Development Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;
* depth of commitment to development
* responsiveness to country circumstances, and
* support for recipient-driven policy
Those donor agencies highlighted by aid recipients as particularly attentive to these issues are the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) and the [[World Bank]], followed by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[Asian Development Bank]] (AsDB).

'''Beyond aid'''

There are an increasing number of studies and literature that argue aid alone is not enough to lift developing countries out of poverty.  Whether or not aid actually significantly affects growth, it does not operate in a vacuum.  An increasing number of donor country policies can either complement or hinder development, such as trade, investment, or migration.  The [[Commitment to Development Index]] published annually by the [[Center for Global Development]] is one such attempt to look at donor country policies toward the developing world and move beyond simple comparisons of aid given. It accounts for not only the quantity but the quality of aid, penalizing nations that given large amounts of tied aid.

'''''Rethinking the development aid model'''''

With the rampant criticisms to aid, come a whole host of prescriptions for alternatives. Offered up, are numerous ways in which countries can move forward without aid or with drastically rethought ways of processing it. In African economist, [[James Shikwati]]’s words, the “African problem is best solved by the African people”. “If aid was stopped, the political elites would be the first casualties” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shikwati |first=James |title=The Future of Africa in the World |journal=Inter Region Economic Network |year=2006 |pages=6 |url=http://www.irenkenya.com/modules/articles/index.php?article_title_id=18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617124226/http://www.irenkenya.com/modules/articles/index.php?article_title_id=18 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as their well of easy cash would dry up. The need for a solution to Africa’s problems would sharply rise and the benefits of entrepreneurship and trade would come into focus.
The need to build healthy institutions comes into play as well.

Noted Peruvian economist, [[Hernando De Soto]], in his book, ''The Mystery of Capital'' also firmly asserts that Africa already has the resource wealth it needs to pull itself out of poverty,  it just lacks the institutions that allow for the creation of wealth from these riches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Soto|first=Hernando|title=The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else.|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poor documentation of assets and the lack of property rights means that people cannot collateralize their assets, for example, if a farmer inhabits a tract of land that has been in his family for generations, in his view, for all intents and purposes, he owns the land. However he does not possess a title deed to the land that clearly demarcates the borders of his ownership, this means that he cannot put up this land as collateral to secure a loan. This simplistic example can help to explain why investment (and therefore growth) is inhibited, the spirit of entrepreneurship may be present, the tools to engage in it, however, are not. The answer therefore seems simple: create such institutions that provide transparent documentation of assets and allows them to be converted to liquidity with ease. In practice, however this may not be so simple and would involve major overhauls in the bureaucratic fabric of a state. How aid can help to foster better institutions then, becomes the main question.

Paul Collier, in ''The Bottom Billion'', suggests a model he calls “Independent Service Authorities”. These are organizations, independent from the government, that co-opt civil society to manage aid and public money and incorporate the scrutiny of public opinion and NGOs to determine how to maximize output from the expenditure of this money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collier|first=Paul|title=The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries Are failing and What Can Be Done about It.|year=2007|publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Easterly tells a story in ''The White Man’s Burden'', where he says that helping the approximate three million people infected with Malaria each year may not be as simple as sending nets over to Africa. A lot of the time, these nets are diverted to the black market and used for more entrepreneurial pursuits, for example, making fishing nets out of them. Easterly does go on to report however that when schemes are introduced where mosquito nets are available on the market for an affordable price, the usage of them increases drastically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Easterly|first=William|title=The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done so Much Ill and so Little Good|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New york}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He advocates the use of localized, tailored schemes like this to help the world’s poor and discounts ambitious overarching schemes that claim to be a complete panacea for poverty.

Dambisa Moyo devotes a whole section of her book, ''Dead Aid'' to rethinking the aid dependency model. She cautions that although “weaning governments off aid won’t be easy”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dambisa|first=Moyo|title=Dambisa Moyo on why aid has been a disaster for Africa|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyf2Cf5GkTY}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary. Primary among her prescriptions is a “capital solution” where African countries must enter the bond market to raise their capital for development, the interconnectedness that globalization has provided, will turn other “pools of money toward African markets in form of mutual funds, hedge funds, pension schemes” etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moyo|first=Dambisa|title=Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa.|year=2009|publisher=Douglas &amp; Mcintyre|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a bleak picture is painted of aid, with it comes room for new solutions and new ways of thinking about development

===Tied aid===

[[Tied aid]] is defined as project aid contracted by source to private firms in the donor country. It refers to aid tied to goods and services supplied exclusively by donor country businesses or agencies. Tied aid increases the cost of assistance and has the tendency of making donors to focus more on the commercial advancement of their countries than what developing countries need. There are many ways aid can be designed to pursue the commercial objectives of donors. One of such pervasive means is by insisting on donor country products.

Others have argued that tying aid to donor-country products is common sense; it is a strategic use of aid to promote donor country’s business or exports. It is further argued that tied aid - if well designed and effectively managed - would not necessarily compromise the quality as well as the effectiveness of aid.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeetey, 1995; Sowa 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this argument would hold particularly for programme aid, where aid is tied to a specific projects or policies and where there is little or no commercial interest. It must be emphasized, however, that commercial interest and aid effectiveness are two different things, and it would be difficult to pursue commercial interest without compromising aid effectiveness. Thus, the idea of maximizing development should be separated from the notion of pursuing commercial interest. Tied aid improves donors export performance, creates business for local companies and jobs. It also helps to expose firms, which have not had any international experience on the global market to do so.&lt;ref name="tiedaid"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112138351/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Tied Aid and Multi-Donor Budgetary Support], ''Journal of International Development'', Vol 17. Issue 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
Despite decades of receiving aid and experiencing different development models (which have had very little success), many developing countries' economies are still dependent on developed countries, and are deep in debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/third_world_countries.htm|title=First, Second, and Third World - Nations Online Project|last=nationsonline.org|first=klaus kästle -|website=www.nationsonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now a growing debate about why developing countries remain impoverished and underdeveloped after all this time. Many argue that current methods of aid are not working and are calling for reducing foreign aid (and therefore dependency) and utilizing different economic theories than the traditional mainstream theories from the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ozay Mehmet|Mehmet, Ozay]], (1995). Mainstream economic development theories have failed to come up with a model that appropriately supports development in developing countries. Westernizing the Third World (Ch 1), Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, development and aid have not accomplished the goals they were meant to, and currently the global gap between the rich and poor is greater than ever,&lt;ref name="Westra"&gt;Westra, Richard (2011). "Renewing Socialist Development in the Third World", [[Journal of Contemporary Asia]], 41(4): 519-543.&lt;/ref&gt; though not everybody agrees with this.&lt;ref name="cliodynamics.ru"&gt;Korotayev A., Zinkina J. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=361&amp;Itemid=1 On the structure of the present-day convergence. ''Campus-Wide Information Systems''. Vol. 31 No. 2/3, 2014, pp. 139-152]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue the problem of development amongst many developing countries through socioeconomic perspectives which study how individuals form organizations amongst each other for all kinds of goals, such as economic matters. Scholars like [[Douglass Cecil North|North]] and Weingast claim that modern states are composed of natural states and open access order states whereby open access order states have more positive development than natural states, because in these states, legally binding institutions (rules of the game, customs) allow individuals to freely form impersonal organizations that can attract a large group of people who work or compete with each other economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|last2=Wallis|last3=Weingast|first1=D.C|first2=J.J|first3=R.|title=Violence and social orders a conceptual framework for interpreting recorded human history|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more competition, the more wealth and growth is created. Examples of open access states are many Western countries like the United States and Germany.&lt;ref name="North"&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|last2=Wallis|last3=Weingast|first1=D.C|first2=J.J|first3=R.|title=Violence and social orders a conceptual framework for interpreting recorded human history|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a natural state (which compromises much of the third world) consists of political elites who try to protect their special privileges by restricting access to the ability to form organizations amongst individuals.&lt;ref name="North"/&gt;  These elites must rely on personal communication and the threat of violence to both maintain order and recruit "desirables" into the organizations. Such a set-up not only weakens good governance (as leaders are less accountable) but also leads to weak institutions, where peace is not always assured, as those in control of the means to inflict violence simply restrain themselves out of trust or loyalty, and can easily resort to violence, as has happened in the past (e.g., Biafra against the rest of Nigeria, Bangladesh against the rest of Pakistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|last2=Wallis|last3=Weingast|first1=D.C|first2=J.J|first3=R.|title=Violence and social orders a conceptual framework for interpreting recorded human history|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ways to improve aid effectiveness==

The Paris Declaration embodied a new, broad consensus on what needs to be done to produce better development results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness Working Party on Aid Effectiveness, "Transforming Global Partnership for Development, March 2010. Available at]&lt;/ref&gt; Its principles lay open the possible ways to undertake, which can be interpreted also as the major objectives of good aid: fostering recipient countries' ownership of development policies and strategies, maximizing donors' coordination and harmonization, improving aid transparency and mutual accountability of donors and recipients, just to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;See OECD, "The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness". March 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving aid transparency and mutual accountability of donors and recipients===

The Accra Agenda for Action states that transparency and accountability are essential elements for development results, as well as drivers of progress.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, "The Accra Agenda For Action", 3rd High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, September 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual accountability and transparency is one of the five partnership commitments of the Paris Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, "The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness". March 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Through 'transparency', donors and recipients can be held accountable for what they spend and aid can be made more effective by knowing the three Ws of transparency:
* Who gives money to which recipient?
* What project is being funded and for what purpose? and
* Where?&lt;ref&gt;Kharas, H., "Transparency: Changing the Accountability Engagement, and Effectiveness of Aid", in: Kharas, H., Makino, K., Jung, W., "Catalyzing Development", Brookings Institution Press, Washington, D.C. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency offers a valuable answer to insecurity, making aid "predictable" and "reliable". Transparency has been shown to improve service delivery and to reduce opportunities for diversion and therefore corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Bjorkman, M., Svensson, J., "Power to the People: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experience on Community-Based Monitoring in Uganda", ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 124, no. 2: 735-69, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency can be defined as a basic expression of mutual accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Robinson’s definition, in the OECD Survey on Monitoring The Paris Declaration, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual accountability can only work if there is a global culture of transparency that demands provision of information through a set of rules and behavioral norms, which are difficult to enforce in the case of official development cooperation. In particular for emerging economy donors and private development assistance, these norms are only at a nascent stage. Kharas&lt;ref&gt;See Kharas, H., "Transparency: Changing the Accountability Engagement, and Effectiveness of Aid", in: Kharas, H., Makino, K., Jung, W., "Catalyzing Development", Brookings Institution Press, Washington, D.C. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest to adopt the "regulation through information" approach,&lt;ref&gt;Majone, G. "The new European Agencies: regulation by information", ''Journal of European Public Policy'' 4, no. 2: 262-75, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; which as been developed and has proven its effectiveness in the case of the European integration. In fact, at the international level, when the enforcement of mandatory rules is difficult, the solution could be to provide and make available transparent, relevant, accurate and reliable information, which can be used to reward or sanction individual aid agencies according to their performances. This means establishing a strong culture of accountability within aid, which rewards aid successes but penalizes failures.

To achieve this, literature on the topic&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Pranay, S., and Hubbard, M., "A Future for Aid Data: Research towards a South-South Cooperation Data Categorization to complement on-going IATI Categorizations’", ongoing research, DFID Future of Aid and Beyond Research Competition 2010-11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that donors should agree on adopting a standardized format for providing information on volume, allocation and results, such as the [[International Aid Transparency Initiative]] (IATI), or other similar standards, and commit to improve recipient countries' databases with technical, financial and informational support. The format should be easily downloadable and with sufficient disaggregation to enable comparison with other data. Making aid data public and comparable among donors, would be likely to encourage a process of positive emulation towards a better usage of public funds.  After all, [[official development assistance]] (ODA) is a voluntary transfer that depends on the support of donor country taxpayers. Donors should therefore consider improving the transparency and traceability of aid funds also as a way of increasing engagement and support toward aid inside their own country. Moreover, a generalized adoption of IATI would ensure the publication of aid information in a timely way, the compatibility with developing countries' budgets and the reliability of future projections, which would have a strong and positive effect on the predictability of aid.&lt;ref&gt;Kharas, H., Makino, K., Jung, W., "Catalyzing Development", Brookings Institution Press, Washington, D.C. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, to improve accountability while building evaluation capabilities in aid recipient countries and systematically collecting beneficiaries’ feedback, different mechanisms to evaluate and monitor transparency should be considered, such as independent third-party reviews, peer reviews or mutual reviews.&lt;ref&gt;See Droop, J., Isenman, P., and Mlalazi, B., "Mutual accountability in Aid Effectiveness: International-Level Mechanisms", Briefing Note, n.3, Oxford Policy Management, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (2011 to present)==

The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) was created at the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan in 2011. This platform brought together governments, bilateral and multilateral organisations, civil society and representatives from parliaments and the private sector, committed to strengthening the effectiveness of development co-operation to produce maximum impact for development. 161 countries and 56 organisations endorsed the creation of the Global Partnership in the 2011 Busan Partnership agreement.

Through its multi-stakeholder platform, the Global Partnership provides support, guidance and shares knowledge to boost development impact with a strong country focus, and to ensure a degree of coherence and collaboration among all development stakeholders on co-operation flows and policies. It offers a global mechanism to ensure co-operation is based on Busan principles of ownership, results, inclusiveness; and transparency and accountability to deliver tangible results on the post-2015 agenda. As a voluntary and multi-stakeholder forum, the Global Partnership plays a role in supporting implementation of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. As noted in the UN Secretary General’s Synthesis report in 2015, the Global Partnership can “help review and strengthen the global partnership for sustainable development”.

The Global Partnership also tracks progress in the implementation of Busan commitments for more effective development co-operation, through its [http://effectivecooperation.org/monitoring-country-progress/what-is-global-partnership-monitoring/ monitoring framework] consisting of a set of 10 indicators, with most targets set for 2015. These indicators focus on strengthening developing country institutions, increasing transparency and predictability of development co-operation, enhancing gender equality, as well as supporting greater involvement of civil society, parliaments and private sector in development efforts.

Results from the Global Partnership's 2016 monitoring round reveal important progress towards achieving the development effectiveness goals agreed in Busan in 2011 at the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, especially in adopting a decisive focus on results for more impact at the country level, in setting good foundations for more effective partnerships amongst governments, civil society organisation and the private sector; in improving transparency by making more publicly available information on development co-operation available than ever before, and in enhancing national budgetary systems to better capture development co-operation flows and allocations for gender equality.&lt;ref name="effectivecooperation.org"&gt;OECD/UNDP (2016). Making Development Co-operation More Effective: 2016 Progress Report. Retrieved on 09 Dec 2016 from http://effectivecooperation.org/2016/11/2016-monitoring-report-released/&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, monitoring also reveal an overall need to adapt to a dynamic and evolving development landscape, as well as specific areas where concerted effort is required to enhance development partnerships and unlock existing bottlenecks, including: increasing the use of countries’ own systems to deliver, manage, and track the impact of development programmes; and making countries’ efforts to strengthen domestic institutions more effective. Engagement and accountability structures at country level around development co-operation also need to become more inclusive and transparent, in order to facilitate meaningful dialogue and joint action.&lt;ref name="effectivecooperation.org"/&gt;

==The International Health Partnership's work on aid effectiveness (2007 to present)==
The [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+) is a group of national governments, development partners, [[civil society]] and others committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries. The initiative was launched in September 2007, bringing together 26 signatories to sign a [[Pact|Global Compact]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/CMS_files/documents/ihp_global_compact_EN.pdf PDF signed version from the Global Compact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226135347/http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/CMS_files/documents/ihp_global_compact_EN.pdf |date=2012-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for achieving the health [[Millennium Development Goals]]. As of May 2012, 56 signatories have signed the Global Compact. The partnership is jointly administered by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]].

Improving health and health services is a complex task in any country. It involves coordination between governments, health workers, civil society, parliamentarians and other stakeholders. In developing countries, money for health comes from both domestic and external resources. This means governments must work with a range of international development partners. These are increasing in number, use different funding streams and have diverse bureaucratic demands. As a result, efforts can become fragmented and resources can be wasted.

IHP+ puts international principles for aid effectiveness and development cooperation set forth in the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]], Accra Agenda for Action and Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation into practice in the health sector by encouraging wide support for a single national health strategy or plan, a single monitoring and evaluation framework, and a strong emphasis on mutual partner accountability. The Partnership aims to build confidence between all in-country stakeholders whose activities affect health.

'''Bad Boy Joe''' (born '''Joe Marcano''' in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]]-[[United States|American]] [[Disc Jockey|DJ]], [[Music Producer|producer]] and [[remixer]]. He's best known for his megamixes, which appeared on [[Louie DeVito]]'s ''NYC Underground Party'', ''Dance Factory'' and ''Dance Divas'' mix series. He can be heard on [[WKTU]] from 5-6 and also on had a mixshow "The Megamix" every Saturday night from 11-midnight on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] The Beat channel 36. After November 12, 2008, The Beat was replaced with [[BPM (Sirius XM)|BPM]] and is no longer on the channel. He also produces a series of shows and events for [[New York City]]'s reigning [[Dance music]] station [[WKTU]], more recently KTU's Beatstock. He owns his own record label entitled "What If Productions".

In 1999, he finally got his big break after catching the eye of another DJ around the [[New York City|New York]] area [[Louie DeVito]], who hired Joe to help him with his ''NYC Underground Party'' mix series before releasing his own series of mixed compilation albums.

The '''Battle of Massawa''' (also known as the '''First Battle of Massawa''') took place from 1977 to 1978 in and around the coastal city of [[Massawa]] in [[Eritrea]]. The port was besieged by the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF) against the forces of [[Ethiopia]], and was one of two battles in and around the city.

==The battle==
By 1977 EPLF soldiers had claimed all of Massawa save the port itself.&lt;ref name="ACIG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper |first=Tom |title=Ethiopia and Eritrea, 1950-1991 |date=2003-09-02 |url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/printer_179.shtml |accessdate=2006-12-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206175724/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/printer_179.shtml |archivedate=2006-12-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the main road used by the garrison for the transport of supplies from [[Asmara]]. Essentially the garrison was cut off by land and under siege.

On 23 December 1977, the EPLF began a strike through an open field towards the salt flats and port. Soviet warships began to shell EPLF-held portions of the town to prevent its occupation by the EPLF, especially the downtown areas.&lt;ref name="ACIG" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Soviet Push for Power|publisher=Time|date=1978-02-06|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945955,00.html|accessdate=2006-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian victory was attributed to the intervention of the Soviet Union on behalf of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Payton|first=Gary|title=The Soviet-Ethiopian Liaison|journal=Air University Review|volume=XXX|issue=1|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1979/nov-dec/payton.html|accessdate=2006-12-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123214224/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1979/nov-dec/payton.html|archive-date=2007-11-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This defeat led to a withdrawal, dubbed the ''strategic withdrawal'', into Sahel, the strategic, EPLF-held mountaintops around the town of [[Nakfa, Eritrea|Nakfa]]. This battle was also the beginning of direct Soviet involvement in the [[Eritrean War of Independence]], which would continue in other battles.

The '''Battle of Pyongyang''' (17–19 October 1950) was one of the major battles of [[UN Offensive, 1950|the United Nations' offensive]] during the [[Korean War]]. Following the [[Battle of Inchon]], the UN forces [[Second Battle of Seoul|re-captured Seoul]], the capital of [[South Korea]], and proceeded to advance north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]. Shortly after advancing, the American and South Korean forces faced the North Korean defenses near [[Pyongyang]], the capital of [[North Korea]], on 17 October.

North Korea's leadership and its main forces had already withdrawn to [[Kanggye]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mossman |first=Billy |date=June 29, 2005 |title=United States Army in the Korean War: Ebb and Flow November 1950 – July 1951 |publisher=University Press of the Pacific |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the allied forces to capture Pyongyang on 19 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Stokesbury |first = James L |year = 1990 |title = A Short History of the Korean War |publisher = Harper Perennial |location = New York |isbn = 0-688-09513-5 |p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was followed by an [[Battle of Yongju|airborne assault]] by the [[187th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 187th Infantry Regiment]]  {{convert|25|mi|}}  north of Pyongyang, with the intention of cutting off North Korean units retreating from the city.&lt;ref name="awm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Out in the Cold: Australia's involvement in the Korean War {{!}} The Australian War Memorial|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/visit/exhibitions/korea/operations/yongju|website=www.awm.gov.au|accessdate=16 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2506">The '''Black Country Urban Park''' is an ambitious proposal to transform the environment of the [[Black Country]] through positive action at an unprecedented scale.

The heart of the [[industrial revolution]], the [[Black Country]] went into a serious economic decline in the 1980s, with the loss of almost all the heavy industry,especially [[Foundry|metal founding]]. Having had the longest history of heavy industry of any urban area in the world the area was left with a legacy of dereliction and contamination. Combined with considerable [[Relative deprivation|economic deprivation]] - amongst the highest levels in the [[UK]].

The aim of the Black Country Urban Park is to turn around the area's fortunes, making it a desirable place for businesses to relocate and reverse the current trend for [[Human migration|outmigration]].

The lead partners in the development of the Urban Park are [[Black Country Consortium]], the [[Metropolitan Borough]] councils of [[Metropolitan Borough of Dudley|Dudley]], [[Sandwell]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall|Walsall]], [[Wolverhampton|Wolverhampton City Council]], [[Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country]] and [[British Waterways]].

The Urban Park proposal was an unsuccessful, second place, contender for the Peoples £50 Million lottery competition organised by the [[Big Lottery Fund|BIG Lottery Fund]].

"'''Butterflies'''" is a song, written by [[Maxim Fadeev]], [[Robert Wells (composer)|Robert Wells]] and [[Malka Chaplin]] and performed by [[Belarus]]ian group [[3+2 (band)|3+2]], and was the Belarusian entry at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]], held in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] in May 2010. [[3+2 (band)|3+2]] had been internally selected in March 2010 to represent Belarus in the contest by the Belarusian broadcaster [[National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus|BTRC]], initially with the song "[[Far Away (3+2 song)|Far Away]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=9533&amp;_t=3%2B2+equals+12+for+Belarus+in+Eurovision%3F|title=3+2 equals 12 for Belarus in Eurovision?|last=Dahlander|first=Gustav|date=25 February 2010|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15210|title=Belarus: 3+2 to Eurovision|last=Murray|first=Gavin|date=25 February 2010|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 19 March it was announced that 3+2 had changed their song for the contest, and would now be singing "Butterflies" in the first semi-final on 25 May. They qualified for the final, for the only second time in the history for Belarus (the first since 2007). However, in the final, they finished 24th out of 25. With three countries left to vote, they got 12 points from Georgia, thus they moved one place up and left the United Kingdom in last place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15414|title=Belarus change entry for Oslo|last=Montebello|first=Edward|date=19 March 2010|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=10603&amp;_t=Belarus%3A+3%2B2+to+perform+Butterflies+in+Oslo|title=Belarus: 3+2 to perform Butterflies in Oslo|last=Schacht|first=Andreas|date=19 March 2010|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cheval Gauvin''' (French : Gauvin horse) is a legendary evil horse of [[Franche-Comté]], France and the [[Jura Mountains]] in Switzerland. It is said to frequent watercourses, forests or cemeteries and to kill those who mount it by drowning them or throwing them into chasms.

The horse is mentioned close to [[Chamblay]] by Désiré Monnier from 1854. It is a harbinger of death, and appears to have been a kind of [[bogeyman]] for children. Possibly a transformed [[lutin]] (hobgoblin) it is one of a number of legendary horses of Jura. [[Jean-Louis Thouard]] depicted it in 1996.

[[File:1651 Coat of arms of Mide.png|thumb|250px|right|1651 Arms of Mide]]

[[Mide]] or Meath, a medieval [[Provinces of Ireland|Irish province]], is sometimes represented by a [[coat of arms]] comprising a [[monarch]] "in majesty": that is, seated on a [[throne]] on a [[field (heraldry)|field]] of [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] (blue).&lt;ref name="nli"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nli.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=72fd744a-aced-43b4-a63b-b64be7b272ec |publisher=[[National Library of Ireland]] |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2008-03-17 |title=Heraldry in Ireland |page=3 |format=[[PDF]] |first=Eoin |last=Carragin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.library.nuigalway.ie&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of Mide appear alongside those of the four modern provinces on a 1651 map of [[Galway]]. The arms reflect the fact that [[Hill of Tara|Tara]], the seat of the [[High King of Ireland]], was in Mide.&lt;ref name="nli"/&gt; This symbolism is derived from [[iconography]] rather than classical [[heraldry]];&lt;ref name="nli"/&gt; mediaeval [[royal seal]]s portrayed a [[majesty]] on the [[obverse]] and the arms of the sovereign on the reverse. The [[sceptre]], here shown to have six oval nodules, represented [[political power|power]], and the outstretched right hand [[justice]]; both of these were [[royal prerogative]]s.&lt;ref name="nli"/&gt;  
The old province of Meath is nearly coextensive with the present-day [[Diocese of Meath]]. The arms of Meath were apparently used at one time as the [[arms of Ireland]], but with the majesty on a field of [[sable (heraldry)|sable]] (black) instead of azure.&lt;ref name="nli"/&gt;

[[Meath GAA]] uses a logo incorporating the arms. The arms of [[Meath County Council]] are [[List of Irish counties' coats of arms|an unrelated design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldry.ws/regional/index.html |title=Irish Civic &amp; Regional Coats of Arms |date= |accessdate=2008-03-17 |publisher=heraldry.ws }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Colgado de un sueño"''' ({{IPA-es|kolˈɣaðo ðe un ˈsweɲo}}, "Hanging From a Dream") was the [[Spain|Spanish]] entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in the year [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]]. It was performed by the blind singer and pianist [[Serafín Zubiri]], who had finished fourteenth for Spain in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992 Eurovision Song Contest]] with "[[Todo esto es la música]]". It was written by José María Purón, who had previously written "[[Vuelve conmigo]]", the runner up song in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995]] representing Spain.

The song, which had a gentle verse and catchy chorus, was about the power of dreams, and how nothing is impossible in dreams. Zubiri also recorded an [[English language]] version of the song, entitled "Dancing on Rainbows".

On stage in Stockholm Zubiri accompanied himself on piano, dressed all in black and wearing dark glasses. He was accompanied by four backing singers; two women in lilac gowns and two men in black suits.

The song was performed 13th on the night, following [[Iceland]]'s [[August &amp; Telma]] with "[[Tell Me!]]" and preceding [[Denmark]]'s [[Olsen Brothers]] with "[[Fly on the Wings of Love]]". At the close of voting it had received 18 points, finishing in equal 18th place in a field of 24.

The song was succeeded as [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spanish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest|2001 Contest]] by [[David Civera]] singing "[[Dile que la quiero]]".

'''Dalit studies''' is a new field of research in India which looks at the problem of marginalised groups, namely [[Dalits]], [[Adivasis|tribals]], religious minorities, women from excluded groups, denotified tribes, physically challenged and similar groups in economic, social and political spheres. Dalit studies scholars also undertake research on the nature and forms of discrimination and social exclusion faced by marginalised groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yadav|first1=Bhupendra|title=A different take on Dalit studies|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/A-different-take-on-Dalit-studies/article14672748.ece|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=The Hindu|date=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad objectives of Dalit studies can be delineated as follows:

*To  undertake research to develop an understanding of the consequences of social exclusion and discrimination on economic growth and poverty, education, health, political participation and on the well-being of the marginalised social groups.
*To undertake research on policies to overcome discrimination, particularly 'exclusion and discrimination-induced deprivation' and its consequences.
*To provide knowledge support to policy-making bodies to develop inclusive policies.	
*To provide knowledge support to international development and funding agencies to enable them to shape their approach and funding policies towards problems of excluded groups.
*To provide knowledge-support to civil society organisations at the grassroot, state and national levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agarwal|first1=Kritika|title=The Rise of Dalit Studies and Its Impact on the Study of India: An Interview with Historian Ramnarayan Rawat|url=http://blog.historians.org/2016/06/the-rise-of-dalit-studies-and-its-impact-on-the-study-of-india-an-interview-with-historian-ramnarayan-rawat/|website=AHA Blog|publisher=American Historical Association|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dead Birds''''' is a 1963&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z7p36FdLYdIC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;dq=dead+birds+robert+gardner+1963&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CsopH4ZGwc&amp;sig=QXpnDO1JMIEAutwS20z_5Xr787E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VeQbUKqCJ4Pd4QSBzYDgCA&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=dead%20birds%20robert%20gardner%201963&amp;f=false Nonfiction Film:A Critical History], p295, Richard Meran Barsam, Indiana University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0253207061}}, 9780253207067&lt;/ref&gt;  [[documentary film]] by [[Robert Gardner (anthropologist)|Robert Gardner]] about the [[Dani people]] of [[New Guinea]]. It was produced as part of the [[Harvard]]-[[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody]] Expedition to study the highlands of [[New Guinea]], at that time one of the few remaining areas in the world uncolonized by [[European ethnic groups|European]]s.&lt;ref name=nyt2011&gt;{{cite news |title=Bringing Faraway Worlds Closer, And Questioning Western Intrusions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/movies/retrospective-of-robert-gardner-ethnographer-at-film-forum.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= November 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere of Dead Birds took place at the Loeb Drama Center at Harvard University in October 1963.
In 1998, this film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Synopsis==
The film's title is borrowed from a Dani fable that Gardner recounts in [[voice-over]]. The Dani people, whom Gardner identifies mysteriously as "a mountain people," believe that there was once a great race between a bird and a snake, which was to determine the lives of human beings. Should men shed their skins and live forever like snakes, or die like birds? The bird won the race, dictating that man must die.

The film's plot revolves around two characters, Weyak and Pua. Weyak is a warrior who guards the frontier between the land of his tribe and that of the neighboring tribe. Pua is a young boy whom Gardner depicts as weak and inept.

==Criticism==
Though stylistically impressive, ''Dead Birds'' has been criticized with respect to its authenticity. The characters who speak in the film are never subtitled, and even then the voice itself is not always what it seems. What the audience perceives as Weyak's voice is actually a post-filming dub of [[Karl G. Heider]] speaking Dani. Gardner himself did not speak Dani, and so all his interpretations of events are second-hand. The battle sequences are made up of many shots taken during different battles and stitched together to give the appearance of temporal unity. The apparent continuity stems from the post-synchronized sound, and in fact all the sound in the film is post-synched. Heider, himself, admits in his book ''Ethnographic Film'', that some of the battle films were edited out of sequence, intercut with scene from the women at the salt pool, which was also taken at a different time.&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Karl. ''Ethnographic Film''. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1977">A concept of [[European Union]] constitutional law that relates specifically to ''regulations'', '''direct applicability''' (or the characteristic of regulations to be ''directly effective'') is set out in Article 288 (ex Article 249) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (as amended by the [[Lisbon Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Although often confused with the doctrine of [[direct effect]], direct applicability refers to the fact that regulations require no implementing legislation within individual member states - they take effect as soon as they are [[Official Journal of the European Union|published]] by the [[European Commission]].

This confusion is perhaps explained by reference to the treaty provision governing regulations which provides that they, and only they, have ''direct applicability'' within the member states. The early jurisprudence of the ECJ suggested that 'direct effect' was a consequence of direct applicability as it was thought that the drafters of the original treaty intended regulations, and only regulations, to be directly effective. However, the expansion of the doctrine of direct effect to include directives and other measures served to create a distinction between direct applicability and direct effect.  ''Direct applicability'' is now taken to mean that regulations require no domestic implementation - if direct effect was only ever intended to be a consequence of direct applicability then the relationship has been severed by a series of ECJ cases.

The '''Free TV Alliance''' is a collaboration between the four major European free [[Digital television|digital]] [[satellite television]] broadcasters to promote free satellite TV and the technology used in its broadcasts and reception

The aims of the alliance are 'to promote the harmonisation of satellite TV services and technology across Europe' to support the growth of free TV services in Europe and to make the manufacturer of reception equipment easier and cheaper. In particular the Free TV Alliance intends to establish 'common service approaches, open source specifications and preferred technologies that work across all products in all markets'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetva.tv/about/ Free TV Alliance website] Accessed November 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The Free TV Alliance is made up of the four main European [[free-to-air]] and [[free-to-view]] satellite broadcasters.

*[[Freesat]]
The free-to-air digital satellite television joint venture between the [[BBC]] and [[ITV plc]] to serve the United Kingdom. Formed in 2007, Freesat broadcasts in SD and HD from the [[Astra 28.2°E]] position.

*[[HD+]]
The [[free-to-view]] package of high-definition digital satellite TV channels for German-speaking viewers owned by [[SES S.A.|SES]]. Founded in 2009, HD+ broadcasts from the [[Astra 19.2°E]] position.

*Fransat
The [[free-to-view]] package of SD and HD channels broadcast to residents of France who cannot receive the digital terrestrial TV channels. Fransat broadcasts from the Eutelsat 5 West A satellite.

*[[Tivù Sat]]
A package of free-to-air and free-to-view Italian-language channels available on national TV networks, owned by a consortium of Italian communications companies including [[RAI]]. Formed in 2009, Tivù Sat broadcasts from the Eutelsat Hot Bird satellites.

==History==
The formation of the Free TV Alliance was announced at the 2014 [[International Broadcasting Convention|IBC]] broadcasting show in Amsterdam on September 12, 2014 as a partnership between Freesat, Fransat and Tivù Sat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltveurope.net/242012/european-satellite-operators-partner-for-free-tv-alliance/ European satellite operators partner for Free TV Alliance] September 13, 2014. Digital TV Europe. Accessed November 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's HD+ was slated to be a founding member but was not included at this time.

HD+ announced that it had joined the Free TV Alliance on October 29, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=HD+ |date=October 29, 2014 |url=http://www.hd-plus.de/#/hd-plus/presse/hd-plus-engagiert-sich-in-der-europischen-free-tv-alliance |title=HD+ engagiert sich in der europäischen FreeTV Alliance (German) |accessdate = November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the Free TV Alliance issued its first suite of technical specifications, offering  a common way for an operator’s mobile app to control the TV viewing experience on the TV screen, aimed at harmonising the  technology across Europe and removing complexities for equipment manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Free TV Alliance |date=March 23, 2015 |url=http://www.freetva.tv/news |title=FREETV ALLIANCE DELIVERS ON TV INDUSTRY INITIATIVE FOR OPEN STANDARDS |accessdate = March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FTA and FTV==
Free satellite TV services (i.e. not [[pay-TV]]) in Europe take the form of either [[free-to-air]] (FTA) or [[free-to-view]] (FTV) broadcasts. Free-to-air services are transmitted in the clear without [[encryption]] and can be received by anyone with a suitable receiving [[satellite dish|dish]] antenna and [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-compliant receiver. These services can include proprietary data services such as an [[electronic program guide|EPG]] that is only available to reception equipment made for, or authorised by, the FTA broadcaster. Free-to-view services are broadcast encrypted and can only be viewed with reception equipment that includes a suitable [[conditional-access module]] and viewing card, in the same way as a pay-TV satellite service. However, the FTV service viewing card is usually a means to restrict access to the service to a specific geographic area or to pay for the delivery of the platform as a whole and not to authorise viewing of individual channels or packages of channels, and may be made available for a regular fee, a one-off payment or even for free.

HD+, in particular, has come in for criticism for describing itself as Free-to-view and joining the Free TV Alliance because of the service fee charged for its viewing cards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.a516digital.com/2014/11/where-free-tv-will-cost-you.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, that all the HD+ channels are also available free to [[Sky Deutschland]] HD subscribers underlines that the HD+ service fee is for the provision of the platform, as explained in 2009 by Ferdinand Kayser, then president and CEO of SES Astra, "The fact that a free TV channel, financed by advertising or public fees, is encrypted, does not mean that it becomes a pay-TV channel. [[Cable TV]], for example, is also not pay-TV just because the access to the cable costs money. The same applies to public TV for which you have to pay a [licence] fee. And the same principle applies to HD+: the annual cost ... is a service fee ... which is related to the reception of the offer and not to specific content, parts or packages of the offer.”&lt;ref&gt;Briel, Robert [http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/09/10/kayser-give-details-about-hd-platform/''Kayser rebuffs critics of HD+ platform''] ''Broadband TV News''  September 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John King Davis''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (19 February 1884{{spaced ndash}}8 May 1967) was an [[England|English-born]] Australian [[exploration|explorer]] and [[navigator]] notable for his work captaining exploration ships in [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] waters as well as for establishing [[weather station|meteorological station]]s on [[Macquarie Island]] in the subantarctic and on [[Willis Island (Coral Sea)|Willis Island]] in the [[Coral Sea]].

==Early life==
Davis's formal education, at [[Colet Court]], London, and at [[Burford School|Burford Grammar School]], Oxfordshire, ended in 1900, when he and his father left London for [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= John | last= Béchervaise | title=Davis, John King (1884–1967) | url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080262b.htm | work=Australian Dictionary of Biography | accessdate =16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early exploration work===
Davis served as Chief Officer of the ''[[Nimrod (ship)|Nimrod]]'' during [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Nimrod Expedition|Antarctic expedition]] in 1908–1909. He was [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] of the ''[[SY Aurora|Aurora]]'' and second in command of [[Douglas Mawson]]'s [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] in 1911–1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Bright Sparcs entry on John King Davis | url =http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/biogs/P001009b.htm | work=Bright Sparcs | accessdate =16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Davis volunteered for active service, and was put in charge of the troop transport [[HMAT Boonah|HMAT ''Boonah'']], carrying troops and horses to Egypt and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Captain John King Davis | url =http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=29573 | work=Australian Antarctic Division | accessdate =16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as Captain of the ''[[RRS Discovery|Discovery]]'' in 1929–1930 in the course of the [[British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition]].

Davis was Australia's Commonwealth Director of Navigation from 1920 to 1949. It was at the beginning of this period that he volunteered to personally set up the remote Willis Island meteorological and [[cyclone]] warning station in 1921–22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=P. | last=Fletcher | title=Seventy-Five Years at Willis Island.

[[File:Gallen-Kallela Joukahainen's revenge.jpg|thumb|Joukahainen preparing to shoot [[Väinämöinen]]]]
'''Joukahainen''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈjoukɑhɑinen}}) is a character in the [[Kalevala]], the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]] of fifty parts. He is the rival of the main character, [[Väinämöinen]]. After losing a singing contest, he pledges his sister [[Aino (mythology)|Aino]] to Väinämöinen, but she drowns herself rather than marry him. Joukahainen, still envious of Väinämöinen, then shoots the stag of his rival from under him, plunging him into the waters of [[Pohjola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kalevala: the Finnish national epic - thisisFINLAND|url = http://finland.fi/arts-culture/kalevala-the-finnish-national-epic/|website = thisisFINLAND|accessdate = 2015-11-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original translation into [[English language|English]] (by [[John Martin Crawford (scholar)|John Martin Crawford]] (1888)) this character's name was [[Anglicised]] as Youkahainen.

[[File:Bern Willadingweg 65 Embassy of Liechtenstein in Switzerland DSC01386.jpg|thumb|Liechtenstein embassy in [[Bern]], Switzerland.]]

'''Diplomatic relations between [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]''' have been close due to Switzerland's role in safeguarding the interests of its smaller neighbour, Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name="bilateral"&gt;[http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/topics/fl.html Principality of Liechtenstein], Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperation==
At the request of Liechtenstein's government in 1919, Switzerland safeguards Liechtenstein's interests and citizens abroad. The two form a common economic and monetary area (Liechtenstein has used the [[Swiss franc]] (since 1920) and has had a [[customs union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/tp150_e.htm|title= Switzerland and Liechtenstein: December 2000|date=2000-12-06|accessdate=2012-09-16|publisher=[[World Trade Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (since 1924) with Switzerland) with open borders (though both are now also party to the [[Schengen Agreement]]).&lt;ref name="bilateral"/&gt; The countries also have a [[Unitary patent (Switzerland and Liechtenstein)|common patent]] system. Switzerland is empowered to enter into treaties on Liechtenstein's behalf if Liechtenstein is not represented at the treaty negotiations; this power has most often been exercised with treaties involving customs duties or procedures.

Swiss [[consular protection]] is extended to citizens of Liechtenstein. Switzerland represents Liechtenstein abroad unless they choose otherwise.&lt;ref name="bilateral"/&gt; Before Liechtenstein became a member in its own right of the [[European Free Trade Association]], Switzerland represented its interests in that organization.

The two also share a common language ([[German language|German]]) and are both outside the [[European Union]]. Liechtenstein relies on Switzerland for its national defence as it has no army of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/02/markoliver|title=Liechtenstein: no retaliation for Swiss 'invasion'|last=Oliver|first=Mark|date=2007-03-02|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like its neighbour, it maintains a policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]]. Ambassadors to one country are usually accredited to both (the only one resident in the country is from the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]).

==Incidents involving the Swiss military==
[[File:Grenze Liechtenstein, Balzers.jpg|thumb|The open border between the two countries at [[Balzers]] and [[Trübbach]]]]
[[Switzerland]] has a relatively active military due to ongoing [[conscription]]. Several incidents have occurred during routine training:

* On 5 December 1985, rockets fired by the [[Swiss Army]] landed in Liechtenstein, causing a forest fire. Compensation was paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Switzerland Invades Neighbor|url=http://www.ooblick.com/weblog/2007/03/05/switzerland-invades-neighbor|publisher=Swiss French Television|date=2007-03-05|accessdate=2009-11-28}}{{unreliable source?|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 13 October 1992, following written orders, Swiss Army cadets unknowingly crossed the border and went to [[Triesen]] to set up an observation post. Swiss commanders had overlooked the fact that Triesenberg was not on Swiss territory. Switzerland apologized to Liechtenstein for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swiss Inform Liechtenstein of Error in Troop Maneuvers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/18/world/swiss-inform-liechtenstein-of-error-in-troop-maneuvers.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Triesenberg&amp;st=nyt
|newspaper=New York Times|date=1992-10-18|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In March 2007, a company of 171 Swiss soldiers mistakenly entered Liechtenstein, they were disorientated and took a wrong turn due to bad weather conditions. The troops returned to Swiss territory before they had travelled more than 2&amp;nbsp;km into the country. The Liechtenstein authorities did not discover the incursion and were informed by the Swiss after the incident. The incident was disregarded by both sides. A Liechtenstein spokesman said "It's not like they invaded with attack helicopters. No problem, these things happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6415531.stm|title=Swiss in Liechtenstein 'invasion' |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=2921407&amp;page=1|title=Whoops! Swiss Accidentally Invade Liechtenstein |publisher=ABC News |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation and tax treaties==

Liechtenstein's standard rate of [[VAT]] (Mehrwertsteuer) is identical to Switzerland's for it must mirror the latter's continually and is currently 7.7%. The reduced rate is 2.5%. A special reduced rate of 3.7% is in use in the hotel industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.vatlive.com/vat-news/liechtenstein-cuts-vat-to-7-7-2018/ | title=Liechtenstein cuts VAT to 7.7% 2018 - Avalara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, both countries signed a new agreement on [[double taxation]], which took effect in December 2016, superseding the previous one from 1995. Some differences on the [[withholding tax]] arose, but Switzerland did not agree to introduce this practice to residents of Liechtenstein working in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/liechtenstein-scheitert-mit-quellensteuer-fuer-grenzgaenger-1.18476756 Liechtenstein scheitert mit Quellensteuer für Grenzgänger](in German). ''Neue Zürcher Zeitung (Schweiz)''. Retrieved 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2016, the parliament of the principality decided with a large majority to introduce an agreement of automatic information exchange with 27 new treaty partners, including Switzerland. Data collection will start in 2018, and effectual exchange of account information is planned for 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blick.ch/news/ausland/informationsaustausch-liechtenstein-und-schweiz-tauschen-kontoinformationen-aus-id7580999.html Liechtenstein und Schweiz tauschen Kontoinformationen aus](in German).

'''Local Economic Development''' ('''LED''') is an approach to [[economic development]], of note in the [[developing world]] that, as [[local economy|its name implies]], places importance on activities in and by cities, districts and regions. This involves added micro-economic measures at the local level to complement macro-economic measures at the national level. LED encompasses a range of disciplines including physical planning, economics and marketing, all with the goal of building up the economic capacity of a local area to improve its economic future and the quality of life for all.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTLED/0,,contentMDK:20185186~menuPK:399161~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:341139,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
According to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), national and local governments, as well as enterprises and other organisations have to rethink development strategies to cope with ongoing events such as [[globalization]]. In contrast to traditional development policies, Local Economic Development strategies promote local dialogue and enable people to be more proactive; help to make local institutions better contribute to development; make economic activity dependent on the comparative advantages of a specific territory, generating development by firms more capable to withstand changes in the global economic environment rather than top-down development imposed by national planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learning.itcilo.org/entdev/led/pub/home.aspx?l=Eng&amp;IdSezione=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501123347/http://learning.itcilo.org/entdev/LED/pub/home.aspx?l=Eng&amp;IdSezione=0 |archivedate=2007-05-01 |df= }} ILO Website on LED&lt;/ref&gt; Economic development activities in developing countries tend to be unidisciplinary, initiated and implemented by just one ministry or agency. An advantage of LED approaches is that they facilitate a multidisciplinary approach. [[South Africa]] has been particularly active in promoting the concept.&lt;ref&gt;http://led.public-hub.com/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The South African LED Network&lt;/ref&gt;

===LED in South Africa: pro-poor vs. pro-growth===
Many LED interventions in South Africa have taken a direct pro-poor intervention, leading to questions regarding whether this approach is more effective in terms of poverty relief than the spin-offs of more pro-growth focused endeavours.The Microeconomic Reform Strategy is a central component of the 2005 policy guidelines for implementing LED in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. "Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa."&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy seeks to address the inequalities in the country and to build on the RDP (Reconstruction and Development Program), by focusing on issues of the geographical spread of activity, integration, black economic empowerment, knowledge-led growth, skills development and state responsiveness.

In addition to the laws and policies directly supporting and encouraging pro-poor 
LED, other instruments, such as Integrated Development Planning, provide additional support for implementation. Integrated Development Planning is a key process used within LED, which looks toward the use of planning to situate pro-poor development and LED specifically.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. "Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa."&lt;/ref&gt; The South African Forum for Effective Planning and Development in 1995 defined Integrated Development Planning as, ‘A participatory approach to integrate economic, sectoral, spatial, social, institutional, environmental and fiscal strategies in order to support the optimal allocation of scarce resources between sectors and geographical areas and across the population in a manner that provides sustainable growth, equity and the empowerment of the poor and the marginalised’(DPLG, 15).&lt;ref&gt;Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs (DPLG), 2000: Local Economic Development: Guideline to Institutional Arrangements, Local Economic Development Manual Series Volume 1, DPLG, Pretoria.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrated Development Planning====
In terms of what an 'Integrated Development Plan' (IDP) should include, the Municipal Systems Act clearly brings out the pro-poor dimensions of government thinking. The Act states that an integrated development plan must reflect:&lt;ref&gt;RSA, 2000a: Local Government Municipal Systems Bill, Government Gazette No. 21071 of 13 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The municipal council's vision for the long-term development of the municipality. Special emphasis is to be placed on the municipality’s most critical development needs
* An assessment of the existing level of development in the municipality. This should include the identification of any communities which do not have access to adequate basic services
* The council's long-term development vision and should consider the need for social and economic advancement of disadvantaged sections of the community
* The IDP must describe in detail how the municipal council will realise its development objectives and the time frame within which those objectives will be realised
* The council's spatial development framework, which should guide the way in which the physical area will be developed

It is suggested that IDP can assist in the promotion of socio-economic development in at least three ways; first, in helping to attract funds from other spheres of government, donor organisations and investors through defining and packaging attractive projects and programmes; secondly in helping to create an environment that is conducive to private sector investment and the general promotion of LED; and thirdly, by proposing direct interventions in the economy through, for example, providing incentives, developing economic infrastructure, and buying, developing and leasing/selling land,(DPLG 2000, 25).&lt;ref&gt;Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs (DPLG), 2000: Local Economic Development: Guideline to Institutional Arrangements, Local Economic Development Manual Series Volume 1, DPLG, Pretoria.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public participation====
A participatory approach to LED involves the inclusion of different stakeholders so that their views, concerns and issues can be included in the planning process. This is important because it is here that networks, partnerships and information sharing occur that make better, more practical, strategies possible.&lt;ref&gt;.ND Ngubane, 2005: "Promoting Local Economic Development through Strategic Planning". Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variables to be considered when conducting this inventory should reflect the components of a functioning economy, such as human and social capital, financial capital, physical capital and [[natural capital]] (UN Habitat,10).&lt;ref&gt;UN Habitat, Eco-Plan, 2005: "Promoting Local Economic Development through Strategic Planning". Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, municipalities are specifically required to involve communities in the affairs of the municipality, to provide services in a financially sustainable manner and to promote development.&lt;ref&gt;RSA, 2000: Local Government Municipal Systems Bill, Government Gazette No. 21071 of 13 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, public participation is a key element of the Systems Act, and municipalities are obliged to establish mechanisms for public participation and participatory governance.

====Conclusions====
There is entrenched policy support for pro-poor development in South Africa – often being the primary focus of municipal vision/mission statements. In many cases it is treated as the partner of pro-growth/economic growth interventions. This situation is to be welcomed and reflects both local imperatives and responsiveness and local adherence to nationally identified objectives.

Given the dual challenges faced by South African society of needing to address both [[chronic poverty]], yet also to achieve economic growth and global competitiveness, from a policy perspective it would seem that the approach adopted by Mangaung, Cape Town and eThekwini is most appropriate. These municipalities took a middle of the road approach, focusing their LED strategy on addressing both issues of poverty and growth and the fundamental linkages between the two (World Bank, 2005, 75).&lt;ref&gt;World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. "Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa."&lt;/ref&gt; The following case studies present pro-growth endeavours that have led to tangible pro-poor driven growth:Johannesburg’s Fashion District; eThekwini's&lt;!--?--&gt; regeneration projects; Ingwe's rail-based tourism initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. "Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa."&lt;/ref&gt;

These case studies show that pro-poor, community-based initiatives that are market linked, providing a viable product and operating in an economically effective fashion, can help disadvantaged community members to effectively participate in the market economy. Similarly, community-based service provision and labour-intensive employment is an effective mechanisms to extend services and create employment and business opportunities for the poor (World Bank, 2005, 78).&lt;ref&gt;World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. "Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land-use planning for LED====
[[Land-use planning]] and development control serve as measurable tools for LED. The assignment of property rights in land and third party enforcement are essential for the efficient operation of markets. Public intervention ensures the separation of incompatible land-uses, integrated planning and development of synergistic land uses, and the 'public goods' aspect of necessary public facilities, open space and infrastructure investment (Lai, 1994, 78-80).&lt;ref&gt;LAI WAI CHUNG, L. (1994), 'The eco- nomics of zoning: a literature review and analysis of the work of Coase', Town Planning Review, 65, 77-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Land use planning and development control are essential for the existence and operation of land and property markets (Alexander, 48).&lt;ref&gt;A Transaction-Cost Theory of Land Use Planning and Development Control: Towards the Institutional Analysis of Public Planning E. R. Alexander The Town Planning Review , Vol. 72, No. 1 (Jan., 2001), pp. 45-75&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the assignment of and control over land uses will generally reduce transaction costs and can create or enlarge markets (Lai, 1994, 91).&lt;ref&gt;LAI WAI CHUNG, L. (1994), 'The eco- nomics of zoning: a literature review and analysis of the work of Coase', Town Planning Review, 65, 77-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are a list of public land use and development controls that the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing lists as useful methods in promoting economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Municipal Affairs and Housing. "Municipal and Financial Tools for Economic Development Handbook".&lt;/ref&gt;

;Zoning by-laws
Zoning by-laws are used to specify matters such as density, uses of land, parking requirements and form-related standards – including building heights, lot coverage, setbacks, minimum lot sizes, and other building envelope specifications. To keep pace with market conditions and to create higher-quality built environments, flexible and context-relevant standards can be implemented to support economic development goals.

;Height and density exchange
Municipalities can require that facilities, services and matters, as set out in an official plan and by-law, be provided in return for an increase in building height and/or density. This exchange might include streetscape and design elements – for example, protected bicycle parking, outdoor seating, non-slip pedestrian surfaces or public art – in support of municipal placemaking and economic development objectives.

;Minimum and maximum standards
More efficient built forms can be achieved through by-law standards for minimum and maximum building height and density. Community resources such as nearby services, public transit, utilities, and existing road and sidewalk networks and greenspaces, can be used more effectively while expanding the number of potential customers for area businesses.

'''Manifesta''', the roving European Biennial of Contemporary Art, is a European pan-regional contemporary cultural [[biennale]].&lt;ref name="WSJ Taboo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schroeder|first=Mariana|title=Touching the Taboo|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703673604575549843652415452#articleTabs%3Darticle|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Manifesta Biennial Festival was created in 1994.

The 2006 edition of Manifesta was set to happen in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]] under the direction of Florian Waldvogel, Mai Abu ElDahab, and [[Anton Vidokle]]. In June 2006, Nicosia for Art, the city-run nonprofit organization sponsoring the exhibition, cancelled the event due to political turmoil around the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|green line]] of Nicosia.&lt;ref name="artnet zenakos6-5-06"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/zenakos/zenakos6-5-06.asp|title=Manifesta no more|website=Artnet.com|date=7 June 2006|author=Augustine Zenakos|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10th edition of Manifesta in [[Saint Petersburg]] in [[Russia]] created tensions as the government just prohibited "gay propaganda".&lt;ref name="artnet boycott"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/controversial-manifesta-10-organizers-condemn-artists-boycotts-13011|title=Controversial Manifesta 10 Organizers Condemn Artists Boycotts|website=Artnet.com|date=30 April 2014|author=Coline Milliard|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Military Frontier]] was an important way in which Austria defended itself against the [[Ottomans]].&lt;br /&gt;
The following shown below is a history of the Austrian military history.

From 1804 to 1867, the '''[[Imperial and Royal Army]]''' (''Kaiserlich-königliche Armee''), as well as the navy were members of the [[Austrian Empire]] (1804–1867).
* [[Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars]] (1773–1815)

From 1867 to 1918, '''The [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]''' was the ground force of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. It was composed of the [[common army]] (recruited from everywhere), the [[Austrian Landwehr]] (recruited only from [[Cisleithania]]), and the [[Hungarian Honvéd]] (recruited only from [[Transleithania]]).

These are official names in [[German language|German]]:

*Regiments of the common army were "Imperial and Royal" - ''[[kaiserlich und königlich]]'' (k.u.k.)
*The Austrian Landwehr regiments were "Imperial Royal" - ''[[kaiserlich-königlich]]'' (k.k.).
*The Hungarian Honvéd regiments were "Royal Hungarian" - ''königlich ungarisch'' (k.u.)

This army existed from the establishment of the [[Dual monarchy|Dual Monarchy]] in 1867 until the end of World War I in 1918.

'''The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]''' was the naval force of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its official name in German was the ''Kaiserlich und königliche Kriegsmarine'' ("Imperial and Royal Navy", also known by the acronym k.u.k.).

Between 1918 and 1921, the military forces were known as ''Volkswehr'' (people's defence).

From 1921 to the present (except World War II, (1938–1945)), the name of the '''[[Military of Austria]]''' is '''''Bundesheer''''' ("Federal Army"). The branches are Land Forces (KdoLdSK) and Air Forces (KdoLuSK).

In 1955, Austria declared its everlasting neutrality and made neutrality a constitutional law. The main purpose of the Austrian military, since then, has been the protection of Austria's neutrality.

'''Nux''' is the official student [[newspaper]] of the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]]. Started in 1934 on the [[Pietermaritzburg]] campus, it is the oldest student newspaper in [[South Africa]]. The newspaper is primarily funded by the university, and 8000 copies are distributed to students across all campuses of the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]] free of charge. Eight issues, of 16 pages each, are distributed per year. The content is created almost entirely by students, from [[journalism]] to [[graphic design|design]].

The name had its origins in the acronym Natal University Campus Chronicles (NUCCs), which became transformed into '''NUX''', by [[homophony]] and rotation of the C's.

The Executive body sits in [[Pietermaritzburg]], and is [[freedom of the press|editorially independent]] of the university and its structures.

The '''Treaty of Eger''' ({{lang-de|Vertrag von Eger}}), also called '''Main Compromise of Eger''' (''Hauptvergleich von Eger'') or '''Peace of Eger''' ({{lang-cs|Chebský mír}}) was concluded on 25 April 1459 in the [[Free imperial city|Imperial City]] of [[Cheb|Eger]] (''Cheb''), administrative seat of the [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] pawn of [[Egerland]] (''Reichspfandschaft Eger''). The treaty established the border between the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and the [[Electorate of Saxony]] on the main ridge of the [[Ore Mountains]] stretching from Eger to the River [[Elbe]]. The border remains largely unchanged up to today, separating the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Germany]], and is thus one of the oldest still extant borders in [[Europe]].

==Background==
At that time, the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II of Saxony]] and his brother Landgrave [[William III, Landgrave of Thuringia|William of Thuringia]] had re-arranged their dominions in the 1445 [[Division of Altenburg]] and the following [[Saxon Fratricidal War]]. In 1432 Frederick had already reached a separate peace agreement with the Bohemian [[Hussite Wars|Hussites]].

After the death of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] king [[Albert II of Germany]], the [[Utraquism|Utraquist]] leader [[George of Poděbrady]] had been elected Bohemian regent by local nobles in 1448 against the resistance of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] supporters of Albert's minor son and heir [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], led by Burgrave [[Meinhard of Neuhaus]]. In the Saxon Fratricidal War, George had backed the younger brother Landgrave William. After the sudden death of Ladislaus, he was crowned Bohemian king by the Utraquist nobility in 1458, while William had also been a candidate for the succession. 
[[File:Cheb hrad 4.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Cheb Castle]]

==Agreement==
In 1459 the Wettin brothers agreed with George of Poděbrady that towns, castles, markets and villages south of the Ore Mountains that formerly had belonged to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] (like [[Most (Most District)|Most]], Rýzmburk Castle at [[Osek (Teplice District)|Osek]] and [[Duchcov]]) together with all spiritual and secular bodies, pensions, interest, duties, etc. belonged to the estates of King George, whilst those estates and castles located on the northern side in the [[Vogtland]] region and the former [[Margraviate of Meissen]] should be left with the Saxon electors. Through this agreement, the border disputes that were constantly occurring were ultimately ended. That said, some places and dominions north of the Ore Mountains continued to be fiefdoms of the Bohemian crown.

==Aftermath==
Upon the death of Elector Frederick II in 1464, his eldest son [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] ruled jointly with his younger brother [[Albert III, Duke of Saxony|Albert]]. Their realm comprised all Wettin lands, when their uncle Landgrave William of Thuringia died without male heirs in 1482. However, by the 1485 [[Treaty of Leipzig]] the brothers again divided the Saxon lands, with the western Thuringia and Vogtland regions passing to Ernest and eastern Meissen falling to Albert. George of Poděbrady had to face the continuous resistance of the Catholic nobility backed by [[Pope Paul II]], who designated [[Matthias Corvinus]] Bohemian king in 1469.

The most significant change to the border fixed by the 1459 treaty happened in 1546, when Duke [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony|Maurice of Saxony]] and King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] divided the [[Barony of Schwarzenberg]], former possession of Elector [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick I]], as part of the spoils of war following the [[Schmalkaldic War]], with [[Boží Dar]] and [[Horní Blatná]] passing to Bohemia.

==Function==
In 2007, the White House announced, "[AFRICOM] will strengthen our security cooperation with Africa and create new opportunities to bolster the capabilities of our partners in Africa. Africa Command will enhance our efforts to bring peace and security to the people of Africa and promote our common goals of development, health, education, democracy, and economic growth in Africa."&lt;ref name="georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/02/20070206-3.html |title=President Bush Creates a Department of Defense Unified Combatant Command for Africa |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Carter F. Ham]] said in a 2012 address at [[Brown University]] that U.S. strategy for [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] is to strengthen democratic institutions and boost broad-based economic growth.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

The U.S. Africa Command is currently operating along five lines of effort:
# Neutralize [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] and transition the security responsibilities of the [[African Union Mission in Somalia]] (AMISOM) to the [[Federal Government of Somalia]] (FGS)
# Degrade violent extremist organizations in the [[Sahel]] [[Maghreb]] and contain instability in [[Libya]]
# Contain and degrade [[Boko Haram]]
# Interdict illicit activity in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and [[Central Africa]] with willing and capable African partners
# Build [[peacekeeping]], [[humanitarian assistance]] and [[disaster response]] capacity of African partners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=United States Africa Command 2017 Posture Statement|last=Waldhauser|first=General Thomas D.|publisher=U.S. Africa Command|date=9 March 2017|isbn=|location=U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services|pages=7}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History (2000–2006)==
Prior to the creation of AFRICOM, responsibility for U.S. military operations in Africa was divided across three unified commands: [[United States European Command]] (EUCOM) for West Africa, [[United States Central Command]] (CENTCOM) for East Africa, and [[United States Pacific Command]] (PACOM) for Indian Ocean waters and islands off the east coast of Africa.

A U.S. military officer wrote the first public article calling for the formation of a separate African command in November 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/parameters/articles/00winter/catoire.htm |title=A CINC for Sub-Saharan Africa?

These locations, along with [[Camp Lemonnier]] in [[Djibouti]], would form the basis of AFRICOM facilities on the continent. Areas of military interest to the United States in Africa include the [[Sahara]]/[[Sahel]] region,&lt;ref name=US-TARGETS-SAHARA-TERRORIST-HAVEN&gt;{{cite news
|title=US targets Sahara 'terrorist haven' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4749357.stm |work=BBC News |date=8 August 2005 |accessdate=24 June 2015 |first=Catherine |last=Fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; over which [[Joint Task Force Aztec Silence]] is conducting anti-terrorist operations ([[Operation Enduring Freedom - Trans Sahara]]), Djibouti in the Horn of Africa, where [[CJTF-HOA|Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa]] is located (overseeing [[Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa]]), and the [[Gulf of Guinea]].

The website '''Magharebia.com''' was launched by USEUCOM in 2004 to provide news about North Africa in English, French and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About This Site |url=http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/document/awi/footer/about/about |date=22 October 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204211810/http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/document/awi/footer/about/about |archivedate=4 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When AFRICOM was created, it took over operation of the website.&lt;ref name=pincus2007-05-08&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Africa Command Brings New Concerns |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052700978.html |date=8 May 2015 |first=Walter |last=Pincus |work=Washington Post |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information operations of the United States Department of Defense was criticized by the Senate Armed Forces Committee and defunded by Congress in 2011.

In 2007, the [[United States Congress]] approved $500&amp;nbsp;million for the [[Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative]] (TSCTI) over six years to support countries involved in [[counterterrorism]] against threats of [[Al Qaeda]] operating in African countries, primarily [[Algeria]], Chad, [[Mali]], Mauritania, [[Niger]], Senegal, [[Nigeria]], and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name=AFRICA-TO-GET-ITS-OWN-US-MILITARY-COMMAND&gt;{{cite news |title=POLITICS: Africa to Get Its Own U.S. Military Command |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2007/01/politics-africa-to-get-its-own-us-military-command/ |work=Inter Press Service |first=Jim |last=Lobe |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program builds upon the former [[Pan Sahel Initiative]] (PSI), which concluded in December 2004&lt;ref name=EUCOM-OPERATIONS-AND-INITIATIVES&gt;{{cite web |title=Operations and Initiatives |url=http://www.eucom.mil/english/Operations/main.asp |publisher=[[EUCOM]] |accessdate=6 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109185740/http://www.eucom.mil/english/Operations/main.asp  |archivedate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focused on [[weapon trafficking|weapon]] and drug trafficking, as well as counterterrorism.&lt;ref name=PAN-SAHEL-INITIATIVE&gt;{{cite web |title=Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI) |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/pan-sahel.htm |work=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous U.S. military activities in Sub-Saharan Africa have included Special Forces associated [[Joint Combined Exchange Training]]. Letitia Lawson, writing in 2007 for a [[Center for Contemporary Conflict]] journal at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], noted that U.S. policy towards Africa, at least in the medium-term, looks to be largely defined by international terrorism, the increasing importance of African oil to American energy needs, and the dramatic expansion and improvement of [[Sino-African relations]] since 2000.&lt;ref name=Lawson07&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawson |first=Letitia |date=January 2007 |title=U.S. Africa Policy Since the Cold War |journal=Strategic Insights |volume=6 |issue=1 |url= http://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/11266/lawsonJan07.pdf |accessdate=24 June 2015 |publisher=Department of National Security Affairs Center on Contemporary Conflict}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of AFRICOM (2006–2008)==
In mid-2006, Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] formed a planning team to advise on requirements for establishing a new Unified Command for the African continent. In early December, he made his recommendations to President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=PENTAGON-CREATES-MILITARY-COMMAND-FOR-AFRICA&gt;{{cite news |title=Pentagon Creates Military Command for Africa.

On 6 February 2007, Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] announced to the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] that President George W. Bush had given authority to create the new African Command.&lt;ref name=DOD-ESTABLISHING-US-AFRICA-COMMAND&gt;{{cite news |title=DoD Establishing U.S. Africa Command |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/News/NewsArticle.aspx?id=2940 |work=American Forces Press Services |publisher=[[US Department of Defense]]

Ward|William E. "Kip" Ward]] as AFRICOM's first commander and AFRICOM officially became operational as a sub-unified command of EUCOM with a separate headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.africom.mil/NEWSROOM/Article/6042/us-africa-command-reaches-initial-operating-capabi |title=U.S. Africa Command Reaches Initial Operating Capability |date=1 October 2007 |publisher=US AFRICOM Public Affairs |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2008, the command separated from USEUCOM and began operating on its own as a full-fledged combatant command.

==Geographic scope==
[[File:GCCMAP.png|thumb|right|300px|In this map, U.S. AFRICOM Area of Responsibility is shown in green]]
[[File:USAFRICOM United States Africa Command Map Draft.jpg|thumb|right|300px|February 2007 Draft Map of U.S. AFRICOM showing its creation from parts of [[USEUCOM]], [[USCENTCOM]] and [[USINDOPACOM]].]]

The territory of the command consists of all of the African continent except for [[Egypt]], which remains under the direct responsibility of USCENTCOM, as it closely relates to the Middle East. USAFRICOM also covers island countries commonly associated with Africa:
* [[Cape Verde]]
* [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]
* [[Comoros]]
* [[Madagascar]]
* [[Mauritius]]
* [[Seychelles]]&lt;ref name="US-CREATING-NEW-AFRICA-COMMAND-TO-COORDINATE-MILITARY-EFFORTS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PENTAGON-SETTING-UP-NEW-US-COMMAND-TO-OVERSEE-AFRICAN-MISSIONS&gt;{{cite news |title=Pentagon setting up new U.S. command to oversee African missions |url=http://helenair.com/news/national/pentagon-setting-up-new-u-s-command-to-oversee-african/article_1fd6a4bb-a254-5345-b619-3c50d6aa87c3.html |work=Independent Record |agency=Associated Press |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=25 June 2015 |first=Pauline |last=Jelinek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military [[area of responsibility|areas of responsibility]] involved were transferred from three separate U.S. unified combatant commands. Most of Africa was transferred from the [[United States European Command]] with the [[East Africa|Horn of Africa]] and [[Sudan]] transferred from the [[United States Central Command]]. Responsibility for U.S. military operations in the islands of [[Madagascar]], the [[Comoros]], the [[Seychelles]] and [[Mauritius]] was transferred from the [[United States Pacific Command]].

==Headquarters and facilities==
The AFRICOM headquarters is located at [[Kelley Barracks]], a small urban facility near [[Stuttgart]], Germany, and is staffed by 1,500 personnel. In addition, the command has military and civilian personnel assigned at [[Camp Lemonnier|Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti]]; [[RAF Molesworth|RAF Molesworth, United Kingdom]]; [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Air Force Base, Florida]]; and in Offices of Security Cooperation and Defense Attaché Offices in about 38 African countries.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

===Selection of the headquarters===
It was reported in June 2007 that African countries were competing to host the headquarters because it would bring money for the recipient country.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', "Policing the undergoverned spaces", 16–22 June 2007, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  However, of all the African nations, only [[Liberia]] has publicly expressed a willingness to host AFRICOM's headquarters. The U.S. declared in February 2008 that AFRICOM would be headquartered in Stuttgart for the "foreseeable future". In August 2007, Dr. Wafula Okumu, a research fellow at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa, testified before the United States Congress about the growing resistance and hostility on the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200708031070.html?page=2 |publisher=Allafrica.com |title=Africa: Testimony of Dr. Wafula Okumu – U.S. House Africom Hearing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigeria]] announced it will not allow its country to host a base and opposed the creation of a base on the continent. South Africa and [[Libya]] also expressed reservations of the establishment of a headquarters in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/19/africa/AF-GEN-US-Africa-Command.php |title=US AFRICOM headquarters to remain in Germany for "foreseeable future |publisher= ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' |date= 19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7251648.stm  |title=US drops Africa military HQ plan |publisher= ''[[BBC News]]'' |date= 18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sudan Tribune'' considered it likely that [[Ethiopia]], a strong U.S. ally in the region, will house USAFRICOM's headquarters due to the collocation of AFRICOM with the [[African Union]]'s developing [[Peace and Security Council|peace and security apparatus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article24660 |title=US army boss for Africa says no garrisons planned |publisher=SudanTribune article |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia|Prime Minister]] [[Meles Zenawi]] stated in early November that Ethiopia would be willing to work together closely with USAFRICOM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article24667 |title=Ethiopia ready to cooperate with US Africa Command – Zenawi |publisher=SudanTribune article |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was further reinforced when a U.S. Air Force official said on 5 December 2007, that [[Addis Ababa]] was likely to be the headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Holmes, [http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2007/12/airforce_africom_standup_071203w/ Official: AFRICOM Will Need Air Force Aircraft], Air Force Times, 5 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 February 2008 General Ward told an audience at the [[Royal United Services Institute]] in London that some portion of that staff headquarters being on the continent at some point in time would be "a positive factor in helping us better deliver programs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africom.mil/getArticle.asp?art=1659 "TRANSCRIPT: General Ward Outlines Vision for U.S. Africa Command"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007034643/http://www.africom.mil/getArticle.asp?art=1659 |date=7 October 2008 }}, 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; General Ward also told the BBC the same day in an interview that there are no definite plans to take the headquarters or a portion of it to any particular location on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africom.mil/getArticle.asp?art=1658 "TRANSCRIPT: AFRICOM's General Ward Interviewed by the BBC's Nick Childs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227125058/http://www.africom.mil/getArticle.asp?art=1658 |date=27 February 2008 }}, 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush denied that the United States was contemplating the construction of new bases on the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/02/20/ap4674005.html "Bush Says No New U.S. Bases in Africa"]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. plans include no large installations such as [[Camp Bondsteel]] in Kosovo, but rather a network of "cooperative security locations" at which temporary activities will be conducted. There is one U.S. base on the continent, [[Camp Lemonnier]] in Djibouti, with approximately 2,300 troops stationed there having been inherited from USCENTCOM upon standup of the command.

In general, U.S. Unified Combatant Commands have an HQ of their own in one location, subordinate service component HQs, sometimes one or two co-located with the main HQ or sometimes spread widely, and a wide range of operating locations, main bases, forward detachments, etc. USAFRICOM initially appears to be considering something slightly different; spreading the actually [[Unified Combatant Command|COCOM]] HQ over several locations, rather than having the COCOM HQ in one place and the putative "U.S. Army Forces, Africa", its air component, and "U.S. Naval Forces, Africa" in one to four separate locations. AFRICOM will not have the traditional J-type staff divisions,{{clarify|date=March 2015}} instead having outreach, plans and programs, knowledge development, operations and logistics, and resources branches.&lt;ref&gt;Stars and Stripes, [http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=55606&amp;archive=true AFRICOM to depart from J-code structure], 12 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  AFRICOM went back to a traditional J-Staff in early 2011 after General [[Carter Ham]] took command.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Personnel==
U.S. Africa Command completed fiscal year 2010 with approximately 2,000 assigned personnel, which includes military, civilian, contractor, and host nation employees. About 1,500 work at the command’s main headquarters in Stuttgart. Others are assigned to the command’s units in England and Florida, along with security cooperation officers posted at U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions in Africa to coordinate Defense Department programs within the host nation.

As of December 2010, the command has five [[Senior Foreign Service]] officers in key positions as well as more than 30 personnel from 13 U.S. Government Departments and Agencies serving in leadership, management, and staff positions. Some of the agencies represented are the United States Departments of [[United States Department of State|State]], [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury]], and [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], [[United States Agency for International Development]], and the [[United States Coast Guard]].

U.S. Africa Command has limited assigned forces and relies on the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for resources necessary to support its missions.

==Components==

{{refimprove|date=December 2016}}
{{Life timeline}}
'''Ur''' is a proposed supercontinent that formed in the [[Archean]]  {{mya|3100}} (3.1 billion).

In Roger's reconstruction{{specify}} Ur is half a billion years older than [[Arctica]] and, in the early period of its existence, it was probably the only continent on [[Earth]], and as such can be considered a [[supercontinent]], though it was probably smaller than present-day [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].  In more recent works geologists often refer to both Ur and other proposed Archaean continental assemblages as supercratons.  Ur can, nevertheless, be half a billion years younger than [[Vaalbara]], but the concepts of these two early cratonic assemblages are incompatible.

==Incompatible reconstructions==
About 1,300–1,071 Mya, Ur joined the continents [[Nena (supercontinent)|Nena]] and [[Atlantica]] to form the supercontinent [[Rodinia]].&lt;ref name&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|Santosh|2003|loc=Rodinia, pp. 363–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the reconstruction of {{Harvnb|Rogers|1996}}, Ur remained the nucleus of East [[Gondwana]] until the break-up of Gondwana.  In other reconstructions, however, India and East Antarctica did not collide until Rodinia formed 1,071 Mya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zhao|Cawood|Wilde|Sun|2002|loc=Implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent, p. 155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in the Early Archaean Earth's mantle was 200&amp;nbsp;°C hotter than today and many characteristics of modern tectonics, such as [[ophiolite]]s, [[blueschist]]s, [[lawsonite]]-bearing [[eclogite]]s, and [[Ultra-high-pressure metamorphism|ultra-high-pressure rocks]], did not exist or were rare.  This makes most proposed Archaean supercontinents controversial, including Rogers's 3 Gya supercontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nance|Murphy|Santosh|2014|loc=Pre-Rodinia supercontinents, pp. 11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstructions of the supercontinent [[Vaalbara]] places two cratons, [[Kaapvaal Craton|Kaapvaal]] in southern Africa and [[Pilbara Craton|Pilbara]] in western Australia next to each other based on stratigraphic similarities.  In Roger's configuration of Ur, these cratons are placed far apart in their Gondwana configuration.  This configuration is contradicted by widespread Precambrian collisional events between Australia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Kock|Evans|Beukes|2009|loc=Introduction, p. 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another possible supercraton, Zimgarn, proposed by {{Harvnb|Smirnov|Evans|Ernst|Söderlund|2013}} and named after the [[Zimbabwe Craton|Zimbabwe]] and Yilgarn cratons, is distinct from both Vaalbara and Ur.  Vaalbara and Zimgarn, according to this proposal, both disintegrated about 2.1–2.0 Gya to reassemble as the [[Kalahari Craton|Kalahari]] and West Australian cratons 2.524–1.507 Gya.  Smirnov et al. based this reconstruction on: (1) Zimgarn was still undergoing cratonisation when an extensive [[carbonate platform]] developed over Vaalbara; (2) the magmatic signatures are different for the two supercratons during the period 2.6–2.0 Gya; and (3) paleomagnetic latitudes for 2.69 Gya are slightly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smirnov|Evans|Ernst|Söderlund|2013|loc=Abstract; Discussion and conclusions, pp. 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original concept and later interpretations==
Important geological similarities link now remote Archaean cratons in India (Singhbhum and Dharwar), western Australia (Kilbaran and Pilbara), and southern Africa (Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe) which indicate that these [[protolith]]ic shields were close together in the Mid-Archaean. The name "Ur", from the German prefix ''[[wikt|ur-]]'' meaning "original", was introduced by {{Harvnb|Rogers|1993}}, since it is the first continent in his tectonic reconstructions.&lt;ref name="Rogers-1996"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1996|loc=Proposed Continents and Their Duration, pp. 94-95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Archaean continental assemblages are considerably younger: [[Arctica]] ([[Baltica]], [[Laurentia]], Ur, and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]) consolidated around ~2.565 Gya, [[Atlantica]] ([[West African Craton|West Africa]] and [[Amazonian Craton|eastern South America]]) consolidated around 2.11 Gya. In some reconstructions the shields of Ur stayed near each other until the Mesozoic break-up of Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mondal|Piper|Hunt|Bandyopadhyay|2009|loc=The ‘Ur’ protocontinent, pp. 503–505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cratons that had become stable around 3 Gya were all in the same region within Pangaea, which is the main argument for them having formed a single continent 3 billion years ago.  The [[Kaapvaal Craton|Kaapvaal craton]] in southern Africa became stable around 3.1 Gya.  The [[Pilbara Craton|Pilbara craton]] in western Australia is not well defined but formed around 3 Gya.  Three cratons in East Antarctica are of similar age but not well known.  These cratons share similar geological histories and are therefore assumed to have formed the continent [[Vaalbara]].&lt;ref name="RogSan-2003"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|Santosh|2003|loc=Ur (~3000 Ma), pp. 358–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three small areas in the Indian Ocean coast of Antarctica are also about 3 Gya old: western [[Dronning Maud Land]], the [[Napier Mountains|Napier complex]], and the [[Vestfold Hills]].  Within Gondwana, these areas were in a belt of [[Grenville orogeny|Grenville]]-age deformation, and because there is no evidence of ocean closure in this belt (except in Africa), the 1&amp;nbsp;Ga orogen can be assumed to be intra-continental.  Consequently, the southern margin of Ur is now below the Antarctic ice cover.&lt;ref name="Rogers-1996" /&gt;

Two cratons in India of equal age, [[Dharwar Craton|Western Dharwar]] and [[Singhbhum Craton|Singhbhum]], were also part of Ur.  Two other Indian cratons, Eastern Dharwar and [[Bhandara Craton|Bhandara]], also formed around 3 Gya but underwent extensive magmatism around 2.5 Gya not seen elsewhere and their relation to Ur is unclear.  Ur, nevertheless, became larger around 2.524 Mya, and this so-called "Expanded Ur" incorporated the [[Zimbabwe Craton]] in Africa and the [[Yilgarn Craton]] in Australia.&lt;ref name="RogSan-2003" /&gt;

The largest preserved parts of Ur are now in India: [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]], [[Dharwar Craton|Dharwar]], [[Bundelkhand]], and [[Singhbhum]].  The [[Central Indian Tectonic Zone]] is the modern [[Suture (geology)|suture]] between the Bundelkhand-Aravalli block and the other Archaean blocks.  2.8–2.6 Gya metamorphism in Dharwar and Bundelkhand indicate that the stabilisation of Ur probably continued until the end of that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahapatro|Pant|Bhowmik|Tripathy|2012|loc=Implication for Ur Assembly, pp. 329–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1370">The '''Zenne Group''' ({{lang-nl|Zenne Groep}}) is a [[group (stratigraphy)|group]] of [[stratum|rock strata]] in the [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]] of central and northwest [[Belgium]]. The group consists of three [[formation (stratigraphy)|formations]], all from the [[Ypresian]] and [[Lutetian]] [[age (geology)|ages]] (early [[Eocene]], 50 to 40 million years old). These formation have their shallow marine [[sedimentary facies|facies]] in common.

The three formations are:
*the [[Aalter Formation]], greenish [[sand]]s and [[clay]]s, found in [[East-Flanders]] and [[West-Flanders]].
*the [[Brussel Formation]], [[marl]]s and sands, found in [[Flemish Brabant|Flemish]] and [[Walloon Brabant]], [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and [[Namur (province)|Namur]].
*the [[Lede Formation]], calcareous sands, found in almost all central Belgium.

Stratigraphically on top of the Zenne Group are the late Eocene sands and clays of the [[Maldegem Formation]], which is not divided into a group. The Zenne Group is almost everywhere found on top of the early Eocene [[Ieper Group]].
