==Early life==
Jones was born in 1974 in [[Dallas, Texas]], and grew up in the Dallas suburb of [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]] and the city of [[Austin, Texas]]. His father is a dentist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charlie|last=Warzel|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/alex-jones-will-never-stop-being-alex-jones|title=Alex Jones will never stop being Alex Jones|website=[[Buzzfeed]]|publisher=Buzzfeed Inc.|location=New York|date=May 4, 2017|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother a [[Homemaking|homemaker]].&lt;ref name="MeetAJ"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Alexander|last=Zaitchik|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302|title=Meet Alex Jones, the Talk Radio Host Behind Charlie Sheen's Crazy Rants|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329052117/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/talk-radios-alex-jones-the-most-paranoid-man-in-america-20110302|archivedate=March 29, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his video podcasts, he reports he is of Irish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGpO5elD3Gs|title = Baltimore City Councilman Pushes Racial Division|date = April 29, 2015|accessdate = April 30, 2015|publisher = YouTube, Google|author = The Alex Jones Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; German, Welsh, mostly English, and partially Native American descent. He was a lineman on his high school's football team and graduated from [[Anderson High School (Texas)|Anderson High School]] in Austin in 1993.&lt;ref name="MeetAJ"/&gt; As a teenager, he read conservative [[journalist]] and conspiracy theorist [[Gary Allen]]'s [[anti-Semitic]] book ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'',&lt;ref name="JTABook"&gt;{{cite news |last1=(Staff writer) |title=Congressman Won't Comment on Endorsement of Anti-semitic Book |url=https://www.jta.org/1972/06/16/archive/congressman-wont-comment-on-endorsement-of-anti-semitic-book |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |work=Daily News Bulletin |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |issue=117 |date=June 16, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a profound influence on him and which he calls "the easiest-to-read primer on The New World Order".&lt;ref name="RollingStonepage3"&gt;{{cite web|first=Alexander|last=Zaitchek|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meet-alex-jones-175845/|title=Meet Alex Jones|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Jones briefly attended [[Austin Community College District|Austin Community College]] but dropped out.&lt;ref name= Stern&gt;Howard Stern Radio Show, February 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Jones began his career in Austin with a live, call-in format [[public-access television|public-access]] [[cable television]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infowars.com/about-alex-jones/|title=About Alex Jones|work=Infowars}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Jones switched format to radio, hosting a show named ''The Final Edition'' on [[KUTX|KJFK]] (98.9 FM).&lt;ref name="KJFK"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lee|last=Nichols|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:75039|title=Psst, It's a Conspiracy: KJFK Gives Alex Jones the Boot Media Clips|newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp.|location=Austin, Texas|date=December 10, 1999|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Paul]] was running for Congress and was a guest on his show several times.&lt;ref name="NYMagpage2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/media/alex-jones-2011-4/index1.html|title=How Radio Host Alex Jones Has Cornered the Bipartisan Paranoia Market|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] happened in 1995 Jones began accusing the government of being responsible, saying, "I understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control".&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"/&gt; In 1998, he released his first film, ''America Destroyed By Design''.

In 1998, Jones organized a successful effort to build a new [[Branch Davidians|Branch Davidian]] church, as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the government's [[Waco siege|siege]] of the original Branch Davidian complex near [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Connie|last=Mabin |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/branch-davidians-hope-a-new-church-can-close-wounds-719121.html |title=Branch Davidians hope a new church can close wounds |agency=Associated Press |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London |date=April 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often featured the project on his public-access television program and claimed that [[David Koresh]] and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] during the siege.&lt;ref name="KJFK" /&gt; In the same year, he was removed from a [[George W. Bush]] rally at [[Bayport Industrial District]], Texas. Jones interrupted [[Governor of Texas|governor]] Bush's speech, demanding that the [[Federal Reserve]] and [[Council on Foreign Relations]] be abolished. Journalist [[David Weigel]], reporting on the incident, said Jones "seemed to launch into public events as if flung from another universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David|last=Wiegel|title=Alex Jones celebrates Trump's takeover of the GOP |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/18/alex-jones-celebrates-trumps-takeover-of-the-gop/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington, DC|date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Jones tied with [[Shannon Burke Show|Shannon Burke]] for that year's "Best Austin Talk Radio Host" poll, as voted by ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best of Austin 1999 Readers Poll|date=1999|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Awards/BestOfAustin/?BOACategory=Media&amp;Year=1999&amp;Poll=Readers&amp;Display=Long|accessdate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. His views were making the show hard to sell to advertisers, according to the station's operations manager.&lt;ref name="KJFK"/&gt; Jones stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;It was purely political, and it came down from on high&amp;nbsp;... I was told 11 weeks ago to lay off [Bill] [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], to lay off all these politicians, to not talk about rebuilding the church, to stop bashing the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], A to Z.&lt;ref name="KJFK" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He began broadcasting his show by Internet connection from his home.&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"&gt;{{cite web | title=Meet Alex Jones j | website=Rolling Stone – Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage | date=March 2, 2011 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meet-alex-jones-175845/ | access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2000, Jones was one of seven [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates for [[Texas House of Representatives|state representative]] in Texas House District 48, an open swing district based in Austin, Texas. Jones stated that he was running "to be a watchdog on the inside"&lt;ref name="Scott S.

In 2001, his show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations.&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"/&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attack]], Jones began to speak of a conspiracy by the Bush administration as being behind the attack,&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt; which caused a number of the stations that had previously carried him to drop his program, according to Will Bunch.&lt;ref name="Bunch2011"/&gt;

On June 8, 2006, while on his way to cover a meeting of the [[Bilderberg Group]] in [[Ottawa]], Jones was stopped and detained at the [[Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport|Ottawa airport]] by Canadian authorities who confiscated his passport, camera equipment, and most of his belongings. He was later allowed to enter Canada lawfully. Jones said about the reason for his immigration hold, "I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Payton |first=Laura |title=Bilderberg-bound filmmaker held at airport |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=June 8, 2006 |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f67cbe75-4eed-4daf-877e-189e52d1f33c&amp;k=12919 |accessdate=August 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011102348/http://canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=f67cbe75-4eed-4daf-877e-189e52d1f33c&amp;k=12919 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2007, he was arrested while protesting at 6th Avenue and 48th Street in [[New York City]]. He was charged with operating a [[megaphone]] without a permit. Two others were also cited for disorderly conduct when his group crashed a live television show featuring [[Geraldo Rivera]]. In an article, one of Jones' fellow protesters said, "It was&amp;nbsp;... guerrilla information warfare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grace|first=Melissa|author2=Xana O'Neill|title=Filmmaker arrested during city protest|date=September 9, 2007|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/09/09/2007-09-09_filmmakerik_arrested_during_city_protest.html|accessdate=September 10, 2007|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|location=New York|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013231209/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/09/09/2007-09-09_filmmaker_arrested_during_city_protest.html|archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2016, following the [[2016 Republican National Convention]], Jones and [[Roger Stone]] began plotting the removal of [[Ted Cruz]] from his Senate seat after he failed to endorse Donald Trump as the Republican presidential candidate, with potential challengers [[Katrina Pierson]] and [[Dan Patrick (politician)|Dan Patrick]] mooted as replacements in the upcoming [[United States Senate election in Texas, 2018|Texas election for Senate]] in 2018.&lt;ref name=plotprimary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/288719-roger-stone-alex-jones-plot-primary-challenge-to-cruz|title=Roger Stone, Alex Jones plot primary challenge to Cruz|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|last=Easley|first=Jonathan|date=July 21, 2016|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2017, alongside [[Paul Joseph Watson]], Jones began hosting a contest to create the best "CNN Meme", in which the winner would receive $20,000.

In February 2018, Jones was accused by two former employees of antisemitism, anti-black racism and sexual harassment of males and females.

==Radio, websites and mail-order business {{anchor|Infowars}}==
''The Alex Jones Show'' is broadcast nationally by the [[Genesis Communications Network]] to more than 90 AM and FM radio stations in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gcnlive.com | title=GCNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[WWCR]], a [[shortwave radio]] station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwcr.com/pgm-links.html | title=WWCR Programming Schedule}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday show also airs on [[KLBJ (AM)|KLBJ]].

According to journalist Will Bunch, a senior fellow at [[Media Matters for America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/author/will-bunch | title=Will Bunch | publisher=CommonDreams | accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/will-bunch/ | title=Will Bunch | work=The Huffington Post | accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the show has a demographic heavier in younger viewers than other conservative pundits due to Jones's "highly conspiratorial tone and Web-oriented approach". Bunch has also stated that Jones "feed[s] on the deepest paranoia".&lt;ref name="Bunch2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunch|first=Will|title=The Backlash: Right-Wing Radicals, High-Def Hucksters, and Paranoid Politics in the Age of Obama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cEAb7Pv-a0C&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=January 10, 2013|date=September 13, 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780061991721|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Zaitchik of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, in 2011 he had a larger on-line audience than [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]] combined.&lt;ref name="RollingStonep4"/&gt;

=== Infowars and other sites ===

Jones is the publisher and director of the Infowars.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infowars.com/contact/|title=Contact " Alex Jones' Infowars: There's a war on for your mind!|website=www.infowars.com|language=en-US|access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Infowars'' website receives approximately 10 million monthly visits, making its reach more extensive than mainstream news websites such as ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quantcast.com/infowars.com?qcLocale=en_US#trafficCard|title=Infowars.com Audience Insights – Quantcast|website=www.quantcast.com|access-date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/28/13424848/alex-jones-infowars-prisonplanet|title=Alex Jones, Pizzagate booster and America's most famous conspiracy theorist, explained|work=Vox|access-date=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:News Wars Logo.svg|thumb|Newswars logo]]
In August 2017, Jones announced the launch of NewsWars.com, a site Jones said was intended to battle news that he considers to be fake news.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Beth|last=Baumann|url=https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/08/12/infowars-alex-jones-launches-new-website-aimed-at-exposing-fake-news|title=InfoWars' Alex Jones launches new website aimed at exposing 'fake news'|website=[[TheBlaze]]|publisher=[[Mercury Radio Arts]]|location=Irving, Texas|date=August 12, 2017|access-date=February 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer products===
A 2017 piece for German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' by Veit Medick indicated that two-thirds of Jones' funds derive from sales of a successful range of his own products. These products are marketed through the ''Infowars'' website and through advertising spots on Jones' show.  They include dietary supplements, toothpaste, bulletproof vests and "brain pills," which hold "an appeal for anyone who believes [[Armageddon]] is near", according to Medick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Veit|last=Medick|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-visit-to-the-infowars-studios-of-alex-jones-a-1136654.html|title=Meet Donald Trump's Propagandist|magazine=[[Der Spiegel]]|publisher=Spiegel-Verlag|location=Hamburg, Germany|date=February 28, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Californian medical company [[Labdoor, Inc]] reported on tests applied to six of Jones' dietary supplement products.  These included a product named Survival Shield, which was found by Labdoor to contain only [[iodine]], and a product named Oxy-Powder, which comprised a compound of magnesium oxide and citric acid; common ingredients in dietary supplements.  Labdoor indicated no evidence of prohibited or harmful substances, but cast doubt on Infowars' marketing claims for these products, and asserted that the quantity of the ingredients in certain products would be "too low to be appropriately effective".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://labdoor.com/article/labdoor-special-report-we-tested-the-infowars-supplements|title=Labdoor Special Report: We Tested the Infowars Supplements|date=August 10, 2017|publisher=Labdoor Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/we-sent-alex-jones-infowars-supplements-to-a-lab-heres|title=We Sent Alex Jones' Infowars Supplements To A Lab.

On a segment of ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'', host [[John Oliver]] stated that Jones spends "nearly a quarter" of his on-air time promoting products sold on his website, many of which are purported solutions to medical and economic problems claimed to be caused by the conspiracy theories described on his show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Locker|first1=Melissa|title=John Oliver Goes to War with Alex Jones on 'Last Week Tonight'|url=http://time.com/4880191/john-oliver-alex-jones-last-week-tonight/|accessdate=August 2, 2017|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|date=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Today in Entertainment: Twitter has a field day over Anthony Scaramucci's exit; Celebrities mourn the loss of Sam Shepard|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-john-oliver-mocks-alex-jones-products-1501509845-htmlstory.html|accessdate=August 4, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4420">In [[functional analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the '''algebraic interior''' or '''radial kernel''' of a subset of a [[vector space]] is a refinement of the concept of the [[Interior (topology)|interior]].  It is the subset of points contained in a given set with respect to which it is [[absorbing set|absorbing]], i.e. the [[radial set|radial]] points of the set.&lt;ref name="coherent"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Coherent Risk Measures, Valuation Bounds, and (&lt;math&gt;\mu,\rho&lt;/math&gt;)-Portfolio Optimization|first1=Stefan|last1=Jaschke|first2=Uwe|last2=Kuchler|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements of the algebraic interior are often referred to as '''internal points'''.&lt;ref name="aliprantis+border"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aliprantis|first=C.D.|last2=Border|first2=K.C.|title=Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide|edition=3rd|publisher=Springer|date=2007|isbn=978-3-540-32696-0|doi=10.1007/3-540-29587-9|pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndcook.com/SeparationOfConvexSets.pdf | accessdate=November 14, 2012 |format=pdf |title=Separation of Convex Sets in Linear Topological Spaces |author=John Cook |date=May 21, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear space]] then the algebraic interior of &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{core}(A) := \left\{x_0 \in A: \forall x \in X, \exists t_x &gt; 0, \forall t \in [0,t_x], x_0 + tx \in A\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikolaĭ Kapitonovich Nikolʹskiĭ|title=Functional analysis I: linear functional analysis|date=1992|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-50584-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that in general &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{core}(A) \neq \operatorname{core}(\operatorname{core}(A))&lt;/math&gt;, but if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[convex set]] then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{core}(A) = \operatorname{core}(\operatorname{core}(A))&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a convex set then if &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \operatorname{core}(A), y \in A, 0 &lt; \lambda \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\lambda x_0 + (1 - \lambda)y \in \operatorname{core}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example ==
If &lt;math&gt;A = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2: x_2 \geq x_1^2 \text{ or } x_2 \leq 0\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;0 \in \operatorname{core}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;0 \not\in \operatorname{int}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \not\in \operatorname{core}(\operatorname{core}(A))&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==
Let &lt;math&gt;A,B \subset X&lt;/math&gt; then:
* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Absorbing set|absorbing]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;0 \in \operatorname{core}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="coherent" /&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;A + \operatorname{core}B \subset \operatorname{core}(A + B)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Zalinescu"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zălinescu|first=C.|title=Convex analysis in general vector spaces|publisher=World Scientific Publishing  Co., Inc|location= River Edge, NJ |date= 2002|pages=2–3|isbn=981-238-067-1|mr=1921556}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;A + \operatorname{core}B = \operatorname{core}(A + B)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;B = \operatorname{core}B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Zalinescu" /&gt;

=== Relation to interior ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological vector space]], &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{int}&lt;/math&gt; denote the interior operator, and &lt;math&gt;A \subset X&lt;/math&gt; then: 
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{int}A \subseteq \operatorname{core}A&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty convex and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{int}A = \operatorname{core}A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="aliprantis+border" /&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is convex with non-empty interior, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{int}A = \operatorname{core}A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="kantorovitz"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Modern Analysis |author=Shmuel Kantorovitz |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2003 |isbn=9780198526568 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a closed convex set and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[complete metric space]], then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{int}A = \operatorname{core}A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Perturbation Analysis of Optimization Problems|series=Springer series in operations research|first1=J.

'''Art''' is a diverse range of [[human behavior|human activities]] in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts ([[artworks]]), expressing the author's [[imagination|imaginative]], [[Concept|conceptual]] [[idea]], or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art |title=Art: definition |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art |title=art |publisher=Merriam-Websters Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. 

The three classical branches of art are [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=q8rvdsxGokwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vasari+lives+of+painters,+sculptors+and+painters&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTta2zrLreAhUGbBoKHdSoDUIQ6AEIKDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Music, theatre, film, dance, and other [[performing arts]], as well as literature and other media such as [[interactive media]], are included in a broader definition  of [[the arts]].&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Art, n. 1". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com. (Accessed 26 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century, ''art'' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [[craft]]s or [[sciences]]. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or [[applied arts]].

Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Definitions of Art |author=Stephen Davies |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8014-9794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Artworks: Definition, Meaning, Value |author=Robert Stecker |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-271-01596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theories of Art Today |editor=Noël Carroll |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-299-16354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |archive-date=27 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427192624/http://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |title=What Is Art? |author=Dr. Robert J.

==Creative art and fine art==
{{wide image|Wang Ximeng - A Thousand Li of River (Bridge).jpg|1250px|Works of art can tell stories or simply express an aesthetic truth or feeling. Panorama of a section of ''A Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers'', a 12th-century painting by Song dynasty artist [[Wang Ximeng]].}}

In the perspective of the history of art,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James "Art History and Images That Are Not Art", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (December 1995), with previous bibliography. "Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value". 553&lt;/ref&gt; One early sense of the definition of ''art'' is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''medical arts'', and ''military arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century Rwandan bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

Over time, [[Philosopher|philosophers]] like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73-96&lt;/ref&gt; Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a–c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40-72&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and more recent, sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.

Within this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287-326&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name="Levinson5"&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], "The Origin of the Work of Art", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], "Cézanne's Doubt" in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the [[art world]]" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."&lt;ref&gt;Shiner 2003. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art may be characterized in terms of [[mimesis]] (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=18 November 2008 |year=2005 |website=The Gombrich Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212330/http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |archivedate=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.83, pp.75-115 pp.132-141, pp.147-155, p.163, p.627.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.86-89, pp.135-141, p.143, p.179, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.&lt;ref name="Nichols2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 634-635&lt;/ref&gt;), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.&lt;ref name="Watson1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Watson|title=The Arts of China 900-1620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-v5jUKaCxYC|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.155, p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer,&lt;ref name="Moore2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Moore|title=Propaganda Prints: A History of Art in the Service of Social and Political Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0KAlsQ2Yj4C|date=6 August 2010|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0591-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.394-395, pp.519-527, pp. 573-575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Enlightenment An Anthology Prepared for the Enlightenment Book Club|url=http://www.rosenfels.org/The_Age_Of_Enlightenment_Anthology.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2018|pages=1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Times Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwEjAQAAMAAJ|volume=1, 84|year=1979|publisher=New York Times Company|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.&lt;ref name="Sangeeta2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Sangeeta|title=Development of Modern Art Criticism in India after Independence: Post Independence Indian Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqs4DwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=6 October 2017|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-947697-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]], a German philosopher and a seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which "that which is" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.

==Forms, genres, media, and styles==
[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]]'' by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] (French, 1806), oil on canvas]]
{{Main|The arts}}
The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as [[List of art mediums|media]], genre, [[Art movement|styles]], and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walton |first1=Kendall L. |title=Categories of Art |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 1970 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=334–67 |doi=10.2307/2183933 |jstor=2183933}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Art form''''' refers to the [[elements of art]] that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., [[figurae]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monelle |first1=Raymond |title=Linguistics and Semiotics in Music |date=3 January 1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-3718652099 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMtQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;pg=PA202#q=figurae |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Color theory|color]], [[Contour drawing|contour]], [[Fourth dimension in art|dimension]], [[List of art mediums|medium]], [[melody]], [[Negative space|space]], [[Texture (painting)|texture]], and [[Lightness|value]]. Form may also include [[Visual design elements and principles#Principles of design|visual design principles]], such as arrangement, [[Formal balance|balance]], [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], [[harmony]], [[Hierarchical proportion|proportion]], [[Principles of grouping|proximity]], and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Belton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belton |first1=Dr. Robert J. |title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook |chapter=The Elements of Art |date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Extreme [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Min |last2=Deng |first2=Guifang |title=Against Zangwill's Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature |journal=Philosophia |date=2 December 2014 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=249–57 |doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1 |url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content – i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s – while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[Importance|significance]].&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Extreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=Paisley |title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics |journal=New Literary History |date=1998 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=831–46 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042 |url=http://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munk |first1=Eduard |last2=Beck |first2=Charles |last3=Felton |first3=Cornelius Conway |title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans |date=1844 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tolstoy |first1=Leo |title=What is Art? |date=1899 |publisher=Crowell |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Finally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Melahat Küçükarslan |last1=Emiroğlu |first2=Fitnat Cimşit |last2=Koş |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16–20 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901145415/http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf "Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art"], ''Signs – International Journal of Semiotics'' 3, pp. 1–28, 2010. {{ISSN|1902-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oc-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=July 1872|publisher=Illustrated London News &amp; Sketch Limited|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.&lt;ref name="NewtonNeil1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Newton|author2=William Neil|title=2000 Years of Christian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSfAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency,&lt;ref name="RichardsGjertson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirk Richards|author2=Stephen Gjertson|title=For glory and for beauty: practical perspectives on Christianity and the visual arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaBGAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Classical Realism|isbn=978-0-9636180-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.&lt;ref name="Leslie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Leslie|title=Pablo Picasso: A Modern Master|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE8Es-9j3e0C|date=30 December 2005|publisher=New Line Books|isbn=978-1-59764-094-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DillenbergerHandley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Dillenberger|author2=John Handley|title=The Religious Art of Pablo Picasso|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uglDQAAQBAJ|date=17 April 2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27629-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MonaLisa sfumato.jpeg|thumb|Detail of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', showing the painting technique of ''[[sfumato]]'']]
A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK_jTggtYl8C|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57364-7|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Luke|title=Damien Hirst's Shark: Nature, Capitalism and the Sublime|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/luke-white-damien-hirsts-shark-nature-capitalism-and-the-sublime-r1136828|publisher=Tate|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=en|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-motivated functions ===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;
# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. - Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. "The World as I See It". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. - Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. - Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions ===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephanidis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011,Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as entertainment'''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.&lt;ref name="Resources2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as a "free zone"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as "a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).

# '''Art for psychological and healing purposes.''' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.&lt;ref name="Hogan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. "Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

==Public access==
[[File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|upright=2|thumb|left|Versailles: [[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', later copied all over Europe.]]

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 161-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics of the Indigenous Peoples of South America: Studies of Production and Exchange using INAA|url=https://core.tdar.org/collection/58128/ceramics-of-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-studies-of-production-and-exchange-using-inaa|website=core.tdar.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ann Kipfer|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C|date=30 April 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46158-3|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[coin]]s were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Coins as Works of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34jbjgEACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1960|publisher=Museum Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.&lt;ref name="Tucker2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hugo Tucker|title=Forms of the "medieval" in the "Renaissance": A Multidisciplinary Exploration of a Cultural Continuum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfbNzcqgYM4C|year=2000|publisher=Rookwood Press|isbn=978-1-886365-20-9|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular prints]] of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony Griffiths|title=Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbxFOR8ujlYC|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20714-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Győző Vörös|title=Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-963-662-084-4|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.&lt;ref name="Waldie1839"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Waldie|title=The Select Circulating Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBs7AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1839|publisher=A. Waldie.|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="MeyerSavoy2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Meyer|author2=Benedicte Savoy|title=The Museum Is Open: Towards a Transnational History of Museums 1750-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhroBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=1 January 2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-029882-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753. The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.&lt;ref name="Fossi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gloria Fossi|title=The Uffizi: The Official Guide : All of the Works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYUh_6F-hc8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=978-88-09-01487-9|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], Munich and other capitals. The opening of the [[Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpD9NgeQozEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04434-7|pages=281–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.&lt;ref name="Findlay2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Findlay|title=The Value of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6jJ5FvdLjcC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Prestel Verlag|isbn=978-3-641-08342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist – On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys |journal=ArtForum |date=December 1969 |first=Willoughby |last=Sharp |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=45 |id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: ''New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality'', p. 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mia |last=Fineman |title=YouTube for Artists The best places to find video art online. |date=21 March 2007 |publisher= |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ |work=Slate |pages= |accessdate=3 August 2007 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', p. 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.&lt;ref name="McCue2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen McCue|title=British Romanticism and the Reception of Italian Old Master Art, 1793-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW43DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-17148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickerson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela K.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.&lt;ref name="RuprechtTaiana1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvina Ruprecht|author2=Cecilia Taiana|title=Reordering of Culture: Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada in the Hood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onoI0AI-JJYC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 November 1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-88629-269-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stout2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.&lt;ref name="ChapmanCiment2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chapman|author2=James Ciment|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XO9nBwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47351-0|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Arthur Brown|title=Noah's Other Son: Bridging the Gap Between the Bible and the Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjbUAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 October 2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2996-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism or truth to nature]] and the [[Idealism|ideal]]; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries.  This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth". [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Modernism===
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872–1944)]]
The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; New York, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-06700-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".&lt;ref name = "Frascina"&gt;''Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology''. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = "Frascina" /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T.

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.&lt;ref name="Gemünden1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerd Gemünden|title=Framed Visions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mpfn_pue34C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08560-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Yorker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BcnAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2004|publisher=F-R Publishing Corporation|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name="Duchamp Interview Clip"&gt;{{YouTube|haon2DXWvLk|Duchamp Two Statements}}{{Dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]], and farming etc.&lt;ref name="BurgueteLam2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maria Burguete|author2=Lui Lam|title=Arts: A Science Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKmND2ImrGUC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4324-93-9|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Criticism and the "intentional fallacy"===
Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.&lt;ref name="Waugh2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colebrook1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.&lt;ref name="Roholt2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tiger C. Roholt|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6aAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3246-8|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hick2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darren Hudson Hick|title=Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_S4DgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-00691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==="Linguistic turn" and its debate===
The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 [[John Locke lectures]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, "Feasible Aesthetic Formalism", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification disputes==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit. Stieglitz used a backdrop of ''The Warriors'' by [[Marsden Hartley]] to photograph the urinal. The exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name="Tomkins, p. 186"&gt;Tomkins, ''Duchamp: A Biography'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the movies, superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Solomon |title=2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=14 December 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-video-game-art.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. ''Contemporary Art and the Home''. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-85973-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis [http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm "Tribal Art"] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur.

Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the [[decorative arts]], or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glancey |first1=Jonathan |title=Is advertising art? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/is-advertising-art-1593252.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=The Independent |date=26 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal hollow log tomb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]

Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist),&lt;ref name="Potts2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Potts|title=The Kahuna Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uu6lPR6EPQC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=8 August 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8689-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&amp;nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.&lt;ref name="AddisonBurgess2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Addison|author2=Lesley Burgess|title=Debates in Art and Design Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOY10gcBeP8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=28 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-61887-8|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FergusonMansbach2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yale H.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Gordon |title=Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Mahayana Buddhism}}
The '''Bodhisattva Precepts''' ({{CJKV|t=菩薩戒|p=Púsà Jiè}}, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''bosatsukai'') are a set of moral codes used in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism to advance a practitioner along the path to becoming a [[Bodhisattva]]. Traditionally, monastics observed the basic moral code in Buddhism, the [[Prātimokṣa]] (such as that of the [[Dharmaguptaka]]), but in the Mahayana tradition, monks may observe the Bodhisattva Precepts as well.

==Sets of Precepts==

===''Brahmajala Sutra''===
The ''[[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sutra]]'', translated by [[Kumārajīva]] (c. 400 CE), has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor Bodhisattva vows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism (bodhisattvaśīla)|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bodhisattva Precepts may be often called the "Brahma Net Precepts" ({{zh|c=梵網戒|p=Fànwǎng Jiè}}), particularly in Buddhist scholarship, although other sets of bodhisattva precepts may be found in other texts as well. Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the ten major precepts are considered the bodhisattva precepts. According to the sutra, the ten major bodhisattva precepts are in summary:&lt;ref name="Thanh 2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thanh |first=Minh |title=The Brahma Net Sutra |year=2000 |url=http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |publisher=New York: Sutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151922/http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Not to kill or encourage others to kill.
# Not to steal or encourage others to steal.
# Not to engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. A monk is expected to abstain from sexual conduct entirely.
# Not to use false words and speech, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to trade or sell alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so.
# Not to broadcast the misdeeds or faults of the Buddhist assembly, nor encourage others to do so.
# Not to praise oneself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to be stingy, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to harbor anger or encourage others to be angry.
# Not to speak ill of the Buddha, the Dharma or the Sangha (lit. the Triple Jewel)) or encourage others to do so.

Breaking any of these precepts is described as a major offense in the sutra. A fuller description is as follows:&lt;ref name="Thanh 2000"/&gt;
{{quote|
# A disciple of the Buddha shall not himself kill, encourage others to kill, kill by expedient means, praise killing, rejoice at witnessing killing, or kill through incantation or deviant mantras. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of killing, and shall not intentionally kill any living creature. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to nurture a mind of compassion and filial piety, always devising expedient means to rescue and protect all beings. If instead, he fails to restrain himself and kills sentient beings without mercy, he commits a Parajika (major) offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not himself steal or encourage others to steal, steal by expedient means, steal by means of incantation or deviant mantras. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of stealing. No valuables or possessions, even those belonging to ghosts and spirits or thieves and robbers, be they as small as a needle or blade of grass, may be stolen. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to have a mind of mercy, compassion, and filial piety -- always helping people earn merits and achieve happiness. If instead, he steals the possessions of others, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. [As a monk] he should not have sexual relations with any female -- be she a human, animal, deity or spirit -- nor create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of such misconduct. Indeed, he must not engage in improper sexual conduct with anyone. A Buddha's disciple ought to have a mind of filial piety -- rescuing all sentient beings and instructing them in the Dharma of purity and chastity. If instead, he lacks compassion and encourages others to engage in sexual relations promiscuously, including with animals and even their mothers, daughters, sisters, or other close relatives, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not himself use false words and speech, or encourage others to lie or lie by expedient means. He should not involve himself in the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of lying, saying that he has seen what he has not seen or vice versa, or lying implicitly through physical or mental means.  As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to maintain Right Speech and Right Views always, and lead all others to maintain them as well. If instead, he causes wrong speech, wrong views or evil karma in others, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not trade in alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of selling any intoxicant whatsoever, for intoxicants are the causes and conditions of all kinds of offenses. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to help all sentient beings achieve clear wisdom. If instead, he causes them to have upside-down, topsy-turvy thinking, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not himself broadcast the misdeeds or infractions of Bodhisattva-clerics or Bodhisattva-laypersons, or of [ordinary] monks and nuns -- nor encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of discussing the offenses of the assembly. As a Buddha's disciple, whenever he hears evil persons, externalists or followers of the Two Vehicles speak of practices contrary to the Dharma or contrary to the precepts within the Buddhist community, he should instruct them with a compassionate mind and lead them to develop wholesome faith in the Mahayana. If instead, he discusses the faults and misdeeds that occur within the assembly, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha shall not praise himself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of praising himself and disparaging others. As a disciple of the Buddha, he should be willing to stand in for all sentient beings and endure humiliation and slander -- accepting blame and letting sentient beings have all the glory. If instead, he displays his own virtues and conceals the good points of others, thus causing them to suffer slander, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not be stingy or encourage others to be stingy. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of stinginess. As a Bodhisattva, whenever a destitute person comes for help, he should give that person what he needs. If instead, out of anger and resentment, he denies all assistance -- refusing to help with even a penny, a needle, a blade of grass, even a single sentence or verse or a phrase of Dharma, but instead scolds and abuses that person -- he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha shall not harbor anger or encourage others to be angry. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of anger. As a disciple of the Buddha, he ought to be compassionate and filial, helping all sentient beings develop the good roots of non-contention. If instead, he insults and abuses sentient beings, or even transformation beings [such as deities and spirits], with harsh words, hitting them with his fists or feet, or attacking them with a knife or club -- or harbors grudges even when the victim confesses his mistakes and humbly seeks forgiveness in a soft, conciliatory voice -- the disciple commits a Parajika offense. 
# A Buddha's disciple shall not himself speak ill of the Triple Jewel or encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods or karma of slander. If a disciple hears but a single word of slander against the Buddha from externalists or evil beings, he experiences a pain similar to that of three hundred spears piercing his heart. How then could he possibly slander the Triple Jewel himself? Hence, if a disciple lacks faith and filial piety towards the Triple Jewel, and even assists evil persons or those of aberrant views to slander the Triple Jewel, he commits a Parajika offense.}}

===''Bodhisattvabhumi''===
[[Asanga]] (circa 300 AD) delineated 18 major vows and forty-six minor vows in the "Bodhisattvabhumi" section of the ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso 1995, pp.13&amp;ndash;34&lt;/ref&gt; These Bodhisattva vows are still used in all four major traditions of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The eighteen major vows (as actions to be abandoned) are as follows:
# Praising oneself or belittling others due to attachment to receiving material offerings, praise and respect.
# Not giving material aid or (due to miserliness) not teaching the Dharma to those who are suffering and without a protector.
# Not listening to others' apologies or striking others.
# Abandoning the Mahayana by saying that Mahayana texts are not the words of Buddha or teaching what appears to be the Dharma but is not. 
# Taking things belonging to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dharma]] or [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].
# Abandoning the holy Dharma by saying that texts which teach the three vehicles are not the Buddha's word.
# With anger depriving ordained ones of their robes, beating and imprisoning them or causing them to lose their ordination even if they have impure morality, for example, by saying that being ordained is useless.
# Committing any of the five extremely negative actions: (1) killing one's mother, (2) killing one's father, (3) killing an [[arhat]], (4) intentionally drawing blood from a Buddha or (5) causing schism in the Sangha community by supporting and spreading sectarian views.
# Holding distorted views (which are contrary to the teaching of Buddha, such as denying the existence of the Three Jewels or the law of cause and effect etc.)
# Destroying towns, villages, cities or large areas by means such as fire, bombs, pollution or black magic.
# Teaching emptiness to those whose minds are unprepared.
# Causing those who have entered the Mahayana to turn away from working for the full enlightenment of Buddhahood and encouraging them to work merely for their own liberation from suffering.
# Causing others to abandon their [[Prātimokṣa]] vows.
# Belittling the [[Śrāvakayāna]] or [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]] (by holding and causing others to hold the view that these vehicles do not abandon attachment and other delusions).
# Falsely stating that oneself has realised profound [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and that if others meditate as one has, they will realize emptiness and become as great and as highly realized as oneself.
# Taking gifts from others who were encouraged to give you things originally intended as offerings to the Three Jewels. Not giving things to the Three Jewels that others have given you to give to them, or accepting property stolen from the Three Jewels.
# Causing those engaged in calm-abiding meditation to give it up by giving their belongings to those who are merely reciting texts or making bad disciplinary rules which cause a spiritual community not to be harmonious.
# Abandoning either of the two types of [[bodhicitta]] (aspiring and engaging).

According to [[Atiśa]], the Prātimokṣa vows are the basis for the Bodhisattva vows. Without keeping one of the different sets of Prātimokṣa vows (in one of the existing Vinaya schools), there can be no Bodhisattva vow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Great Kagyu Masters: The Golden Lineage Treasury |last=Gyaltsen |first=Konchog |year=1990 |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |location=Ithaca |isbn=9780937938881 | oclc=22210145 |pages=154&amp;ndash;86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sixteen Bodhisattva Precepts in Sōtō Zen===

In the [[Sōtō]] school of [[Zen]], the founder [[Dōgen]] established a somewhat expanded version of the Bodhisattva Precepts for use by both priests and lay followers, based on both Brahma Net Sutra and other sources.  Many various translations exist, the following is used by [[John Daido Loori]], [[rōshi]] at the [[Zen Mountain Monastery]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mro.org/mro.html Mountains and Rivers Order of Zen Buddhism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821220000/http://www.mro.org/mro.html |date=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Three Treasures ====
*Taking refuge in the Buddha
*Taking refuge in the Dharma
*Taking refuge in the Sangha

The Three Treasures are universally known in Buddhism as the Three Refuges or [[Three Jewels]].

==== The Three Pure Precepts ====
*Do not create Evil
*Practice Good
*Actualize Good For Others

These are also known as the ''Three Root Precepts'', and are mentioned in the [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahma Net Sutra]] as well.

==== The Ten Grave Precepts ====
*Respect life – Do not kill
*Be giving – Do not steal
*Honor the body – Do not misuse sexuality
*Manifest truth – Do not lie
*Proceed clearly – Do not cloud the mind
*See the perfection – Do not speak of others' errors and faults
*Realize self and others as one – Do not elevate the self and blame others
*Give generously – Do not be withholding
*Actualize harmony – Do not be angry
*Experience the intimacy of things – Do not defile the Three Treasures

==Traditional uses==

===Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese traditions===
The Chinese [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] monk, [[Yin Shun]], wrote of the Bodhisattva Precepts, "To cultivate [[bodhicitta|bodhi mind]] means to accept the bodhisattva precepts and practice the ten good deeds."&lt;ref name="yin-shun"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shih | first = Yin-Shun | title = The Way to Buddhahood | 
publisher = Wisdom Publications | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-86171-133-5 | page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the acceptance of and ordination of the Bodhisattva Precepts varies greatly depending on the school of Mahayana Buddhism. In [[East Asian Buddhism]], a fully ordained monk or nun ordains under the traditional [[prātimokṣa]] precepts first according to the [[vinaya]] of the [[Dharmaguptaka]]. In the Chinese tradition, this is called the ''Four Part Vinaya'' ({{zh|c=四分律|p=Sìfēnlǜ}}). Then as a supplement, the same disciple would undertake the Bodhisattva Precepts as well.

Monks and nuns are not considered "ordained" by the Bodhisattva Precepts, but rather by the "Four Part Vinaya", while the Bodhisattva Precepts served to strengthen the Mahayana ideals.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=James L.|title=Jokei and Buddhist Devotion in Early Medieval Japan|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=0-19-518814-4|pages=131, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Bodhisattva Precepts are given to lay disciples to strengthen their devotion to Buddhism as well.&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; Such disciples often take the basic [[Five Precepts]] and then the Bodhisattva precepts as a supplement.

===Japanese traditions===
In [[Buddhism in Japan]], the "Four-Part Vinaya" was deemphasized with the rise of [[Saichō]] and the [[Tendai]] sect&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; and a new monastic community was set up exclusively using the ''Brahmajala Sutra''{{'}}s Bodhisattva Precepts. All Vinaya ordinations at the time were given at [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and Saichō had wanted to both undermine the power of the Nara Buddhist community and to establish a "purely Mahayana lineage",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages=40–44, 50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made a request to the Emperor to Later Buddhist sects, which was granted 7 days after his death in 822.

Later Buddhist sects in Japan, including the [[Sōtō|Sōtō school of Zen]], [[Jōdo-shū]] and [[Shingon Buddhism]], adopted a similar approach to their monastic communities and exclusive use of the Bodhisattva Precepts. By this time in Japan, the Vinaya lineage had all but died out and Japan's remote location made it difficult to reestablish though limited efforts by [[Jōkei (monk)|Jōkei]] and the [[Shingon Risshu]] revived it for a time. This was further enforced during the [[Meiji period]], when the {{nihongo|Nikujiku Saitai Law|肉食妻帯||}} of 1872 decriminalized clerical marriage and meat-eating.&lt;ref&gt;Horii, Mitsutoshi (2006).

'''Clara Tice''' (22 May 1888 – 2 February 1973) was an American [[avant-garde]] illustrator and artist, who spent most of her life in [[New York City, United States]]. Because of her provocative art and public appearances, she was seen as representative of bohemian [[Greenwich Village]] and thus known as "The Queen of Greenwich Village."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=414–441|author=Keller, Marie T.|authorlink=Clara Tice|editor=Naomi Sawelson-Gorse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
According to herself and the ''[[New York Times]]'', in 1908 Tice was the first woman in Greenwich Village to bob her hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogue of Bobbed Hair: Of Course Greenwich Village Lassies Wear Short Locks, But Society's Doing It Too|journal=New York Times|date=27 June 1920|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Tice was able to study under the famous artist and teacher [[Robert Henri]]. In 1910, Henri and some of his artist friends, organized the first exhibition of Independent Artist. This art show, which was with its jury-free and no-awards concept quite a revolution at that time and thus received enormous attention, was financially backed by Tice and featured her works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=415–416|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immersion in the arts ==
A few years later, namely in 1915, Tice's fame skyrocketed when [[Anthony Comstock]], main founder of the [[Society for the Suppression of Vice]], tried to confiscate Tice's art at the well-known bohemian restaurant Polly's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naumann|first=Francis M.|title=New York Dada 1915-23.|year=1994|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter images of Tice's artworks and photos of the artist were featured in magazines such as ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]], Rogue, [[The Blind Man]],'' and ''[[Cartoons magazine]]''. During that time she had several one-person exhibitions and also worked on numerous other projects, for example, she created posters for bohemian costume balls and played herself in the 1922 version of the ''Greenwich Village Follies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=416–429|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years, Tice not only played an important part in Greenwich Village's colorful art scene, but also joined the Arensberg Circle in their uptown location. It was probably [[Marcel Duchamp]] who introduced Tice to Walter and Louise Arensberg and their salon. There she met [[Henri-Pierre Roché]], with whom she spent several evenings. Tice also participated in two projects by the Arensberg Circle: first, two of her works were shown in the first exhibition of the [[Society of Independent Artists]] and second, one of her works was featured in ''The Blind Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=425–427|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, she illustrated about a dozen books with her erotic images,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=432–434|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are nowadays expensive collector's items. In 1940, her own book called ''ABC Dogs'' was published. It is a children's book in which each letter of the alphabet is represented by a dog breed whose name starts with the same letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tice|first=Clara|title=ABC Dogs|year=1940|publisher=Funk|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication sparked renewed interest in Tice and her art. She also worked on her memoirs, which she never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=414–441|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ECOWEEK''' ''Εβδομάδα Οικολογίας'' (Greek) is a private non-profit, non-governmental international organization aiming towards the empowerment, networking, education and training of young professionals - architects, designers, engineers, landscape architects - towards sustainable urban and public interventions and facilitation of action through fieldwork, workshops, education and training and through cooperation with local authorities, organizations and leaders.

== Mission ==
ECOWEEK mission is to raise environmental awareness and awareness on [[climate change]] and to promote the principles of [[sustainability]].

== History ==
ECOWEEK was initially established in Aegina, Greece in 2005. It was initially conceived as a community event - ''Ecological Week in Aegina'' - to raise environmental awareness of the local community of 14,000. At the time Aegina was challenged by unresolved waste management,&lt;ref&gt;Ζουμπουλάκης, Γ. (7-08-2005). ''Χωρίς νερό αλλά με σκουπίδια - Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΒΗΜΑ - http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=167683&lt;/ref&gt; illegal burning of waste, inexistant waste recycling program, water shortages,&lt;ref&gt;Χριστοδουλίδου, Π. (9-08-2005). ''Άρχισε ξανά η μεταφορά νερού στην Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22733&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=11058&lt;/ref&gt; energy shortages, and a thriving and partially unregulated spec construction market for summer houses, which although contributed to the local economy, it put pressure in protected areas to be developed and constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Petropoulos, Thracy. (1-06-2007). ''Concrete plans unsettled''. ATHENS NEWS - http://www.aeginagreece.com/main/aegina_eco/cementfactory.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Construction also contributed in increasing illegal disposal of construction waste in natural reserves, and the increase of the summer population thus bringing the capacity of the existing infrastructures of the island to its limits.

Ecological Week in Aegina was held in Aegina for 2 years. In 2007, responding to an increase demand for environmental awareness beyond Aegina, ECOWEEK co-organized activity throughout Greece, and initiated free-admission screenings of award-winning documentary on Climate Change by Davis Guggenheim ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' with [[Al Gore]] in schools, the army, and public screenings in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Lamia, Corfu, and Crete. Within this activity, in June 2007, ECOWEEK held a public free-admission keynote lecture and slide show on Climate Change by inviting Al Gore&lt;ref&gt;Πολιτισμός. (22-5-2007). ''Ο Αλ Γκορ στο Μέγαρο Μουσικής''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22784&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=110309&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Athens Concert Hall]]. In 2007 ECOWEEK was also established in Jerusalem, Israel and in 2008 ECOWEEK initiated the first Ecological Week in [[Larnaka]], [[Cyprus]], in cooperation with the Municipality of Larnaka], involving schools, universities, professional organizations, and the general public.

== Programs ==
Since 2005, ECOWEEK developed its outreach activity towards raising awareness to a variety of population groups, age-groups and interests. For example, from children activity, cleaning of beaches, lottery of composters and solar chargers, to academic and colloquial lectures, site visits, design workshops, and film screenings.
Since 2008, ECOWEEK activity focuses more on sustainable design and ecological building, social design,and [[placemaking]]. Its activity involved primarily one-week-long design workshops and international conferences for young and established professionals - primarily architects, designers, landscape architects and engineers. ECOWEEK has developed and expanded its activity through close collaboration with cultural institutions, such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] Continental Europe, the [[British Council]], [[Goethe Institute]], academic institutions, municipalities and governments. ECOWEEK has initiated and organized activities in [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Ag. Nikolaos]] ([[Crete]]), [[Athens]], [[Bethany (biblical village)|Azaryia]] ([[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]]), [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]], [[Cairns]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Istanbul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Kraków]], [[London]], [[Milan]]o, [[Mumbai]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Tilburg]], [[Pristina|Prishtina]], and [[Rome]].

In 2017 ECOWEEK published its first book titled [http://ecoweekbook.org/ ECOWEEK Book#1: 50 Voices for Sustainability], featuring fifty articles by leading architects,designers, professionals, academics and environmentalists from around the world. Among them award-winning architects [[Kengo Kuma]], [[Bjarke Ingels|BIG]], [[MVRDV]], [[Françoise-Hélène Jourda|Francoise-Helene Jourda]], [[Diébédo Francis Kéré|Diebedo Francis Kere]], [[Michael Sorkin]], Prof. David Orr and Antarctica explorer [[Robert Swan]]. The same year ECOWEEK also issued [https://issuu.com/ecoweek/docs/ecoweek_catalogue_2016 ECOWEEK: The Workshops] a publication with a collection of ideas and projects from the ECOWEEK workshops (2009-2016).

== Hassan Fathy ==
In 1989 ECOWEEK co-founder architect Elias Messinas met the late Egyptian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] - author of [[Architecture for the Poor]] - in [[Cairo]]. In that meeting, Fathy conveyed to Messinas how problems in Egypt - among them housing for the poor - could be solved. Among others Fathy challenged Messinas when he emphasized the need for young professionals to be more aware of their own community and instead of imitating architecture in international magazines, to reach out, learn about and be creative while benefiting with their work their own community.

Inspired by Fathy, ECOWEEK workshops have gradually developed a more hands-on approach that links between acedemia and the community, and between professionals and students since 2010. Aiming to both empower and train young professionals to address urban public space, placemaking, urban communities through interventions in design and hands-on workshops in urban public context, ECOWEEK and its partners have developed a model of close collaboration with local authorities, local organizations and leaders. Through this collaboration, the ECOWEEK workshops are assigned projects that are real, support them with professional consultants and see that some of the projects are implemented. Students' ideas are heard and cities, neighborhoods and communities benefit from the innovative and creative ideas of students and the professional guidance of the workshop leaders.

[[File:Ecoweek greenhouse.jpg|thumb|right]]
Aiming to establish a permanent platform and not just one-week-long activity, ECOWEEK established the GREENHOUSE in 2011 in Athens, Greece. The GREENHOUSE is a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship for society and the environment, engaging young architects, designers, landscape architects and students in real design assignments for real non-profit organizations and local authorities. The GREENHOUSE teams, under the guidance of experienced professionals, have developed sustainable solutions for schools, community centers, [https://ecoweekorg.wixsite.com/ghath2017 welfare institutions] and the urban public space in Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece and Holon,&lt;ref&gt;(20-05-2013).

'''[[Torture]]''' has been used throughout history for the purpose of obtaining information in [[interrogation]]. Torture, while widely illegal and a violation of international law, has been frequently cited as generating false or misleading information, and lacks scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness. The counterargument points to some specific cases{{which|date=September 2018}} where torture has elicited true information.

== Historical Examples of the Use of Torture ==

=== Judicial Use of Torture ===

====17th century====

One early writer on the ineffectiveness of torture was [[Friedrich Spee]] (1591-1635). Spee was a [[Germany|German]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, professor, and poet, most noted as an opponent of [[Witch trials|trials for witchcraft]].  Spee was the first person in his time to present strong written and spoken arguments against [[torture]], especially with regards to its unreliability in obtaining "truth" from someone undergoing painful questioning.&lt;ref name="Hellyer"&gt;Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld: ''Cautio Criminalis, or a Book on Witch Trials'' (1631), translated by Marcus Hellyer. University of Virginia Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8139-2182-1}}. The [https://books.google.com/books?id=gp1GMTaUuzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover translator's introduction (pp. vii–xxxvi)] contains many details on Spee's life.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that subjects would make up stories if it meant the torture would cease.

=== Military Use of Torture ===

====World War II====

After the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of the atomic bombs]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] during World War II, the Japanese military tortured a captured American [[P-51]] [[fighter pilot]], Marcus McDilda,  in order to discover how many [[atomic bombs]] the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had and what the future targets were. McDilda, who knew nothing about the atomic bomb nor the [[Manhattan Project]], "confessed" under torture that the U.S. had 100 atomic bombs and that [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]] were the next targets. McDilda's false confession may have swayed the Japanese leaders' [[Surrender of Japan|decision to surrender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Jerome T. Hagen| title=War in the Pacific, Chapter 25 "The Lie of Marcus McDilda"| publisher= Hawaii Pacific University| year=1996| ISBN=978-0-9653927-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kristof&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/05/opinion/blood-on-our-hands.html |title=Blood On Our Hands? |first=Nicholas |last=Kristof |authorlink=Nicholas Kristof |date=5 August 2003 |accessdate=20 May 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korean War====
Chinese interrogators tortured U.S. Air Force prisoners of war during the [[Korean War]] with the specific goal of eliciting false confessions.&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/us/02detain.html |title=China Inspired Interrogations at Guantánamo|last1=Shane |first1=Scott |authorlink=Scott Shane |date=July 2, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, these false confessions led to allegations that the airmen had been "[[brainwashing|brainwashed]]", so the United States interviewed the former prisoners of war to collect information on the torture techniques employed, publishing their results in 1957.&lt;ref name=Biderman&gt;{{cite journal |title=Communist Attempts to Elicit False Confessions from Air Force Prisoners of War |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1806204/pdf/bullnyacadmed00378-0046.pdf |first=Albert D. |last=Biderman |work=[[Journal of Urban Health|Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine]] |date=September 1957 |volume=33 |issue=9 |pages=616–625 |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These torture techniques were incorporated into the [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) program to train servicemembers to resist torture.&lt;ref name=china /&gt;

====1992 U.S. Army Field Manual====
[[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation]], the [[United States Army Field Manuals|United States Army field manual]], explains that torture "is a poor technique that yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants to hear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=United States Department of the Army |authorlink=United States Department of the Army |title=FM 34-52: Intelligence Interrogation |date=28 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is torture ineffective at gathering reliable information, but it also increases the difficulty of gathering information from a source in the future.

Since the revelations in 2004 and 2008 that the President [[George W. Bush]] administration [[Torture Memos|authorized the use of torture]] in interrogations, and that United States personnel have used such practices in interrogations related to the [[9/11 attacks]] and [[al-Qaeda]], both at [[black sites]] and at [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp]], discussions on this topic have been heated. In commenting on the use and effectiveness of various torture methods, with a focus on [[waterboarding]], former U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]], [[Dennis C. Blair]], wrote in 2009 that "high value information came from interrogations in which these methods were used".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/us/politics/23detain.html?_r=0|title=Interrogations' Effectiveness May Prove Elusive|work=[[New York Times]]|date=22 April 2009 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a Senate Committee that investigated claims of useful information being extracted from suspects that underwent enhanced interrogation concluded that critical and valuable information was not obtained using these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/jan/26/does-torture-work-and-is-it-worth-the-cost-donald-trump|title=Does torture work – and is it worth the cost?|last=Burke|first=Jason|date=26 January 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5,700-page [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] also concluded that the CIA repeatedly and deliberately impeded oversight, as well as misrepresenting the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation technique to policymakers and to the public through coordinated [[news leak|leaking]] of false information.&lt;ref name=TheReportItself&gt;{{cite web

Alex Knapp, a staff writer at ''[[Forbes]],'' wrote the following in 2009, "Time and time again, people with actual experience with interrogating terror suspects and actual experience and knowledge about the effectiveness of torture techniques have come out to explain that they are ineffective and that their use threatens national security more than it helps".&lt;ref name="knapp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/an_fbi_interrogator_on_the_effectiveness_of_torture/ |title=An FBI Interrogator on the Effectiveness of Torture |publisher=Outsidethebeltway.com |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had written an article about an FBI interrogator, who noted their practice did not include torture; FBI agents had registered strong disapproval of the US military approach.&lt;ref name="knapp"/&gt;

Annette Sisco argues that "the [torture] techniques... are specifically designed to make captives pliable and dependent. They are designed to get prisoners to say whatever you want them to say".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Annette Sisco |url=http://blog.nola.com/guesteditorials/2009/04/how_effective_is_torture_not_v.html |title=How effective is torture? Not very &amp;#124; NOLA.com |publisher=''The Times-Picayune''/ Blog.nola.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many torture survivors report revealing false or incomplete information since their goal was to satisfy the torturer and end the suffering, not to reveal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgu.edu/pdffiles/sbos/costanzo_effects_of_interrogation.pdf |title=The Effects and Effectiveness of Using Torture as an Interrogation Device: Using Research to Inform the Policy Debate |last1=Costanza |first1=Mark A. |last2=Gerrity |first2=Ellen |date=December 2009 |publisher=Social Issues and Policy Review |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Physicians at War: the Dual-Loyalties Challenge'' by Fritz Allhoff explains that "to test the effectiveness of torture researchers would have to ignore the consent of the research subjects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D2BDGSZ0qJEC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Effectiveness+of+torture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mqXYTtH3EJDSmAWDpY3fCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Effectiveness%20of%20torture&amp;f=false |title=Physicians at war: the dual-loyalties challenge|editor=Fritz Allhoff|via=Google Books |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date= 2008|isbn=9781402069123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''entitlement''' is a [[provision (accounting)|provision]] made in accordance with a [[law|legal framework]] of a society. Typically, entitlements are based on concepts of [[principle]] ("[[rights]]") which are themselves based in concepts of [[social equality]] or [[enfranchisement]]. In recent decades the meaning of the word has been extended to encompass informal expectations of social relationships, social conventions and [[social norms]] which are considered unreasonable or unduly prescriptive upon others{{clarify|date=October 2018}}{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

== Psychology ==
[[Psychoanalysis]] differentiated among children three main varieties of the sense of entitlement: normal; inflated; and compromised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; A normal or healthy sense of entitlement included an expectation of responsiveness from significant others,&lt;ref&gt;A. Goldberg, ''Advances in Self-Psychology'' (2013) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; a sense of agency, and a sense of one's right to one's own feelings - all forming positive elements in [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Ronningstam, ''Identifying and Understanding the Narcissistic Personality'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The inflated sense of entitlement sought special privileges for the individual alone, perhaps to compensate for childhood suffering or [[narcissistic injury]]; while the compromised sense involved an inability to expect the basic rights enjoyed by those around one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy]] distinguished in adult life between (ethically) ''earning'' entitlement in relationships, through care and consideration, and a subjective feeling of entitlement the real basis for which may be very different.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 109-10&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the depressive may have an unjustifiably low sense of entitlement, the manic an exaggeratedly high one.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The gambler may feel ''entitled'' to expect a big win, to compensate for childhood deprivation; those who clamour most loudly for such reimbursement from fate may in fact unconsciously doubt their entitlement to anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis''. (London 1946) p. 372 and p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

An inflated sense of what is sometimes called ''psychological entitlement''&lt;ref&gt;L. Ashner, ''When is Enough, Enough?'' (1997) p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; - unrealistic, [[exaggerated]], or rigidly held - is especially prominent among narcissists.  According to the [[DSM-5]], individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] (NPD) are likely to have a "sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others", typically without commensurate qualities or accomplishments:&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{citation|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.)|location=Arlington|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|pages=669–672|isbn=0890425558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{citation|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Narcissistic personality disorder: Symptoms|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|date=18 Nov 2014|accessdate=29 Apr 2016|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/con-20025568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to [[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin]], the [[narcissistic]] personality attempts to protect the [[vulnerable self]] by building layers of [[grandiosity]] and a huge sense of entitlement.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Farrell, ''Acts of Trust'' (2010) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

While an earned sense of entitlement is usually seen as more beneficent than purely psychological entitlement, it can also have a destructive counterpart in the sense of a felt entitlement to revenge based on the accumulation of grievances.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Exalted''''' is a [[role-playing game]] published by [[White Wolf Publishing]]. The game is classified as [[high fantasy]] and it was inspired by a mixture of world mythologies as well as Japanese [[Anime]].&lt;ref name="Chambers 2006 22–67"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=John|author2=Alan Alexander|author3=Rebecca Borgstrom|author4=Carl Bowen|author5=Zach Bush|author6=Joseph Carricker|author7=Genevieve Cogman|author8=Dawn Elliot|author9=Michael Goodwin|author10=Conrad Hubbard|author11=Peter Schaefer|author12=John Snead|author13=Andrew Watt|author14=William Wulf|editor=Carl Bowen|title=Exalted |edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=White Wolf Publishing|isbn=1-58846-684-1 |pages=22–67|chapter=Chapter One: Setting}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is currently in its third edition. First Edition was originally created by [[Robert Hatch (game designer)|Robert Hatch]], [[Justin Achilli]] and [[Stephan Wieck]]. The original core rulebook was published in July 2001.

==Influences==
The setting is strongly influenced by [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[Tales from the Flat Earth]]'', [[Michael Moorcock]]'s ''[[Hawkmoon]]'', [[Lord Dunsany]]'s ''[[The Gods of Pegana]]'' and [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]]'s ''[[Ninja Scroll]]''. Other influences include [[Glen Cook]]'s ''[[The Black Company]]''; [[Sean Stewart]]'s ''[[Resurrection Man (novel)|Resurrection Man]]'', ''[[The Night Watch (Stewart novel)|The Night Watch]]'', and ''[[Galveston (novel)|Galveston]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the Bible, and [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s ''[[Journey to the West]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Grabowski|first1=Geoff C.| author2=Bryan Armor|author3=Andrew Bates|author4=Kraig Blackwelder|author5=Dana Habecker|author6=Robert Hatch|author7=Sheri M.

== System ==

The game uses ten-sided [[dice]] and a variation of the [[Storytelling System|Storyteller System]]&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory12.phtml |title=A Brief History of Game #12: White Wolf, Part Two: 1993-Present |accessdate=2007-09-16 |author=Shannon Appelcline |year=2007 |work= |publisher=RPGnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; to arbitrate the action, and, as with many other RPGs, requires little beyond the rulebooks themselves, dice, pencil, and paper.  The Exalted version of the rules were derived from the trilogy of White Wolf Publishing games Aeon (Trinity), Aberrant, and Adventure where the idea of a fixed target number of 7 or higher was first introduced.  

Characters may be frequently presented with challenges that normal human beings, even within the context of the game, would find difficult, deadly, or simply impossible.  However, as the chosen champions of greater powers, each Exalt possesses Charms, which may either enhance their natural capabilities or manifest as shows of great power.  An Exalt with low-level archery charms might find her arrows hitting with preternatural accuracy, while greater faculty might allow her to shoot without difficulty to the edge of her vision, or turn a single arrow into a deadly rain of ammunition.

The Exalted frequently power their charms with accumulated Essence, a universal energy that flows through and comprises Creation and other worlds.  While normally their Essence recovered slowly through rest, in the first two editions they could also regain it more quickly by performing ''stunts'', actions given special description and embellishment by the players.  In the third edition stunts no longer regenerate Essence, but combat automatically causes Essence stores to refill quickly.  However, stunts continue to exist, and their primary benefit—adding extra dice to the actions they describe, thus enhancing the possibility of success—remains.

== History ==
Exalted has mechanical and thematic similarities to White Wolf's previous game series, the old [[World of Darkness]], but exists in its own product line, called the '''Age of Sorrows.''' The game has a sales record on par with the company's flagship title, ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'', the second edition core rulebook achieving a sales ranking at #23,558 on Amazon.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588466841/ |title=Exalted reviews on Amazon.com |accessdate=2007-02-09 |author=Amazon.com |year=2005 |work= |publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 4.5-star mean user review rating based on 13 user reviews as of January 2009.

The initial advertisements for Exalted placed the Age of Sorrows as the pre-history of the [[World of Darkness#Classic World of Darkness (cWoD)|old World of Darkness]].  However, once the game was released such connections became uncertain: names and themes from the World of Darkness line run throughout the material, but rarely in a way that suggested a direct connection between one and the other. Meanwhile, some oWoD supplements also supported this; the Hunter Apocrypha gave a vision of the past that said that Hunters gained their power from the broken shards of the souls of great heroes of a lost age. which seems to suggest that hunters carry fragments of Solar Essences. Likewise, the Kindred of the East supplement gave a structure of the Wheel of Ages (mirrored in Exalted first edition books as the Ages of Man) that seemed to accommodate the integration of Exalted and the classic World of Darkness, the former the first and second age, and the latter being the fifth age.

However, per the commentary of multiple developers, the connections are deliberately tenuous, allowing players to be free to treat it as a prehistory or as its own world as it may suit their individual game. The similarities between Exalted and the new edition of the World of Darkness are even weaker. The Second Edition seems to imply that its story is the prehistory of our ''own'' world on its back cover, but this idea is not explored in any depth past that book; while the last book of Second Edition would posit a modernized world with the Exalted, it was clearly a technologically advanced version of Creation &amp;ndash; the world of Exalted &amp;ndash; rather than Earth.

Shards of the Exalted Dream, the final 2nd edition product, was published in January 2012. Development of Exalted 3rd Edition was officially announced in October 2012. A [[Kickstarter]] [[crowdfunding]] campaign for Exalted 3rd edition ran in 2013 from May 9 to June 8, reaching its $60,000 funding goal within 18 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/200664283/deluxe-exalted-3rd-edition/posts/477304&lt;/ref&gt; and raising a total of $684,755 and breaking [[Numenera]]'s record for the most funded tabletop RPG Kickstarter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/200664283/deluxe-exalted-3rd-edition/posts/504354&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotions ==
In March 2008, White Wolf Publishing unveiled a promotion that would allow 2,500 [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] players to exchange their copy of their Edition 3.5 Player's Handbook for a copy of the Exalted Second Edition Core Rulebook.  The promotion was called "Graduate your Game" and has received mixed reviews from fans of both games.  The success of this promotion was not revealed.

== Setting ==

=== Background ===
In Exalted, the [[player character]]s are chosen by a deity and imbued with their powers (thus, "exalted", or "raised high"). There are numerous varieties of Exalted, each chosen by a different deity or group of deities; however, the core game is based around the Solar Exalted, Chosen of the Unconquered Sun, with the Core Rulebook covering the Solars' abilities, powers, and place within the setting. While the core rulebook mentions and discusses the other Exalted to the extent necessary for them to appear as supporting characters in Solar-themed games, additional sourcebooks provide the depth of detail necessary to stage other Exalted as playable characters.

According to the core sourcebooks and the supplementary materials, the history of the setting begins with the Primordials: vast entities akin to [[Greek primordial deities]] or the [[Outer God]]s of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s works, even going so far as to use similar epithets to the latter. They shaped Creation &amp;ndash; a flat world of finite extent &amp;ndash; from the [[Chaos (cosmogony)|primordial chaos]], and placed the gods (numberless immortal spirits resembling the [[Kami]] of [[Shinto]]) to watch over it.

In time, the [[Sky deity|Celestial Incarnae]], the greatest of the gods who represented great celestial objects such as the sun and moon, decided to end the rule of the callous and destructive Primordials and claim the Games of Divinity for their own, but they were forbidden from taking arms against the Primordials themselves. Instead, they imbued exceptional humans with their power (the titular Exalted) to fight for them. After a cataclysmic struggle, the Exalted finally triumphed over the Primordials, slaying many and then forcing the others to surrender.

Upon victory, the gods retreated to the city of Yu-Shan to oversee from on high, and granted the Exalted the [[Divine right of kings|Creation-Ruling Mandate]] as a boon for their service to the new order. The surrendered Primordials were banished to/became the [[Tartarus|Hell]] known as Malfeas, the Demon City. Now they are half-remembered only as the Yozis: ill-understood and impersonal cosmic deities whose continued worship is reckoned among the highest of heresies. The slain Primordials are known as the Neverborn, quiescent monsters whose impossible ending resulted in the formation of the [[Underworld]].

Common to all of [[White Wolf Publishing]]'s games, the primary character archetype, the Exalted, suffer from a systemic character flaw. In this case, this flaw is represented by a "Great Curse", uttered upon the dying breaths of the slain Primordials. This Great Curse manifests itself in a variety of ways and causes the "heroes" of the setting to be [[Hamartia|fatally flawed]]. In the game's history, the Solars eventually grew decadent and corrupt from this influence. After centuries of plotting, the Solars were slaughtered in a massive insurrection known as the Usurpation by the Terrestrial and Sidereal Exalted, their servants and advisors.  After the Usurpation, the majority of the Exaltations of the Solar Exalted were locked away, and an organization known as the Wyld Hunt was organized by agents of the Sidereals and Terrestrials to kill all the others, and drive the Lunar Exalted from the civilised lands of Creation.

During the intervening age, the Terrestrial Exalted became the rulers of the world, ruling in a system not unlike the [[Shōgun|shogunate]] of [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185–1868)|feudal Japan]]. After the Great Contagion (a plague engineered by the Neverborn to swell the population of the underworld and weaken Creation) and the Balorian Crusade (a war with the [[Fairy|Fair Folk]], who seek to return the world to Chaos) wrought devastation across Creation, a young captain of the Dragon-Blooded armies gained access to powerful weapons of the First Age. With these, she first beat back the Balorian Crusade, and then asserted her rulership over much of the world, dubbing herself the Scarlet Empress.  Nearly eight hundred years later—in the present day of the game—there are eleven Great Houses of the Realm, nearly all of whom claim direct descent from the Empress.

Five years prior to the default starting point of the game, the Empress vanished.  While she had temporarily disappeared before, by the present of the game it is believed she will not return, and the Realm stands on the brink of civil war. Simultaneously, the Solar exaltations held in the Jade Prison have returned.  With the Houses ignoring the threat of the Celestial Exalted to position themselves to take control of the Realm, the number of Solar Exalted in Creation is slowly growing. Thus, the backdrop to the setting sees the newly arisen Solars (among various other heroes and villains) struggling to survive their enemies in this time of tumult long enough to make their mark upon the fate of Creation, for good or for ill.&lt;ref name="Chambers 2006 22–67"/&gt;

The flat world of Creation is the primary setting of Exalted. Creation has two continents, the Blessed Isle and the unnamed super-continent which covers the northern, eastern and southern edges of Creation, populated by many nations and tribes, with the settled regions along the inner coast of this super-continent being known collectively as the threshold. The Blessed Isle is located in the center of Creation. The Realm rules the Blessed Isle and its proximate archipelago directly, and indirectly rules numerous tributary states known as satrapies along the threshold. The elemental poles of Creation color the directions of the map:  the frigid North, near the pole of Air, is divided by the White Sea; The element of Wood influences the heavily forested East, the most densely populated region of Creation other than the Blessed Isle; the Scavenger Lands, formally named the Confederation of Rivers, is an organization of allied nations within the East; the South, drawing from the Pole of Fire, is a hot, arid region; the influence of the Pole of Water upon the West shows itself in the Great Western Ocean encompassing various major and minor island nations; finally, the Elemental Pole of Earth, the least dangerous of the five, is located at the top of the towering Imperial Mountain in the centre of the Blessed Isle.

Surrounding Creation is the infinite ocean of Pure Chaos known as the Wyld. The cosmology of Exalted also includes the Underworld, the celestial city of Yu-Shan, the demon realm of Malfeas, the machine world of Autochthonia, and Elsewhere.

=== Types of Exalts ===
At the core of the setting, there are several different types of Exalted, any type of which could play the role of protagonist or antagonist of the game. The Exalted of Creation can be divided into two categories: Terrestrial Exalted and Celestial Exalted. Celestial Exalted, being the chosen of the Celestial Incarnae, are significantly more powerful than Terrestrial Exalted, and can live for millennia, but their numbers are limited by a fixed number of Exaltations passing from mortal life to mortal life at any given time. Terrestrial Exalted are the chosen of the Elemental Dragons, children of the primordial Gaia, who govern the elemental underpinnings of Creation. While less powerful, Terrestrial Exalted (commonly known as the Dragon-Blooded) can pass on their Exaltation to their children, much like one would pass on other genetic features.

The Abyssal, Alchemical, and Infernal Exalted technically fall outside of the two categories, though their power level is comparable to that of Celestial Exalted. A brief synopsis of each type is given here, organized by relative power and significance within the game.

Most types of Exalted have certain collective predispositions toward or against other Exalt types, and may be viewed differently by the various mortals of Creation; while the Dragon-Blooded and their world-spanning empire are often seen as demigods and heroes, for instance, the Lunar Exalted are often seen as monstrous and dangerous; this is in part owing to their abilities to take the shapes of animals and monsters and other humans by killing them, but also due to the concerted efforts of Terrestrial propaganda.

==== Solar Exalted (Chosen of the Unconquered Sun, Lawgivers) ====
The default protagonists of ''Exalted'' and the champions of the chief of the gods, a being known as the '''[[Sol Invictus|Unconquered Sun]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=John|author2=Alan Alexander|author3=Rebecca Borgstrom|author4=Carl Bowen|author5=Zach Bush|author6=Joseph Carricker|author7=Genevieve Cogman|author8=Dawn Elliot|author9=Michael Goodwin|author10=Conrad Hubbard|author11=Peter Schaefer|author12=John Snead|author13=Andrew Watt|author14=William Wulf|editor=Carl Bowen|title=Exalted |edition =2nd|year=2006|publisher=White Wolf Publishing|isbn=1-58846-684-1|pages=23–32|chapter=Chapter One: Setting}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five [[Caste#Definitions|castes]] of Solar Exalted: '''Dawn''' (the warriors and generals), '''Zenith''' (the priest-kings of the Unconquered Sun), '''Twilight''' (the scholars and sorcerers), '''Night''' (the spies and assassins) and '''Eclipse''' (the ambassadors, diplomats, and negotiators).

Considered to be Anathema by much of the mortal world of the Second Age, the Solars are regarded as monstrous demons and few remember their former greatness. This is due to a prolonged and widespread campaign of propaganda orchestrated by the Terrestrials, via a now firmly established religion known as the Immaculate Order.

The nature of Solar charms tends to express itself instead through human excellence taken to superhuman extremes, and as such their raw prowess in most skills easily exceeds any of the others. Their three greatest advantages are their large [[#Essence|Essence]] pools that give them more raw power to work with, their powerful, efficient, straightforward charms, and their ability to use the highest of all forms of sorcery, the Adamant Circle &amp;ndash; also called the Solar Circle due to the Solars alone being able to access that circle of sorcery.  With the addition in the third edition of Evocations—powers derived from legendary artifacts—the Solars have attained another area in which they are the undisputed masters.

==== Abyssal Exalted (Chosen of the Void, Deathknights) ====
Loyal servants of the '''Deathlords''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dansky|first=Richard E. |author2=Michael Kessler |author3=Michael Goodwin |author4=Bryan Armor |author5=Jim Kiley |author6=Ellen P. Kiley |author7=Dawn Elliot |author8=Scott Taylor|editor=Carl Bowen|title=Exalted: The Abyssals|year=2003|publisher=White Wolf Publishing|isbn=978-1-58846-665-5|pages=107–117|chapter=Chapter Two: Deathlords and Abyssals}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Abyssal castes are a dark reflection of their Solar counterparts; '''Dusk''' (soldiers, generals, and martial champions), '''Midnight''' (priests and leaders), '''Daybreak''' (scholars and artisans), '''Day''' (assassins and spies), and '''Moonshadow''' (bureaucrats, diplomats, and couriers).

In the present of Exalted, the Neverborn sow their revenge from beyond the grave through their Deathlord servants.  The source materials, primarily the second-edition sourcebook ''The Manual of Exalted Power: Abyssals'', present the Deathlords as the largely insane ghosts of First Age Solars slaughtered in the Usurpation, who are easily among the most powerful beings in the Underworld of Exalted. The Deathlords have varied goals, but most strive not to conquer or corrupt Creation, save as a path to the Neverborn's desire: the complete destruction of existence.

The named agents of the Deathlords in the world of the living are the Abyssal Exalted, also known as Deathknights; these antagonists are dark reflections of the Solar Exalted and are presented as being their equal in power. They were created by the Deathlords through powerful sorcery taught them by the Neverborn, using Solar Exaltations stolen from the Jade Prison. Willing Solar Exalted can also be converted to Abyssal Exalted with powerful magic.  They field vast undead armies, bolstered by ancient knowledge long since lost in the world of the living but still readily available in the lingering dead, and a powerful form of magic known as necromancy. Several sourcebooks present the Abyssals and the Deathlords as having a tentative foothold in Creation, likely representing a grave threat.

==== Lunar Exalted (Chosen of Luna, Stewards) ====
Presented as the most anarchistic and chaotic of the Exalted. In the sourcebooks, they are often referred to as cunning shapeshifters, skilled fighters, and capable generals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Alan |author2=Genevieve Cogman |author3=Conrad Hubbard |author4=Peter Schaefer|editor=Scribendi.com|title=The Manual of Exalted Power: Lunars|year=2007|publisher=White Wolf Publishing|isbn=978-1-58846-694-5|pages=20–56|chapter=Chapter One: The Silver Pact}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Within the game's history, they were very tightly bound to the First Age Solars.  While many stood and died beside their Solar friends and spouses in the Usurpation, those that were not killed along with their companions fled to the edges of Creation.

At the borders of the order of Creation and the chaotic turbulence of the '''Wyld''', their natures were changed over a great many years. Lunars follow at best a loose tribal hierarchy and ritually tattoo each other to protect themselves from the warping effects of the Wyld. This further serves to mark them as different from the rest of humanity; the tattoos are made of moonsilver and are often visible over much of the Lunar's body. 

Second edition materials detailed the Lunar Exalted's subversive influence on Creation's societies and revealed the Thousand Streams River Project, a complicated system of social engineering designed to create self-sufficient human societies that do not require Exalted leadership to function. Several major societies within the game were declared the results of centuries of subtle, behind-the-scenes guidance, with varying degrees of success.

==== Sidereal Exalted (Chosen of the Five Maidens, Viziers) ====
These Celestial Exalted are the least numerous of all the Exalted types (with the exception of the newly created Infernals), yet are described as major players in the fate of Creation. Sidereals, in addition to their mastery of martial arts, evidenced by their access to the highest forms of martial-arts magical abilities (known as Sidereal martial arts), excel at foreseeing and manipulating fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Alan|author2=Carl Bowen|author3=Joseph Carriker|author4=Conrad Hubbard|author5=Peter Schaefer|author6=Stephen Lea Sheppard|author7=Dean Shomshak|editor=Scribendi.com|title=The Manual of Exalted Power: Sidereals|year=2007|publisher=White Wolf Publishing|isbn=978-1-58846-697-6|pages=19–43|chapter=Chapter One: The Five-Score Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Exalted universe, they are often presented as celestial bureaucrats who often work in the '''Bureau of Fate''' of the Celestial City of Yu-Shan, the home of the gods, directing events in the mortal world from behind the scenes.

They were the viziers, prophets and cunning advisers of the First Age. Toward the end of the First Age, a prophecy came to them that warned that without action, Creation would fall to darkness.  Seeking to save the world, the Sidereals looked into the future and saw two options: attempt to reform of their maddening kings, or destroy the Solar Exalted and raise up the Dragon-blooded in their place. The Sidereals, possibly under the effects of the Great Curse laid upon them by the Neverborn, elected the path that offered a guaranteed future for Creation. As such, they orchestrated the end of the First Age, known as the Great Usurpation. 

Sidereals slip from the minds of those who meet them, mortal and Exalt alike, which can be beneficial to Sidereal characters or harmful, depending on their intended goals as player characters and non-player characters. Some unpredicted events prior to the "present" setting of Exalted, such as the Great Contagion, have jarred their faith in their precognitive abilities. Meanwhile, the loss of the Scarlet Empress, their secret ally at the top of the Scarlet Dynasty, has greatly weakened their influence.

In the present, a growing rift between the Bronze Faction (which supports the Dragon-Blooded hegemony) and the Gold Faction (which backs the newly-returned Solars) renders the Sidereal Exalted uncertain of their future.

==== Terrestrial Exalted (Chosen of the Elemental Dragons, Dragon-Blooded) ====
There are five elemental aspects to the Dragon-Blooded: Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Alan |author2=Kraig Blackwelder |author3=Peter Schaefer |author4=Scott Taylor|editor=Carl Bowen|title=The Manual of Exalted Power: Dragon-Blooded|year=2006|publisher=White Wolf Publishing|isbn=978-1-58846-688-4|pages=18–87|chapter=Chapter One: The Scarlet Dynasty &amp; Chapter Two: The Outcaste}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the history of Exalted, they were the elite infantry and servants to the rest of the Exalted in the First Age. They are less powerful than other types of Exalted, but most of their strength lies in their inheritance &amp;ndash; rather than being chosen by a god, the Dragon-Blooded have the potential to share their Exaltation through their bloodline.  With their comparatively massive numbers, along with the help and guidance of the Sidereal Exalted, they were able to overthrow the Solar Exalted at the height of their power and end the First Age.

The most prevalent Dragon-Blooded in Creation make up the ruling class of the Realm, currently the most powerful empire in Creation. The state-sanctioned faith known as the Immaculate Order paints the Solar and Lunar Exalted as dangerous Anathema who will bring ruin to the world if allowed to exist. Because of this, the Realm organizes the Wyld Hunt, which actively seeks out dangers to the Realm (such "Anathema" include many other types of Exalted, rogue gods, and the Fair Folk) and destroys them. This practice had effectively kept the Solars from rising to power again since the end of the First Age, but has faltered with the recent disappearance of the Scarlet Empress; the power struggle to fill the resulting vacuum has destabilized the Realm and allowed the Solar Exalted to escape the purges of the Wyld Hunt and rise in Creation once more.

The ruling Dragon-Blooded of the Realm are made up of the eleven Great Houses. Most houses were founded by and named after one of the Scarlet Empress's Exalted offspring, though at least two are descended from the Empress' late husbands and consorts, and three unspecified houses are descended from adopted children of the Empress. The prominent Dragon-Blooded families of the rival city-state of Lookshy, across the Inner Sea, are known as Gentes.

==== Alchemical Exalted (Chosen of Autochthon, Champions, Colossi, Patropoli/Metropoli) ====
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Blackwelder| first=Kraig |author2=Michael A.

The Champions are infused with the souls of dead Autochthonian heroes, and they serve as protectors of the inhabitants of a parallel world made up of the body of Autochthon himself, and enforce the will of the '''Tripartite''', the theocratic government of this world. They divide themselves into castes according to which material was mainly used in their construction: there are five canon castes, one for each of the Five Magical Materials, as well as the optional Adamant caste. Instead of wielding Essence directly and using their Charms in a "magical" fashion like other Exalted do, the Alchemicals have Charms "installed" like peripheral parts. As Alchemical Exalted grow in power, they also increase in size, eventually physically joining with Autochthon and forming living, sapient cities. 
The Alchemicals are not subject to the Great Curse, as they did not fight in the Primordial War. In gameplay, in place of curse driven insanity, they have a Clarity track which measures their distance from humanity. Those Alchemicals who have been infected with Autochthon's illness have a Dissonance track in place of a Clarity track, with Dissonance measuring their madness, corruption, and drive to violate boundaries. A brief tour of the world of Autochthonia can be found on the game's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.white-wolf.com/index.php?line=news&amp;articleid=203 |title=Welcome to the Machine God - A Tour of the Very Different World of Exalted: The Autochthonians |accessdate=2008-01-06 |author=White-Wolf, Inc. |year=2005 |work= |publisher=White Wolf Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Infernal Exalted (Chosen of the Yozis, Akuma and the Green Sun Princes) ====
They currently have less published material covering their nature, back-story and abilities than other Exalts. There are two types of Infernal Exalted, the '''Akuma''' and the '''Green Sun Princes'''. 

Rules for Akuma were first introduced in the 1st edition '''Exalted Player's Guide''' (April 2004). Akuma are Exalted of another type who have given themselves over to the cause of the Yozis and have been remade according to their masters' desires. They retain access to their native charm set and gain the ability to learn and use their patron Yozi's Infernal charms.  

The Green Sun Princes are made with the fifty Essences of Solar Exalts which the Yozis took in payment from the Neverborn and altered to emulate themselves in exchange for teaching the Neverborn to corrupt Solar Essences to create the Abyssals. While the first edition hinted at their existence, they did not get official rules until 2nd edition's '''Manual of Exalted Power - The Infernals''' (April 2009). The Green Sun Princes were created by a cadre of five of the Yozis; Malfeas, She Who Lives In Her Name, Cecylene, Adorjan, and the Ebon Dragon. Each of these Yozis is responsible for the creation of one caste of Green Sun Princes and the charms associated with that caste, Malfeas created the '''Slayers''', Cecylene created the '''Malefactors''', She Who Lives in Her Name created the '''Defilers''', Adorjan created the '''Scourges''' and the Ebon Dragon created the '''Fiends'''. Green Sun Princes of any caste can learn the charms of all five castes, as well as the charms of any other Yozis who have opened up access to their charms to the Green Sun Princes; in the default setting, Kimbery is the only other Yozi who has done so. The Yozis have tasked the Green Sun Princes with transforming Creation into a mirror of Malfeas, which they believe will break their bonds and reverse their disfiguring imprisonment. They call this effort the Reclamation.

The Green Sun Princes are few in number; only 50 infernal essences are controlled by the Yozis, and they do not yet have the ability to corrupt further Solar Essences as the Deathlords can. On the other hand, the Infernals have the full resources of the demon realm at their disposal, along with numerous Yozi cults which already exist in creation. It is implied that despite currently revelling in their power, the vast majority of Infernal Exalted will grow disillusioned with the alien Yozis and their obvious insanity, and go rogue. The Infernals' Primordial power gives them the potential to grow into new Titans themselves, not bound by the same shortness of vision their current patrons possess.

==== Other Exalted ====
Three new types of playable Exalted have been announced for 3rd edition: The Liminals, the Getimians and the Exigents.

The Liminals "stand at the border between life and death, humanity and monstrosity".&lt;ref name="kickstarter.com"&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/200664283/deluxe-exalted-3rd-edition&lt;/ref&gt; They are created when someone attempts to bring another person back from death; resurrection is explicitly impossible in Exalted, but some will still try.  On occasion, this attempt draws the attention of some other power that raises the corpse to life again.  The new Liminal possesses the memories of the body that she wears, but does not possess the same soul, and thus does not have the same personality.  In their initial introduction at the end of Second Edition, it was mentioned that they possess an interest in severed limbs and body parts, but the full explanation for this has yet to be given. Like the Dragon-Blooded, they are divided among five aspects—Breath, Blood, Flesh, Marrow, and Soil—depending on the motives of the person who created them.

The Getimian Exalted are described as "drawn from stillborn destinies to serve as agents in one man’s war against Heaven".&lt;ref name="kickstarter.com"/&gt; The Getimian Exaltations predate their current use, but the rogue Sidereal Exalt Rakan Thulio has employed them.  The Getimians have their own will: one sample character works as a special consultant to Heaven rather than opposing it.  The Getimian Exalted have Essence split into two pools, but unlike the other Exalted types, their charms interact with their separate pools in different ways;  their personal pool is akin to Yin essence, while their peripheral pool is Yang.  Some of their charms can only be powered by one or the other, or cause different effects depending on which one is used.

The Exigents are described by 3rd edition developer Holden Shearer as follows:
{{quote|text=The Exigents are a scattered host of Chosen of many lesser divinities, from gods of mazes and masks to gods of field, hearth, and blazing volcano. Each is unique, born of desperate circumstances in which Creation needed a hero.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.white-wolf.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=1639237#post1639237&lt;/ref&gt;}}  A god may petition the Unconquered Sun for the power to Exalt their own champion.  If successful, then the God receives the Exigence, which they may use to create their own champion.  The process is taxing on a god, and can destroy it in the process.  Some Exigences have been sold or otherwise passed into the hands of gods who do not have the Unconquered Sun's approval, while others have been heavily modified from multiple sources; the writers have referred to the former as "black market" Exaltations, and the latter as "dirty bomb" Exaltations.

=== Other magical beings ===
Alongside the various types of Exalts found in Creation, there are also other magical creatures that use the same Essence that Exalts use to power their magical effects. The following are the most prominent types of magical beings.

; Behemoths
: Behemoths are unique, immortal monsters. There are two broad categories of behemoths: ''Primordial Behemoths'', created by the Primordials in the Time of Glory before the Primordial War. Some, now known as Hekatonkheires, were killed during that war and now serve the Neverborn in the Underworld. ''Wyld Behemoths'' appear as monsters under the control of Fair Folk, but they are not truly separate beings from their masters, and are merely the aggressive tendencies of powerful Fair Folk come to life. 

; Dragon Kings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bolack| first=David|author2=Michael Goodwin|author3=John Snead|author4=Scott Taylor|author5=Eric Toth|author6=W. Van Meter| editor=John Chambers| title=Exalted Player's Guide |year=2004| publisher=White Wolf Publishing| isbn=1-58846-673-6| pages=154–195| chapter=Chapter Four: The Dragon Kings}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: The Dragon Kings are not Exalted; they are supernatural creatures offered as a player character type. The Dragon Kings are dinosaur-like beings of great power. Dragon Kings are sworn in allegiance to their creator, the Unconquered Sun, and can remember their past lives with great clarity. Although they once ruled Creation, the majority of their perpetually-reincarnating souls were annihilated during the war against the Primordials. After the First Age ended in war and disease, what remained of their civilization collapsed. They still exist in the Second Age, though hidden in the farthest corners of Creation. Rules for playing Dragon Kings are presented in the ''Exalted Player's Guide'' in 1st edition and the ''Scroll of the Fallen Races'' in 2nd edition.

; Fair Folk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Borgstrom| first=R. Sean|author2=Eric Brennan|author3=Genevieve Cogman|author4=Michael Goodwin|author5=John Snead| editor=John Chambers| title=Exalted: The Fair Folk| year=2002| publisher=White Wolf Publishing| isbn=1-58846-678-7| pages=60–89| chapter=Chapter Two: The Raksha}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Like the Dragon Kings, they are an alternative player character type to the Exalted. They know themselves by their own word, '''Raksha'''; however the superstitious in Creation, rightly fearing that to name them is to invoke them, call them the Fair Folk with the hope of flattering and placating them. In one sense, they are very similar to the Primordials: primeval beings whose existences precede and are not bound by the physical reality of Creation. They are natives of the Wyld, which they call '''Rakshastan''' &amp;ndash; the place that exists between Creation and the Unshaped Chaos. 

: The Fair Folks prey upon mortal souls and do a brisk slave trade with The Guild, a powerful economic organization in Creation. The Unshaped are the most powerful of their number, but lack the means to stabilize themselves by assimilating the personhood of mortals and as such are incapable of existing in Creation for any great duration. Rules for playing Fair Folk are presented in ''Exalted: The Fair Folk'' in 1st edition; 2nd edition rules are included in ''Graceful Wicked Masques: The Fair Folk.''

; God-Blooded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bolack| first=David|author2=Michael Goodwin|author3=John Snead|author4=Scott Taylor|author5=Eric Toth|author6=W. Van Meter| editor=John Chambers| title=Exalted Player's Guide| year=2004| publisher=White Wolf Publishing| isbn=1-58846-673-6| pages=44–93| chapter=Chapter Two: The God-Blooded}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Refers to, as a collective whole, offspring of a mortal or animal and a magical being, or the mortal offspring of two magical beings, in which case they take after the more powerful of the two. The resulting offspring bears traces of its mystical parentage. According to the authors, they stand somewhere between divinity and mortality: less than Exalted, but more than human. Those with awakened Essence can purchase the same types of Charms as their supernatural parent, though their power is limited by a low Permanent Essence trait and a small Essence pool.

: There are several subtypes of God-Blooded, mostly named for their supernatural parentage: God-Blooded are the children of gods and elementals, '''Demon-Blooded''' are the offspring of demons, '''Ghost-Blooded''' are the children of ghosts using powerful Charms to help them reproduce with mortals, and '''Half-Caste''' are the children of powerful Exalts (although exceedingly rare). The '''Fae-Blooded''' are the children of a union between the Raksha and mortals. The Mountain Folk can also produce God-Blooded offspring, but there is no specific term for them. Rules for playing God-Blooded characters are presented in the ''Exalted Player's Guide'' in 1st edition, and ''Scroll of Heroes'' in 2nd edition.

; Mountain Folk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Borgstrom| first=R. Sean|author2=Eric Brennan|author3=Genevieve Cogman|author4=Michael Goodwin|author5=John Snead| editor=John Chambers| title=Exalted: The Fair Folk| year=2002| publisher=White Wolf Publishing| isbn=1-58846-678-7| pages=60–89| chapter=Chapter Six: The Mountain Folk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Also known as the '''Jadeborn''',  creatures of the Great Maker, Autochthon: when Creation was initially formed by the Primordials, some among the Unshaped were incorporated into the substance of the created world. Sensing that these other, native intelligences of Chaos had been snuffed out in the Creation of inanimate elements, Autochthon took pity on them.  Salvaging whatever it could discern of their prior selves, Autochthon resurrected them &amp;ndash; still formed of the earthen materials they had calcified into, but ''alive'', and with at least a glimmering memory of the intelligent entities they had once been.

: The Mountain Folk, like many of the Exalted, are divided into Castes: Artisans, Warriors, and Workers. The vast majority of the Mountain Folk are Unenlightened &amp;ndash; limited in intelligence, creativity, and supernatural power. A small minority of Workers and Warriors--as well as the entire Artisan Caste--are Enlightened, with much greater creativity as well as both mundane and supernatural potential. Mountain Folk society is ruled by the Artisan Caste, who make up the nobility, with Unenlightened Warriors and Workers making up the commoners and Enlightened Warriors and Workers occupying an intermediate position. Rules for playing the Mountain Folk are presented in 1st edition's ''Exalted: The Fair Folk'' and 2nd edition's ''Scroll of the Fallen Races''.

; Spirits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Borgstrom| first=R. Sean|author2=Michael Kessler|author3=John Snead| editor=John Chambers| title=Games of Divinity| year=2002| publisher=White Wolf Publishing| isbn=1-58846-659-0| pages=1–127| chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Brennan| first1=Eric|author2=Deirdre Brooks|author3=Conrad Hubbard|author4=Lydia Laurenson|author5=Dustin Shampel|author6=Stephen Lea Sheppard| editor=Scribendi.com| title=The Books of Sorcery, Vol. IV: The Roll of Glorious Divinity I - Gods &amp; Elementals| year=2007| publisher=White Wolf Publishing| isbn=978-1-58846-698-3| pages=1–176| chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Spirits are divided into four broad categories: demons, elementals, ghosts, and gods. With the exception of elementals, spirits are naturally immaterial, generally require Charms to materialize in Creation, and will reform when killed unless some supernatural effect prevents them from doing so. Rules for playing ghosts in 1st edition are presented in ''Exalted: The Abyssals'', and rules for 2nd edition are presented in ''The Books of Sorcery, Vol. V: The Roll of Glorious Divinity II: Ghosts &amp; Demons''. Rules for playing elementals and gods are presented in ''The Books of Sorcery, Vol. IV: The Roll of Glorious Divinity I: Gods &amp; Elementals''.

:;Demons, Yozis, Primordials and Devas
::The Yozis are exiled, imprisoned and twisted Primordials, each primordial can have one or more bodies, known as Jouten. For each Yozi, there are at least a dozen Third Circle demons including the Fetich; each third circle demon rivals the most powerful gods and elementals in power and embodies and defines an aspect of the Yozi, which will change if the demon is permanently slain. More dramatic changes, including a new name and identity, result from the death of a Fetich. Each Third Circle Demon expresses itself through seven Second Circle demons, who exist both as individuals and aspects of a greater demon's power and personality.  First Circle demons are actively created, rather than aspects of other beings, and are generally divided into various demonic species rather than being fashioned as individuals. 
Due to the terms of the Yozis' surrender, all demons can be summoned and bound.

::Devas are the spiritual entities spawned from Primordials; while this includes the Yozis, it also extends to unbound Primordials such as Gaia and Autochthon.  Each primordial's devas has a specific name. Gaia's devas are known as kami, and the Five Elemental Dragons were described as such in the first two editions. Autochthon's devas are known as exmachina.  Unlike true demons, these beings cannot be summoned through sorcery. The terms Deva, Exmachina and Kami were established in Voice of the Magnus, published online in the Ink Monkeys blog.

:; Elementals
:: Elementals maintain Creation, and with a few exceptions, embody one of the five elements: air, earth, fire, water or wood. Elementals are naturally material, requiring charms to dematerialize, and with a few exceptions, cannot reform when slain. Unlike other spirits, their growth is largely unrestricted. The most powerful elementals are the Lesser and Greater Elemental Dragons. Elementals are generally outranked by gods of similar power. While Sorcerers can summon and bind demons through sorcery, the Elementals conjured through a similar spell are brought into being whole-cloth, and frequently cease to exist at the end of their binding.

:: The elementals of Autochthonia embody one of the machine world's elements: crystal, metal, oil, lightning or steam, and cannot be summoned through sorcery.

:; Ghosts
:: The most common type of ghosts, referred to as ''ghosts'' or ''the dead'', are the ''[[Hun and po|hun]]'' or higher souls of mortals who have refused to pass into Lethe and reincarnation due to their attachment to their mortal lives. These ghosts are much weaker than Exalted, and they can only respire Essence in the Underworld and Shadowlands. ''Hungry ghosts'' generally come into existence due to betrayal, vengeance or a traumatic death. Initially, a hungry ghost includes both the higher soul and the ''[[Hun and po|po]]'', or lower soul, but the ''hun'' soon moves on, leaving the hungry ghost largely mindless. Unlike other ghosts, hungry ghosts are naturally material in Creation at night. ''Nephwracks'' are ghosts who have been corrupted by the Neverborn. Unlike uncorrupted ghosts, they are capable of using necromancy. The ''Deathlords'' are thirteen ghosts of powerful Solar Exalted who have been empowered by the Neverborn, and although they are not technically Exalted, they have access to Abyssal Charms. ''Spectres'', also known as ''plasmics'', are bizarre creatures spawned by the nightmares of the Neverborn. The category of ''Hekatonkhire'' includes the ghosts of demons, devas and Primordial behemoths, as well as the manifested nightmares of the Neverborn. The ''Neverborn'' are the ghosts of slain Primordials. Immensely powerful, they are difficult to rouse from their slumber, and their power seems largely constrained to the Labyrinth. Only mundane ghosts and Hekatonkhire can be summoned through necromancy, and only mundane ghosts can be summoned through sorcery.

:; Gods
:: Gods represent objects, locations and concepts, but they are separate from them. In order of least powerful and influential to most, there are least gods, minor gods, gods, major gods and Celestial Incarnae. Examples of least gods include gods of a single pebble, whereas major gods include gods of concepts such as wealth or war. Most gods are members of the Celestial Order, which is stratified into two divisions: the Celestial Court, composed of gods of concepts, and the Terrestrial Bureaucracy, made up of the gods of physical objects and locations.

:: The Celestial Court is ruled by the seven Celestial Incarnae, and is divided into the Bureaus of Destiny, Heaven, Humanity, Nature and Seasons, with the other four bureaus reporting to the Bureau of Heaven. The Terrestrial Bureaucracy is nominally ruled by the Five Elemental Dragons, and is divided into various spirit courts. Technically, all members of the Celestial Court outrank all members of the Terrestrial Bureaucracy. In practice, Terrestrial courts are largely independent.

:: Outside of the Celestial Order, there are also the machine spirits of Autochthonia, unemployed gods whose domains have been usurped or destroyed, rogue gods who have abandoned their duties, and forbidden gods who have been exiled due to madness, an abhorrent nature or because they sided with the Primordials. Gods can generally only significantly increase their power by getting promoted or expanding their purview.

=== Mortals and Beasts ===

; Crafted Races

: During the First Age, the Solar deliberative began a series of experiments on human volunteers with the aim of creating specialised subspecies of humanity. With the aid of magic and selective breeding they succeeded in creating several new mortal races with unique talents and abilities. In order to ensure complicity, these Crafted Races were given special mental conditioning to ensure absolute loyalty to the Solars and their Realm. Many of the crafted races were classified as blessed races and given special status and privileges, however some of the other crafted races, known informally as the slave races, had low status and limited rights. The Usurpation and the Great Contagion decimated their numbers and now they survive in small isolated pockets. The Crafted Folk that survived include the winged '''Airfolk''' in the North and the cannibalistic '''Dunefolk''' of the south. Rules for creating a Mortal or Exalted member of a Crafted Race are presented in the 2nd edition book, ''Scroll of Heroes''.

=== Essence ===
Essence is the mystical force which the Exalted and gods manipulate to gain their supernatural powers, as well as the energy that forms all things. Within the game, the mystical force "Essence" is always capitalized to distinguish from other uses of the word.

=== Five Magical Materials ===
The Five Magical Materials are used to forge artifacts and weapons. Each material is associated with a type of Exalted, as well as one of the castes of Alchemical Exalted, who are partially constructed from that material. These materials are all easily enchanted, and each one resonates with a particular type of Exalted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Grabowski|first1=Geoff C.| author2=Bryan Armor|author3=Andrew Bates|author4=Kraig Blackwelder|author5=Dana Habecker|author6=Robert Hatch|author7=Sheri M.

It also gives the Exalt access to the powers of any hearthstone mounted on the item.

; '''Jade''' : is the most common material, and is associated with the most common, least powerful of the Exalted, the Terrestrial Exalted. There are six five colors of Jade of which correspond to one of the Elemental Dragons. Blue jade resonates with Air, white with Earth, black with Water, green with Wood, and red with Fire. 

; '''Starmetal''' : is the rarest of the magical materials, forged from meteors, the husks of godlings executed Yu-Shan, the Heavenly City. Like its wielders, the Sidereal Exalted, Starmetal re-weaves fate and involves itself with divine functions.

; '''Moonsilver''' : is considered by the Lunar Exalted to be a gift from their patron, Luna. It must be harvested by moonlight, using no crafted tools, forged at night and cooled only with water that has never seen the sun. Like the protean Lunars, Moonsilver can shift into new forms easily.

; '''Soulsteel''' : is made from human souls and the substance of the Labyrinth of the Underworld. It is jet black, and agonized faces of the souls it contains can be seen moving and screaming in the metal. Unsurprisingly, this material is used almost exclusively by the Abyssal Exalted. Soulsteel weapons draw upon the forces of death and the underworld.

; '''Orichalcum''' : is used primarily by the Solar Exalted. [[Orichalcum]] is rarely found in pure deposits; usually, it is created out of gold that has been heated by lava and sunlight reflected from mirrors of occult design. 

First Edition Exalted hints at a sixth magical material, but it is not presented in full until the Second Edition release of Dreams of the First Age.

; '''Adamant''' : a super-solid crystal that is refined down to the sharpest substance known.  It is largely present within the body of the Primordial Autochthon, but was also known in Creation during the First Age.  This material is used primarily by the Alchemical Exalted, though the Exalted of the First Age occasionally made items out of the material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The '''exhaustion of intellectual property rights''' constitutes one of the limits of [[intellectual property]] (IP) rights. Once a given product has been sold under the authorization of the IP owner, the reselling, rental, lending and other third party commercial uses of IP-protected goods in domestic and international markets is governed by the principle.&lt;ref name=wipo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/ip_business/export/international_exhaustion.htm|title=International Exhaustion and Parallel Importation|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a product covered by an IP right, such as by a [[patent]] right, has been sold by the IP right owner or by others with the consent of the owner, the IP right is said to be exhausted. It can no longer be exercised by the owner.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This limitation is also referred to as the '''exhaustion doctrine''' or '''first sale doctrine'''.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; For example, if an inventor obtains a patent on a new kind of umbrella, the inventor (or anyone else to whom he sells his patent) can legally prohibit other companies from making and selling this kind of umbrella, but can not prohibit customers who have bought this umbrella from the patent owner from reselling the umbrella to third parties. There is a "fairly broad consensus" throughout the world "that this applies at least within the context of the domestic market".&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "national exhaustion". However, "[t]here is less consensus as to what extent the sale of an IP protected product abroad can exhaust the IP rights over this product in the context of domestic law."&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "regional exhaustion" or "international exhaustion". The rules and legal implications of the exhaustion largely differ depending on the country of importation, i.e. the national jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt;

The legal concept of international exhaustion is much more controversial, and is recognized in some countries but not in others. The importation, in a country that recognizes the concept of international exhaustion, of a product sold in a foreign country with the authorization of the IP right owner cannot be prevented by the IP right owner.&lt;ref&gt;The United States Supreme Court adopted the doctrine of international exhaustion in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' for US copyright law, and in that decision explained the general rationale for the doctrine under [[common law]] principles of property rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS), an international agreement administered by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), does not address the issue of exhaustion of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 TRIPS: "For the purposes of dispute settlement under this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 nothing in this Agreement shall be used to address the issue of the exhaustion of intellectual property rights."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses}}
In terms of [[nuclear explosion]]s and other large [[bomb]]s, the term "'''ground zero'''" (also known as "'''surface zero'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=5214|title=U.S. DoD Terminology: surface zero|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) describes the point on the Earth's surface closest to a detonation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nmbook/appendices/ap_B.htm Nuclear Matters: A Practical Guide, Appendix B] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201082850/http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nmbook/appendices/ap_B.htm |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of an explosion above the ground, ''ground zero'' refers to the point on the ground directly below the nuclear detonation and is sometimes called the '''hypocenter''' (from [[Greek Language|Greek]] ὑπο- "under-" and [[center (disambiguation)|center]]). 

Generally, the term "ground zero" is also used in relation to [[earthquake]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and other [[disaster]]s to mark the point of the most severe damage or destruction. The term is distinguished from the term '''zero point''' in that the latter can also be located in the air, underground, or underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=5818|title=U.S. DoD Terminology: zero point|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trinity, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki==
[[File:Hiroshima Damage Map.gif|right|thumb|In mapping the effects of an atomic bomb, such as on the city of [[Hiroshima]] here, concentric circles are drawn centered on the point below the detonation and numbered at radial distances of 1,000 feet (305 meters). This point below the detonation is called "Ground Zero".]]
The origins of the term "ground zero" began with the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] in [[Jornada del Muerto desert]] near [[Socorro, New Mexico]], and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in [[Japan]]. The [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Atomic attacks)|Strategic Bombing Survey]] of the atomic attacks, released in June 1946, used the term liberally, defining it as: "For convenience, the term 'ground zero' will be used to designate the point on the ground directly beneath the point of detonation, or 'air zero.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&amp;documentid=65&amp;documentdate=1946-06-19&amp;studycollectionid=abomb&amp;groupid= U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey: The Effects of the Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]. June 19, 1946. President's Secretary's File, Truman Papers. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Laurence]], an [[embedded reporter]] with the [[Manhattan Project]], reported that "Zero" was "the code name given to the spot chosen for the [Trinity] test" in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Laurence]], ''Dawn over Zero'' (London: Museum Press, 1947), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', citing the use of the term in a 1946 ''[[New York Times]]'' report on the destroyed city of [[Hiroshima]], defines ''ground zero'' as "that part of the ground situated immediately under an exploding bomb, especially an atomic one."
The term was military slang, used at the Trinity site where the weapon tower for the first [[nuclear weapon]] was at "point zero", and moved into general use very shortly after the end of [[World War II]]. At Hiroshima, the hypocenter of the attack was [[Shima Hospital]], approximately {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} away from the intended aiming point at [[Aioi Bridge]].

==The Pentagon==
[[File:PentagonHotDogStand.jpg|thumb|left|The former hot dog stand nicknamed Cafe Ground Zero&lt;ref name="Pentagon" /&gt; in the Pentagon's center courtyard.]]
During the [[Cold War]], [[The Pentagon]], the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], was an assured target in the event of [[nuclear war]]. The open space in the center of the Pentagon became known informally as ground zero. A snack bar that used to be located at the center of this open space was nicknamed "Cafe Ground Zero".&lt;ref name="Pentagon" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=1049|title=Pentagon Hot Dog Stand, Cold War Legend, to be Torn Down|quote ='It's rumored that a portion of their (Soviet) nuclear arsenal was directed at that building, the Pentagon hot dog stand,' tour guides tell visitors as they pass the stand. 'This is where the building earned the nickname Cafe Ground Zero, the deadliest hot dog stand in the world.'|date= September 20, 2006|publisher=United States Department of Defense |accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Trade Center==
[[File:Wtc-photo.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[World Trade Center site]] in September 2001.]]
During the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], two aircraft [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by 10 [[al-Qaeda]] [[Terrorism|terrorists]] flew into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, causing massive damage and starting fires that [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|caused the weakened 110-story skyscrapers to collapse]]. The destroyed [[World Trade Center site]] soon became known as "ground zero." Rescue workers also used the phrase "The Pile", referring to the pile of rubble that was left after the buildings collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamill | first= Denis|title=Rescue Workers Keep Up Quest for Signs of Life Ruin All Over, But Not One Unkind Word|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]|date=16 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:World Trade Center site 2004.jpg|thumb|right|The [[World Trade Center site]], as it appeared in October 2004.]]
Even after the site was cleaned up and construction on the new [[One World Trade Center]] and the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] were well under way, the term was still frequently used to refer to the site, as when opponents of the [[Park51]] project that was to be located two blocks away from the site labeled it the "[[Ground Zero mosque]]." 

In advance of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] urged that the "ground zero" moniker be retired, saying, "...the time has come to call those 16 acres what they are: The World Trade Center and the National September 11th Memorial and Museum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14827694 |title=Is it time to retire 'Ground zero'? |work=[[BBC]] |author=Geoghegan, Tom |date=2011-09-07 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52316">{{Lie groups |Homogeneous spaces}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' is a [[Hermitian manifold]] which at every point has as an inversion symmetry preserving the Hermitian structure. First studied by [[Élie Cartan]], they form a natural generalization of the notion of [[Riemannian symmetric space]] from [[real manifold]]s to [[complex manifold]]s.

Every Hermitian symmetric space is a homogeneous space for its isometry group and has a unique decomposition as a product of irreducible spaces and a Euclidean space. The irreducible spaces arise in pairs as a non-compact space that, as [[Armand Borel|Borel]] showed, can be embedded as an open subspace of its compact dual space. [[Harish Chandra]] showed that each non-compact space can be realized as a '''bounded symmetric domain''' in a complex vector space. The simplest case involves the groups SU(2), SU(1,1) and their common complexification SL(2,'''C'''). In this case the non-compact space is the [[unit disk]], a homogeneous space for SU(1,1). It is a bounded domain in the complex plane '''C'''. The one-point compactification of '''C''', the [[Riemann sphere]], is the dual space, a homogeneous space for SU(2) and SL(2,'''C''').

Irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are exactly the homogeneous spaces of simple compact Lie groups by maximal closed connected subgroups which contain a maximal torus and have center isomorphic to '''T'''.  There is a complete classification of irreducible spaces, with four classical series, studied by Cartan, and two exceptional cases; the classification can be deduced from
[[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]], which classifies closed connected subgroups containing a maximal torus. Hermitian symmetric spaces appear in the theory of [[Jordan triple system]]s, [[several complex variables]], [[complex geometry]], [[automorphic form]]s and [[group representation]]s, in particular permitting the construction of the [[holomorphic discrete series representation]]s of semisimple Lie groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knapp|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type==

===Definition===
Let ''H'' be a connected compact semisimple Lie group, σ an automorphism of ''H'' of order 2 and ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; the fixed point subgroup of σ.  Let ''K'' be a closed subgroup of ''H'' lying between ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; and its [[identity component]]. The compact homogeneous space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a [[symmetric space|symmetric space of compact type]]. The Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; admits a decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{m},}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the Lie algebra of ''K'', is the +1 eigenspace of σ and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; the –1 eigenspace.
If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; contains no simple summand of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, the pair (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) is called an [[orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra]] of ''compact type''.&lt;ref name="Wolf-2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, invariant under the [[adjoint representation]] and σ, induces a Riemannian structure on ''H'' / ''K'', with ''H'' acting by isometries. A canonical example is given by minus the [[Killing form]]. Under such an inner product, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal. ''H'' / ''K'' is then a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' if it has an [[almost complex structure]] preserving the Riemannian metric. This is equivalent to the existence of a linear map ''J'' with ''J''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −''I'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of ''K''.

===Symmetry and center of isotropy subgroup===
If (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;,σ) is Hermitian, ''K'' has non-trivial center and the symmetry σ is inner, implemented by an element of the center of ''K''.

In fact ''J'' lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and exp ''tJ'' forms a one-parameter group in the center of ''K''.  This follows because if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' lie in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;, then by the invariance of the inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{([[A,B],C],D)=([A,B],[C,D])=([[C,D],B],A).}&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing ''A'' and ''B'' by ''JA'' and ''JB'', it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{[JA,JB] = [A,B].}&lt;/math&gt;

Define a linear map δ on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; by extending ''J'' to be 0 on  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;. The last relation shows that δ is a derivation of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple, δ must be an inner derivation, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\delta(X)=[T + A,X],}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''T'' in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and ''A'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking ''X'' in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that ''A'' = 0 and ''T'' lies in the center of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and hence that ''K'' is non-semisimple. The symmetry σ is implemented by ''z'' = exp π''T'' and the almost complex structure by exp π/2 ''T''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The innerness of σ implies that ''K'' contains a maximal torus of ''H'', so has maximal rank. On the other hand, the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus ''S'' of elements exp ''tT'' is connected, since if ''x'' is any element in ''K'' there is a maximal torus containing ''x'' and ''S'',  which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand, it contains ''K'' since ''S'' is central in ''K'' and is contained in ''K'' since ''z'' lies in ''S''. So ''K'' is the centralizer of ''S'' and hence connected. In particular ''K'' contains the center of ''H''.&lt;ref name="Wolf-2010" /&gt;

===Irreducible decomposition===
The symmetric space or the pair (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) is said to be ''irreducible'' if the adjoint action of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently the identity component of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; or  ''K'') is irreducible on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This is equivalent to the maximality of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; as a subalgebra.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact there is a one-one correspondence between intermediate subalgebras &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{l}&lt;/math&gt; and ''K''-invariant subspaces 
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{l}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus \mathfrak{m}_1,\,\,\,\ \mathfrak{m}_1=\mathfrak{l}\cap \mathfrak{m}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Any orthogonal symmetric algebra  (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) of Hermitian type can be decomposed as an (orthogonal) direct sum of irreducible orthogonal symmetric algebras of Hermitian type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=378–379}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a direct sum of simple algebras

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{h}=\oplus_{i=1}^N \mathfrak{h}_i,}&lt;/math&gt;

each of which is left invariant by the automorphism σ and the complex structure ''J'', since they are both inner. The eigenspace decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}_1&lt;/math&gt; coincides with its intersections with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. So the restriction of σ to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}_1&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible.

This decomposition of the orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra yields a direct product decomposition of the corresponding compact symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' when ''H'' is simply connected. In this case the fixed point subgroup ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; is automatically connected. For simply connected ''H'', the symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is the direct product of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; simply connected and simple. In the irreducible case, ''K'' is a maximal connected subgroup of ''H''. Since ''K'' acts irreducibly on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; (regarded as a complex space for the complex structure defined by ''J''), the center of ''K'' is a one-dimensional torus '''T''', given by the operators exp ''tT''. Since each ''H'' is simply connected and ''K'' connected, the quotient ''H''/''K'' is simply connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex structure===
{{Main article|Complex structures on homogeneous spaces}}
if ''H'' / ''K'' is irreducible with ''K'' non-semisimple, the compact group ''H'' must be simple and ''K'' of maximal rank. From [[Borel-de Siebenthal theory]], the involution σ is inner and ''K'' is the centralizer of its center, which is isomorphic to '''T'''. In particular ''K'' is connected. It follows that ''H'' / ''K'' is simply connected and there is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] ''G'' of ''H'' such that ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P''. In particular there is a complex structure on ''H'' / ''K'' and the action of ''H'' is holomorphic. Since any Hermitian symmetric space is a product of irreducible spaces, the same is true in general.

At the [[Lie algebra]] level, there is a symmetric decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h = \mathfrak k\oplus\mathfrak m,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak m,J)&lt;/math&gt; is a real vector space with a complex structure ''J'', whose complex dimension is given in the table. Correspondingly, there is a [[graded Lie algebra]] decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g = \mathfrak{m}_{+}\oplus\mathfrak l\oplus\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m\otimes\mathbb C= \mathfrak m_{-}\oplus\mathfrak m_{+}&lt;/math&gt; is the decomposition into +''i'' and &amp;minus;''i'' eigenspaces of ''J'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak l=\mathfrak k\otimes\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;. The Lie algebra of ''P'' is the semidirect product &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m^{+}\oplus\mathfrak l&lt;/math&gt;. The complex Lie algebras  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; are Abelian. Indeed, if ''U'' and ''V'' lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt;, [''U'',''V''] = ''J''[''U'',''V''] = [''JU'',''JV''] = [±''iU'',±''iV''] = –[''U'',''V''], so the Lie bracket must vanish.

The complex subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt; are irreducible for the action of ''K'', since ''J'' commutes with ''K'' so that each is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; with complex structure ±''J''.  Equivalently the centre '''T''' of ''K'' acts on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; by the identity representation and on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt; by its conjugate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The realization of ''H''/''K'' as a generalized flag variety ''G''/''P'' is obtained by taking ''G'' as in the table (the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H'') and ''P'' to be the [[parabolic subgroup]] equal to the semidirect product of ''L'', the complexification of ''K'', with the complex Abelian subgroup exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt;. (In the language of [[algebraic groups]],  ''L'' is the [[Levi factor]] of ''P''.)

===Classification===
Any Hermitian symmetric space of compact type is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; simple, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; connected of maximal rank with center '''T'''. The irreducible ones are therefore exactly the non-semisimple cases classified by [[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]].&lt;ref name="Wolf-2010" /&gt;
 
Accordingly, the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' are classified as follows.

In terms of the classification of compact Riemannian symmetric spaces, the Hermitian symmetric spaces are the four infinite series AIII, DIII, CI and BDI with ''p'' = 2 or ''q'' = 2, and two exceptional spaces, namely EIII and EVII.

===Classical examples===
The irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type are all simply connected. The corresponding symmetry σ of the simply connected simple compact Lie group is inner, given by conjugation by the unique element ''S'' in ''Z''(''K'') / ''Z''(''H'') of period 2. For the classical groups, as in the table above, these symmetries are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=444–447,451–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*AIII: &lt;math&gt;S=\begin{pmatrix}-\alpha I_p &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \alpha I_q\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in S(U(''p'')×U(''q'')), where α&lt;sup&gt;''p''+''q''&lt;/sup&gt;=(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.
*DIII: ''S'' = ''iI'' in U(''n'') ⊂ SO(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;J_n=\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp;I_n \\ -I_n &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
*CI: ''S''=''iI'' in U(''n'') ⊂ Sp(''n'') = Sp(''n'','''C''') ∩ U(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
*BDI: &lt;math&gt;S=\begin{pmatrix}I_p &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -I_2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in SO(''p'')×SO(2).

The maximal parabolic subgroup ''P'' can be described explicitly in these classical cases. For AIII

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{P(p,q)= \begin{pmatrix}A_{pp} &amp; B_{pq}\\ 0 &amp; D_{qq}\end{pmatrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

in SL(''p''+''q'','''C'''). ''P''(''p'',''q'') is the stabilizer of a subspace of dimension ''p'' in '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''p''+''q''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The other groups arise as fixed points of involutions. Let ''J'' be the ''n'' × ''n'' matrix with 1's on the antidiagonal and 0's elsewhere and set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; J\\ -J &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Then Sp(''n'','''C''') is the fixed point subgroup of the involution θ(''g'') = ''A'' (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of SL(2''n'','''C'''). SO(''n'','''C''') can be realised as the fixed points of ψ(''g'') = ''B'' (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in SL(''n'','''C''') where ''B'' = ''J''. These involutions leave invariant ''P''(''n'',''n'') in the cases DIII and CI and ''P''(''p'',2) in the case BDI. The corresponding parabolic subgroups ''P'' are obtained by taking the fixed points. The compact group ''H'' acts transitively on ''G'' / ''P'', so that ''G'' / ''P'' = ''H'' / ''K''.

==Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type==

===Definition===
As with symmetric spaces in general, each compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' has a noncompact dual ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/''K'' obtained by replacing ''H'' with the closed real Lie subgroup ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of the complex Lie group ''G'' with Lie algebra
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h^* = \mathfrak k \oplus i\mathfrak m\subset\mathfrak g.&lt;/math&gt;

===Borel embedding===
Whereas the natural map from ''H''/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is an isomorphism, the natural map from ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is only an inclusion onto an open subset. This inclusion is called the '''Borel embedding''' after [[Armand Borel]]. In fact ''P'' ∩ ''H'' = ''K'' = ''P'' ∩ ''H''*. The images of ''H'' and ''H''* have the same dimension so are open. Since the image of ''H'' is compact, so closed, it follows that ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Borel|1952}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartan decomposition===
The polar decomposition in the complex linear group ''G'' implies the Cartan decomposition ''H''* = ''K'' ⋅ exp &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; in ''H''*.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, given a maximal Abelian subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; in t, ''A'' = exp  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is a toral subgroup such that σ(''a'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; on ''A''; and any two such &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;'s are conjugate by an element of ''K''. A similar statement holds for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}^*=i\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. Morevoer if ''A''* = exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}^*&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H^*=KA^*K.}&lt;/math&gt;

These results are special cases of the Cartan decomposition in any Riemannian symmetric space and its dual. The geodesics emanating from the origin in the homogeneous spaces can be identified with one parameter groups with generators in  &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Similar results hold for in the compact case: ''H''= ''K'' ⋅ exp &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and ''H'' = ''KAK''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb||Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The properties of the [[totally geodesic]] subspace ''A'' can be shown directly.  ''A'' is closed because the closure of ''A'' is a toral subgroup satisfying σ(''a'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, so its Lie algebra lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and hence equals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; by maximality. ''A'' can be generated topologically by a single element exp ''X'', so  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the centralizer of ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. In the ''K''-orbit of any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; there is an element ''Y'' such that (X,Ad ''k'' Y) is minimized at ''k'' = 1. Setting ''k'' = exp ''tT'' with ''T'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that (''X'',[''T'',''Y'']) = 0 and hence [''X'',''Y''] = 0, so that ''Y'' must lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of the conjugates of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular some conjugate of ''X'' lies in any other choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, which centralizes that conjugate; so by maximality the only possibilities are conjugates of  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb||Helgason|1978|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decompositions

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H=KAK,\,\,\,H = K\cdot \exp \mathfrak{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

can be proved directly by applying the [[slice theorem (differential geometry)|slice theorem]] for [[transformation group|compact transformation groups]] to the action of ''K'' on ''H'' / ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=35–36}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1982|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the space ''H'' / ''K'' can be identified with

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M=\{ \sigma(g)g^{-1}:g\in H\},}&lt;/math&gt;

a closed submanifold of ''H'', and the Cartan decomposition follows by showing that ''M'' is the union of the ''kAk''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for ''k'' in ''K''. Since this union is the continuous image of ''K'' × ''A'', it is compact and connected. So it suffices to show that the union is open in ''M'' and for this it is enough to show each ''a'' in ''A'' has an open neighbourhood in this union. Now by computing derivatives at 0, the union contains an open neighbourhood of 1. If ''a'' is central the union is invariant under multiplication by ''a'', so contains an open neighbourhood of ''a''. If ''a'' is not central, write ''a'' = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''b'' in ''A''. Then τ = Ad ''b'' −  Ad ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is a skew-adjoint operator on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; anticommuting with σ, which can be regarded as a '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading operator σ on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. By an [[Euler–Poincaré characteristic]] argument it follows that the superdimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the superdimension of the kernel of τ. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{k} - \mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{k}_a = \mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{m} - \mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{m}_a,}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_a&lt;/math&gt; are the subspaces fixed by Ad ''a''. Let the orthogonal complement of  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a^\perp&lt;/math&gt;. Computing derivstives it follows that Ad ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; (''a'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''X'' lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a^\perp&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_a&lt;/math&gt;, is an open neighbourhood of ''a'' in the union. Here the terms ''a'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt; lie in the union by the argument for central ''a'': indeed ''a'' is in the center of the identity component of the centralizer of ''a'' which is invariant under σ and contains ''A''.

The dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''rank''' of the Hermitian symmetric space.

===Strongly orthogonal roots===
In the case of Hermitian symmetric spaces, Harish-Chandra gave a canonical choice for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. 
This choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by taking a maximal torus ''T'' of ''H'' in ''K'' with Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the symmetry σ is implemented by an element of ''T'' lying in the centre of ''H'', the root spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; are left invariant by σ. It acts as the identity on those contained in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt; and minus the identity on those in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The roots with root spaces in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt; 
are called '''compact roots''' and those with root spaces in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''noncompact roots'''. (This terminology originates from the symmetric space of noncompact type.)   If ''H'' is simple, the generator ''Z'' of the centre of ''K'' can be used to define a set of positive roots, according to the sign of α(''Z''). With this choice of roots  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt; are the direct sum of the root spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; over positive and negative noncompact roots α. Root vectors ''E''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; can be chosen so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{X_\alpha=E_\alpha + E_{-\alpha}, \,\,\, Y_\alpha=i(E_\alpha - E_{-\alpha})}&lt;/math&gt;

lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. The simple roots α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the indecomposable positive roots. These can be numbered so that  α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; vanishes on the center of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; for ''i'', whereas α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not. Thus α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the unique noncompact simple root and the other simple roots are compact. Any positive noncompact root then has the form β = α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ⋅⋅⋅ +  ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with non-negative coefficients ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. These corfficients lead to a [[lexicographic order]] on positive roots. The coefficient of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is always one because &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible for ''K'' so is spanned by vectors obtained by successively applying the lowering operators ''E''&lt;sub&gt;–α&lt;/sub&gt; for simple compact roots α.

Two roots α and β are said to be '''strongly orthogonal''' if  ±α ±β are not roots or zero, written  α ≐ β. The highest positive root ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is noncompact. Take ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (for the lexicographic order). Then continue in this way taking ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; until the process terminates. The corresponding vectors

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{X_i= E_{\psi_i} + E_{-\psi_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and commute by strong orthogonality. Their span &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is Harish-Chandra's canonical maximal Abelian subalgebra.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=375–387}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; (As Sugiura later showed, having fixed ''T'', the set of strongly orthogonal roots is uniquely determined up to applying an element in the Weyl group of ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agaoka|Kaneda|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Maximality can be checked by showing that if

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{[\sum c_\alpha E_\alpha + \overline{c_\alpha}E_{-\alpha}, E_{\psi_i} + E_{-\psi_i}]=0}&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''i'', then ''c''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for all positive noncompact roots α  different from the ψ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;'s. This follows by showing inductively that if ''c''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0, then α is strongly orthogonal to ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... a contradiction. Indeed, the above relation shows ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; + α cannot be a root; and that if ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; – α is a root, then it would necessarily have the form β – ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. If ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; – α were negative, then α would be a higher positive root than  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, strongly orthogonal to the ψ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''j'' &lt; ''i'', which is not possible; similarly if  β – ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; were positive.

===Polysphere and polydisk theorem===
Harish-Chandra's canonical choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; leads to a polydisk and polysphere theorem in ''H''*/''K'' and ''H''/''K''. This result reduces the geometry to products of the prototypic example  involving SL(2,'''C'''), SU(1,1) and SU(2), namely the unit disk inside the Riemann sphere.

In the case of ''H'' = SU(2) the symmetry σ is given by conjugation by the diagonal matrix with entries ±''i'' so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sigma\begin{pmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta\\ -\overline{\beta} &amp; \overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} \alpha &amp; -\beta\\ \overline{\beta} &amp; \overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

The fixed point subgroup is the maximal torus ''T'', the diagonal matrices with entries ''e''&lt;sup&gt; ±''it''&lt;/sup&gt;. SU(2) acts on the Riemann sphere &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{CP}^1&lt;/math&gt; transitively by Möbius transformations and ''T'' is the stabilizer of 0. SL(2,'''C'''), the complexification of SU(2), also acts by Möbius transformations and the stabiliser of 0 is the subgroup ''B'' of lower triangular matrices. The noncompact subgroup SU(1,1) acts with precisely three orbits: the open unit disk |''z''| &lt; 1; the unit circle ''z'' = 1; and its exterior |''z''| &gt; 1. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{SU}(1,1)/\mathbf{T} = \{z: |z|&lt;1\} \,\,\, \subset \,\,\, B_+/\mathbf{T}_{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{C}\,\,\, \subset \,\,\,\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/B = \mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\},}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the subgroups of upper triangular and diagonal matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The middle term is the orbit of 0 under the upper unitriangular matrices

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; z\\ 0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix} =\exp \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; z\\ 0 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Now for each root ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; there is a homomorphism of π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of SU(2) into ''H'' which is compatible with the symmetries. It extends uniquely to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''') into ''G''. The images of the Lie algebras for different ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s since they are strongly orthogonal. Thus there is a homomorphism π of the direct product SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; into ''H'' compatible with the symmetries. It extends to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''')&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; into ''G''. The kernel of π is contained in the center (±1)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; of SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; which is fixed pointwise by the symmetry. So the image of the center under π lies in ''K''. Thus there is an embedding of the polysphere (SU(2)/T)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; into ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P'' and the polysphere contains the polydisk (SU(1,1)/T)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. The polysphere and polydisk are the direct product of ''r'' copies of the Riemann sphere and the unit disk. By the Cartan decompositions in SU(2) and SU(1,1), 
the polysphere is the orbit of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' in ''H'' / ''K'' and the polydisk is the orbit of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;''A''*, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = π('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;) ⊆ ''K''. On the other hand, ''H'' = ''KAK'' and ''H''* = ''K'' ''A''* ''K''.

Hence every element in the compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polysphere; and every element in the image  under the Borel embedding of the noncompact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''* / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polydisk.&lt;ref&gt;See:

&amp;{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harish-Chandra embedding===
''H''* / ''K'', the  Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type, lies in the image of &lt;math&gt;\exp \mathfrak m_+&lt;/math&gt;, a dense open subset of ''H'' / ''K'' biholomorphic to  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m_+&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding domain in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m_+&lt;/math&gt; is bounded. This is the '''Harish-Chandra embedding''' named after [[Harish-Chandra]]. 
 
In fact Harish-Chandra showed the following properties of the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}=\exp (\mathfrak{m}_+)\cdot K_{\mathbb{C}} \cdot \exp(\mathfrak{m}_-)=\exp (\mathfrak{m}_+)\cdot P&lt;/math&gt;:

# As a space, '''X''' is the direct product of the three factors.
# '''X''' is open in ''G''.
# '''X''' is dense in ''G''.
# '''X''' contains ''H''*.
# The closure of ''H''* / ''K'' in '''X''' / ''P'' = &lt;math&gt;\exp \mathfrak{m}_+ &lt;/math&gt; is compact.

In fact &lt;math&gt;M_\pm=\exp \mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; are complex Abelian groups normalised by ''K''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{m}_+,\mathfrak{m}_-] \subset \mathfrak{k}_{\mathfrak{C}}&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{m},\mathfrak{m}] \subset \mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

This implies ''P'' ∩ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = {1}. For if ''x'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; with ''X'' in 
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; lies in ''P'', it must normalize ''M''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;. But if ''Y'' lies in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{Y=\mathrm{Ad}(X)\cdot Y= Y + [X,Y] + {1\over 2} [X,[X,Y]]\in \mathfrak{m}_+ \oplus \mathfrak{k}_{\mathbb{C}} \oplus \mathfrak{m}_-,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that ''X'' commutes with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;. But if ''X'' commutes with every noncompact root space, it must be 0, so ''x'' = 1. It follows that the multiplication map μ on ''M''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; × ''P'' is injective so (1) follows. Similarly the derivative of μ at (''x'',''p'') is

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mu^\prime(X,Y)=\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})X + Y =\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})(X\oplus\mathrm{Ad}(p)Y),}&lt;/math&gt;

which is injective, so (2) follows. For the special case ''H'' = SU(2), ''H''* = SU(1,1) and ''G'' = SL(2,'''C''') the remaining assertions are consequences of the identification with the Riemann sphere, '''C''' and unit disk. They can be applied to the groups defined for each root ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. By the polysphere and polydisk theorem ''H''*/''K'', '''X'''/''P'' and ''H''/''K'' are the union of the ''K''-translates of the polydisk, '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; and the polysphere. So ''H''* lies in '''X''', the closure of ''H''*/''K'' is compact in '''X'''/''P'', which is in turn dense in ''H''/''K''.

Note that (2) and (3) are also consequences of the fact that the image of ''X'' in ''G''/''P'' is that of the big cell ''B''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;''B'' in the [[Complexification (Lie group)#Gauss decomposition|Gauss decomposition]] of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=382–396}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|p=281}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Using results on the [[restricted root system]] of the symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' and ''H''*/''K'', 
[[Robert Hermann (mathematician)|Hermann]] showed that the image of ''H''*/''K'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized unit disk. In fact it is the [[convex set]] of ''X'' for which the [[operator norm]] of ad Im ''X'' is less than one.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=284–286}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bounded symmetric domains===
A bounded domain ''&amp;Omega;'' in a complex vector space is said to be a '''bounded symmetric domain''' if for every ''x'' in ''&amp;Omega;'', there is an involutive biholomorphism ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''&amp;Omega;'' for which ''x'' is an isolated fixed point. The Harish-Chandra embedding exhibits every Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type ''H''* / ''K'' as a bounded symmetric domain. The biholomorphism group of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; / ''K'' is equal to its isometry group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

Conversely every bounded symmetric domain arises in this way. Indeed, given a bounded symmetric domain ''&amp;Omega;'', the [[Bergman kernel]] defines a [[Riemannian metric|metric]] on ''&amp;Omega;'', the [[Bergman metric]], for which every biholomorphism is an isometry. This realizes ''&amp;Omega;'' as a Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
The irreducible bounded symmetric domains are called '''Cartan domains''' and are classified as follows.

===Classical domains===
In the classical cases (I–IV), the noncompact group can be realized by 2 × 2 block matrices&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Borel|1952}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=321–331}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g=\begin{pmatrix} A &amp; B \\ C &amp; D\end{pmatrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

acting by generalized [[Möbius transformation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(Z)=(AZ+B)(CZ+D)^{-1}.}&lt;/math&gt;

The polydisk theorem takes the following concrete form in the classical cases:&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Siegel|1943|pp=14–15}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Type I'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''pq'''''&lt;/sub&gt; (''p'' ≤ ''q''): for every ''p'' × ''q'' matrix ''M'' there are unitary matrices such that ''UMV'' is diagonal. In fact this follows from the [[polar decomposition]] for ''p'' × ''p'' matrices.
* '''Type III'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''n'''''&lt;/sub&gt;: for every complex symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix ''U'' such that ''UMU''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is diagonal. This is proved by a classical argument of [[Carl Ludwig Siegel|Siegel]]. Take ''V'' unitary so that ''V''*''M''*''MV'' is diagonal. Then ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;''MV'' is symmetric and its real and imaginary parts commute. Since they are real symmetric matrices they can be simultaneously diagonalized by a real orthogonal matrix ''W''. So ''UMU''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is diagonal if ''U'' = ''WV''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* '''Type II'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''n'''''&lt;/sub&gt;: for every complex skew symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix such that ''UMU''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is made up of diagonal blocks &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; a\\ -a &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and one zero if ''n'' is odd. As in Siegel's artgument, this can be reduced to case where the real and imaginary parts of ''M'' commute. Any real skew-symmetric matrix can be reduced to the given [[Skew-symmetric matrix#Spectral theory|canonical form]] by an orthogonal matrix and this can be done simultaneously for commuting matrices.
* '''Type IV'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''n'''''&lt;/sub&gt;: by a transformation in SO(''n'') × SO(2) any vector can be transformed so that all but the first two coordinates are non-zero.

===Boundary components===
The noncompact group ''H''* acts on the complex Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P'' with only finitely many orbits. The orbit structure is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Wolf|1972}}. In particular the closure of the bounded domain ''H''*/''K'' has a unique closed orbit, which is the [[Shilov boundary]] of the domain. In general the orbits are unions of Hermitian symmetric spaces of lower dimension. The complex function theory of the domains, in particular the analogue of the [[Cauchy integral formula]]s, are described for the Cartan domains in {{harvtxt|Hua|1979}}. The closure of the bounded domain is the [[Baily–Borel compactification]] of ''H''*/''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borel|Ji|2006|pp=77–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundary structure can be described using [[Cayley transform]]s. For each copy of SU(2) defined by one of the noncompact roots ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a Cayley transform ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which as a Möbius transformation maps the unit disk onto the upper half plane. Given a subset ''I'' of indices of the strongly orthogonal family ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ψ&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''partial Cayley transform'' ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the product of the ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s with ''i'' in ''I'' in the product of the groups π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''G''(''I'') be the centralizer of this product in ''G'' and ''H''*(''I'') = ''H''* ∩ ''G''(''I''). Since σ leaves ''H''*(''I'') invariant, there is a corresponding Hermitian symmetric space ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''H''*(''I'')/''H''*(''I'')∩''K'' ⊂ ''H''*/''K'' = ''M'' . The boundary component for the subset ''I'' is the union of the ''K''-translates of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;. When ''I'' is the set of all indices, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a single point and the boundary component is the Shilov boundary. Moreover, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is in the closure of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''I'' ⊇ ''J''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric properties==
Every Hermitian symmetric space is a [[Kähler manifold]]. They can be defined equivalently as Riemannian symmetric spaces with a parallel complex structure with respect to which the Riemannian metric is [[Hermitian metric|Hermitian]]. The complex structure is automatically preserved by the isometry group ''H'' of the metric, and so any Hermitian symmetric space ''M'' is a homogeneous complex manifold. Some examples are [[complex vector space]]s and [[complex projective space]]s, with their usual Hermitian metrics and [[Fubini–Study metric]]s, and the complex [[unit ball]]s with suitable metrics so that they become [[Complete metric space|complete]] and Riemannian symmetric. The [[compact space|compact]] Hermitian symmetric spaces are [[projective variety|projective varieties]], and admit a strictly larger [[Lie group]] ''G'' of [[biholomorphism]]s with respect to which they are homogeneous: in fact, they are [[generalized flag manifold]]s, i.e., ''G'' is [[semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] and the stabilizer of a point is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' of ''G''. Among (complex) generalized flag manifolds ''G''/''P'', they are characterized as those for which the [[Nilradical of a Lie algebra|nilradical]] of the Lie algebra of ''P'' is abelian. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded [[domain (mathematics)|domains]] in complex vector spaces.

==Jordan algebras==
{{See also|Mutation (Jordan algebra)|Symmetric cone|Quadratic Jordan algebra}}
Although the classical Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed by ad hoc methods, [[Jordan triple system]]s, or equivalently Jordan pairs, provide a uniform algebraic means of describing all the basic properties connected with a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type and its non-compact dual. This theory is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} and {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} and summarized in {{harvtxt|Satake|1981}}. The development is in the reverse order from that using the structure theory of compact Lie groups. It starting point is the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type realized as a bounded symmetric domain. It can be described in terms of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]]. This Jordan algebra structure can be used to reconstruct the dual Hermitian symmetric space of compact type, including in particular all the associated Lie algebras and Lie groups.

The theory is easiest to describe when the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric space is of tube type. In that case the space is determined by a simple real Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;
with negative definite Killing form. It must admit an action of SU(2) which only acts via the trivial and adjoint representation, both types occurring. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is simple, this action is inner, so implemented by an inclusion of the Lie algebra of SU(2) in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. The complexification of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; decomposes as a direct sum of three eigenspaces for the diagonal matrices in SU(2). It is a three-graded complex Lie algebra, with the Weyl group element of SU(2) providing the involution. Each of the ±1 eigenspaces has the structure of a unital complex Jordan algebra explicitly arising as the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra. It can be identified with the multiplicity space of the adjoint representation  of SU(2) in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.

The description of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type starts from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra ''E''. It admits [[Jordan frame (Jordan algebra)|Jordan frames]], i.e. sets of orthogonal minimal idempotents ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;. Any two are related by an automorphism of ''E'', so that the integer ''m'' is an invariant called the '''rank''' of ''E''. Moreover, if ''A'' is the complexification of ''E'', it has a unitary [[structure group (Jordan algebra)|structure group]]. It is a subgroup of GL(''A'') preserving the natural complex inner product on ''A''. Any element ''a'' in ''A'' has a polar decomposition {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' ∑ α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with  {{math|1=α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0}}. The spectral norm is defined by ||a|| = sup α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The associated [[bounded symmetric domain]] is just the open unit ball ''D'' in ''A''. There is a biholomorphism between ''D'' and the tube domain ''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC'' where ''C'' is the open self-dual convex cone of elements in ''E'' of the form {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' ∑ α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with ''u'' an automorphism of ''E'' and α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0. This gives two descriptions of the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. There is a natural way of using [[mutation (Jordan algebra)|mutations]] of the Jordan algebra ''A'' to compactify the space ''A''. The compactification ''X'' is a complex manifold and the finite-dimensional Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; of holomorphic vector fields on ''X'' can be determined explicitly. One parameter groups of biholomorphisms can be defined such that the corresponding holomorphic vector fields span &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. This includes the group of all complex Möbius transformations corresponding to matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The subgroup SU(1,1) leaves invariant the unit ball and its closure. The subgroup SL(2,'''R''') leaves invariant the tube domain and its closure. The usual Cayley transform and its inverse, mapping the unit disk in '''C''' to the upper half plane, establishes analogous maps between ''D'' and ''T''. The polydisk corresponds to the real and complex Jordan subalgebras generated by a fixed Jordan frame. It admits a transitive action of SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and this action extends to ''X''. The group ''G'' generated by the one-parameter groups of biholomorphisms acts faithfully on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. The subgroup generated by the identity component ''K'' of the unitary structure group and the operators in SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. It defines a compact Lie group ''H'' which acts transitively on ''X''. Thus ''H'' / ''K'' is the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. The group ''G'' can be identified with the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H''. The subgroup ''H''* leaving ''D'' invariant is a  noncompact real form of ''G''. It acts transitively on ''D'' so that ''H''* / ''K'' is the dual Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. The inclusions ''D'' ⊂ ''A'' ⊂ ''X'' reproduce the Borel and Harish-Chandra embeddings. The classification of Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type reduces to that of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. These were classified by {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1934}} in terms of [[Euclidean Hurwitz algebra]]s, a special type of [[composition algebra]].

In general a Hermitian symmetric space gives rise to a 3-graded Lie algebra with a period 2 conjugate linear automorphism switching the parts of degree ±1 and preserving the degree 0 part. This gives rise to the structure of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]], to which {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} extended the theory of Jordan algebras. All irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed uniformly within this framework. {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} constructed the irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of non-tube type from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra together with a period 2 automorphism. The −1 eigenspace of the automorphism has the structure of a Jordan pair, which can be deduced from that of the larger Jordan algebra. In the non-tube type case corresponding to a [[Siegel domain]] of type II, there is no distinguished subgroup of real or complex Möbius transformations. For irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces, tube type is characterized by the real dimension of the Shilov boundary {{math|''S''}} being equal to the complex dimension of {{math|''D''}}.

[[Rick Santorum]] and volunteered for Rep. [[Curt Weldon]]'s unsuccessful [[Pennsylvania 7th congressional district election, 2006|reelection campaign in 2006]].&lt;ref name=philly/&gt; He graduated with a [[double major]] in [[political science]] and [[broadcast journalism]].&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;

After graduation Posobiec worked for the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] in [[Shanghai, China]].&lt;ref name=philly/&gt; In 2008 he played a minor role in the film ''[[The Forbidden Kingdom]]''.&lt;ref name=vice/&gt;&lt;ref name=philly/&gt; He later worked for [[WPHT]], a conservative [[talk radio]] station and later for the campaign of Steve Johnson in the [[Pennsylvania lieutenant gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 Pennsylvania lieutenant gubernatorial election]].&lt;ref name=philly/&gt;

Posobiec is a [[lieutenant junior grade]] [[naval intelligence]] officer.&lt;ref name=nbcnavy&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/right-winger-jack-posobiec-retweeted-trump-navy-intel-officer-n793191|title=Right-Winger Jack Posobiec, Retweeted by Trump, Is Navy Intel Officer|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=August 16, 2017|first=Courtney|last=Kube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served several tours in the [[United States Naval Reserves|Naval Reserves]] from 2010 to 2017, including a deployment at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]].&lt;ref name=vice/&gt; In March 2017 Posobiec resigned from his [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] position, saying that his support for Trump led to a "toxic work environment".

==Recent political activities==
{{prose|section|date=August 2017}}

Posobiec describes himself as a "Republican political operative".&lt;ref name=wapo08152017&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/15/trump-retweets-right-wing-provocateur-known-for-pushing-false-conspiracy-theories/|title=Trump retweets right-wing provocateur known for pushing false conspiracy theories|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 15, 2017|first=Samantha|last=Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has called his recent work "reality journalism—part investigative, part activist, part commentary",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-france-cyber-activist-idUSKBN187008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/us/politics/comey-fake-news-twitter-posobiec.html|title=A Pro-Trump Conspiracy Theorist, a False Tweet and a Runaway Story|first=Jeremy W.|last=Peters|date=10 June 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said: "I'm willing to break the fourth wall. I'm willing to walk into an anti-Trump march and start chanting anti-Clinton stuff—to make something happen, and then cover what happens."&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-far-right-american-nationalist-who-tweeted-macronleaks|title=The Far-Right American Nationalist Who Tweeted #MacronLeaks|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 7, 2017|first=Andrew|last=Marantz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Will Sommer, an editor at ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', has said Posobiec "make[s] stuff up, relentlessly", and that "there's no one at that level."&lt;ref name=philly/&gt;

=== Conspiracy theories, falsehoods, and unsubstantiated claims ===
* Posobiec was one of the biggest promoters on [[social media]] of the [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]], which falsely claimed that high-ranking officials were involved in a [[Child sexual abuse|child-sex]] ring centered at a [[Washington, D.C.]] pizzeria.&lt;ref name=philly/&gt; He [[live stream|live-streamed]] an investigation of the pizzeria and was asked to leave after attempting to broadcast a child's birthday party being held in a back room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/pizzagate-from-rumor-to-hashtag-to-gunfire-in-dc/2016/12/06/4c7def50-bbd4-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html|title=Pizzagate: From rumor, to hashtag, to gunfire in D.C.|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 6, 2016|first1=Marc|last1=Fisher|first2=John Woodrow|last2=Cox|first3=Peter|last3=Hermann3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posobiec later said he had always thought the Pizzagate theory was "stupid" and had filmed his visit to debunk it.&lt;ref name=philly/&gt;
* In December 2016, Posobiec claimed without evidence that [[Disney]] had re-written scenes in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie ''[[Rogue One]]'' to add "Anti Trump scenes calling him a racist", and called for a boycott of the ''Star Wars'' franchise. Disney denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a51399/now-trump-supporters-are-boycotting-star-wars/|title=Now Trump Supporters Are Boycotting Star Wars Based on No Evidence|journal=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=December 8, 2016|first=Sammy|last=Nickalls}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Posobiec falsely said that former FBI director [[James Comey]], at a [[United States Senate]] hearing on May 17, 2017, "said under oath that Trump did not ask him to halt any investigation". The claim was later repeated by the conservative media, including in prominent outlets such as [[InfoWars]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]].&lt;ref name="Peters"/&gt;
* Posobiec promoted the discredited conspiracy theory that [[Seth Rich]] had leaked e-mails from the [[Democratic National Committee]] to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref name=buzzfeed05292017/&gt;
* Posobiec promoted a hoax that [[CNN]] had published and then deleted an article defending [[Bill Maher]]'s use of a [[racial slur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cnn-article-bill-maher/|title=Did CNN Delete an Article Defending Bill Maher's Use of a Racial Slur?|publisher=[[Snopes.com]]|date=June 5, 2017|first=Dan|last=Evon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2017, shortly after Republican congressman [[Steve Scalise]] was [[2017 Congressional baseball shooting|shot during a baseball practice]], Posobiec falsely tweeted that [[Loretta Lynch]] had previously called for "blood in the streets"&lt;ref name=philly2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/tracing-right-wing-alt-reality-on-twitter-20170619.html|title=Tracing right-wing alt-reality on Twitter|publisher=[[Philly.com]]|date=June 18, 2017|first=Aubrey|last=Whelan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Bernie Sanders]] had ordered his followers to "take down" Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-trump-supporter-links-congressional-1497472393-htmlstory.html|title=How fake news starts: Trump supporters tie Bernie Sanders to Alexandria shooting using a fake quote|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 14, 2017|first=Colleen|last=Shalby}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2017, Posobiec, along with Cernovich, [[The Gateway Pundit]], and InfoWars, promoted a false theory that a [[2017 Washington train derailment|passenger train derailment near Dupont, Washington]] was linked to the [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]] anti-fascism movement.&lt;ref name=train&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newsweek.com/antifa-falsely-linked-amtrak-train-derailment-right-wing-conspiracy-peddlers-751893|title=Antifa' Falsely Linked to Amtrak Train Derailment by Right-Wing Conspiracy Peddlers|journal=[[Newsweek]]|date=December 18, 2017|first=Michael Edison|last=Hayden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Posobiec has frequently tweeted about the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro-Trump Bloggers Are Trying To Disown The Alt-Right Brand After Charlottesville |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alt-right-charlottesville_us_59932926e4b04b193360992e |publisher=''[[HuffPost]]'' |date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump Retweets Alt-Right Leader Who Has Praised White Supremacist Richard Spencer |url=https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tweets-alt-right-leader-who-praised-white-supremacist-richard-spencer-650852 |publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for Donald Trump ===

During the 2016 election, Posobiec was a special projects director of Citizens for Trump, a pro-Trump organization.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed05292017"/&gt; 
* Posobiec led a campaign in November 2016 to discredit [[Protests against Donald Trump|anti-Trump protesters]] by planting a sign at a protest reading "Rape Melania".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/15/how-one-deplorable-sign-at-an-anti-trump-protest-foreshadows-the-fight-over-fake-news/|title=How one deplorable sign at an anti-Trump protest foreshadows the fight over fake news|first=Callum|last=Borchers|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/from-alt-right-to-alt-lite-naming-the-hate|title=From Alt Right to Alt Lite: Naming the Hate|website=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/trump-retweets-alt-right-provocateur-after-condemning-white-supremacists|title=Trump's erratic early morning Twitter retweets include one calling him fascist|first1=Amanda|last1=Holpuch|first2=Kevin|last2=Rawlinson|date=15 August 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later denied his involvement and said he had been questioned about it by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]].&lt;ref name=philly/&gt;
* Posobiec was an organizer of the [[DeploraBall]], an event held on January 19, 2017, to celebrate [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|Trump's inauguration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/clarendon-ballroom-gets-threats-after-refusing-to-host-trump-deploraball/2016/12/15/d2c956e6-3d30-4a1b-b6bc-0a4ae744325f_story.html|title=Clarendon Ballroom gets harassing calls after declining to host Trump backers' 'DeploraBall'|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 15, 2016|first=Rachel|last=Weiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For two months in 2017, Posobiec was a correspondent for ''[[The Rebel Media|The Rebel]]'', a far-right Canada-based website.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed05292017"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/janelytvynenko/jack-posobiec-out-at-the-rebel|title=Pro-Trump Media Figure And Conspiracy Theory Peddler Jack Posobiec Is Out At The Rebel|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=May 29, 2017|first=Jane|last=Lytvynenko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted press access to the [[White House]] in April 2017, but he left the next month after allegations arose that he had engaged in [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.phillymag.com/news/2017/09/16/jack-posobiec-trump-fake-news/|title=How Jack Posobiec Became the King of Fake News|journal=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]|date=September 16, 2017|first=Jonathan|last=Valania}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Philadelphia (magazine)|''Philadelphia'' magazine]], during his short time in the White House press pool Posobiec "seems to have been charged in the press briefing room with haranguing legitimate journalists and running out the clock on press conferences with inane softball questions and [[Dear Leader]] obsequiousness."&lt;ref name=philly/&gt;
* On June 16, 2017, Posobiec disrupted a [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park]] production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' that depicted the title character as a President Trump-like figure. Posobiec was prompted by [[Mike Cernovich]], another alt-right conspiracy theorist, who had offered a $1,000 prize for anyone who interrupted the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/06/17/pro-trump-protester-arrested-after-rushing-stage-at-controversial-julius-caesar-play-in-new-york/|title=Pro-Trump protester arrested after rushing stage at controversial 'Julius Caesar' production in New York|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 17, 2017|first=Amy B|last=Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posobiec was escorted from the event along with fellow protester [[Laura Loomer]], who was arrested for [[disorderly conduct]] after refusing to leave the stage.&lt;ref name=philly/&gt;

=== Race relations ===

* In September 2016, Posobiec praised [[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer]] on Twitter as "indispensable". He later sought to distance himself from the [[white supremacist]], deleting his supporting tweets and calling Spencer a "scumbag".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-tweets-alt-right-leader-who-praised-white-supremacist-richard-spencer-650852|title=Trump retweeted an alt-right figurehead who has praised white supremacist Richard Spencer|date=2017-08-15|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2016, Posobiec posted a [[Twitter|tweet]] that included [[triple parentheses]], an [[anti-semitic]] meme.&lt;ref name=purge&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newsweek.com/white-supremacist-neo-nazi-accounts-active-twitter-after-purge-790286|title=White Supremacist, Neo-Nazi Accounts Still Active on Twitter After a So-Called Purge|journal=[[Newsweek]]|date=January 25, 2018|first=Michael Edison|last=Hayden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2017, following a [[2017 Unite the Right rally|"Unite the Right" rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] that led to violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-protesters, Posobiec said that the rally had become "massive propaganda" for the left and that the mainstream media was "fanning the flames of this violence."

== History ==
Kuro Tawil was on a [[backpacking (travel)|solo-backpacking]] trip through [[Southwestern Asia|South Western Asia]] in 2013, shortly after graduating from [[Texas State University]]. While traveling, he realized how large the issue of [[sexual violence]] is around the world and saw how in many developing countries the [[law]] and [[justice system]] were ineffective. Tawil realized many of these women needed a way to take their protection and their lives into their own hands, seeing the need for a realistic way for a woman to be able to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kuro-tawil/fighting-the-war-on-women_1_b_5419285.html|title=Fighting the War on Women: Arming Women to Fight Sexual Assault Worldwide|last=Tawil|first=Kuro|date=2014-06-02|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tawil returned home to Texas and started the [[conscious business]] Kuros, as a way to fund the distribution of pepper spray to [[Sexual violence|at risk populations of women]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.policeone.com/police-products/less-lethal/sprays-aerosols/press-releases/8560308-New-Pepper-Spray-from-SABRE-and-Kuros-Helps-Women-Worldwide/|title=New Pepper Spray from SABRE and Kuros!

'''Making a mountain out of a molehill''' is an [[idiom]] referring to over-reactive, histrionic behaviour where a person makes too much of a minor issue. It seems to have come into existence in the 16th century.

==Metaphor==
[[File:Molehill Country - geograph.org.uk - 140468.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Molehills at the foot of a Scottish mountain]]

The idiom is a [[metaphor]] for the common [[behaviour]] of responding disproportionately to something - usually an adverse circumstance. One who ''"makes a mountain out of a molehill"'' is said to be greatly exaggerating the severity of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/make-a-mountain-out-of-a-molehill Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[cognitive psychology]], this form of [[cognitive distortion|distortion]] is called [[Exaggeration|magnification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Depression |page=106 |author=William J. Knaus, Albert Ellis  |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_3PYxltgXoC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt; or overreacting. The phrase itself is so common that a study by psychologists found that with respect to familiarity and image value, it ranks high among the 203 common sayings they tested.&lt;ref name=Visual&gt;Kenneth L. Higbee and Richard J. Millard, ''Visual imagery and familiarity ratings for 203 sayings'', Am. J. Psychiatry, Summer 1983, Vol. 96, No. 2, pp. 211–22; found at [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1422812 JSTOR website]. Retrieved January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar idioms include 'Much ado about nothing' and 'Making a song and dance about nothing'. The meaning finds its opposite in the fable about [[The Mountain in Labour|the mountain in labour]] that gives birth to a mouse. In the former too much is made of little; in the latter one is led to expect much, but with too little result. The two appear to converge in [[William Caxton]]'s translation of the fable (1484), where he makes of the mountain ''a hylle whiche beganne to tremble and shake by cause of the molle whiche delved it''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/caxton/25.htm |title=2.5. Of the Montayn whiche shoke (Caxton's Aesop) |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he mimics the meaning of the fable by turning a mountain into a molehill. It was in the context of this bringing together of the two ideas that the English idiom grew.

==Origin==
The earliest recorded use of the [[alliteration|alliterative]] phrase making a mountain out of a molehill dates from 1548. The word for the animal involved was less than two hundred years old by then. Previous to that the [[Mole (animal)|mole]] had been known by its [[Old English]] name ''wand'', which had slowly changed to 'want'. A [[molehill]] was known as a 'wantitump', a word that continued in dialect use for centuries more.&lt;ref&gt;J.O.Halliwell, ''A Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words'', London 1847&lt;/ref&gt; The former name of want was then replaced by ''mold(e)warp'' (meaning earth-thrower),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moldwarp?s=t|title=moldwarp |publisher=dictionary.com |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a shortened version of which (''molle'') began to appear in the later 14th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mole |title=mole |publisher=dictionary.com |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the word molehill in the first half of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/molehill|title=molehill |publisher=dictionary.com |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idiom is found in [[Nicholas Udall]]'s translation of ''[[The first tome or volume of the Paraphrase of Erasmus vpon the newe testamente]]'' (1548) in the statement that "The Sophistes of Grece coulde through their copiousness make an Elephant of a flye, and a mountaine of a mollehill."  The comparison of the elephant with a fly (''elephantem ex musca facere'') is an old Latin proverb that Erasmus recorded in his collection of such phrases, the [[Adagia]],&lt;ref&gt;1.9.69, [http://widgets.bestmoodle.net/scriptdata/adagia_animals_data.html Erasmian animal idioms]&lt;/ref&gt; European variations on which persist. The mountain and molehill seem to have been added by Udall&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/14/magazine/on-language.html?pagewanted=1 |title=On Language – The Earth Makes Its Move | author=William Safire |date=June 14, 1987 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase has continued in popular use ever since. If the idiom was not coined by Udall himself, the linguistic evidence above suggests that it cannot have been in existence long.

'''Militarization of police''' refers to the use of [[military equipment]] and [[Military tactics|tactics]] by [[law enforcement officer]]s. This includes the use of [[armored personnel carrier]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, [[submachine gun]]s, [[flashbang grenade]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eliteukforces.info/special-air-service/weapons/stun-grenade.php |title=SAS - Weapons - Flash Bang &amp;#124; Stun Grenade (The British Army's SAS developed flashbang grenades) |publisher=Eliteukforces.info |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The flash from a flashbang grenade detonation momentarily activates all [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the [[human eye|eye]], making vision impossible for approximately five seconds, until the eye restores itself to its normal, unstimulated state. The loud blast is meant to cause temporary loss of hearing, and also disturbs the [[Perilymph|fluid in the ear]], causing loss of balance. The concussive blast of the detonation can still injure, and the heat created can ignite flammable materials.&lt;/ref&gt; [[grenade launcher]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Texas Rangers, Department of Public Safety, [http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/indexfirst.htm Branch Davidian Evidence], Investigative Report No. 1, September 1999; Investigative Report No. 2, January 2000 (PDFs available at Texas Rangers website). The Rangers found that the FBI used grenade launchers to fire two 40 mm M651 grenades. The Army considers the M651 a pyrotechnic device and that it is known to cause fires. The Army Tech Manual for the M651 warns that it can penetrate 3/4" plywood at 200 meters and "projectile may explode upon target impact." During inventory of the Waco evidence the Texas Rangers also found flashbang grenades.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sniper rifle]]s, and [[Special Weapons and Tactics]] (SWAT) teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/militarization-of-police/| author=James Joyner| title=Militarization of Police| publisher=Outside the Beltway| date=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-and-the-shocking-nature-of-us-police-militarization| author=Paul D.

Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of [[protest]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo21636470.html|title=Crisis and Control|website=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/10/senate-police-militarization.html|title=Congress scrutinizes police militarization before planned Ferguson protest|website=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, [[riot police]] have fired at protesters using guns with [[rubber bullet]]s or [[plastic bullet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plastic+bullet http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plastic+bullet] "A solid PVC cylinder, 10 cm long and 38 mm in diameter, fired by police or military forces to regain control in riots."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tear gas]], which was developed by the [[United States Army]] for [[riot control]] in 1919, was widely used against protesters in the 2000s. The use of tear gas in [[war]]fare is prohibited by various international treaties&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the [[Geneva Protocol]] of 1925: 'Prohibited the use of "asphyxiating gas, or any other kind of gas, liquids, substances or similar materials"'&lt;/ref&gt; that most states have signed; however, its law enforcement or [[military]] use for [[domestic policy|domestic]] or non-[[combat]] situations is permitted.

Concerns about the militarization of police have been raised by both ends of the political spectrum in the [[United States]], with both the right-of-center/libertarian [[Cato Institute]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] voicing criticisms of the practice. The [[Fraternal Order of Police]] has spoken out in favor of equipping law enforcement officers with military equipment, on the grounds that it increases the officers' safety and enables them to protect members of the public and other [[first responder]]s (e.g., [[firefighter]]s and [[emergency medical services]] personnel). However, a 2017 study showed that police forces which received military equipment were more likely to have violent encounters with the public, regardless of local crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/06/30/does-military-equipment-lead-police-officers-to-be-more-violent-we-did-the-research/| author=Ryan Welch and Jack Mewhirter| title=Does military equipment lead police officers to be more violent?

Canadian legal expert Michael Spratt wrote, "... there's no question that Canadian police sometimes look more like post-apocalyptic military mercenaries than protectors of the peace.

The [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests|G20 protests]] in Toronto in 2010 showed that the militarization of protest policing is not only occurring in the United States. Police in Toronto used a sound cannon, or [[Long Range Acoustic Device]] (LRAD) -- a [[weapon]] that was developed for use in conflicts in the Middle East, as well as barricades, pre-emptive arrests and riot units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/views-expressed/2014/09/canadian-police-agencies-innovators-militarization|title=Canadian police agencies: Innovators in militarization?|work=rabble.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kevin Walby, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the [[University of Winnipeg]], "the more interesting aspect of the militarization of the police is actually on the strategy side"; police are "increasingly training with military-style tacticians, especially when it comes to situations like [[crowd control]] and, increasingly, [[surveillance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/news/police-militarization-is-already-in-canada-as-surveillance-on-the-rise | author=Ashley Csanady| title=Police militarization is already in Canada as surveillance on the rise| publisher=Canada.com| date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2015 it was reported that "RCMP officers have started openly carrying [[MP5]] submachine guns on [[Parliament Hill]] as part of a visible increase to Parliament Hill security following last [[2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa|October's terrorist attack]]" in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/rcmp-brings-out-the-big-guns-to-the-dismay-of-some|title=Mounties now toting submachine guns for Hill security|author=Lee Berthiaume, Ottawa Citizen More Lee Berthiaume, Ottawa Citizen|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative senator [[Vern White]], a former RCMP officer and a former Ottawa police chief states that "...some RCMP officers guarding Parliament Hill against potential terrorist attacks should be armed with rifles similar to those carried by Canadian troops in Afghanistan [,]" the "...more powerful Colt [[C8 carbine|C8]] [which is] popular with police tactical teams and Canadian and other NATO alliance troops." White argues that the C8 carbines would give officers a much longer shooting range than the short-barreled [[MP5|MP5 submachine guns]]. "The RCMP is issuing more than 2,200 C8 carbines to its officers [,]" but the RCMP has not indicated whether the C8s will be issued to Parliament Hill officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/boost-firepower-of-rcmp-guards-on-parliament-hill-says-senator|title=Boost firepower of Mounties guarding Parliament Hill, says senator|author=David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen More David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
In 2013 "...Brazil saw countrywide demonstrations protesting a lack of basic services while the country was spending billions on the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The unprepared and overreacting police forces responded in a way that shocked the largely middle-class protesters. The police, using "non-lethal" weapons like pepper spray and rubber bullets while dressed from head to toe in ninja-like full battle gear, indiscriminately arrested both violent "[[black bloc]]" demonstrators, known for their confrontational tactics and anarchist views, along with non-violent protestors marching peacefully." As a result, "...calls for de-militarization of the police—from social movements, non-governmental organizations, and even segments of the police itself—became widespread and remain one of the legacies of the World Cup." The Brazilian "...Military Police today, while not officially a wing of the Armed Forces, remains an institution with a strict military hierarchy, training that retains a military ideology, and practices that frequently resemble occupying forces conquering enemy territories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wola.org/commentary/police_militarization_similarities_between_ferguson_and_brazil|title=Police Militarization: Similarities Between Ferguson and Brazil|publisher=wola.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The units that responded to the protests were Shock Police, units specialized in [[riot control]]. The Military Police is an ancillary and reserve force of the Army, under the General Inspectorate of Military Police, being that a part of Land Operations Command. But, in time of peace, the state governor act as commander-in-chief of the Police and Firefighting Corps, according to the [[Constitution of Brazil]], article 144, 6th paragraph, where it is said that the "Military Police and Firefighter Corps, ancillary and reserve forces of the Army, subordinate themselves, with the Civil Police, to the state and Federal District governors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coter.eb.mil.br/igpm/index.php/2013-03-19-15-57-34|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317105455/http://www.coter.eb.mil.br/igpm/index.php/2013-03-19-15-57-34|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-17|title=Legislação|website=www.coter.eb.mil.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

====19th Century====
Following the [[Reconstruction Era]] (1865–1877) in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the 1878 [[Posse Comitatus Act]], in response to the allegation of [[civil liberties]] abuse under [[military occupation]] of the former [[Confederacy (American Civil War)|Confederate States]] by members of the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] during Reconstruction. Still in force, the law prohibits the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]] (as amended in 1956) for being used as [[domestic policy|domestic]] [[law enforcement]] except when authorized by the [[President of the United States|President]] under certain circumstances; similar limitation also applies to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]] by [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] policy. The Act does not apply to the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and [[state defense force]]s while under the authority of their respective [[Governor (United States)|state governors]] nor the [[United States Coast Guard]], which is both an [[armed service]] and a [[maritime law enforcement]] agency and is not under authority of the [[United States Department of Defense]] (which was formed in 1947 out of the [[United States Department of War]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/docs/10-16/ch_12.asp|title=Domestic Operational Law: The Posse Comitatus Act and Homeland Security|website=army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=706794 THE POSSE COMITATUS ACT: A HINDRANCE TO NATIONAL SECURITY IN NEED OF A CHANGE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/04autumn/felicett.pdf|title=The Posse Comitatus Act: Liberation from the Lawyers|website=army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the law was passed, it allowed [[U.S. state|state]] and [[Local government in the United States|local authorities]] to regain control of their affairs, with their police departments typically equipped with [[handguns]], [[shotguns]], and [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], which were suitable for law enforcement purposes.

====20th Century====
[[File:Thompsonad1sm.jpg|thumb|upright|The "Anti-Bandit Gun": a 1920s advertisement of the [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson M1921]] for United States [[Police|law enforcement]] forces]]
Throughout the 20th century, the United States has faced large and heavily armed [[criminal organizations]], in which law enforcement officers were clearly outperformed. In the 1920s during the [[Prohibition Era]] and in the early 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], criminal syndicates and individual bank robbers such as [[John Dillinger]] and [[Bonnie and Clyde]] were frequently armed with [[Thompson submachine gun]]s and [[Browning Automatic Rifles]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray Bearse, "The Thompson Submachine Gun: Weapon of War and Peace", in Murtz, ''Gun Digest Treasury'' (DBI Books, 1994), p.210 {{ISBN|0873491564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), as well as police departments in cities such as [[Kansas City, Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article1337845.html|title=Police armored vehicles have long history|work=kansascity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenoshapolice.com/history-department|title=History of Department|work=Kenosha Police Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; began deploying automatic weapons, including the Thompson submachine gun, and armored cars in the 1920s and 1930s.
[[File:Firearms practice, 1936.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An FBI officer firing a [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] in 1936.]]

[[George Fletcher Chandler]], a veteran of the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] and the first Superintendent of the [[New York State Police]], was an early advocate of law enforcement officers wearing their weapons exposed on the outside of their uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Wilbur R.|title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412988766|page=1230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYME6Z35nyAC&amp;pg=PA1230&amp;dq=george+fletcher+chandler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiz_zxr6_TAhVD64MKHUkkChwQ6AEIVjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20fletcher%20chandler&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Social issues of the 1920s in the United States|the late 1920s through the early 1930s]], gunmen from criminal gangs in the United States began wearing [[bulletproof vest]]s made from thick layers of cotton padding and cloth. These early vests could absorb the impact of handgun rounds such as [[.22 Long Rifle]], [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 S&amp;W Long]], [[.32 S&amp;W]], [[.380 ACP]], [[.38 Special]] and [[.45 ACP]] traveling at speeds of up to {{convert|300|m/s|abbr=on}}. To overcome these vests, law enforcement agents such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] began using the newer and more powerful [[.38 Super]], and later the [[.357 Magnum]] cartridge.

Experts believes that police militarization was escalated in the 1950s and 1960s, an era in which [[race riot]]s were common in many U.S. cities. Some believe that the seeming success of officers armed with military-style weapons and deployed to curtail the 1965 [[Watts Riots]], a six-day race riot sparked by conflicts with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) that killed 34 people, gave way to the trend of arming and equipping law enforcement officers with battlefield weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/police-militarization-history-stretches-back-civil-rights-movement-photos-1926956|title=Police Militarization History Stretches Back To Civil Rights Movement [PHOTOS]|author=Aaron Morrison|date=May 18, 2015|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joy Rohde, a professor at the [[University of Michigan]]'s [[Ford School of Public Policy]], has published research indicating that "militarization is a mindset...is a tendency to see the world through the lens of national security, a tendency to exaggerate existing threats." Rohde traces "the origins of modern militarized policing" to the [[Cold War]]-era [[anti-communist]] paranoia, and the idea that domestic civil rights activists were similar to foreign enemies, as manifested in activities such as the CIA's [[Operation CHAOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-is-a-relic-of-cold-war-paranoia-2016-8| author=Joy Rohde| title=Police militarization is a relic of Cold War paranoia| publisher=Business Insider| date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Things have changed over the last 100 years and due to the rise of acts of terrorism and the easy access to high-powered weapons; special weapons and tactics teams have been implemented and are being utilized across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=J|date=2000|title=Training SWAT teams: Implications for improving tactical units.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235200000556|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|doi=10.1016/S0047-2352(00)00055-6|pmid=|access-date=|volume=28|pages=407–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s to 1990s, encounters with the sophisticated weapons of narcotics trafficking groups such as the [[Medellín Cartel]] and street gangs such as the [[Gangster Disciples]], with organized, violent left-wing protesters at such events as the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]] and the 1999 [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO Conference]] in [[Seattle]],&lt;ref name="ew1"&gt;{{Cite news|first = Kera|last = Abraham|title = Flames of Dissent|newspaper = Eugene Weekly|date = November 22, 2006|url = http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|accessdate = June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[urban riots]] such as the 1965 Watts riots in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[1967 Detroit Riot]] in [[Detroit]] led law enforcement to reconsider their standard [[side arm]]s.

The 1981 [[Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies Act]] allows the U.S. military to cooperate with domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies. Operations in support of law enforcement include assistance in counter-drug operations, assistance for civil disturbances, special security operations, [[counter-terrorism]], explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), and similar activities. Constitutional and statutory restrictions and corresponding directives and regulations limit the type of support provided in this area. This allows the U.S. military to give law enforcement agencies access to [[List of United States military bases|its military bases]] and [[Equipment of the United States Armed Forces|its military equipment]].&lt;ref name=balko&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balko|first1=Radley|title=A Decade After 9/11, Police Departments Are Increasingly Militarized|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/12/police-militarization-9-11-september-11_n_955508.html|accessdate=November 29, 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was promoted during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan]] in the context of the [[War on drugs]], and is considered a part of a general trend towards the militarization of police.&lt;ref name=balko /&gt; The Act is cited in the 1992 essay ''[[The Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012]]'' as having set a precedent that the author, a [[United States Air Force]] officer, considered dangerous.

The 1997 [[North Hollywood shootout]] had a profound effect on law enforcement agencies. Local patrol officers at the time were typically armed with their standard issue [[9×19mm]] or [[.38 Special]] pistols, with some having a [[gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] shotgun available in their cars. The North Hollywood bank robbers carried fully automatic [[AK-47]]-style weapons with high capacity [[drum magazine]]s and ammunition capable of penetrating vehicles and police Kevlar vests. With these weapons, two bank robbers fired approximately 1,100 rounds at officers and civilians before being killed. The robbers wore [[ballistic vest|body armor]] which successfully protected them from bullets and shotgun pellets fired by the responding patrolmen. Police noted that the service pistols carried by the first responding officers had insufficient range and relatively poor accuracy, although a SWAT team eventually arrived with sufficient firepower.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The ineffectiveness of the standard police patrol pistols and shotguns in penetrating the robbers' body armor led to a trend in the United States toward arming selected police officers, not just SWAT teams, with heavier firepower such as semi-automatic [[5.56×45mm NATO]] [[AR-15]] type rifles.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} SWAT teams, whose close quarters battle weaponry usually consisted of [[submachine gun]]s that fired pistol cartridges such as the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]], began supplementing them with AR-15 type rifles and carbines.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====21st Century====
Under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], law enforcement officers must receive written permission from a court of law, or otherwise qualified [[magistrate]], to lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal activity. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the 2001 [[Patriot Act]] gave law enforcement officers permission to search a home or business without the owner's or the occupant's consent or knowledge, amongst other provisions, if terrorist activities were suspected. The Act was criticized for its perceived violation of civil liberties and has generated a great deal of controversy since its enactment. In ''[[United States v. Antoine Jones]]'', the court found that increased monitoring of suspects caused by the Patriot Act directly put the suspects' [[Constitutional right#United States|constitutional rights]] in jeopardy. For a time, the Act allowed for agents to undertake "sneak and peek" searches. Critics such as the ACLU strongly criticized the law for violating the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.aclu.org/safefree/patriot/16745prs20030903.html|title=Uncle Sam Asks: "What the hell is going on here?" in New ACLU Print and Radio Advertisements|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|date=September 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FactCheckOnACLUAdv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/aclu_ad_on_sneak-and-peek_searches_overblown.html|title=ACLU Ad On "Sneak-and-Peek" Searches: Overblown|publisher=FactCheck.org|date=September 21, 2004|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714102208/http://www.factcheck.org/aclu_ad_on_sneak-and-peek_searches_overblown.html|archivedate=July 14, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2015, President [[Barack Obama]] announced limits on the types of military equipment which can be transferred to police departments and the implementation of training programs to assure the appropriate use of other items. The military can no longer transfer some weapons, such as grenade launchers, weaponized vehicles, and bayonets to police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-military-equipment-gravy-train-is-ending-for-local-police-departments| author=Colleen Curry| title=The Military Equipment Gravy Train Is Ending for Local Police Departments| publisher=Vice| date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama stated that "We've seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like it's an [[military occupation|occupying force]] as opposed to a force that's part of the community that's protecting them and serving them,...So we're going to prohibit equipment made for the battlefield that is not appropriate for local police departments."&lt;ref name="politico.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/white-house-limiting-military-equipment-for-police-118041.html|title=Police union accuses White House of politicizing cop safety|work=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Obama's announcement, the United States' largest police union, the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], reacted negatively, pledging to push back against the new restrictions, and accusing the administration of politicizing officers' safety.&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt; The executive director of the FOP, James Pasco, stated that his group "...(would) be at (their) most aggressive in asserting the need for officer safety and officer rights in any police changes that are to be effected", and objected to a requirement that would require police departments to obtain permission from city governments to acquire certain equipment, including riot batons, helmets and shields, through federal programs.&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt; Pasco stated "We need to only look back to [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] (the location of the 2015 protests following the [[death of Freddie Gray]]) to see what happens when officers are sent out ill-equipped in a disturbance situation...[;] Because you don't like the optics (of militarization), you can't send police officers out to be hurt or killed."&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt;

In July 2016, the Obama Administration announced that it would revisit the 2015 ban on some types of military equipment for police forces, and begin a process of case-by-case review.&lt;ref name=td20160722&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160722/07570135041/administrations-one-year-experimentation-with-reining-police-militarization-apparently-over.shtml |title=Administration's One-Year Experimentation With Reining In Police Militarization Apparently Over |work=TechDirt |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ruby Ridge====
In 1992, there was a deadly confrontation and a 12-day [[siege]] at [[Ruby Ridge]] in [[northern Idaho]] between [[Randy Weaver]], his family and his friend Kevin Harris, and agents of the [[United States Marshals Service]] (USMS) and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). USMS and FBI agents were armed with M16s and sniper rifles, and they used an armored personnel carrier. It resulted in the deaths of two Weaver's son Sammy, his wife Vicki, and Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan. At the subsequent federal criminal trial of Weaver and Harris, Weaver's attorney [[Gerry Spence]] made accusations of "criminal wrongdoing" against every agency involved in the incident: the FBI, USMS, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (BATFE), and the [[United States Attorney's Office]] (USAO) for Idaho. At the completion of the trial, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] formed a Ruby Ridge Task Force to investigate Spence's charges. The 1994 Task Force report was released in redacted form by Lexis Counsel Connect and raised questions about the conduct and policy of all the agencies. Public outcry over Ruby Ridge led to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information holding 14 days of hearings and issuing a report calling for reforms in [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement]] to prevent a repeat of Ruby Ridge and to restore public confidence in federal law enforcement.

====Branch Davidian siege====

Referring to the 2011 [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests in [[New York City]], Glen Greenwald wrote, "The police response was so excessive, and so clearly modeled after battlefield tactics, that there was no doubt that deterring domestic [[dissent]] is one of the primary aims of police militarization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/14/militarization-u-s-police-dragged-light-horrors-ferguson/| author=Glenn Greenwald| title=The Militarization of U.S. Police: Finally Dragged Into the Light by the Horrors of Ferguson| publisher=The Intercept| date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oakland Police Department]] (OPD) used excessive force while breaking up [[Occupy Oakland]] demonstrations in 2011. Several protesters successfully sued the city of [[Oakland, California]] for their injuries; Scott Olsen was severely injured after being hit in the head with a police projectile and was awarded $4.5 million. The city paid $1.17 million to a group of protesters, and $645,000 to Kayvan Sabeghi, who was clubbed by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thenation.com/article/179351/did-occupy-actually-make-police-departments-more-accountable| author=Amity Paye |title=Did Occupy Actually Make Police Departments More Accountable?| work=The Nation| date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2014, a SWAT team looking for drugs in a [[Cornelia, Georgia]] home threw a [[flashbang grenade]] into the house. The grenade landed in the playpen of a 19-month-old baby boy, and the detonation severely burned and mutilated the baby's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/toddler-critically-injured-by-flash-bang-during-po/nf9XM/ | title=Toddler critically injured by 'flash bang' during police search | date=May 29, 2014 | accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, concerns about the militarization of police arose after the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] occurred on {{nowrap|August 9}}, 2014, in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], a [[suburb]] of {{nowrap|[[St. Louis]]}}. The display of military gear by area police agencies dealing with the protests received significant criticism from the media and politicians.

===Concerns and responses===
====Community policing====
The drift toward militarization concerns police officers and police policy analysts themselves. U.S. [[community policing]] grew out of the [[Peelian Principles]] of the [[London Metropolitan Police]] which emphasizes the relationship between the police and the community they serve. Police academy education patterned after a military boot camp, military-type [[battle dress uniform]]s and black color by itself may produce aggression, as do the missions named wars on crime, on drugs, and on terrorism.&lt;ref name=dispatch&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Karl Bickel|title=Will the Growing Militarization of Our Police Doom Community Policing?|journal=Daily Dispatch|date=December 2013|volume=6|issue=12|publisher=Community Oriented Policing Services, US Dept of Justice |url=http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp#two|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 piece in the newsletter of the DOJ's [[Office of Community Oriented Policing Services]] (COPS), COPS Senior Policy Analyst Karl Bickel warned that police militarization could seriously impair [[Community policing|community-oriented policing]]. Bickel wrote that accelerating militarization was likely to alienate police relationship with the community, and pointed to a variety of factors that contribute to militarization, including the growth of SWAT; the increase prevalence of dark-colored military-style battle dress uniforms for patrol officers (which research suggests has a psychological effect of increasing aggression in the wearer), and "warrior-like" stress training in policing training, which fosters an "us versus them" approach.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bickel, [https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/12-2013/will_the_growing_militarization_of_our_police_doom_community_policing.asp Will the Growing Militarization of Our Police Doom Community Policing?], ''Community Policing Dispatch'', [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Community Oriented Policing Services]] (Vol. 6, Issue 12), December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of force====
A report by [[The Marshall Project]] looking at data from the early 2010s investigated the mindset of "guardian" versus "warrior" by calculating the rate of complaints for excessive use of force against police officers who had served in the military versus police officers in general.  It found higher rates for veterans in Boston (28% vs. 17%) and Miami (14% vs. 11%), but found no difference for [[Massachusetts State Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/03/30/when-warriors-put-on-the-badge |title=When Warriors Put On The Badge |date=3 March 2017 |publisher=[[The Marshall Project]] |authors=Simone Weichselbaum, Beth Schwartzapfel, Tom Meagher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A national survey in August 2016 by the [[Pew Research Center]] found police officers who had served in the military were more likely to have fired their weapon while doing police work (32% vs. 26%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=A closer look at police officers who have fired their weapon on duty | url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/08/a-closer-look-at-police-officers-who-have-fired-their-weapon-on-duty/ |authors=Rich Morin, Andrew Mercer |date=8 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viewpoints====
The ACLU has stated that local police use these "wartime weapons in everyday policing, especially to fight the wasteful and failed drug war, which has unfairly targeted people of color."&lt;ref name="aclu.org"/&gt; Travis Irvine from ''The Huffington Post'' referred to how "local police forces now roll tank-like vehicles through our streets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/travis-irvine/a-new-christmas-truce_b_6370476.html|title=A New Christmas Truce|work=The Huffington Post|date=n.d.|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Pruett from ''The Huffington Post'' raised concerns about "Military [[Humvee]]s, still in camouflage and mounted with [[machine gun]]s, in the hands of municipal police [and] SWAT teams of police in full [[riot gear]], bristling with automatic weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-pruett/what-have-we-become_1_b_6308324.html|title=What Have We Become?|work=The Huffington Post|date=n.d.|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former "...Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper published an essay arguing that the current epidemic of [[police brutality]] is a reflection of the militarization...of our urban police forces, the result of years of the "war on drugs" and the "war on terror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1103039|title=Militarization Of Campus Police|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Rand Paul]] has proposed a demilitarization of U.S. police departments, stating that "The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slumz.boxden.com/f5/aug-20-database-shows-what-military-equipment-your-local-police-department-has-been-stockpiling-2111318/|title=Aug 20 - Database Shows What Military Equipment Your Local Police Department Has Been Stockpiling|publisher=boxden.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuck Canterbury, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, argued that the equipment received from the federal government had been properly de-militarized, and that it was being used to protect civilians from [[violent crime]]. He further stated that the use of the equipment by law enforcement was necessary to protect civilians, since [[mass shootings]] have taken place across the United States, even in small towns. Responding to claims that law enforcement officers were being given tanks, Canterbury argued that the vehicles being used by law enforcement were not armed, and that they were being used across the United States to protect other officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Becky|title=Fraternal Order of Police defends 'militarization'|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=370&amp;sid=31391932|website=KSL TV|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2015, a Department of Justice investigation into [[Police use of deadly force in the United States|use of deadly force]] by the [[Philadelphia Police Department]] in the period from 2007-2013 found that the way officers are trained may be a contributing factor to excessive use of deadly force. The report found that a) many officers have the mistaken assumption that being "in fear of their life" is justification for the use of deadly force, but fear should not be a factor - it's a reasonable belief that deadly force is necessary to avoid death or serious injury; b) instruction about policies on the use of force is confusing; c) most training scenarios end in some type of use of force and officers are rarely, if ever, trained how to resolve confrontations peacefully; d) 80% of suspects shot by police were black - black suspects were also more than twice as likely to be shot due to a "threat perception failure"; and e) no consistent procedure was in place for shooting investigations, no audio or video recordings of officer interviews were being made, and officers are often interviewed months after the incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fusion.net/story/108190/the-new-doj-report-on-philadelphia-police-shootings-is-mandatory-reading/| author=Daniel Rivero| title=The new DOJ report on Philadelphia police shootings is mandatory reading| publisher=Fusion| date=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/crime/article/Justice-Department-to-release-use-of-deadly-force-6152555.php|author1=SEAN CARLIN  |author2=MICHAEL R.

====Intelligence-gathering and surveillance====
In a January 2017 report [[Cato Institute]] criminal justice policy analyst Adam Bates argues that in the United States, "an increasingly militarized domestic police force" is characterized by "[[mission creep]] [that] has not been limited to weapons and tactics. What the War on Drugs has done for police militarization, the War on Terror is now doing for police intelligence gathering, and the privacy of millions of Americans is at risk."&lt;ref&gt;Adam Bates, Policy Analysis No. 809, [https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa-809-revised.pdf Stingray: A New Frontier in Police Surveillance], Cato Institute (January 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has raised concerns about military involvement in surveillance of peaceful protesters. The ACLU pointed, for example, to [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DOD) issuance of [[TALON (database)|Threat and Local Observation Notices]] (TALON) depicting [[Veterans for Peace]] and other anti-war groups as "terrorist threats." The ACLU also raised concerns about military involvement in "[[fusion center]]s."&lt;ref name="ACLUReport"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Spyfiles_2_0.pdf| title=POLICING FREE SPEECH: Police Surveillance and Obstruction of First Amendment-Protected Activity| publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|date=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil liberties====
The federal [[Posse Comitatus Act]] of 1878 forbids the U.S. military from conducting domestic law enforcement activities, embodying "the traditional American principle of separating civilian and military authority."&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;Matthew Carlton Hammond, [http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1576&amp;context=law_lawreview The Posse Comitatus Act: A Principle in Need of Renewal], ''Washington University Law Review'', Vol. 75, issue 2 (January 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been exceptions made, however: in 1981, Congress enacted legislation allowing military involvement in drug interdiction at U.S. borders, and eight years later "designated the Department of Defense as the 'single lead agency' in drug interdiction efforts."&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt; In the late 1990s, following the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], there were proposals to further limit the act to allow military participation in law enforcement activities in chemical/biological weapon and terrorism cases.&lt;ref name="KopelOlson"&gt;David B. Kopel &amp; Joseph Olson, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=10476 Preventing a Reign of Terror: Civil Liberties Implications of Terrorism Legislation], 21 ''Oklahoma City University Law Review'' 247 (summer/fall 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; These anti-terrorism proposals were criticized by some commentators on the basis that they were a threat to civil liberties.&lt;ref name="KopelOlson"/&gt; Writers such as [[U.S. Air Force]] officer [[Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.]] critiqued proposals to use the military for internal security, on the basis that "No one should suffer the illusion that military forces could ever execute the laws with the same sensitivity to civil liberties as regular police forces." Dunlap argued that "the central imperatives of military service" was "destroying targets and undermining enemy command and control"&amp;mdash;a skill that did not necessary carry over into intelligence-gathering and investigation. Under this view, "a successful policization of the armed forces may well render it incapable of defeating authentic external military threats."&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Dunlap, Jr., [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6040&amp;context=faculty_scholarship The Police-ization of the Military], ''Journal of Political and Military Sociology'' Vol. 27 (Winter 1999), pp. 217-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accelerating militarization of regular law enforcement during the [[War on Drugs]] and post-[[September 11 attacks|September 11]] [[War on Terror]], however, prompted some commentators to express alarm at the blurring of the distinction between civil and military functions, and the potential to erode constraints on governmental power in times of perceived crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Abigail R. Hall &amp; Christoper J. Coyne, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2122384 The Militarization of U.S. Domestic Policing], ''Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy'', vol. 17, no. 4 (spring 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 paper published in the journal ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]'' examined "role convergence, that is, evidence that significant segments of police operations in the United States have taken on military characteristics; and evidence indicating that many U.S. military initiatives have taken on policing characteristics."&lt;ref name="CampbellCampbell"&gt;Donald J. Campbell &amp; Kathleen M. Campbell, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249775935_Soldiers_as_Police_Officers_Police_Officers_as_Soldiers_Role_Evolution_and_Revolution_in_the_United_States Soldiers as Police Officers/Police Officers as Soldiers: Role Evolution and Revolution in the United States], ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' 36(2), pp. 347-48 (January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that "for individual citizens and for society as a whole, at least one aspect of role convergence—the militarization of the police—is potentially troublesome. If this convergence results in the police adopting not only military-type tactics and procedures but also military attitudes and orientations, the convergence may seriously threaten traditional civil rights and liberties."&lt;ref name="CampbellCampbell"/&gt;

A 2014 report by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], ''War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing'', concluded that "American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized...," citing an increase in the use in unnecessarily aggressive SWAT raids, "tactics designed for the battlefield"; and military equipment such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s, [[flashbang grenade]]s, and [[battering ram]]s, as well as a lack of transparency and oversight.&lt;ref name="WarComesHome"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf| title=War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union| date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as [[Ilya Shapiro]] have argued that military leads to "extreme constitutional violations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cato.org/blog/police-militarization-leads-extreme-constitutional-violations| author=Ilya Shapiro and Randal John Meyer| title=Police Militarization Leads to Extreme Constitutional Violations| publisher=Cato Institute| date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SWAT teams and military-style raid tactics====
Peter Kraska, a criminal justice professor at [[Eastern Kentucky University]], found that the prevalence of SWAT teams, among police agencies serving populations of at least 50,000 people, doubled from the mid-1980s to the late-1990s, rising to 89% of police agencies by the end of this time period. Among smaller police agencies (covering areas  with between 25,000 and 50,000 people), the proportion with SWAT teams rose from 20% in the mid-198-s to 80% in the mid-2000s. Kraska states that: "When people refer to the militarization of police, it's not in a pejorative or judgmental sense.Contemporary police agencies have moved significantly along a continuum culturally, materially, operationally, while using a [[Navy SEALs]] model. All of those are clear indications that they're moving away from a civilian model of policing."&lt;ref name="Sanburn"&gt;Josh Sanburn, [http://time.com/2907307/aclu-swat-local-police/ This Is Why Your Local Police Department Might Have a Tank], ''Time'' (June 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 ACLU report, ''War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing'', concluded that "American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized..."&lt;ref name="WarComesHome"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf| title=War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union| date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report examined 818 uses of SWAT teams by more than 20 law enforcement agencies in 11 U.S. states from the period of July 2010 to October 2013.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"&gt;Ed Pilkington, [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/24/military-us-police-swat-teams-raids-aclu US police departments are increasingly militarised, finds report], ''The Guardian'' (June 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Military-style tactics used by such teams include nighttime raids, use of [[battering ram]]s, use of [[flashbang]]s, overwhelming displays of force, and the wearing of helmets and masks.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-americas-police-have-become-too-militarised-cops-or-soldiers Paramilitary police: Cops or soldiers? America's police have become too militarised], ''The Economist'' (March 14, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of SWAT teams became especially common for [[Drug crime|drug]] searches.

==Types of teams and weapons==

===SWAT teams===
[[File:Falls SWAT team member.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A member of the Wichita Falls SWAT team conducts a rifle drill.]]
{{main|SWAT}}
[[SWAT]] (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams are law enforcement units in the United States that use specialized or military equipment and tactics. First created in the 1960s for [[riot control]] or violent confrontations with [[crime|criminals]], the number and usage of SWAT teams increased in the 1980s and 1990s during the [[War on Drugs]], and in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In the United States today, SWAT teams are deployed 50,000-80,000 times every year, 80% of the time in order to serve search warrants, most often for narcotics. SWAT teams are increasingly equipped with military-type hardware and are trained to deploy against threats of [[terrorism]], for [[crowd control]], and in situations beyond the capabilities of ordinary law enforcement, sometimes deemed "high-risk." Other countries have developed their own [[paramilitary]] police units (PPU)s that are also described as or compared to SWAT police forces. SWAT units are often equipped with specialized firearms including [[submachine gun]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, [[breaching round|breaching shotguns]], [[sniper rifle]]s, [[riot control agent]]s, and stun grenades. They have specialized equipment including heavy body armor, ballistic shields, entry tools, armored vehicles, advanced night vision optics, and motion detectors for covertly determining the positions of hostages or hostage takers, inside enclosed structures.

The increased use of SWAT teams is a hallmark of increased police militarization. The Cato Institute's [[Radley Balko]] wrote that during the 1970s, there were about 300 SWAT raids a year and as of 2005 there were 40,000 a year. SWAT teams being used for gambling crackdowns and serving a search warrant are routine in some places, like Fairfax, VA.&lt;ref name = "Balko"&gt;{{cite web|last=Balko|first=Radley|title=Overkill: The Latest Trend in Policing|work=The Washington Post|date=February 5, 2006|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;"There has been a more than 1400% increase in the amount of SWAT deployments between 1980 and 2000, according to estimates...by [[Eastern Kentucky University]] professor Peter Kraska."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-military-restraints-violence-weaponry-missouri |title=Ferguson police: a stark illustration of newly militarised US law enforcement |last1=Swaine |first1=Jon|last2=Holpuch|first2=Amanda |date=August 14, 2014 |work=The Guardian |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balko states that in 2007, "...a Dallas SWAT team raided a Veterans [organization's]... charity poker games. In 2010, a team of heavily armed Orange County, Florida, sheriff's deputies raided several barbershops, holding barbers and customers at gunpoint while they turned the shops inside out. Of the 37 people arrested, 34 were taken in for "barbering without a license."&lt;ref&gt;[http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/catosletter-v11n4.pdf http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/catosletter-v11n4.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Orlando barbershop raids were subsequently challenged in court, and in 2014, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] ruled that it violated "[[Qualified immunity|clearly established]] Fourth Amendment rights" for the government to conduct "a run-of-the-mill administrative inspection as though it is a criminal raid."&lt;ref&gt;Radley Balko, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/09/19/federal-appeals-court-stop-using-swat-style-raids-for-regulatory-inspections/ Federal appeals court: Stop using SWAT-style raids for regulatory inspections], ''Washington Post'' (September 19, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU has stated that "... heavily armed SWAT teams are raiding people's homes in the middle of the night, often just to search for drugs", causing people to "needlessly di[e] during these raids," in which neighborhoods are turned into "warzones".&lt;ref name="aclu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/war-comes-home-excessive-militarization-american-policing|title=War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Snipers===


[[Law enforcement agency|Law enforcement]] [[sniper]]s, commonly called police snipers, and military snipers differ in many ways, including their areas of operation and tactics. A police sharpshooter is part of a police operation and usually takes part in relatively short missions. [[Police]] forces typically deploy such sharpshooters in [[hostage]] scenarios. This differs from a military sniper, who operates as part of a larger army, engaged in warfare. Sometimes as part of a SWAT team, police snipers are deployed alongside negotiators and an assault team trained for [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. As policemen, they are trained to shoot only as a last resort, when there is a direct threat to life; the police sharpshooter has a well-known rule: "Be prepared to take a life to save a life."&lt;ref name="cbssniper"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/25/60II/main267184.shtml |title=The Sniper, SWAT Teams Grow In Number |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=May 4, 2008| date=January 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police snipers typically operate at much shorter ranges than military snipers, generally under {{convert|100|m|yd|0|sp=us}} and sometimes even less than {{convert|50|m|yd|0|sp=us}}. Both types of snipers do make difficult shots under pressure, and often perform one-shot kills.
[[File:Secret Service on White House roof.jpg|thumb|left|A [[U.S. Secret Service]] sniper on the roof of the [[White House]]]]

Police units that are unequipped for tactical operations may rely on a specialized SWAT team, which may have a dedicated sniper. Police snipers placed in vantage points, such as high buildings, can provide security for events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/photos/2007/09/06/2025679.htm |title=Police sniper watches from roof, Sydney |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=May 4, 2008 |date= September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one high-profile incident, Mike Plumb, a SWAT sniper in [[Columbus, Ohio Division of Police|Columbus, Ohio]], prevented a suicide by shooting a revolver out of the individual's hand, leaving him unharmed.&lt;ref name="nasta"&gt;{{cite web|ref = harv|year = 2010|url = http://www.nasta.ws/New_Folder/Tactical%20Edge%20Article.doc|title = The Columbus Ohio Police|publisher = The Columbus Ohio Police|accessdate = May 7, 2010|last = Scanlon|first = James J.|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031206083809/http://www.nasta.ws/New_Folder/Tactical%20Edge%20Article.doc|archivedate = December 6, 2003|df = }} - [https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cold_blooded/badass-sniper-cleanly-shoots-the-gun-out-of-a-crazy-mans-hand-291329.php?autoplay=true News footage of sniper shooting gun out of a persons hand]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USCG TACLET Airborne Use of Force.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Coast Guard [[Law Enforcement Detachments|TACLET]] marksman uses an M107 from a helicopter.]]

The need for specialized training for police sharpshooters was made apparent in 1972 during the [[Munich massacre]] when the German police could not deploy specialized personnel or equipment during the standoff at the airport in the closing phase of the crisis, and consequently all of the [[Israel]]i hostages were killed. While the German army did have snipers in 1972, the use of snipers of the German army in the scenario was impossible due to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]'s explicit prohibition of the use of the military in domestic matters. This lack of police trained snipers was later addressed with the founding of the specialized police counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]], which subsequently became a widely copied model for a police special forces unit.

In September 2015, a San Bernardino Sheriff's Department sniper shot a suspect in a fast-moving car from a helicopter. The suspect leapt from his car and died on the side of the road, but his vehicle continued forward, striking another vehicle and critically injuring three civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/09/18/suspect-injured-in-deputy-involved-shooting-along-215-freeway/| title=Suspect Dies After Deputy Opens Fire From Helicopter Along 215 Freeway| publisher=CBS Los Angeles| date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest policing===
[[Image:Mótmæli vörubílstjóra 1.jpg|thumb|Rank of [[Icelandic National Police]] officers in full riot gear during the [[2008 Icelandic lorry driver protests]]]]
Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of [[protest]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; [[Riot police]] are [[police]] who are organized, deployed, trained or equipped to confront [[crowd]]s, [[protests]] or [[riot]]s. Riot police may be regular police who act in the role of riot police in particular situations or they may be separate units organized within or in parallel to regular police forces. Riot police are used in a variety of different situations and for a variety of different purposes. They may be employed to [[riot control|control riots]] as their name suggests, to disperse or [[crowd control|control crowds]], to maintain [[public order]] or discourage [[criminal]]ity, or to protect people or property. In some cases, riot police may function as a tool of [[political repression]] by violently breaking up protests and suppressing [[dissent]] or [[civil disobedience]].
[[File:WTO protests in Seattle November 30 1999.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A riot policeman sprays [[pepper spray]] at seated protesters during the [[Battle for Seattle|WTO protests in Seattle in 1999.]]]]
Riot police often use special equipment termed [[riot gear]] to help protect themselves and attack protesters or rioters. Riot gear typically includes [[personal armor]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], [[riot shields]] and [[riot helmet]]s. Many riot police teams also deploy specialized [[less-than-lethal]] weapons, such as [[pepper spray]], [[tear gas]], rifles that fire [[rubber bullets]] or [[plastic bullet]]s, [[flashbang grenade]]s, and [[Long Range Acoustic Device]]s (sound cannons).

The police tactics used during the 2001 [[Quebec City protest]] serve as an example of the approaches used by North American riot police. During the protest, riot police fired [[tear gas]] canisters, [[water cannon]], and [[rubber bullets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|authorlink=David Graeber|title=Direct Action: An Ethnography|publisher=[[AK Press]]|year=2009|page=185|ISBN=978-190485979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; dispersing large groupings of protesters both violent and peaceful, including teach-ins and teams of medics providing first aid to other protesters.

Some U.S. SWAT teams have adopted the [[AR-15]] carbine. Some U.S. police departments are using the [[M4 carbine]], which will replace the M16 as the main U.S. Army combat [[assault rifle]]. "After the [[North Hollywood shootout]] in 1997, the Department of Defense gave 600 surplus [[M16 rifle|M16]] [[assault rifle]]s to LAPD, which were issued to each patrol sergeant. Various U.S. SWAT teams are armed with the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]], a [[submachine gun]].

U.S. law enforcement agencies such as the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD), and the [[Pittsburgh Bureau of Police]] (PBP) use the [[Barrett M82]]. Police use the M82 to breach barriers, because the large-calibre [[.50 BMG]] round it fires will penetrate most commercial brick walls and [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete blocks]]. It is an [[anti-materiel rifle]] designated as a Special Application Sniper Rifle and designed for use against military equipment (materiel), rather than against other [[combatant]]s ("[[Anti-personnel weapon|anti-personnel]]"). It is used by many armies around the world both in regular forces and in special forces units. As it uses a .50 BMG round, this has led to some debates in the U.S. armed forces about the legality of using such a large anti-materiel rifle round against a human. There have been persistent reports that some U.S. military personnel believe that the use of .50 BMG in a direct antipersonnel role is prohibited by the [[Laww of war|laws of war]]. However, Maj. Hays Parks states that "No treaty language exists (either generally or specifically) to support a limitation on [the use of .50 BMG] against personnel, and its widespread, longstanding use in this role suggests that such antipersonnel employment is the customary practice of nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/killing-myth |title=Killing A Myth |last1=Parks |first1=Maj W.

==In popular culture==

The 2015 video game ''[[Battlefield Hardline]]'' depicts a militarized police, and it depicts both police and criminals wielding military equipment including rifles, machine guns and grenade launchers. The developer's insistence on "fantasy" while meticulously recreating LA areas and loosely basing crimes in the game on real-life crimes has subsequently been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/03/battlefield-hardline-reviewcop-out.html|title=Battlefield Hardline Review: Cop Out|work=Paste}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/soldier-cops-are-giving-games-like-battlefield-an-image-1620511782|title=Soldier Cops Aren't So Fun Now, Video Games|author=Luke Plunkett|work=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tmi.kotaku.com/why-2014s-battlefield-is-just-avoiding-uncomfortable-to-1593412680|title=Why 2014's Battlefield Is 'Just Avoiding' Uncomfortable Topics|author=Nathan Grayson|work=TMI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''Do Not Resist'' by Craig Atkinson is also critical of the phenomenon of police militarization, as exemplified by law enforcement training courses taught by retired military officer [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]], who tells police officers, "You are men and women of violence."

'''''Muditā''''' ([[Pāli]] and [[Sanskrit]]: मुदिता) means [[joy]]; especially sympathetic or vicarious joy.

Also: the pleasure that comes from delighting in other people's well-being.&lt;ref name="salzberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzberg|first=Sharon|authorlink=Sharon Salzberg|year=1995|title=Loving-Kindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness|page=119|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|ISBN=9781570629037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional paradigmatic example of this mind-state is the attitude of a parent observing a growing child's accomplishments and successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=U Pandita|first=Sayadaw|authorlink=U Pandita|title=The State of Mind Called Beautiful|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|year=2006|page=51|ISBN=9780861713455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mudita should not be confused with pride, as a person feeling mudita may not have any interest or direct income from the accomplishments of the other. Mudita is a pure joy unadulterated by self-interest.

When we can be happy of the joys other beings feel, it is called mudita; the opposite word is [[invidia]].

==Application==
Mudita meditation is used to cultivate '''appreciative joy''' at the success and good fortune of others.

Buddhist teachers interpret mudita more broadly as an inner spring of infinite joy that is available to everyone at all times, regardless of circumstances.
"''The more deeply one drinks of this spring,'' 
''the more securely one becomes in one's own abundant happiness,'' 
''the more bountiful it becomes to relish the joy of other people.''"{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Joy is also traditionally regarded as the most difficult to cultivate of the [[brahmavihara|four immeasurables]] (''[[brahmavihara|brahmavihārā]]'': also "four sublime attitudes"). To show joy is to celebrate happiness and achievement in others even when we are facing tragedy ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/harris/bl134.html Elizabeth J. Harris, ''A Journey into Buddhism''] Source for Free Distribution with permission from Access to Insight and the Buddhist Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Buddhist teacher [[Ayya Khema]] showing joy towards sadistic pleasure is wrong. Here there should instead be compassion (''[[karuṇā]]'').

The "far enemies" of joy are [[jealousy]] ([[envy]]) and [[greed]], mind-states in obvious opposition. Joy's "near enemy," the quality which superficially resembles joy but is in fact more subtly in opposition to it, is [[exhilaration]], described as a grasping at pleasant experience out of a sense of insufficiency or lack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/PathofPurification2011.pdf Buddhagosha, 'Vishudimagga'] Section 2.100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/dhamma-lists/|title=Dhamma Lists: Insight Meditation Center|author=|date=|website=Insight Meditation Center|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Equality Standard''' ('''NES''') is an initiative created by [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]]. It was developed for business, by business and sets clear [[Equality, Diversity and Inclusion]] (EDI) criteria against which companies are assessed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Home/National-Equality-Standard|title= The National Equality Standard official website|format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The NES has been developed and sponsored by [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]], supported by the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC), the [[Home Office]] and the [[Confederation of British Industry]] and developed in partnership with the following UK and global companies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehrdirector.com/business-news/diversity_and_equality/untitled-resource/|title= The HR Director magazine |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NES was launched in May 2013 at the [[British Museum]] and since then many businesses have signed up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2c14e85e-c13c-11e2-9767-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2ftK5A0gr|title = The Financial Times|format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Standard has received significant media attention and news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Home/National-Equality-Standard---Media-Coverage |title=Media coverage from the NES website|format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== People ==
Arun Batra is the CEO and founder of the NES. Prior to his position at [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]] he ran the Mayor's 'Diversity Works' programme in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.obv.org.uk/news-blogs/arun-batra-mission-deliver-equality|title= Operate Black Vote|format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has recently been recognised as one of Britain’s most influential Asians for leading the establishment of the NES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.top-consultant.com/UK/Ernst-Young-pens-national-equality-standard-9008.html|title= Top Consultant Magazine |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arun is supported by Harry Gaskell, the managing partner of [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]]s UK &amp; Ireland advisory Practice and Head of D&amp;I, and the Chair of the Employers Network for Equality &amp; Inclusion (enei).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.recruiter.co.uk/news/2012/07/ey-leads-launch-for-national-equality-standard-for-britain/#sthash.VlS0iTMw.dpuf|title= The Recruiter Magazine |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[David Bell (publisher)|Sir David Bell]] has been appointed as the Non-executive Chair of the steering committee that drives the development of the NES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.top-consultant.com/UK/Ernst-Young-pens-national-equality-standard-9008.html|title= Top Consultant Magazine |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The National Equality Standard Assessment ==
Through the NES, companies are subjected to a robust EDI assessment which has been devised by the NES Board and [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2c14e85e-c13c-11e2-9767-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2ftK5A0gr|title= The Financial Times |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NES Assessment provides companies with a comprehensive quality review of their EDI policies and practices, identifies areas for improvement and provides implementation recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Home/National-Equality-Standard|title= The National Equality Standard official website |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each company that undertakes the NES undergoes a robust assessment against a defined set of criteria across 7 standards. Trained NES Assessors review documentation, ensure legal compliance, conduct comprehensive interviews and sample staff through in-depth surveys. The outcome is detailed in a comprehensive report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehrdirector.com/business-news/diversity_and_equality/untitled-resource|title= The HR Director |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Objectives ==
The objectives of the NES are to provide an assessment tool which:
*Aims to significantly impact the way diversity and inclusion is integrated into everyday business activity across the country
*Provides a single reference point incorporating all elements of the [[Equality Act 2010]]
*Enables businesses to undertake a comprehensive assessment specifically focused on EDI
*Consists of best practice standards that can be applied to any business sector or size
*Provides a pragmatic solution to EDI which rewards ambition
*Supports the private sector by providing one recognisable holistic framework for industry good practice
*Enables companies to showcase their businesses as leaders in this field
*Bridges the gap between legal requirements and best practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edf.org.uk/blog/?p=26602|title= EDF Energy Website |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feedback ==
The feedback from those undertaking assessments has been positive; Tina Southall, Director, Diversity and Inclusion at [[Vodafone]] Group Services described the assessment process in an interview:
:“The assessment process was excellent. It really captured both the macro status but also important details. It consisted of an in-depth review of materials and a very professional and well structured audit. It provided thought provoking insights combined with pragmatic and actionable recommendations. The Standard has potential to drive a real change in Equality Standards.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Home/National-Equality-Standard---Testimonials|title= Testimonials from the National Equality Standard Website |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''net.flag''''' is a work of [[internet art]] created in 2002 by [[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://softwareandart.com/?p=595 Artist Bio and work description]&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with ''[[Unfolding Object]]'' by [[John Simon (artist)|John Simon]], it was commissioned by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://netflag.guggenheim.org/netflag net.flag on the Guggenheim website]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]], and was among the first works of [[internet art]] to enter the permanent collection of a major museum.

''net.flag'' is an [[interactive]] work hosted on the Guggenheim museum's [[website]].  The site contains images of all the national [[flag]]s of the world.  Each flag is broken into its respective components, that are categorized according to several broadly descriptive terms. Users may pick and choose from a menu of these components to form a new flag, which they may then save to the site.  In addition, the project features a browsable history, through which users may look over past creations that have been titled and saved by the previous participants.

''net.flag'' creates a virtual territory. A limited [[language]] of visual [[symbols]] and the actions of thousands of visitors create an ongoing micro-drama about ownership, territory, control and [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]] in a post-national world.

Napier has described ''net.flag'' as "an emblem for the Internet as a new territory," &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/8920401/Permanence-Through-Change-The-Variable-Media-Approach Article by Jon Ippolito, ''Mark Napier net.flag,'' 2002] printed in ''Permanence Through Change: The Variable Media Approach'', p.108-114 © 2003 The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, and The Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science, and Technology, Montreal. All rights reserved. {{ISBN|0-9684693-2-9}} Published by Guggenheim Museum Publications 1071 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10128&lt;/ref&gt; and is inspired in part by "Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong", the franchise nation depicted in [[Snow Crash]] by [[Neal Stephenson]].  In Stephenson's world geographical borders are re-mapped into [[Mobile computing|mobile]], [[modular]] elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7537">In [[film theory]], the term '''oneiric''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|n|aɪ|r|ɪ|k}}; "pertaining to [[dream]]s") refers to the depiction of dream-like states or to the use of the metaphor of a dream or the dream-state in the analysis of a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bacher|first1=Hans P|title=Film Analysis|journal=Dream Worlds|date=1 January 2008|pages=12–27|doi=10.1016/b978-0-240-52093-3.50005-7|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-240-52093-3.50005-7|publisher=Focal Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparshott|first1=F.E.|title=Vision and Dream in the Cinema|journal=Philosophic Exchange: Annual Proceedings|date=1971|volume=1|page=116|url=http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/phil_ex/vol2/iss1/13/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eber/&gt;{{rp|3-4}}

==History==
Early film theorists such as [[Ricciotto Canudo]] (1879–1923) and [[Jean Epstein]] (1897–1953) argued that films had a dreamlike quality. [[Raymond Bellour]] and [[Guy Rosolato]] have made psychoanalytical analogies between films and the dream state, claiming films as having a "latent" content that can be [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyzed]] as if it were a dream. {{ill|Lydia Marinelli|de}} states that before the 1930s, psychoanalysts "primarily attempted to apply the interpretative schemata found in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[Interpretation of Dreams]]'' to films."{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Author Douglas Fowler surmises that "images arising from dreams are the well spring of all our efforts to give enduring form and meaning to the urgencies within," seeing this as the reason why "the deep structure of human narrative is conceived in dreams and the genesis of all myth is dreams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Douglas|title=The Kingdom of Dreams in Literature and Film: Selected Papers from the Tenth Annual Florida State University Conference on Literature and Film|date=1986|publisher=University Presses of Florida|location=Tallahassee|isbn=0813008638|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Robert Eberwein describes the filmic experience as the merging of a viewer's consciousness with the projected consciousness of the screen's subject, a process whereby the viewer's prior experiences with dreaming "help to create a sense of oneness" with cinema, causing the gap between viewer and what is being viewed to narrow.&lt;ref name=eber&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eberwein|first1=Robert T.|title=Film &amp; the Dream Screen: A Sleep and a Forgetting|date=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/33536|isbn=0691066191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} Under this theory, no matter what is being shown on the screen — whether the literal representation of a character dreaming, or the fictional characters of a story going on about their fictional lives — the very process of viewing film itself "replicates activities associated with the oneiric experience."&lt;ref name=eber/&gt;{{rp|81-82}}

Films and dreams are also connected in psychological analysis by examining the relationship between the cinema screening process and the spectator (who is perceived as passive). [[Roland Barthes]], a French literary critic and [[Semiotics|semiotician]], described film spectators as being in a "para-oneiric" state, feeling "sleepy and drowsy as if they had just woken up" when a film ends. Similarly, the French [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[André Breton]] argues that film viewers enter a state between being "awake and falling asleep", what French filmmaker [[René Clair]] called a "dreamlike state". [[Edgar Morin]]'s ''Le cinéma ou l'homme imaginaire'' (1956) and [[Jean Mitry]]'s first volume of ''Esthétique et psychologie du cinéma'' (1963) also discuss the connection between films and the dream state.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Filmmakers==
Filmmakers described as using oneiric or dreamlike elements in their films include [[Sergei Parajanov]] (e.g., ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]''), [[David Lynch]] (e.g., ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lentzner|first1=Jay R.|last2=Ross|first2=Donald R.|title=The Dreams That Blister Sleep: Latent Content and Cinematic Form in Mulholland Drive|journal=American Imago|date=26 April 2005|volume=62|issue=1|pages=120|doi=10.1353/aim.2005.0016|url=https://doi.org/10.1353/aim.2005.0016|issn=1085-7931}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] (e.g. ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' and ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petric|first1=Vlada|title=Tarkovsky's Dream Imagery|journal=Film Quarterly|date=December 1989|volume=43|issue=2|pages=28–34|doi=10.1525/fq.1989.43.2.04a00040|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1525/fq.1989.43.2.04a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Brakhage]] (e.g., ''[[Dog Star Man]]''), [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] (e.g. ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]''), [[Jaromil Jireš]] (e.g., ''[[Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (film)|Valerie and Her Week of Wonders]]''), [[Krzysztof Kieslowski]] (e.g. ''[[The Double Life of Veronique]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santilli|first1=Paul C.|title=Cinema and Subjectivity in Krzysztof Kieslowski|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=December 2006|volume=64|issue=1|pages=147–156|doi=10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00236.x|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00236.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federico Fellini]] (e.g., ''[[Amarcord]]''), [[Ingmar Bergman]] (e.g., ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''), [[Jean Cocteau]] (e.g., ''[[Orphic Trilogy]]''), [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]] (e.g., ''[[City of Pirates]]''), [[Edgar G.

'''Party discipline''' is the ability of a [[parliamentary group]] of a [[political party]] to get its members to support the policies of their party leadership. In [[liberal democracies]], it usually refers to the control that party leaders have over their [[caucus]] members in the [[legislature]]. Party discipline is important for all systems of [[government]] that allow parties to hold [[political power]] because it determines the degree to which the governmental infrastructure will be affected by legitimate political processes.

Breaking party discipline in parliamentary votes can result in a number of penalties such as not being promoted to a cabinet position, and losing other perks of elected office like travel. Disagreement with the party caucus may be so strong that they leave the party to join another parliamentary caucus or become an independent, which is known as [[crossing the floor]]. With party discipline, there is an unwritten rule that pressures parliamentarians to compromise their beliefs if they conflict with the decisions made by the rest of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestlibrary.org/ss11/2007/02/the_pros_and_co.html|title=The pros and cons of party discipline|last=Guay|first=Monique|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many political systems, a member of each party is officially designated or elected as a "[[whip (politics)|whip]]", whose role it is to enforce party discipline.

The term has a somewhat different meaning in [[Marxist–Leninist]] political systems such as the [[People's Republic of China]].  In this case it refers to administrative sanctions such as fines or expulsion that the Communist Party can impose on its members for actions such as corruption or disagreeing with the party.

Other examples of even stronger party discipline include the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] and the [[French Communist Party]].

Party discipline tends to be strong in countries using the Westminster system, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[India]], in which a vote by the legislature against the government is understood, by convention, to cause the government to "collapse". Thus, it is rare for members to vote against the wishes of their party. Party leaders in such governments often have the authority to expel members of the party who violate the party line.

In countries such as New Zealand, which use the [[mixed member proportionality]] system of voting, party discipline tends to be high. That is especially true for list MPs, who do not represent an electorate. If they do not vote the party line, they risk losing their seat.

==Weak party discipline==
Weak party discipline is usually more frequent in parties of [[notables]] and [[Elite party|elite parties]] than in [[populism|populist]] parties. The centrist [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] and the right-wing parties during the [[French Third Republic]] (1871–1940) all had no party discipline.

In the [[United States]], the modern [[US Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and [[US Republican Party|Republican Party]] both have weak party discipline, but that varies somewhat between states. That is aptly illustrated by the vote on the federal [[Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act]], in which the only senator to vote against overriding President [[Barack Obama]]'s veto was the retiring Democratic minority leader [[Harry Reid]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7121">In [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] '''''the passions''''' are the instinctive, emotional, primitive drives in a human being (including, for example, lust, anger, aggression and jealousy) which a human being must restrain, channel, develop and [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimate]] in order to be possessed of wisdom. Passions in religion and philosophy have a different connotation from the popular concept of passion which is generally seen as a positive emotion. The philosophical notion of passion, in contrast, is identified with innate or biologically driven [[emotion]]al states regarded in ancient philosophies and the great religions as being the basis for [[seven deadly sins|deadly sins]] and seen as leading to various social and spiritual ills such as unstable relationships, broken marriages, lack of social integration, psychological disorders and other problems. In the philosophical tradition of [[Western culture|the west]] passion is often placed in opposition to [[reason]]. Reason is advocated in the control of passion, something seen as desirable and necessary for the development of a mature, civilized human being. This is achieved by the cultivation of virtue. [[Cardinal virtues|Four virtues]] in particular have long been seen as of especial value in this regard.

The majority of philosophies and religions advocate at the very least tempering the passions to keep them within acceptable bounds. However most of the great religions recommend both the restraint and the transformation of the passions to the point where they no longer arise. This is true of Christianity, Jainism, Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. The institution of the [[monastery]] within various religions is a means by which human beings may temporarily or permanently seclude themselves from circumstances exacerbating the arising of passion and provide a supportive environment for doing spiritual work.

Contemporary philosopher [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] has developed a view of the passions that disassociates them from human nature, and instead gives them a formless life that serve in our noninstrumental dealings with each other. Rather than the guiding force behind our relations with the world, they organize and are organized around the need and danger that is at the heart of our relations with each other. In this way, Unger rejects the traditional view of the passions as something counter to reason and which are associated with certain expressions, rather he sees them at the service of reason and their expression formed within certain contexts.&lt;ref name="Unger 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The subject of the passions has long been a consideration in Western philosophy. According to European philosopher Michel Meyer, they have aroused harsh judgments as the representation of a force of excess and lawlessness in humanity that produces troubling, confusing paradoxes. Meyer sees philosophers as having treated the passions as a given expression of human nature, leaving the question of whether the passions "torture people because it blinds them, or, on the contrary, does it permit them to apprehend who and what we really are?"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Meyer, ''Philosophy and the Passions'', a translation of ''Le Philosophe et les passions'' *(Livre de poche), Penn State Press, 2000. Preface, introduction and translation by Robert F. Barsky, [http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-02031-8.html website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinoza==
The seventeenth century Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] contrasted "action" with "passion," as well as the state of being "[[Action (philosophy)|active]]" with the state of being "passive." A passion, in his view, happened when external events affect us partially such that we have confused ideas about these events and their causes. A "passive" state is when we experience an emotion which Spinoza regarded as a "passivity of the soul."&lt;ref name=tws09dec4333/&gt; The body's power is increased or diminished. Emotions are bodily changes plus ideas about these changes which can help or hurt a human.&lt;ref name=tws09dec4333&gt;{{cite news

|title = DEFINITIONS. ON THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS
|quote = By emotion I mean the modifications of the body, whereby the active power of the said body is increased or diminished, aided or constrained, and also the ideas of such modifications. N.B.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It happens when the bodily changes we experience are caused primarily by external forces or by a mix of external and internal forces. Spinoza argued that it was much better for the individual himself to be the only adequate cause of bodily changes, and to act based on an adequate understanding of causes-and-effects with ideas of these changes logically related to each other and to reality. When this happened the person is "active," and Spinoza described the ideas as adequate. But most of the time, this does not happen, and Spinoza, along with [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], saw emotions as more powerful than [[Rationalism|reason]]. Spinoza tried to live the life of reason which he advocated.&lt;ref name=tws9911&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12954">The '''Plastic Principle''' is an idea introduced into Western thought by the English philosopher [[Ralph Cudworth]] (1617–1689) to explain the function of nature and life in the face of both the mechanism and materialism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It is a dynamic functional power that contains all of natural law, and is both sustentative and generative, organizing matter according to Platonic Ideas, that is, archetypes that lie beyond the physical realm coming from the Mind of God or Deity, the ground of Being.

== Background ==

The role of nature was one faced by philosophers in the Age of Reason or Enlightenment. The prevailing view was either that of the Church of a personal deity intervening in his creation, producing miracles, or an ancient pantheism (atheism relative to theism) – deity pervading all things and existing in all things. However, the "ideas of an all-embracing providential care of the world and of one universal vital force capable of organizing the world from within."&lt;ref name=Giglioni&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giglioni|first=Guido|title=The cosmoplastic system of the universe: Ralph Cudworth on Stoic naturalism|journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences|year=2008/2|volume=Tome 61|pages=313–331|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-revue-d-histoire-des-sciences-2008-2-page-313.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  presented difficulties for philosophers of a spiritual as well as materialistic bent.

== Cambridge Platonists ==
The Cartesian idea of nature as mechanical, and Hobbes' materialistic views were countered by the English philosopher, Ralph Cudworth (1617–1689), who, in his ''True intellectual system of the universe'' (1678), addressing the tension between theism and atheism, took both the Stoic idea of Divine Reason poured into the world, and the Platonic idea of the world soul (''anima mundi'') to posit a power that was polaric – "either as a ruling but separate mind or as an informing vital principle – either nous hypercosmios or nous enkosmios.&lt;ref name=Giglioni /&gt;

Cudworth was a member of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], a group of English seventeenth-century thinkers associated with the University of Cambridge who were stimulated by Plato's teachings but also were aware or and influenced by Descartes, Hobbes, Bacon, Boyle and Spinoza. The other important philosopher of this group was Henry More (1614–1687). More held that spiritual substance or mind controlled inert matter. Out of his correspondence with Descartes, he developed the idea that everything, whether material or non, had extension, an example of the latter being space, which is infinite (Newton) and which then is correlative to the idea of God (set out in his Enchiridion metaphysicum 1667). In developing this idea, More also introduced a causal agent between God and substance, or Nature in his Hylarchic Principle, derived from Plato's ''anima mundi'' or world soul, and the Stoic's pneuma, which encapsulates the laws of nature, both for inert and vital nature, and involves a sympathetic resonance between soul (''psyche'') and ''soma''.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanford U. Encyc. of Philosophy|title=The Cambridge Platonists|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cambridge-platonists/|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cudworth's idea of 'the Plastick Life of Nature' ==

Like More, Cudworth put forward the idea of 'the Plastick Life of Nature', a formative principle that contains both substance and the laws of motion, as well as a nisus or direction that accounts for design and goal in the natural world. He was stimulated by the Cartesian idea of the mind as self-consciousness to see God as consciousness. He first analysed four forms of atheism from ancient times to present, and showed that all misunderstood the principle of life and knowledge, which involved unsentient activity and self-consciousness.

:It is in connection with the refutation of hylozoic atheism that he brings forward the celebrated hypothesis, which he held in common with More, of a plastic nature,—a substance intermediate between matter and spirit,—a power which prosecutes certain ends but not freely or intelligently,—an instrument by which laws are able to act without the immediate agency of God...&lt;ref name="1902 Encyc."&gt;{{cite web|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1902|title=Ralph Cudworth|url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/C/CUD/ralph-cudworth.html|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All of the atheistic approaches posted nature as unconscious, which for Cudworth was ontologically unsupportable, as a principle that was supposed to be the ultimate source of life and meaning could only be itself self-conscious and knowledgeable, that is, rational, otherwise creation or nature degenerates into inert matter set in motion by random external forces (Coleridge's 'chance whirlings of unproductive particles'). Cudworth saw nature as a vegetative power endowed with plastic (forming) and spermatic (generative) forces, but one with Mind, or a self-conscious knowledge. This idea would later emerge in the Romantic period in German science as [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach's ''Bildungstreib'']] (generative power) and the ''Lebenskraft'' (or ''Bildungskraft'').

:...the life of the universe splits into two principles&amp;nbsp;– the one transcendent and intellectual (« an animalish, sentient and intellectual nature, or a conscious soul and mind, that presided over the whole world »), the other immanent and devoid of perception (« a certain plastic nature, or spermatic principle which was properly the fate of all things »)&lt;ref name=Giglioni /&gt;

The essence of atheism for Cudworth was the view that matter was self-active and self-sufficient, whereas for Cudworth the plastic power was unsentient and under the direct control of the universal Mind or ''Logos''. For him atheism, whether mechanical or material could not solve the "phenomenon of nature." Henry More argued that atheism made each substance independent and self-acting such that it 'deified' matter. Cudworth argued that materialism/mechanism reduced "substance to a corporeal entity, its activity to causal determinism, and each single thing to fleeting appearances in a system dominated by material necessity."&lt;ref name=Giglioni /&gt;

Cudworth had the idea of a general plastic nature of the world, containing natural laws to keep all of nature, inert and vital in orderly motion, and particular plastic natures in particular entities, which serve as 'Inward Principles' of growth and motion, but ascribes it to the Platonic tradition:
:The Platonists seem to affirm both these together, namely that there is a Plastick Nature lodged in all particular Souls of Animals, Brutes, and Men, and also that there is a Plastick or Spermatick Principle of the whole Universe distinct from the Higher Mundane Soul, though subordinate to it.(Cudworth, TIS, p. 165)&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Justin E. H.|title=The Leibnizian Organism Between Cudworth's Plastic Natures and Locke's Thinking Matter|url=http://www.bib.umontreal.ca/colloqueNE/textes_des_communications/Smith.pdf|publisher=Concordia University, Montreal|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further, Cudsworth's plastic principle was also a functional polarity. As he wrote:
:The Seminary Reason or Plastick Nature of the Universe opposing the Parts to one another and making them severally Indigent, produces by that means War and Contention. And therefore though it be One, yet notwithstanding it consists of Different and Contrary things. For there being Hostility in its Parts, it is nevertheless Friendly and Agreeable in the Whole; after the same manner as in a Dramatick Poem, Clashings and Contentions are reconciled into one Harmony. And therefore the Seminary or Plastick Nature of the World, may fitly be resembled to the Harmony of Disagreeing things.&lt;ref name=Raiger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raiger|first=Michael|title=The Intellectual Breeze, the Corporeality of Thought, and the Eolian Harp|journal=Coleridge Bulletin|date=Winter 2002|series=New Series|issue=20|pages=76–84|url=http://www.friendsofcoleridge.com/MembersOnly/CB20Raiger.htm|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another historian notes in conclusion, "Cudworth’s theory of plastic natures is offered as an alternative to the interpretation of all of nature as either governed by blind chance, or, on his understanding of the Malebranchean view, as micro-managed by God."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

== Plastic Principle and mind ==
Cudworth's plastic principle also involves a theory of mind that is active, that is, God or the Supreme Mind is "the spermatic reason" which gives rise to individual mind and reason. Human mind can also create, and has access to spiritual or super-sensible 'Ideas' in the Platonic sense.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; Cudworth challenged Hobbesian determinism in arguing that will is not distinct from reason, but a power to act that is internal, and therefore, the voluntary will function involves self-determination, not external compulsion, though we have the power to act either in accordance with God's will or not. Cudworth's 'hegemonikon' (taken from Stoicism) is a function within the soul that combines the higher functions of the soul (voluntary will and reason) on the one hand with the lower animal functions (instinct), and also constitutes the whole person, thus bridging the Cartesian dualism of body and soul or ''psyche'' and ''soma''. This idea provided the basis for a concept of self-awareness and identity of an individual that is self-directed and autonomous, an idea that anticipates John Locke.

== Influence on Locke ==
Locke examined how man came to knowledge via stimulus (rather than seeing ideas as inherent), which approach led to his idea of the 'thinking' mind, which is both receptive and pro-active. The first involves receiving sensations ('simple ideas') and the second by reflection – "observation of its own inner operations" (inner sense which leads to complex ideas), with the second activity acting upon the first. Thought is set in motion by outer stimuli which 'simple ideas' are taken up by the mind's self-activity, an "active power" such that the outer world can only be real-ized as action (natural cause) by the activity of consciousness. Locke also took the issue of life as lying not in substance but in the capacity of the self for consciousness, to be able to organize (associate) disparate events, that is to participate life by means of the [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s, which have the capacity to produce every kind of experience in consciousness. These ideas of Locke were taken over by Fichte and influenced German Romantic science and medicine. (See [[Romantic medicine]] and [[Brunonian system of medicine]]).
[[Thomas Reid]] and his "Common Sense" philosophy, was also influenced by Cudworth, taking his influence into the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

Berkeley later developed the idea of a plastic life principle with his idea of an 'aether' or 'aetherial medium' that causes 'vibrations' that animate all living beings. For Berkeley, it is the very nature of this medium that generates the 'attractions' of entities to each other.

:The refraction of light is also thought to proceed from the different density and elastic force of this æthereal medium in different places. The vibrations of this medium, alternately concurring with or obstructing the motions of the rays of light, are supposed to produce the fits of easy reflection and transmission. Light by the vibrations of this medium is thought to communicate heat to bodies. Animal motion and sensation are also accounted for by the vibrating motions of this æthereal medium, propagated through the solid capillaments of the nerves. In a word, all the phenomena and properties of bodies that were before attributed to attraction, upon later thoughts seem ascribed to this æther, together with the various attractions themselves. (Berkeley V 107–8)&lt;ref name="Raiger"/&gt;

Berkeley meant this 'aether' to supplant Newton's gravity as the cause of motion (neither seeing the polarity involved between two forces, as Cudworth had in his plastic principle). However, in Berkeley's conception, aether is both the movement of spirit and the motion of nature.

Both Cudworth's views and those of Berkeley were taken up by Coleridge in his metaphor of the eolian harp in his 'Effusion XXXV' as one commentator noted: "what we see in the first manuscript is the articulation of Cudworth’s principle of plastic nature, which is then transformed in the published version into a Berkeleyan expression of the causal agency of motion performed by God’s immanent activity."&lt;ref name="Raiger"/&gt;

Cudworth's idea of the plastic principle and that of mind will also be taken up in a new way in the idea of [[emergent evolution]].

A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin
 |title=The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9525">In [[mathematics]], a '''Priestley space''' is an [[partial order|ordered]] [[topological space]] with special properties. Priestley spaces are named after [[Hilary Priestley]] who introduced and investigated them.&lt;ref&gt;
Priestley, (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley spaces play a fundamental role in the study of [[distributive lattice]]s. In particular, there is a [[duality theory for distributive lattices|duality]] ("'''Priestley duality'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Order (journal)|Order]] | date=September 1991 | volume=8 | number=3 | pages=299–315 | title=Remarks on Priestley duality for distributive lattices | first1=R. | last1=Cignoli | first2=S. | last2=Lafalce | first3=A. | last3=Petrovich | doi=10.1007/BF00383451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) between the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of Priestley spaces and the category of bounded distributive lattices.&lt;ref&gt;
Cornish, (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A ''Priestley space'' is an ''ordered topological space'' {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, i. e. a set {{math|''X''}} equipped with a [[partial order]] {{math|&amp;le;}} and a [[topological space#Definition|topology]] {{math|''&amp;tau;''}}, satisfying 
the following two conditions:

# {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} is [[Compact space|compact]].
# If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a [[clopen set|clopen]] [[up-set]] {{math|''U''}} of {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt;''U''}} and {{math|''y''&amp;notin; ''U''}}. (This condition is known as the ''Priestley separation axiom''.)

==Properties of Priestley spaces==
* Each Priestley space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. Indeed, given two points {{math|''x'',''y''}} of a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, if {{math|''x''&amp;ne; ''y''}}, then as {{math|&amp;le;}} is a partial order, either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y\,\not\le\, x&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming, without loss of generality, that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt;, (ii) provides a clopen up-set {{math|''U''}} of {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''U''}} and {{math|''y''&amp;notin; ''U''}}. Therefore, {{math|''U''}} and {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}} are disjoint open subsets of {{math|''X''}} separating {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.
* Each Priestley space is also [[zero-dimensional]]; that is, each [[open neighborhood]] {{math|''U''}} of a point {{math|''x''}} of a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} contains a clopen neighborhood {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''x''}}. To see this, one proceeds as follows. For each {{math|''y'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}}, either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\,\not\le\, y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y\,\not\le\, x&lt;/math&gt;. By the Priestley separation axiom, there exists a clopen up-set or a clopen [[down-set]] containing {{math|''x''}} and missing {{math|''y''}}. Obviously the intersection of these clopen neighborhoods of {{math|''x''}} does not meet {{math|''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}}. Therefore, as {{math|''X''}} is compact, there exists a finite intersection of these clopen neighborhoods of {{math|''x''}} missing {{math|''X'' &amp;minus; ''U''}}. This finite intersection is the desired clopen neighborhood {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''x''}} contained in {{math|''U''}}.

It follows that for each Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, the topological space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} is a [[Stone space]]; that is, it is a compact Hausdorff zero-dimensional space.

Some further useful properties of Priestley spaces are listed below.

Let {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} be a Priestley space.

::(a) For each closed subset {{math|''F''}} of {{math|''X''}}, both {{math|&amp;uarr; ''F'' {{=}} {''x'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X''&amp;nbsp; :&amp;nbsp; ''y'' &amp;le; ''x'' for some ''y'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''F''} }} and {{math|&amp;darr; ''F'' {{=}} { ''x'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''X'' &amp;nbsp; :&amp;nbsp; ''x'' &amp;le; ''y'' for some ''y'' &lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''F''} }} are closed subsets of {{math|''X''}}.

::(b) Each open up-set of {{math|''X''}} is a union of clopen up-sets of {{math|''X''}} and each open down-set of {{math|''X''}} is a union of clopen down-sets of {{math|''X''}}.

::(c) Each closed up-set of {{math|''X''}} is an intersection of clopen up-sets of {{math|''X''}} and each closed down-set of {{math|''X''}} is an intersection of clopen down-sets of {{math|''X''}}.

::(d) Clopen up-sets and clopen down-sets of {{math|''X''}} form a [[subbasis]] for {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}}.

::(e) For each pair of closed subsets {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''G''}} of {{math|''X''}}, if {{math|&amp;uarr;''F'' &amp;cap; &amp;darr;''G'' {{=}} &amp;empty;}}, then there exists a clopen up-set {{math|''U''}} such that {{math|''F'' &amp;sube; ''U''}} and {{math|''U'' &amp;cap; ''G'' {{=}} &amp;empty;}}.

A '''Priestley morphism''' from a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} to another Priestley space {{math|(''X''&amp;prime;,''&amp;tau;''&amp;prime;,&amp;le;&amp;prime;)}} is a map {{math|f  :  ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X''&amp;prime;}} which is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] and [[order-preserving]].

Let '''Pries''' denote the category of Priestley spaces and Priestley morphisms.

==Connection with spectral spaces==
Priestley spaces are closely related to [[spectral space]]s. For a Priestley space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}, let {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the collection of all open up-sets of {{math|''X''}}. Similarly, let {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the collection of all open down-sets of {{math|''X''}}.

'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, (1975). Bezhanishvili et al. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
If {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space, then both {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;)}} are spectral spaces.

Conversely, given a spectral space {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}}, let {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote the [[patch topology]] on {{math|''X''}}; that is, the topology generated by the subbasis consisting of compact open subsets of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} and their [[Complement (set theory)|complement]]s. Let also {{math|&amp;le;}} denote the [[specialization order]] of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}}.

'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, (1975). Bezhanishvili et al. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
If {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'')}} is a spectral space, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space.

In fact, this correspondence between Priestley spaces and spectral spaces is [[functorial]] and yields an [[isomorphism]] between '''Pries''' and the category '''Spec''' of spectral spaces and [[spectral space|spectral map]]s.

==Connection with bitopological spaces==
Priestley spaces are also closely related to [[bitopological space]]s.

'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Bezhanishvili et al. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
If {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is a [[pairwise Stone space]]. Conversely, if {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a pairwise Stone space, then {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}} is a Priestley space, where {{math|''&amp;tau;''}} is the join of {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&amp;le;}} is the specialization order of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

The correspondence between Priestley spaces and pairwise Stone spaces is functorial and yields an isomorphism between the category '''Pries''' of Priestley spaces and Priestley morphisms and the category '''PStone''' of pairwise Stone spaces and [[bitopological space#Bi-continuity|bi-continuous map]]s.

Thus, one has the following isomorphisms of categories:

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Spec}\cong \mathbf{Pries}\cong \mathbf{PStone}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

One of the main consequences of the [[duality theory for distributive lattices]] is that each of these categories is dually equivalent to the category of bounded [[distributive lattice]]s.

Broadly speaking, '''pure mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] that studies entirely abstract [[concept]]s.  This has been a recognizable category of mathematical activity from the 19th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piaggio|first1=H|title=Three Sadleirian Professors: A.R. Forsyth, E.W. Hobson and G.H. Hardy|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Sadleirian_Professors.html|website=MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=St. Andrews University|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of [[navigation]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], and so on.

Another view is that pure mathematics is ''not necessarily'' [[applied mathematics]]: it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.&lt;ref name=Magid/&gt; Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.

To develop accurate models for describing the real world, many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be "pure" mathematics. On the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research.

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
Ancient Greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics. [[Plato]] helped to create the gap between "arithmetic", now called [[number theory]], and "logistic", now called [[arithmetic]]. Plato regarded logistic (arithmetic) as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who "must learn the art of numbers or [they] will not know how to array [their] troops" and arithmetic (number theory) as appropriate for philosophers "because [they have] to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=The age of Plato and Aristotle|pages=86|quote=Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of war, who "must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops." The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an arithmetician "because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euclid of Alexandria]], when asked by one of his students of what use was the study of geometry, asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria |pages=101 |quote=Evidently Euclid did not stress the practical aspects of his subject, for there is a tale told of him that when one of his students asked of what use was the study of geometry, Euclid asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek mathematician [[Apollonius of Perga]] was asked about the usefulness of some of his theorems in Book IV of ''Conics'' to which he proudly asserted,&lt;ref name="Apollonius"&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Apollonius of Perga|pages=152|quote=It is in connection with the theorems in this book that Apollonius makes a statement implying that in his day, as in ours, there were narrow-minded opponents of pure mathematics who pejoratively inquired about the usefulness of such results. The author proudly asserted: "They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason." (Heath 1961, p.lxxiv).&lt;BR&gt;The preface to Book V, relating to maximum and minimum straight lines drawn to a conic, again argues that the subject is one of those that seem "worthy of study for their own sake." While one must admire the author for his lofty intellectual attitude, it may be pertinently pointed out that s day was beautiful theory, with no prospect of applicability to the science or engineering of his time, has since become fundamental in such fields as terrestrial dynamics and celestial mechanics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And since many of his results were not applicable to the science or engineering of his day, Apollonius further argued in the preface of the fifth book of ''Conics'' that the subject is one of those that "...seem worthy of study for their own sake."&lt;ref name="Apollonius"/&gt;

===19th century===
The term itself is enshrined in the full title of the [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics|Sadleirian Chair]], founded (as a professorship) in the mid-nineteenth century. The idea of a separate discipline of ''pure'' mathematics may have emerged at that time. The generation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] made no sweeping distinction of the kind, between ''pure'' and ''applied''. In the following years, specialisation and professionalisation (particularly in the [[Weierstrass]] approach to [[mathematical analysis]]) started to make a rift more apparent.

===20th century===
At the start of the twentieth century mathematicians took up the [[axiomatic method]], strongly influenced by [[David Hilbert]]'s example. The logical formulation of '''pure mathematics''' suggested by [[Bertrand Russell]] in terms of a [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] structure of [[Proposition (mathematics)|proposition]]s seemed more and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject to the simple criteria of ''[[rigorous proof]]''.

In fact in an axiomatic setting ''rigorous'' adds nothing to the idea of ''proof''. Pure mathematics, according to a view that can be ascribed to the [[Bourbaki group]], is what is proved. '''Pure mathematician''' became a recognized vocation, achievable through training.

The case was made that pure mathematics is useful in [[engineering education]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[A. S. Hathaway]] (1901) [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1901-07-06/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5.pdf "Pure mathematics for engineering students"], [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 7(6):266–71.&lt;/ref&gt;
:There is a training in habits of thought, points of view, and intellectual comprehension of ordinary engineering problems, which only the study of higher mathematics can give.

==Generality and abstraction==
One central concept in pure mathematics is the idea of generality; pure mathematics often exhibits a trend towards increased generality. Uses and advantages of generality include the following:

* Generalizing theorems or mathematical structures can lead to deeper understanding of the original theorems or structures
* Generality can simplify the presentation of material, resulting in shorter proofs or arguments that are easier to follow.
* One can use generality to avoid duplication of effort, proving a general result instead of having to prove separate cases independently, or using results from other areas of mathematics.
* Generality can facilitate connections between different branches of mathematics. [[Category theory]] is one area of mathematics dedicated to exploring this commonality of structure as it plays out in some areas of math.

Generality's impact on [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is both dependent on the subject and a matter of personal preference or learning style.  Often generality is seen as a hindrance to intuition, although it can certainly function as an aid to it, especially when it provides analogies to material for which one already has good intuition.

As a prime example of generality, the [[Erlangen program]] involved an expansion of [[geometry]] to accommodate [[non-Euclidean geometries]] as well as the field of [[topology]], and other forms of geometry, by viewing geometry as the study of a space together with a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations.  The study of [[number]]s, called [[algebra]] at the beginning undergraduate level, extends to [[abstract algebra]] at a more advanced level; and the study of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, called [[calculus]] at the college freshman level becomes [[mathematical analysis]] and [[functional analysis]] at a more advanced level.  Each of these branches of more ''abstract'' mathematics have many sub-specialties, and there are in fact many connections between pure mathematics and applied mathematics disciplines. A steep rise in [[abstraction]] was seen mid 20th century.

In practice, however, these developments led to a sharp divergence from [[physics]], particularly from 1950 to 1983. Later this was criticised, for example by [[Vladimir Arnold]], as too much [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], not enough [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]. The point does not yet seem to be settled, in that [[string theory]] pulls one way, while [[discrete mathematics]] pulls back towards proof as central.

==Purism==
Mathematicians have always had differing opinions regarding the distinction between pure and applied mathematics. 
One of the most famous (but perhaps misunderstood) modern examples of this debate can be found in [[G.H. Hardy]]'s ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''.

It is widely believed that Hardy considered applied mathematics to be ugly and dull. Although it is true that Hardy preferred pure mathematics, which he often compared to [[painting]] and [[poetry]], Hardy saw the distinction between pure and applied mathematics to be simply that applied mathematics sought to express ''physical'' truth in a mathematical framework, whereas pure mathematics expressed truths that were independent of the physical world. Hardy made a separate distinction in mathematics between what he called "real" mathematics, "which has permanent aesthetic value", and "the dull and elementary parts of mathematics" that have practical use.

Hardy considered some physicists, such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], to be among the "real" mathematicians, but at the time that he was writing the ''Apology'' he also considered [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] to be "useless", which allowed him to hold the opinion that only "dull" mathematics was useful. Moreover, Hardy briefly admitted that—just as the application of [[matrix theory]] and [[group theory]] to physics had come unexpectedly—the time may come where some kinds of beautiful, "real" mathematics may be useful as well.

Another insightful view is offered by Magid:
{{quote|I've always thought that a good model here could be drawn from ring theory. In that subject, one has the subareas of [[commutative ring|commutative ring theory]] and [[non-commutative ring|non-commutative ring theory]]. An uninformed observer might think that these represent a dichotomy, but in fact the latter subsumes the former: a non-commutative ring is a not-necessarily-commutative ring. If we use similar conventions, then we could refer to applied mathematics and nonapplied mathematics, where by the latter we ''mean not-necessarily-applied mathematics''... [emphasis added]&lt;ref name=Magid&gt;[[Andy Magid]] (November 2005) [http://www.ams.org/notices/200510/commentary.pdf Letter from the Editor], [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]], page 1173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Subfields==
[[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]] is concerned with the properties of functions. It deals with concepts such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[limit of a function|limits]], [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], thus providing a rigorous foundation for the [[calculus]] of infinitesimals introduced by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century. [[Real analysis]] studies functions of real numbers, while [[complex analysis]] extends the aforementioned concepts to functions of complex numbers.  [[Functional analysis]] is a branch of analysis that studies infinite-dimensional vector spaces and views functions as points in these spaces.

[[Abstract algebra]] is not to be confused with the manipulation of formulae that is covered in secondary education. It studies [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] together with [[binary operations]] defined on them. Sets and their binary operations may be classified according to their properties: for instance, if an operation is [[associative]] on a set that contains an identity element and inverses for each member of the set, the set and operation is considered to be a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Other structures include [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[vector spaces]] and [[Lattice (group)|lattices]].

[[Geometry]] is the study of shapes and space, in particular, groups of transformations that act on spaces. For example, [[projective geometry]] is about the group of projective transformations that act on the real projective plane, whereas [[inversive geometry]] is concerned with the group of inversive transformations acting on the extended complex plane.

[[Number theory]] is the theory of the positive [[integers]]. It is based on ideas such as divisibility and [[modular arithmetic|congruence]]. Its [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|fundamental theorem]] states that each positive integer has a unique prime factorization. In some ways it is the most accessible discipline in pure mathematics for the general public: for instance the [[Goldbach conjecture]] is easily stated (but is yet to be proved or disproved). In other ways it is the least accessible discipline; for example, Wiles' proof that Fermat's equation has no nontrivial solutions requires understanding [[automorphic forms]], which though intrinsic to nature have not found a place in physics or the general public discourse.

[[Topology]] is a modern extension of Geometry. Rather than focusing on the sizes of objects and their precise measurement, topology involves the properties of spaces or objects that are preserved under smooth operations such as bending or twisting (but not, for example, tearing or shearing). Topology's subfields interact with other branches of pure math: traditional topology uses ideas from [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], such as metric spaces, and [[algebraic topology]] relies on ideas from [[combinatorics]] in addition to those of analysis.

[[Combinatorics]] is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures. It also interacts with many other areas of mathematics. For example, additive combinatorics is related to [[number theory]] and [[analysis]], and [[graph theory]] comes from [[topology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">In [[calculus]], 
the '''racetrack principle''' describes the movement and growth of two functions in terms of their [[derivative]]s.

This principle is derived from the fact that if a horse named Frank Fleetfeet always runs faster than a horse named Greg Gooseleg, then if Frank and Greg start a race from the same place and the same time, then Frank will win.  More briefly, the horse that starts fast and stays fast wins.

In symbols: 
:if &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;f(0)=g(0)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. 
or, substituting ≥ for &gt; produces the theorem
:if &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \ge g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;f(0)=g(0)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ge g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. 
which can be proved in a similar way

==Proof==
This principle can be proven by considering the function h(x) = f(x) - g(x). If we were to take the derivative we would notice that for x&gt;0

:&lt;math&gt; h'= f'-g'&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

Also notice that h(0) = 0. Combining these observations, we can use the [[mean value theorem]] on the interval [0, x] and get

:&lt;math&gt; h'(x_0)= \frac{h(x)-h(0)}{x-0}= \frac{f(x)-g(x)}{x}&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since x &gt; 0 for the mean value theorem to work then we may conclude that f(x) - g(x) &gt; 0. This implies f(x) &gt; g(x).

==Generalizations==

The statement of the racetrack principle can slightly generalized as follows; 
:if &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;f(a)=g(a)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

as above, substituting ≥ for &gt; produces the theorem 
:if &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \ge g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;f(a)=g(a)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ge g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof===
This generalization can be proved from the racetrack principle as follows:

Consider functions &lt;math&gt;f_2(x)=f(x-a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_2(x)=g(x-a)&lt;/math&gt;.
Given that &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(a)=g(a)&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;f_2'(x)&gt;g_2'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f_2(0)=g_2(0)&lt;/math&gt;, which by the proof of the racetrack principle above means &lt;math&gt;f_2(x)&gt;g_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

==Application==
The racetrack principle can be used to prove a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] necessary to show that the [[exponential function]] grows faster than any power function. The lemma required is that
:&lt;math&gt; e^{x}&gt;x &lt;/math&gt;
for all real x. This is obvious for x&lt;0 but the racetrack principle is required for x&gt;0. To see how it is used we consider the functions
:&lt;math&gt; f(x)=e^{x}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; g(x)=x+1.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that f(0) = g(0) and that
:&lt;math&gt; e^{x}&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
because the exponential function is always increasing ([[monotonic]]) so &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus by the racetrack principle f(x)&gt;g(x). Thus,
:&lt;math&gt; e^{x}&gt;x+1&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
for all x&gt;0.

'''Ripple-down rules''' ('''RDR''') are a way of approaching [[knowledge acquisition]]. Knowledge acquisition refers to the transfer of knowledge from human experts to knowledge based systems.

== Introductory material ==
Ripple-down rules are an incremental approach to [[knowledge acquisition]] and covers a family of techniques. RDR were proposed by [[Paul Justin Compton|Compton]] and Jansen based on experience maintaining the expert system GARVAN-ES1 (Compton and Jansen 1988). The original GARVAN-ES1 (Horn et al. 1985) employed a knowledge acquisition process where new cases that were poorly classified by the system were added to a data base and then used to incrementally refine the knowledge base. The added cases, whose conclusions conflicted with the advice of the system were termed "cornerstone cases". Consequently, the data base grew iteratively with each refinement to the knowledge. The data base could then be used to test changes to the knowledge. Knowledge acquisition tools, similar to those provided by Teiresias were developed to find and help modify the conflicting rules. The tools would display the rules fired by each case and suggestions to "edit" the knowledge to remove the conflicts.

In the RDR framework, the human expert’s knowledge is acquired based on the current context and is added incrementally. Compton and Jansen argued that the expert's knowledge is to some extent 'made up' to justify why she was right, not to explain how she reached this right interpretation (or conclusion). The justification is based on features that are identified from the current case. The expert creates a rule for classifying cases corresponding to a particular context. This rule is unlikely to classify all cases belonging to the class. Compton and Jansen asserted that it is not possible to create a single elegant context free rule as the knowledge we communicate is a justification in a context. This implies that there is no absolute knowledge that acts as foundation of other knowledge, since knowledge is only true in a context (Compton and Jansen 1990).

== Methodology ==
Ripple-down rules consist of a data structure and knowledge acquisition scenarios. Human experts' knowledge is stored in the data structure. The knowledge is coded as a set of rules.
The process of transferring human experts's knowledge to Knowledge-based systems in RDR is explained in knowledge acquisition scenario.

=== Data structure ===
There are various structures of ripple-down rules, for example single-classification ripple-down rules (SCRDR), multiple-classification ripple-down rules (MCRDR), nested ripple-down rules (NRDR) and repeat-inference multiple-classification ripple-down rules (RIMCRDR). The data structure of RDR described here is SCRDR, which is the simplest structure.

The data structure is similar to a [[decision tree]]. Each node has a rule, the format of this rule is IF cond1 AND cond2 AND ... AND condN THEN conclusion. Cond1 is a condition (boolean evaluation), for example A=1, isGreater(A,5) and average(A,"&gt;",average(B)). Each node has exactly two successor nodes, these successor nodes are connected to predecessor node by "ELSE" or "EXCEPT".

An example of SCRDR tree (defined recursively) is shown below:

IF (OutLook = "SUNNY" AND Temperature = "COOL") THEN PLAY="TENNIS"
EXCEPT Child-1
ELSE Child-2

where Child-1 and Child-2 are also SCRDR trees. For example, Child-1 is:

IF (Wind = "WINDY" AND Humidity = "HIGH") THEN Play="SQUASH"
EXCEPT NoChild
ELSE NoChild

===Knowledge-acquisition scenario===
Human experts provide a case to the system and they add a new rule to correct the classification of a misclassified case. For example, rule Child-1 is added to correct classification of case
[OutLook="SUNNY", Temperature="COOL", Wind="WINDY", Humidity="HIGH", ForeCast="STORM", Play="SQUASH"]. This case is misclassified as Play="TENNIS".

When a rule is constructed by the human experts, the conditions of this rule should be satisfied by the misclassified case and also they should NOT be satisfied by any previous cases classified correctly by the parent rule (which in this context is the first rule).

The '''Sand Mountain blue''' (''Euphilotes pallescens arenamontana'') is a [[butterfly]] of the [[Lycaenidae|gossamer winged]] variety that is only found around the [[Sand Mountain (Nevada)|Sand Mountain Recreation Area]] near [[Fallon, Nevada]].  This species is one of several belonging to the [[Polyommatinae|"blue" subfamily]] of Lycaenidae.&lt;ref name="fws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sand Mountain Blue Butterfly|url=http://www.fws.gov/nevada/nv_species/smb_butterfly.html|publisher=Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological characteristics==
These butterflies are known for their almost complete dependence upon [[Eriogonum nummulare|Kearney buckwheat]]; eating the fallen leaves of the plant as [[caterpillar|larvae]], and drinking the [[nectar]] of the flowers as adults - however, the adults occasionally feed on other plant species. Like many gossamer-winged butterflies, Sand Mountain blues have a close relationship with [[ant]]s; in this case, desert [[carpenter ant]]s feed on a [[sugar]]y secretion of the larvae; whether the larvae [[mutualism (biology)|also benefit]] or [[commensalism|not]] is yet to be determined. Once the larvae [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into the [[pupa]]l stage, rather than remaining fixed to buckwheat plant, the [[Pupa#Chrysalis|chrysalis]] drops into the [[plant litter|leaf litter]] at the base. Upon reaching adulthood, ''E. pallescens arenamontana'' typically measure anywhere between {{convert|10.0|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|11.9|mm|in|abbr=on}}.  The species is not known to [[Lepidoptera migration|migrate]], and stays within {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} of its host plant. The lifespan of an adult Sand Mountain blue is approximately one week.&lt;ref name="fws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="petition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Petition to list the Sand Mountain Blue Butterfly as a Threatened or Endangered Species Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act|url=http://www.fws.gov/nevada/nv_species/documents/smbb/smbb_petition.pdf|format=PDF|author=[[Center for Biological Diversity]] |author2=[[Xerces Society]] |author3=[[Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility]] |author4=Nevada Outdoor Recreation Association |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
The Sand Mountain blue species, ''[[Euphilotes pallescens|E. pallescens]]'' has been officially classified as being [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]], while the subspecies ''E. p. arenamontana'' has been labeled as critically imperiled, at great risk of extinction.&lt;ref name=NS /&gt;  In 2004 a [[petition]] was filed to investigate the [[conservation status|status]] of the Sand Mountain blue and whether it should be placed on the [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[threatened species]] lists.  Currently Sand Mountain blues are referred to as "[[rare species|rare]]" because of their small [[range (biology)|geographical distribution]] around the Sand Mountain [[dune]].&lt;ref name="petition"/&gt; In March 2007, several [[off-road vehicle]] trails were closed off in order to protect the species and its host plant from intrusion.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Move to protect butterfly steps on off-roaders|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17722427|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''science of morality''' may refer to various forms of [[ethical naturalism]] grounding [[morality]] in rational, [[empirical]] consideration of the natural world.&lt;ref name="sep-naturalism-moral"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Lenman |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Moral Naturalism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/naturalism-moral/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Moral science may refer to the consideration of what is best for, and how to maximize the [[flourishing]] of, either particular individuals&lt;ref&gt;Carrier&lt;/ref&gt; or all conscious creatures.&lt;ref name="tedharris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Moral Landscape'', pp. 39ff&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that "morality" can be appropriately defined on the basis of fundamental premises necessary for ''any'' empirical, secular, and philosophical discussion and that societies can use the methods of science to provide answers to moral questions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Daleiden ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations''; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', 2010; and Richard Carrier ''Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = In sum, from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on [[David Hume|Hume]]’s warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences.

The norms advocated by moral scientists (e.g. rights to [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], and [[drug liberalization]] under certain circumstances) would be founded upon the shifting and growing collection of human understanding.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;  Even with science's admitted degree of ignorance, and the various semantic issues, moral scientists can meaningfully discuss things as being ''almost certainly'' "better" or "worse" for promoting flourishing.&lt;ref name=HarrisFlourishing&gt;Sam Harris (2010), page 183: "Much of the skepticism I encounter when speaking about these issues comes from people who think "happiness" is a superficial state of mind and that there are far more important things in life than "being happy." Some reasers may think that concepts like "well-being" and "flourishing" are similarly effete. However, I don't know of any better terms with which to signify the most positive states of being to which we can aspire. One of the virtues of thinking about a moral landscape, the heights of which remain to be discovered, is that it frees us from these semantic difficulties. Generally speaking, we need only worry about what it will mean to move "up" as opposed to "down".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In philosophy===
[[Utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] discussed some of the ways moral investigations are a science.&lt;ref&gt;''Deontology, or The Science of Morality''&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes [[Deontology|deontological ethics]] for failing to recognize that it needed to make the same presumptions as his science of morality to really work – whilst pursuing rules that were to be obeyed in every situation (something that worried Bentham).

[[W.V.O. Quine]] advocated naturalizing epistemology by looking to natural sciences like psychology for a full explanation of knowledge.{{explain|date=October 2015}} His work contributed to a resurgence of moral naturalism in the last half of the 20th century. [[Paul Kurtz]], who believes that the careful, secular pursuit of normative rules is vital to society, coined the term ''eupraxophy'' to refer to his approach to normative ethics. [[Steven Pinker]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and [[Peter Singer]] believe that we learn what is right and wrong through reason and empirical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/steven-pinker-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=debate1&gt;At 11:25 in the video debate at http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maria Ossowska.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Maria Ossowska]] used the methods of science to understand the origins of moral norms.]]
[[Maria Ossowska]] thought that sociology was inextricably related to philosophical reflections on morality, including normative ethics. She proposed that science analyze: (a) existing social norms and their history, (b) the psychology of morality, and the way that individuals interact with moral matters and prescriptions, and (c) the sociology of morality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/6/3/311 Marcin T. Zdrenka. (2006). "Moral philosopher or sociologist of morals?". Journal of Classical Sociology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular literature===
The theory and methods of a normative science of morality are explicitly discussed in Joseph Daleiden's ''The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations'' (1998). Daleiden's book, in contrast to Harris, extensively discusses the relevant philosophical literature.  In ''[[The Moral Landscape|The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]]'', [[Sam Harris]]'s goal is to show how moral truth can be backed by "science", or more specifically, [[empirical knowledge]], critical thinking, philosophy, but most controversially, the [[scientific method]].

[[Patricia Churchland]] offers that, accepting [[David Hume|Hume]]'s [[Is–ought problem|is-ought problem]], the use of induction from premises and definitions remains a valid way of reasoning in life and science.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-great-debate/the-great-debate-panel-1&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|Our moral behavior, while more complex than the social behavior of other animals, is similar in that it represents our attempt to manage well in the existing social ecology....from the perspective of neuroscience and brain evolution, the routine rejection of scientific approaches to moral behavior based on Hume's warning against deriving ''ought'' from ''is'' seems unfortunate, especially as the warning is limited to deductive inferences....The truth seems to be that values rooted in the circuitry for caring—for well-being of self, offspring, mates, kin, and others—shape social reasoning about many issues: conflict resolutions, keeping the peace, defense, trade, resource distribution, and many other aspects of social life in all its vast richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patricia Smith |last=Churchland |year=2011 |title=Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-13703-2 |lccn=2010043584 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLsIzyFR08IC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7 |pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Patricia Churchland|Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality}}

Daleiden and [[Leonard Carmichael]] warn that science is probabilistic, and that [[certainty]] is not possible. One should therefore expect that moral prescriptions will change as humans gain understanding.&lt;ref&gt;p502, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|To quote Carmichael: "We do not turn aside from what we know about astronomy at any time because there is still a great deal we do not know, or because so much of what we once thought we knew is no longer recognized as true. May not the same argument be accepted in our thinking about ethical and esthetic judgements?"&lt;ref&gt;Leaonard Carmichael, the chapter "Absolutes, Relativism and the Scientific Psychology of Human Nature", H. Schoeck and J. Wiggins (eds), in the book "Relativism and the Study of Man, Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand, 1961, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

==Views in scientific Morality==
{{See also|Moral psychology}}

===Training to promote good behaviour===
The science of morality may aim to discover the best ways to motivate and shape individuals. Methods to accomplish this include instilling explicit [[virtue]]s, building [[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|character strengths]], and forming [[Association (psychology)|mental associations]]. These generally require some level of practical reason. James Rest suggested that abstract reasoning is also a factor in making moral judgements&lt;ref name=RestJudging/&gt; and emphasized that moral judgements alone do not predict moral behaviour: “Moral judgement may be closely related to advocacy behaviour, which in turn influences social institutions, which in turn creates a system of norms and sanctions that influences people’s behaviour.”&lt;ref name=RestJudging&gt;James R. Rest, Development in Judging Moral Issues. (1979). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Daleiden suggested that religions instill a practical sense of virtue and justice, right and wrong. They also effectively use art and myths to educate people about moral situations.&lt;ref&gt;323, 326, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of government====
Harris argues that moral science does not imply an "[[George Orwell|Orwell]]ian future" with "scientists at every door". Instead, Harris imagines data about normative moral issues being shared in the same way as other sciences (e.g. peer-reviewed journals on medicine).&lt;ref name=SalonHarris&gt;[http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/10/17/sam_harris_interview/ www.salon.com] Asked "Let's say scientists do end up discovering moral truths. How are they supposed to enforce their findings? Would they become something like policemen or priests?" Harris writes ''"They wouldn’t necessarily enforce them any more than they enforce their knowledge about human health. What are scientists doing with the knowledge that smoking causes cancer or obesity is bad for your health, or that the common cold is spread by not washing your hands? We’re not living in some Orwellian world where we have scientists in lab coats at every door. Imagine we discovered that there is a best way to teach your children to be compassionate, or to defer short-term gratification in the service of a long-term goal. What if it turns out to be true that calcium intake in the first two years of life has a significant effect on a child’s emotional life? If we learn that, what parent wouldn’t want that knowledge? The fear of a "Brave New World" component to this argument is unfounded."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Daleiden specifies that government, like any organization, should have limited power. He says "centralization of power irrevocably in the hands of one person or an elite has always ultimately led to great evil for the human race. It was the novel experiment of democracy—a clear break with tradition—that ended the long tradition of tyranny.”&lt;ref&gt;219, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He is also explicit that [[government]] should only use law to enforce the most basic, reasonable, evidence and widely supported moral norms. In other words, there are a great many moral norms that should never be the task of the government to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;273–274, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of punishment====
{{Main|Differential reinforcement|Prison}}
One author has argued that to attain a society where people are motivated by conditioned self-interest, [[punishment]] must go hand-in-hand with [[reward system|reward]].&lt;ref&gt;77, Daleiden (1998), quote “We use rewards and punishments, praise and blame, in training any animal. The human species is only different in degree in this regard, not in kind.”&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in this line of reasoning, prison remains necessary for many perpetrators of crimes. This is so, even if libertarian free will is false. This is because punishment can still serve its purposes: it deters others from committing their own crimes, educates and reminds everyone about what the society stands for, incapacitates the criminal from doing more harm, goes some way to relieving or repaying the victim, and corrects the criminal (also see [[recidivism]]). This author argues that, at least, any prison system ''should'' be pursuing those goals, and that it is an empirical question as to what sorts of punishment realize these goals most effectively, and how well various [[prison]] systems actually serve these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;289, Daleiden (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
{{see also| Positive psychology|Moral development}}
The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a8926q746t212727/ "Bzdok, D. et al. Parsing the neural correlates of moral cognition: ALE meta-analysis on morality, theory of mind, and empathy. Brain Struct Funct, 2011."]&lt;/ref&gt;  The neural network underlying moral decisions overlaps with the network pertaining to representing others' intentions (i.e., theory of mind) and the network pertaining to representing others' (vicariously experienced) emotional states (i.e., empathy). This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons’ points of view and to grasping others’ feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a "moral module" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.
An essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sevinc |first1=Gunes |last2=Gurvit |first2=Hakan |last3=Spreng |first3=R. Nathan |title=Salience network engagement with the detection of morally laden information |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |date=July 2017 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1118–1127 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsx035|pmid=28338944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The salience network responds to behaviorally salient events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seeley |first1=W. W. |last2=Menon |first2=V. |last3=Schatzberg |first3=A. F. |last4=Keller |first4=J. |last5=Glover |first5=G. H. |last6=Kenna |first6=H. |last7=Reiss |first7=A. L. |last8=Greicius |first8=M. D. |title=Dissociable Intrinsic Connectivity Networks for Salience Processing and Executive Control |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |date=28 February 2007 |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=2349–2356 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5587-06.2007|pmc=2680293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menon |first1=Vinod |last2=Uddin |first2=Lucina Q. |title=Saliency, switching, attention and control: a network model of insula function |journal=Brain Structure and Function |date=29 May 2010 |volume=214 |issue=5–6 |pages=655–667 |doi=10.1007/s00429-010-0262-0|pmc=2899886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be critical to modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes. This suggest that moral cognition involves both bottom-up and top-down attentional processes, mediated by discrete large-scale brain networks and their interactions.

===Other implications===

Daleiden provides examples of how science can use empirical evidence to assess the effect that specific behaviors can have on the well-being of individuals and society with regard to various moral issues. He argues that science supports [[Drug liberalization|decriminalization and regulation of drugs]], euthanasia under some circumstances, and the permission of sexual behaviors that are not tolerated in some cultures (he cites [[homosexuality]] as an example). Daleiden further argues that in seeking to reduce human suffering, [[abortion]] should not only be permissible, but at times a moral obligation (as in the case of a mother of a potential child who would face the probability of much suffering). Like all moral claims in his book, however, Daleiden is adamant that these decisions remain grounded in, and contingent on empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=DaleidenSummary/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Joseph Daleiden's final word regarding his book, ''The Science of Morality,'' is that “[The study of ethics] should be included with the social sciences and be subject to as rigorous a scientific program of research as any other area of human behaviour. Lacking this scientific rigour, the moral conclusions drawn in this volume must be considered as working hypotheses, some with greater degree of evidentiary support than others. It is the process by which to assess and transmit moral norms that was the primary focus of this work, and I hope it will serve as a new way of deciding moral issues.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of [[cultural relativity]], to Daleiden, do offer some lessons: investigators must be careful not to judge a person's behaviour without understanding the environmental context. An action may be necessary and more moral once we are aware of circumstances.&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"&gt;100, Daleiden&lt;/ref&gt; However, Daleiden emphasizes that this does not mean all ethical norms or systems are equally effective at promoting flourishing&lt;ref name="100, Daleiden"/&gt; and he often offers the equal treatment of women as a reliably superior norm, wherever it is practiced.

== Criticisms ==

The idea of a normative science of morality has met with some criticisms. Critics include physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]], who argues that morality cannot be part of science.&lt;ref name=twsJun14eef&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= Casting morality as a maximization problem might seem overly restrictive at first glance, but the procedure can potentially account for a wide variety of approaches. A libertarian might want to maximize a feeling of personal freedom, while a traditional utilitarian might want to maximize some version of happiness. The point is simply that the goal of morality should be to create certain conditions that are, in principle, directly measurable by empirical means. ...Nevertheless, I want to argue that this program is simply not possible. ... Morality is not part of science, however much we would like it to be. There are a large number of arguments one could advance for in support of this claim, but I'll stick to three.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and other critics cite the widely held "[[fact-value distinction]]", that the [[scientific method]] cannot answer "moral" questions, although it can describe the norms of different cultures. In contrast, moral scientists defend the position that such a division between values and scientific facts ("moral relativism") is not only arbitrary and illusory, but impeding progress towards taking action against documented cases of human rights violations in different cultures.&lt;ref name=Moralconfusion&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= There are also very practical, moral concerns that follow from the glib idea that anyone is free to value anything—the most consequential being that it is precisely what allows highly educated, secular, and otherwise well-intentioned people to pause thoughtfully, and often interminably, before condemning practices like compulsory veiling, genital excision, bride-burning, forced marriage, and the other cheerful products of alternative “morality” found elsewhere in the world. Fanciers of Hume’s is/ought distinction never seem to realize what the stakes are, and they do not see what an abject failure of compassion their intellectual “tolerance” of moral difference amounts to. While much of this debate must be had in academic terms, this is not merely an academic debate. There are women and girls getting their faces burned off with acid at this moment for daring to learn to read, or for not consenting to marry men they have never met, or even for the crime of getting raped.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that science and religion occupy "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]". To Gould, science is concerned with questions of fact and theory, but not with meaning and morality – the magisteria of religion. In the same vein, [[Edward Teller]] proposed that politics decides what is right, whereas science decides what is true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/280/5367/1200 Essays on Science and Society. "Science and Morality".]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a discussion on the role that [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] might play in professions like [[nursing]], Philosopher Trevor Hussey calls the popular view that science is unconcerned with morality "too simplistic". Although his main focus in the paper is naturalism in nursing, he goes on to explain that science can, at very least, be interested in morality at a descriptive level. He even briefly entertains the idea that morality could itself be a scientific subject, writing that one ''might'' argue "..that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one. If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here."
{{#tag:ref|Hussey writes "The relationship between naturalism and morality and politics is complicated, and is difficult to state in a few sentences because it involves deep philosophical issues. Only the briefest discussion is possible here. The most popular view is that science, and hence naturalism, is concerned with objective facts and not with values: with what is the case rather than what ought to be. But this is too simplistic." He gives a reason immediately: "First, at the very least, science can study morality and politics at a descriptive level and try to understand their workings within societies and in the lives of individuals, and investigate their evolutionary origins, their social propagation, and so on." Hussey then describes how scientists must adhere to certain values, but also how values guide what it is that science may investigate. His real interest in the paper is to justify naturalism as a nursing practice, yet he does eventually write: "Finally, the idea that science and morality are separate realms, one dealing with facts the other with values, is not as certain and clear-cut as it seems. Various versions of moral realism are now widely discussed among philosophers (e.g. Railton, 1986, 1996, 2003; Sayre-McCord, 1988; Dancy, 1993; Casebeer, 2003; Shafer-Landau, 2003; Baghramian, 2004; Smith, 1994, 2004). Despite their differences, moral realists generally agree on two principles. First, that our moral utterances, such as ‘Murder is morally wrong’ or ‘We ought to be honest’ are genuine statements and hence they are capable of being either true or false. Second, what makes them either true or false are aspects of the real world, open to objective examination. It can be argued that it is an implication of this thesis that moral judgements are subject to the same kinds of rational, empirical examination as the rest of the world: they are a subject for science – although a difficult one." He continues "If this could be shown to be so, morality would be contained within naturalism. However, I will not assume the truth of moral realism here. It is sufficient to say that it has at least as much credibility as any theory claiming a supernatural or divine foundation for morality: views which, while popular among the general public, do not have widespread support among moral philosophers – for what that is worth." Hussey thus directs discussion back towards Naturalism in nursing because his main point in all this was, in the end, to prove that naturalistic moralities are not necessarily less credible than supernatural ones, and may even be more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Naturalistic nursing, Trevor Hussey (2011), Nursing Philosophy, Vol 12, Pg.45–52.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

The '''self-expansion model''' is based on two key principles. The first is that humans have a primary motivation to self expand. The second principle is that individuals often achieve self-expansion through close relationships which allow the inclusion of the other in the self.

==Self-expansion motivation==

One of the underlying themes of self-expansion is that individuals have a very basic [[Motivation|motive]] to self-expand. Self-expansion is the desire to enhance an individual's potential [[efficacy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge Structure in Close Relationships: A Social Psychological Approach|last1=Aron|first1=A.|last2=Aron|publisher=Erlbaum|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8058-1432-3|editor-last=Fletcher|editor-first=Garth|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=325–344|chapter=Self and self expansion in relationships|oclc=477410911|ref=harv|editor-last2=Fitness|editor-first2=Julie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Interpersonal Processes|last1=Aron|first1=Arthur|last2=Aron|first2=Elaine N.|last3=Norman|first3=Christina|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd|year=2003|isbn=978-0-470-99855-7|editor-last=Fletcher|editor-first=Garth|volume=2|location=Oxford|pages=478–501|chapter=Self-expansion Model of Motivation and Cognition in Close Relationships and Beyond|doi=10.1002/9780470998557.ch19|ref=harv|editor-last2=Clark|editor-first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivational models often refer to self-efficacy as one's belief that they are competent and can achieve specific goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1977|title=Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.315.4567&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Psychological Review|volume=84|issue=2|pages=191–215|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191|issn=1939-1471|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the self-expansion model, potential efficacy is used instead, as it only refers to obtaining resources that will make goal attainment possible. Achievement of this goal is a secondary concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=Arthur|last2=Norman|first2=Christina|last3=Aron|first3=Elaine|date=1 January 1998|title=The self-expansion model and motivation|journal=Representative Research in Social Psychology|volume=22|pages=1–13|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the self-expansion model, people increase potential efficacy by creating close [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], which in turn, increases material and social resources, perspectives, and identities. Some examples of resources include the following: social support, possessions, information, and friendship networks. Perspectives are the way people appreciate the world and ascribe causal explanations for people's behaviors. Identities refer to a person's memories and characteristics. Self-expansion is not [[consciously]] motivated. A person does not explicitly attempt to be part of a close relationship for the sole intention of increasing physical and psychological resources.

However, the motivation to self-expand still does influence attraction to others for a potential close relationship. Aron and Aron suggest that our attraction is broken down into two components based on Rotter's value-expectancy approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Desirability is the perceived total amount of self-expansion possible from a potential close relationship. The second factor, probability, refers to the likelihood that the close relationship with the individual can actually be formed. It can also be conceptualized as the likelihood that self-expansion will occur. Consequently, individuals will seek a partner that has high social status and a greater number of resources. However, to maximize self-expansion, consideration is also given to how likely this person will be loyal and desires to be in the close relationship. Self expansion is when you motivate yourself and trust yourself.

==Including the other in the self==

The second principle of the self-expansion model is that people use close relationships to self expand by including the other in the self.

Aron, Aron, Tudor and Nelson conducted several classic studies that scientifically demonstrated that we include the other in the self.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, A., Aron, E. N., Tudor, M., &amp; Nelson, G. (1991). Close relationships as including other in the self. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60(2), 241-253. {{doi|10.1037/0022-3514.60.2.241}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experiment, participants were more likely to distribute money equally between the self and the close other in comparison to distributing the money between oneself and a stranger. The sharing of resources was suggestive of including the self in the other. In a second experiment, participants were more likely to remember more nouns for a stranger than a close other (one's mother). This supported the IOS phenomenon, as participants were more likely to take the perspective of the close other thus not being able to remember descriptive nouns of that person. In a final experiment participants were required to make yes/no decisions on whether certain traits belonged to themselves. Decisions on traits that were different between a participant and a close other had longer reaction times than decisions on traits that were different between a participant and a stranger. It was suggested that the increased confusion between the self and the close other was directly related to integrating the other in the self. The degree of closeness in the relationship affects the self and other reaction studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=Arthur|last2=Fraley|first2=Barbara|date=1 June 1999|title=Relationship Closeness as Including Other in the Self: Cognitive Underpinnings and Measures|journal=Social Cognition|volume=17|issue=2|pages=140–160|doi=10.1521/soco.1999.17.2.140|issn=0278-016X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As two individuals become closer, there is greater confusion and therefore a longer reaction time. As a result, as closeness of a relationship increases, there will be a greater inclusion of the other in the self.

===Measuring inclusion of the other in the self===
[[File:Inclusion of other in the self scale.png|alt=Adapted inclusion of other in the self scale.|thumb|Adapted inclusion of other in the self scale.]]
The Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale (IOS Scale)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=Arthur|last2=Aron|first2=Elaine N.|last3=Smollan|first3=Danny|date=1992|title=Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=4|pages=596–612|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.596|issn=0022-3514|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most frequently used tools to assess this phenomenon. The scale consists of seven Venn diagram-like pairs of circles that vary on the level of overlap between the self and the other. Respondents are asked to select the pair of circles that best represents their current close relationship. Several studies have showed that this measurement tool is effective in getting accurate depictions of the amount of closeness and the inclusion of the other in the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agnew|first1=Christopher R|last2=Van Lange|first2=Paul AM|last3=Rusbult|first3=Caryl E|last4=Langston|first4=Christopher A|date=1998|title=Cognitive interdependence: Commitment and the mental representation of close relationships.|url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/17663/Agnew_JournalOfPersonalityAndSocialPsychology_74(4)_1998_u.pdf?sequence=2|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=74|issue=4|pages=939|issn=1939-1315|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gächter|first=Simon|last2=Starmer|first2=Chris|last3=Tufano|first3=Fabio|date=2015-06-12|title=Measuring the Closeness of Relationships: A Comprehensive Evaluation of the 'Inclusion of the Other in the Self' Scale|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129478|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=e0129478|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0129478|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4466912|pmid=26068873}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOS has also been assessed with the Continuous IOS, a [[Java applet|Java-based applet]] suitable for online surveys that measures IOS on a continuous scale from 0-100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy|last1=Agnew|first1=Christopher R.|last2=Loving|first2=T.

==Inclusion of the ingroup in the self==

The idea of including the other in the self has been extended to include an entire ingroup in the self.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Self: Cognitive, Interpersonal and Intergroup Perspectives|last1=Wright|first1=S. C.|last2=Aron|first2=A.|last3=Tropp|first3=L.

The individual believes he or she is a member of this group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In fact, several academic groups have found similar findings in the me/not me reaction time paradigm at a group level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Eliot R.|last2=Henry|first2=Susan|date=1 June 1996|title=An In-Group Becomes Part of the Self: Response Time Evidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=22|issue=6|pages=635–642|doi=10.1177/0146167296226008|issn=0146-1672|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants showed a slower reaction time for traits that were incongruent between the self and ingroup. This was in comparison to quicker reaction times for traits that were congruent between the self and ingroup. The slow reaction times were consistent with the inclusion of the ingroup in the self claim as it suggested that the individual had included group characteristics in the self. As a result, there was difficulty recalling if a trait belong to the self or ingroup. Several researchers have examined the role of ingroup identification (i.e. a person's prolonged psychological connection to an ingroup) and self-expansion. In fact, Trop and Wright refined the meaning of ingroup identification and believed it was analogous to the inclusion of the ingroup in the self.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tropp|first1=Linda R.|last2=Wright|first2=Stephen C.|date=1 May 2001|title=Ingroup Identification as the Inclusion of Ingroup in the Self|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Wright6/publication/238334130_Ingroup_Identification_as_the_Inclusion_of_Ingroup_in_the_Self/links/54686e600cf2f5eb18037d07.pdf|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=27|issue=5|pages=585–600|doi=10.1177/0146167201275007|issn=0146-1672|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found that the degree of connectedness to the ingroup will affect confusion of self-descriptors. People who highly identified with an ingroup showed slower reaction times for self-descriptors that did not relate to the ingroup (this is consistent with previous findings). However, low ingroup identification lead to no differences in reaction times between whether or not the self-descriptors were also descriptive of the ingroup. This demonstrated that the level of identification with an ingroup can be conceptualized as the degree to which we will include the ingroup in the self.

The central motivation for including the ingroup in the self parallels the self-expansion model at the interpersonal level. The self-expansion model suggests that we are strongly motivated to expand ourselves by including the other in the self. This occurs when an individual incorporates the other's perspectives, identities and resources. Likewise, it has been proposed that including an ingroup in the self, or ingroup identification, is partly influenced by the self-expansion motive. Inclusion of the ingroup's perspectives and resources can increase one's confidence in completing a variety of goals. Thus, a group's attractiveness is often based on the potential for self-expansion. A group with higher social status and a greater amount of potential resources is more likely to be included in the self.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Inclusion and Exclusion|last1=McLaughlin-Volpe|first1=T.|last2=Aron|first2=A.|last3=Wright|first3=S.

===Measurement of inclusion of the ingroup in the self===

Tropp and Wright created an instrument to measure the extent that an individual includes the ingroup in the self.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Inclusion of the Ingroup in the Self Scale (ISS Scale) was based on the Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale. Similar to the original scale, seven pairs of circles vary on the degree of overlap between the self and the particular ingroup. The scale has been well validated and the degree of inclusion of the ingroup in the self is said to capture the sense of ingroup identification.

==Self-expansion, including the outgroup in the self, and intergroup relations==

An abundance of research focuses on the negative interactions between different groups (e.g. negative attitudes, intolerance, discrimination). However, there is sparse evidence to explain the positive aspects of intergroup relations such as reduction of prejudice. The contact hypothesis(by [[Gordon Allport]]) is one area of psychology that focuses on positive aspects of intergroup relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Prejudice|last=Allport|first=Gordon Willard|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1954|isbn=|location=Reading, Mass.|pages=|oclc=601412540|ref=harv}}{{Pages needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas F.|date=1998|title=Intergroup Contact Theory|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/oneworld/system/files/annurev.psych_.49.1.65-2.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=49|issue=1|pages=65–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.65|pmid=15012467|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis suggests that when there is cooperation, equal status, common goals and authority support then contact between members of different groups can result in reduced negative attitudes. In addition, positive emotions between intergroup members was said to be of utmost importance as it would lead to positive attitudes which, in turn, would generalize to the entire outgroup.&lt;ref&gt;Pettrigrew, T. (1997). Generalized intergroup effects on prejudice. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 173-185. {{doi|10.1177/0146167297232006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An outgroup is set of individuals with which the individuals does not identify.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was unclear how this attitude generalization actually happened. Recently, the process of including the outgroup in the self was used as an explanatory mechanism for this [[generalization]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Including the outgroup in the self is based on the similar self-expansion notion of including the other or ingroup in the self. As a person becomes a friend with an outgroup member, the aspects of the outgroup is included in the self when that group is made salient. Essentially, representation of the outgroup and its identity is shared with our representation of the self. Including the outgroup in the self can vary; a person may actually become a member of an outgroup.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, in certain circumstances this is virtually impossible and we simply psychologically identify with the group even though we are aware that we are not part of it. Upon inclusion of the outgroup in the self, we now give that group several benefits. These benefits include taking pride in the group, sharing resources, and positive biases in causal explanations of the group. These benefits all increase the likelihood for reduced outgroup prejudice, hence its use as a mechanism for the contact hypothesis.

It is important to note that the focus of the inclusion of the outgroup in the self is initially at the interpersonal level (i.e. between individuals).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Psychology of Prejudice: Historical and Contemporary Issues|last1=Pettigrew|first1=Thomas F|last2=Wright|first2=S. C.|last3=Brody|first3=S. M.|last4=Aron|first4=A.|publisher=Lewinian Press|year=2005|editor-last=Crandall|editor-first=Christian|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=119–146|chapter=Intergroup contact: Still our best hope for improving intergroup relations|oclc=135635378|ref=harv|editor-last2=Schaller|editor-first2=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction needs to have interpersonal closeness for inclusion of the self in the other to occur. Consequently, a decategorized approach to contact should be used where the focus is on personal identities instead of group identities. By focusing on personalization, there is a greater chance for the development of closeness. Eventually, group membership needs to become available so that an individual can now include the outgroup in the self as well. However, it is believed that group membership will become more central in a natural manner as the close relationship develops.

Empirical evidence seems to support the inclusion of the outgroup in the self hypothesis. In one study white women were paired off with either another white woman (ingroup member) or a Latina woman (outgroup member).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The pairs of women met over an extended period of time completing different activities together, which led to a measurable close friendship. Women with an intergroup friendship were more likely to have positive intergroup attitudes, less likely to endorse anti-minority policies and less likely to demonstrate intergroup anxiety. The study suggests that the intergroup close relationship led to improved attitudes towards the entire outgroup as suggested by the inclusion of the outgroup in the self mechanism. Another study also found that the level of inclusion of the outgroup in the self would affect the amount of decreased prejudicial attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=Rhiannon N.|last2=Hewstone|first2=Miles|last3=Voci|first3=Alberto|last4=Vonofakou|first4=Christiana|date=2008|title=A test of the extended intergroup contact hypothesis: The mediating role of intergroup anxiety, perceived ingroup and outgroup norms, and inclusion of the outgroup in the self.|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/3762643/2008JPSP.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=95|issue=4|pages=843–860|doi=10.1037/a0011434|issn=1939-1315|ref=harv}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, simply including a friend in the self who has a close relationship with an outgroup member can decrease outgroup prejudiced attitudes. Knowing that a friend includes an outgroup member in the self allows for the individual to include that entire outgroup in the self. In turn, this also leads to positive attitudes about the outgroup.

===Self-expansion motive===

It may be the case that individuals want to make friends with outgroup members (instead of oppress and mistreat the outgroup) because of the self-expansion motive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on Aron and Aron's original work, people want to expand the self and an optimal way of doing so is to make close friendships that give the opportunity for increased perspectives, identities and resources. People who are most similar to ourselves provide a diminished capacity for self-expansion.  As a result, an individual may turn to outgroup members for friendship because they are different from one's self-concept. These differences allow for a greater likelihood to increase resources, identities and perspectives, which is consistent with the self-expansion motive. A recent study has shown that, consistent with this idea, priming high self-expansion motivation enhances outgroup self-expansion and the quality and outcomes of outgroup interactions (e.g. greater self-efficacy, reported closeness, and self-growth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dys-Steenbergen|first1=Odilia|last2=Wright|first2=Stephen C.|last3=Aron|first3=Arthur|date=1 January 2016|title=Self-expansion motivation improves cross-group interactions and enhances self-growth|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=19|issue=1|pages=60–71|doi=10.1177/1368430215583517|issn=1368-4302|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barriers to self-expansion at the intergroup level===

Self-expansion motives can explain why people may appreciate intergroup contact, however, it can also provide explanations for why we avoid this intergroup contact. People may be cautious of self-expansion due to a sense of self-loss. As we self-expand in one area we may put ourselves at risk of losing aspects of the self in another area. Consequently, people may be fearful of creating a close relationship with an outgroup member as this may trigger animosity from original ingroup members. Often individuals must balance between potential benefits of including the outgroup in the self with the potential loss of ingroup friends and the associated resources. If the self-loss outweighs the self-expansion, it is possible for a decrease in perceived self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A second barrier for self-expansion is the notion for an overabundance of self-expansion in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Improving Intergroup Relations Building on the Legacy of Thomas F. Pettigrew|last1=Wright|first1=S. C.|last2=Aron|first2=A.|last3=Brody|first3=S. M.|publisher=Blackwell Pub|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4443-0311-7|editor-last=Wagner|editor-first=Ulrich|location=Oxford|pages=143–159|chapter=Extended contact and including the others in the self: Building on the Allport/Pettigrew legacy|oclc=839361889|ref=harv|editor-last2=Tropp|editor-first2=L.|editor-last3=Finchilescu|editor-first3=G.|editor-last4=Tredoux|editor-first4=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accumulation of new resources and perspectives in our self-concept leads to a need for self-integration (i.e. combining different resources, identities and perspectives into single overarching self-concept). An excessive amount of self-expansion without proper self-integration can be quite stressful (e.g. moving to a new city, or starting a new job). It has been suggested that when a person is socially stable, self-expansion via an outgroup member is most likely to be successful. Consequently, the likelihood for cross-group contact and the inclusion of the outgroup in the self is dependent on the degree of self-expansion in other domains. Expansion = motivation and believing.

===Self-expansion beyond relationships===
More recently, self-expansion research has begun to shift away from investigating self-expansion in a social context (e.g. romantic relationships)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Helen E.|last2=Xu|first2=Xiaomeng|last3=Aron|first3=Arthur|last4=Brown|first4=Lucy L.|date=2016|title=Intense, Passionate, Romantic Love: A Natural Addiction?

Similar to findings from social self-expansion literature, individual self-expansion also has positive effects and includes the same processes (e.g. motivation, self-efficacy). Self-expansion has also been presented theoretically within a framework of self-concept change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mattingly | first1=Brent A. | last2=Lewandowski | first2=Gary W. | last3=McIntyre | first3=Kevin P. | title="You make me a better/worse person": A two-dimensional model of relationship self-change | journal=Personal Relationships | date=1 March 2014 | pages=176–190 | doi=10.1111/pere.12025 | issn=1475-6811 | volume=21 | issue=1 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, self-concept change can be thought of as occurring along two independent dimensions: valence (positive vs. negative content) and direction of change (increase vs. decrease in content) and self-expansion represents one of the four possible processes of self-concept change (increasing positive content).

'''Sexual and reproductive health and rights''' or ''SRHR'' is an  of [[human rights]] applied to [[sexuality]] and [[reproduction]]. It is a combination of four fields that in some contexts are more or less distinct from each other, but less so or not at all in other contexts. These four fields are [[sexual health]], [[Universal Declaration of Sexual Rights|sexual rights]], [[reproductive health]] and [[reproductive rights]]. In the concept of SRHR, these four fields are treated as separate but inherently intertwined.

Distinctions between these four fields are not always made. Sexual health and reproductive health are sometimes treated as synonymous to each other, as are sexual rights and reproductive rights. In some cases, sexual rights are included in the term sexual health, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ippf.org/resource/IPPF-Charter-Sexual-and-Reproductive-Rights|title=IPPF Charter on Sexual and Reproductive Rights Guidelines | date = 22 November 2011 | publisher= IPPF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do different [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) and governments{{cn|date=May 2018}} use different terminologies, but different terminologies are often used within the same organization.

Some of the notable global NGOs that fight for sexual and reproductive health and rights include [[International Planned Parenthood Federation|IPPF]] (International Planned Parenthood Federation), [[ILGA]] (International Lesbian and Gay Alliance), WAS ([[World Association for Sexual Health]] - formerly known as World Association for Sexology), and International HIV/AIDS Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131206105333/http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-date = 6 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | title = SRHR and HIV | publisher = International HIV/AIDS Alliance | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616041715/http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-date = 16 June 2011 | dead-url = yes | title = Members of EuroNGOs | publisher = EuroNGOs | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual health==
The [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/sexual_health/en/|title=Sexual health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines sexual health as: "Sexual health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."

==Sexual rights==
Unlike the other three aspects of SRHR, the struggle for sexual rights include, and focus on, sexual pleasure and emotional sexual expression. One platform for this struggle is the [[World Association for Sexual Health|WAS]] Declaration of Sexual Rights.

The Platform for Action from the [[1995 Beijing Conference on Women]] established that human rights include the right of women freely and without coercion, violence or discrimination, to have control over and make decisions concerning their own sexuality, including their own sexual and reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ | title = Beijing Platform for Action, paragraphs 92, 93 and 96 | publisher = United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women | date = September 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paragraph has been interpreted by some countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sweden's international policy on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights" | url = http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | website = www.regeringen.se | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001157/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | archivedate = 2014-05-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the applicable definition of women’s sexual rights. The UN Commission on Human Rights has established that if women had more power, their ability to protect themselves against violence would be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/84: The protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-84.doc | date = 21 April 2005 | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 20 April 2005 | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/41: Elimination of violence against women | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-41.doc | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14th World Congress of Sexology (Hong Kong, 1999), the WAS adopted the [[Declaration of Sexual Rights]], which originally included 11 sexual rights. It was heavily revised and expanded in March 2014 by the WAS Advisory Council to include 16 sexual rights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsexology.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/declaration_of_sexual_rights_sep03_2014.pdf |title=Declaration of sexual rights' |publisher=Worldsexology.org |date=2014-03-01 |access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Declaration influenced [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] (which were launched as a set of international principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity on 26 March 2007), especially on the idea of each person's [[integrity]], and right to sexual and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yogyakartaprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/A5_yogyakartaWEB-2.pdf | title = The Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity | work = Yogyakartaprinciples.org | date = 10 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the U.S. government said it would begin using the term "sexual rights" in discussions of human rights and global development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/us-government-says-it-will-now-use-the-term-sexual-rights/ar-AAer3sZ?li=AAa0dzB&amp;ocid=HPCDHP |title=US government says it will now use the term 'sexual rights' |publisher=Msn.com |date=2015-06-26 |access-date=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive health==
{{Main article|Reproductive health}}
Within the framework of the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) definition of [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, '''reproductive health''', or '''sexual health'''/'''hygiene''', addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/|title=WHO: Reproductive health|access-date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and [[Safer sex|safer sex life]] and that they have the capability to reproduce and the [[Family planning|freedom to decide]] if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be [[sex education|informed]] of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of [[birth control]]; also access to appropriate [[reproductive medicine|health care services]] of [[sexual medicine|sexual]], [[reproductive medicine]] and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of [[maternal health|women to go safely]] through [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. On the other hand, individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall KS, Moreau C, Trussell J | title = Determinants of and disparities in reproductive health service use among adolescent and young adult women in the United States, 2002-2008 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–67 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22390451 | pmc = 3483992 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive Rights==
{{Main article|Reproductive rights}}
'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name="Cook_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Rebecca J. | last2 = Fathalla | first2 = Mahmoud F. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives | date = September 1996 | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 115 | doi = 10.2307/2950752 | jstor = 2950752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html|title=Sexual and reproductive health | publisher = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Goals and objectives ==
Despite frequent changes to frameworks, overall goals for SRHR remain little changed. As first stipulated at the ICPD, universal reproductive health care remains the ultimate objective, and with each new framework, targets are developed to progress towards this.&lt;ref name="Tangcharoensathien_2015" /&gt; In the original ICPD Program of Action, the primary call was for universal access to healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, family planning and sexual health.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt; Over time, these have expanded to include the right to access education regarding sexual and reproductive health, an end to [[female genital mutilation]], and increased women's empowerment in social, political, and cultural spheres.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt;

Special goals and targets were also created to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs. Adolescents are often the most vulnerable to risks associated with sexual activity, including HIV, due to personal and social issues such as feelings of isolation, child marriage, and stigmatization.&lt;ref name="Hindin_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindin MJ, Fatusi AO | title = Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in developing countries: an overview of trends and interventions | journal = International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 58–62 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19620089 | doi = 10.1363/ipsrh.35.058.09 | jstor = 40233805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments realized the importance of investing in the health of adolescents as a means of establishing future well-being for their societies.&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra-Mouli V, Svanemyr J, Amin A, Fogstad H, Say L, Girard F, Temmerman M | title = Twenty years after International Conference on Population and Development: where are we with adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights? | language = English | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 56 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = S1-6 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25528975 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Commission on Population and Development]] developed a series of fundamental rights for adolescents including the right to comprehensive sex education, the right to decide all matters related to their sexuality, and access to sexual and reproductive health services without discrimination (including safe abortions wherever legal).&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015" /&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7399">In [[information theory]] and telecommunication engineering, the  '''signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio''' ('''SINR'''&lt;ref name="Haenggi2009"/&gt;) (also known as the '''signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio''' ('''SNIR''')&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"/&gt;)  is a quantity used to give theoretical upper bounds on [[channel capacity]] (or the rate of information transfer) in wireless communication systems such as networks. Analogous to the SNR used often in wired communications systems, the SINR is defined as the power of a certain signal of interest divided by the sum of the [[Interference (communication)|interference]] power (from all the other interfering signals) and the power of some background noise. If the power of noise term is zero, then the SINR reduces to the [[signal-to-interference ratio]] (SIR). Conversely, zero interference reduces the SINR to the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR), which is used less often when developing [[mathematical models]] of wireless networks such as [[cellular networks]].&lt;ref name="andrews2010primer"&gt;J. G. Andrews, R. K. Ganti, M. Haenggi, N. Jindal, and S. Weber. A primer on spatial modeling and analysis in wireless networks. ''Communications Magazine, IEEE'', 48(11):156--163, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity and randomness of certain types of wireless networks and signal propagation has motivated the use of [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks|stochastic geometry models]] in order to model the SINR, particularly for cellular or mobile phone networks.&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"&gt;M. Haenggi. ''Stochastic geometry for wireless networks''. Cambridge University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
SINR is commonly used in [[wireless communication]] as a way to measure the quality of wireless connections. Typically, the energy of a signal fades with distance, which is referred to as a [[path loss]] in wireless networks. Conversely, in wired networks the existence of a wired path between the sender or transmitter and the receiver determines the correct reception of data. In a wireless network ones has to take other factors into account (e.g. the background noise, interfering strength of other simultaneous transmission). The concept of SINR attempts to create a representation of this aspect.

==Mathematical definition==
The definition of SINR is usually defined for a particular receiver (or user). In particular, for a receiver located at some point ''x'' in space (usually, on the plane), then its corresponding SINR given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x) {{=}} \frac{P}{I+N} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the power of the incoming signal of interest, ''I'' is the interference power of the other (interfering) signals in the network, and ''N'' is some noise term, which may be a constant or random. Like other ratios in electronic engineering and related fields, the SINR is often expressed in [[decibel]]s or dB.

==Propagation model==
To develop a mathematical model for estimating the SINR, a suitable [[mathematical model]] is needed to represent the propagation of the incoming signal and the interfering signals. A common model approach is to assume the [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks#Model fundamentals#Propagation model|propagation model]] consists of a random component and non-random (or deterministic) component.&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Blaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume I --- Theory'', volume 3, No 3--4 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Blaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume II --- Applications'', volume 4, No 1--2 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deterministic component seeks to capture how a signal decays or attenuates as it travels a medium such as air, which is done by introducing a path-loss or attenuation function. A common choice for the path-loss function is a simple power-law. For example, if a signal travels from point ''x'' to point ''y'',  then it decays by a factor given by the path-loss function

:&lt;math&gt;  \ell(|x-y|)=  |x-y|^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

where the path-loss exponent '' α&gt;2'', and ''|x-y|'' denotes the [[Euclidean distance|distance]] between point ''y'' of the user and the signal source at point ''x''. Although this model suffers from a singularity (when ''x=y''), its simple nature results in it often being used due to the relatively tractable models it gives.&lt;ref name="andrews2010primer"/&gt; Exponential functions are sometimes used to model fast decaying signals.&lt;ref name="Haenggi2009"&gt;M. Haenggi, J. Andrews, F. Baccelli, O. Dousse, and M. Franceschetti. Stochastic geometry and random graphs for the analysis and design of wireless networks. ''IEEE JSAC'', 27(7):1029--1046, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The random component of the model entails representing [[multipath fading]] of the signal, which is caused by  signals colliding with and reflecting off various obstacles such as buildings. This is incorporated into the model by introducing a [[random variable]] with some [[probability distribution]]. The probability distribution is chosen depending on the type of fading model and include [[Rayleigh distribution|Rayleigh]], [[Rician distribution|Rician]], [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal shadow]] (or shadowing), and [[Nakagami distribution|Nakagami]].

==SINR model==
The propagation model leads to a model for the SINR.&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt; Consider a collection of 'n' base stations located at points ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the plane or 3D space. Then for a user located at, say ''x=0'', then the SINR for a signal coming from base station, say, ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', is given by



:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x_i) {{=}} \frac{\frac{F_i}{\ell(|x_i|)}}{\sum_{j\neq i} [\frac{F_j}{\ell(|x_j|)}] +N} &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are fading [[random variables]] of some distribution. Under the simple power-law path-loss model becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x_i) {{=}} \frac{\frac{F_i}{|x_i|^{\alpha}}}{\sum_{j\neq i} \frac{F_j}{|x_j|^{\alpha}} +N} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Stochastic geometry models==
In wireless networks, the factors that contribute to the SINR are often random (or appear random) including the signal propagation and the positioning of network transmitters and receivers. Consequently, in recent years this has motivated research in developing tractable [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks|stochastic geometry models]] in order to estimate the SINR in wireless networks. The related field of [[continuum percolation theory]] has also been used to derive  bounds on the SINR in wireless networks.&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"&gt;M. Franceschetti and R. Meester. ''Random networks for communication: from statistical physics to information systems'', volume 24. Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meester1996continuum"&gt;R. Meester. ''Continuum percolation'', volume 119. Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spread the Word to End the Word''' is a United States national campaign to encourage people to pledge to stop using the word ''[[Mental retardation|retard]]''.

End the [[Retard (pejorative)|"R" word]] advocates believe the use of the word “retard” in colloquial and everyday speech is hurtful and dehumanizing to individuals with special needs. According to R-word.org,  "The R-word hurts because it is exclusive. It's offensive. It's derogatory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.r-word.org/r-word-why-pledge.aspx#.WpYHOGaZOqA|title=Special Olympics: Why Pledge|website=www.r-word.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They advocate for the use of language that respects the dignity of people with mental disabilities. Advocates believe individuals with cognitive disabilities are capable of enjoying life’s experiences and that causal references to the words ''retard'' or ''retarded'' makes a person with intellectual disabilities feel "less than human."

==History==
The Spread the Word to End the Word movement was established in 2009 during the Special Olympics Global Youth Activation Summit at the [[2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games]]. The Spread the Word to End the Word movement was created by youth with and without intellectual disabilities.  According to the Special Olympics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The motivation for the campaign was driven by a united passion to promote the positive contributions people with intellectual disabilities make to communities around the world combined with a simple call to action that also symbolizes positive attitude change and a commitment to make the world a more accepting place for all people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.specialolympics.org/03-31-09_Spread_the_Word.aspx | title=Spread the Word to End the Word | publisher=Special Olympics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 31, 2009 the campaign celebrated the 1st Annual Spread the Word to End the Word National Awareness Day. Across the country, students of all ages made a pledge to eliminate "[[Mental retardation|retard]]" from their vocabulary and encourage others to do the same. In 2010, the 2nd Annual Spread the Word to End the Word National Day of Awareness took place on March 3, 2010.

In January 2010, the news of the past summer use of "retards" by White House chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] to describe liberal groups planning attack ads on Democrats was reported in the Wall Street Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chief of Staff Draws Fire From Left as Obama Falters|author=PETER WALLSTEN|date=2010-01-26|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703808904575025030384695158|accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Emanuel's apologizing to [[Tim Shriver]], chief executive of the Special Olympics.  A meeting was held with Emanuel, who was asked to visit www.r-word.org, and he promised to take the R-word pledge.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''straight-line diagram''' (abbreviated '''SLD''') is a diagram of a road where the road is shown as a [[straight line]]. Such diagrams are usually produced by a highway department, and display features along the road, including bridges and intersecting roads. Rows below the diagram show data about the road, usually including speed limit, number of lanes, bridge numbers, and historical data, among other data. Subway lines also frequently employ straight-line diagrams.

An internal SLD viewing system may also include links to other internal data, including photos or plans. Public SLDs are distributed in formats including [[portable document format|PDF]] and [[tagged image file format|TIFF]].

In Australia, "strip maps", which serve a similar function, are distributed by state automobile associations.

'''Success is Unbounded''' refers to the nature of success. It is a subtopic of [[Social status]]. Success in Scence of Success is equivalent to recognition, be it the recognition of an individual or a team. It is most easily measured by indices on the internet, for example with number of followers, numbers of [[Google]] hits, etc. It is correlated with the performance in the field in which they compete with others for the recognition. The first to investigate this phenomena was [[Vilfredo Pareto|Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto]] as [[Pareto principle]] he investigated it in the question of wealth. The distribution of success has been investigated in economics as well, and it has been verified that the success distribution follows a [[Power law]] distribution&lt;ref&gt;S. Rosen. "[http://home.uchicago.edu/~vlima/courses/econ201/Superstars.pdf The Economics of Superstars]" The American Economics Review Volume 71. Issue 5. (Dec.1981) 845-858&lt;/ref&gt;. According to these results the relationship between quality and recognition works in a way that the effect of an additional amount of quality on success is increasing as quality increases. The higher performance the individual produces the higher is the marginal gain of success from an additional amount of performance measure. It means that success is distributed in a way that the vast majority have low success measure, while there are few who achieved extremely high values of success and even between these top performers there are [[order of magnitude]] diffferences in success even though there is close to no extreme in performance.

== Consequences[edit] ==
The [[Poisson distribution]] of the performance&lt;ref&gt;Barabási, Albert-László; Bonabeau, Eric (May 2003). "[http://barabasi.com/f/124.pdf Scale-Free Networks]" (PDF). ''Scientific American''. '''288''' (5): 50–9.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Power law distribution of success combined are able to produce superstars. The individuals or teams with extremely high amount of recognition even compared to the others with just slightly smaller performance value. So there are large amounts of individuals with small amount of recognition, and just a few individuals with outstanding recognition. It can be observed in many fields from earnings to telephone calls, and even outside of the question of recognition and performance there are natural phenomenons which follow the Power law distribution such as earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, MEJ (2005) '[http://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~tas110/Teaching/Lectures/L4/Material/Newman05.pdf Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf's law]', Contemporary Physics, 46:5, 323 - 351&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
System dynamics is a methodology and mathematical modeling technique to frame, understand, and discuss complex issues and problems. Originally developed in the 1950s to help corporate managers improve their understanding of industrial processes, SD is currently being used throughout the public and private sector for policy analysis and design.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

Convenient [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) system dynamics software developed into user friendly versions by the 1990s and have been applied to diverse systems. SD models solve the problem of simultaneity (mutual causation) by updating all variables in small time increments with positive and negative feedbacks and time delays structuring the interactions and control. The best known SD model is probably the 1972 ''[[The Limits to Growth]]''. This model forecast that exponential growth of population and capital, with finite resource sources and sinks and perception delays, would lead to economic collapse during the 21st century under a wide variety of growth scenarios.

System dynamics is an aspect of [[systems theory]] as a method to understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system, the many circular, interlocking, sometimes time-delayed relationships among its components, is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are [[chaos theory]] and [[social dynamics]]. It is also claimed that because there are often properties-of-the-whole which cannot be found among the properties-of-the-elements, in some cases the behavior of the whole cannot be explained in terms of the behavior of the parts.

==History==
System dynamics was created during the mid-1950s&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, Jay (1971). Counterintuitive behavior of social systems. Technology Review 73(3): 52–68&lt;/ref&gt; by Professor [[Jay Forrester]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1956, Forrester accepted a professorship in the newly formed [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. His initial goal was to determine how his background in science and engineering could be brought to bear, in some useful way, on the core issues that determine the success or failure of corporations. Forrester's insights into the common foundations that underlie engineering, which led to the creation of system dynamics, were triggered, to a large degree, by his involvement with managers at [[General Electric]] (GE) during the mid-1950s. At that time, the managers at GE were perplexed because employment at their appliance plants in Kentucky exhibited a significant three-year cycle. The [[business cycle]] was judged to be an insufficient explanation for the employment instability. From hand simulations (or calculations) of the stock-flow-feedback structure of the GE plants, which included the existing corporate decision-making structure for hiring and layoffs, Forrester was able to show how the instability in GE employment was due to the internal structure of the firm and not to an external force such as the business cycle. These hand simulations were the start of the field of system dynamics.&lt;ref name="UDE"&gt;Michael J. Radzicki and Robert A. Taylor (2008). [http://www.systemdynamics.org/DL-IntroSysDyn/start.htm "Origin of System Dynamics: Jay W. Forrester and the History of System Dynamics"]. In: ''U.S. Department of Energy's Introduction to System Dynamics''. Retrieved 23 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Forrester and a team of graduate students moved the emerging field of system dynamics from the hand-simulation stage to the formal [[computer modeling]] stage. [[Richard Bennett (computer scientist)|Richard Bennett]] created the first system dynamics computer modeling language called SIMPLE (Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations) in the spring of 1958. In 1959, [[Phyllis Fox]] and [[Alexander Pugh]] wrote the first version of
[[DYNAMO (programming language)|DYNAMO]] (DYNAmic MOdels), an improved version of SIMPLE, and the system dynamics language became the industry standard for over thirty years. Forrester published the first, and still classic, book in the field titled ''Industrial Dynamics'' in 1961.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

From the late 1950s to the late 1960s, system dynamics was applied almost exclusively to corporate/managerial problems. In 1968, however, an unexpected occurrence caused the field to broaden beyond corporate modeling. [[John F. Collins]], the former mayor of Boston, was appointed a visiting professor of Urban Affairs at MIT. The result of the Collins-Forrester collaboration was a book titled ''Urban Dynamics''. The [[Urban Dynamics]] model presented in the book was the first major non-corporate application of system dynamics.&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

The second major noncorporate application of system dynamics came shortly after the first. In 1970, Jay Forrester was invited by the [[Club of Rome]] to a meeting in Bern, Switzerland. The Club of Rome is an organization devoted to solving what its members describe as the "predicament of mankind"—that is, the global crisis that may appear sometime in the future, due to the demands being placed on the Earth's [[carrying capacity]] (its sources of renewable and nonrenewable resources and its sinks for the disposal of pollutants) by the world's exponentially growing population. At the Bern meeting, Forrester was asked if system dynamics could be used to address the predicament of mankind. His answer, of course, was that it could. On the plane back from the Bern meeting, Forrester created the first draft of a system dynamics model of the world's socioeconomic system. He called this model WORLD1. Upon his return to the United States, Forrester refined WORLD1 in preparation for a visit to MIT by members of the Club of Rome. Forrester called the refined version of the model WORLD2. Forrester published WORLD2 in a book titled [[World Dynamics]].&lt;ref name ="UDE"/&gt;

==Topics in systems dynamics==
The elements of system dynamics diagrams are feedback, accumulation of flows into stocks and time delays.

As an illustration of the use of system dynamics, imagine an organisation that plans to introduce an innovative new durable consumer product.  The organisation needs to understand the possible [[market dynamics]] in order to design marketing and production plans.

===Causal loop diagrams===
{{Main article|Causal loop diagram}}
In the system dynamics methodology, a problem or a system (e.g., ecosystem, political system or mechanical system) may be represented as a [[causal loop diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, John D. (2000). Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World. New York: McGraw&lt;/ref&gt; A causal loop diagram is a simple map of a system with all its constituent components and their interactions. By capturing interactions and consequently the feedback loops (see figure below), a causal loop diagram reveals the structure of a system. By understanding the structure of a system, it becomes possible to ascertain a system’s behavior over a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, Donella. (2008). Thinking in Systems: A Primer. Earthscan&lt;/ref&gt;

The causal loop diagram of the new product introduction may look as follows:

[[Image:Adoption CLD.svg|centre|Causal loop diagram of ''New product adoption'' model|frame]]

There are two feedback loops in this diagram.  The positive reinforcement (labeled R) loop on the right indicates that the more people have already adopted the new product, the stronger the word-of-mouth impact.  There will be more references to the product, more demonstrations, and more reviews.  This positive feedback should generate sales that continue to grow.

The second feedback loop on the left is negative reinforcement (or "balancing" and hence labeled B).  Clearly, growth cannot continue forever, because as more and more people adopt, there remain fewer and fewer potential adopters.

Both feedback loops act simultaneously, but at different times they may have different strengths.  Thus one might expect growing sales in the initial years, and then declining sales in the later years. However, in general a causal loop diagram does not specify the structure of a system sufficiently to permit determination of its behavior from the visual representation alone.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G. P. (1986), Problems with causal-loop diagrams. Syst. Dyn. Rev., 2: 158–170. doi:10.1002/sdr.4260020207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock and flow diagrams===
{{Main article|Stock and flow}}
Causal loop diagrams aid in visualizing a system’s structure and behavior, and analyzing the system qualitatively. To perform a more detailed quantitative analysis, a causal loop diagram is transformed to a [[stock and flow]] diagram. A stock and flow model helps in studying and analyzing the system in a quantitative way; such models are usually built and simulated using computer software.

A stock is the term for any entity that accumulates or depletes over time.  A flow is the rate of change in a stock.

[[Image:Simple stock and flow diagram.gif|centre|frame|A flow is the rate of accumulation of the stock]]

In our example, there are two stocks: Potential adopters and Adopters.  There is one flow: New adopters.  For every new adopter, the stock of potential adopters declines by one, and the stock of adopters increases by one.

[[Image:Adoption SFD.png|centre|Stock and flow diagram of ''New product adoption'' model|frame]]

===Equations===
The real power of system dynamics is utilised through simulation.  Although it is possible to perform the modeling in a [[spreadsheet]], there are a [[Comparison of system dynamics software|variety of software]] packages that have been optimised for this.

The steps involved in a simulation are:

*Define the problem boundary
*Identify the most important stocks and flows that change these stock levels
*Identify sources of information that impact the flows
*Identify the main feedback loops
*Draw a causal loop diagram that links the stocks, flows and sources of information
*Write the equations that determine the flows
*Estimate the parameters and initial conditions.  These can be estimated using statistical methods, expert opinion, market research data or other relevant sources of information.&lt;ref name="Sterman2001CMR"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sterman |first=John D. |year=2001 |month= |title=System dynamics modeling: Tools for learning in a complex world |journal=California management review |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=8–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Simulate the model and analyse results.

In this example, the equations that change the two stocks via the flow are:

 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Potential adopters} = \int_{0} ^{t} \mbox{-New adopters }\,dt &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- I don't want to mark up this great contribution, but shouldn't this be something like potential adopters at t(0) - sum(new adopters at t(i))? Yes --&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Adopters} = \int_{0} ^{t} \mbox{New adopters }\,dt &lt;/math&gt;

===Equations in discrete time===
List of all the equations in [[discrete time]], in their order of execution in each year, for years 1 to 15 :

 &lt;math&gt;1) \ \mbox{Probability that contact has not yet adopted}=\mbox{Potential adopters} / (\mbox{Potential adopters } + \mbox{ Adopters}) &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;2) \ \mbox{Imitators}=q \cdot \mbox{Adopters} \cdot \mbox{Probability that contact has not yet adopted}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;3) \ \mbox{Innovators}=p \cdot \mbox{Potential adopters} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4) \ \mbox{New adopters}=\mbox{Innovators}+\mbox{Imitators} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4.1) \ \mbox{Potential adopters}\ -= \mbox{New adopters }&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4.2) \ \mbox{Adopters}\ += \mbox{New adopters }&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\ p=0.03 &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ q=0.4 &lt;/math&gt;

====Dynamic simulation results====
The dynamic simulation results show that the behaviour of the system would be to have growth in ''adopters'' that follows a classic s-curve shape.&lt;br /&gt;
The increase in ''adopters'' is very slow initially, then exponential growth for a period, followed ultimately by saturation.

[[Image:SFDD VAL.gif|centre|Stocks and flows values for years = 0 to 15|frame]]
4588

===Equations in continuous time===
To get intermediate values and better accuracy, the model can run in continuous time: we multiply the number of units of time and we proportionally divide values that change stock levels. In this example we multiply the 15 years by 4 to obtain 60 trimesters, and we divide the value of the flow by 4.&lt;br&gt;
Dividing the value is the simplest with the [[Euler method]], but other methods could be employed instead, such as [[Runge–Kutta methods]].

List of the equations in continuous time for trimesters = 1 to 60 :
*They are the same equations as in the section ''Equation in discrete time'' above, except equations ''4.1'' and ''4.2'' replaced by following :
 &lt;math&gt;10) \ \mbox{Valve New adopters}\ = \mbox{New adopters} \cdot TimeStep &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;10.1) \ \mbox{Potential adopters}\ -= \mbox{Valve New adopters} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;10.2) \ \mbox{Adopters}\ += \mbox{Valve New adopters } &lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt; \ TimeStep = 1/4 &lt;/math&gt;

*In the below stock and flow diagram, the intermediate flow 'Valve New adopters' calculates the equation :
 &lt;math&gt; \ \mbox{Valve New adopters}\ = \mbox{New adopters } \cdot TimeStep &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Adaption SFD continuous time.png|centre|Dynamic stock and flow diagram of ''New product adoption'' model in continuous time|frame]]

==Application==
System dynamics has found application in a wide range of areas, for example [[Population dynamics|population]], agriculture&lt;ref&gt;F. H. A. Rahim, N. N. Hawari and N. Z. Abidin, “Supply and demand of rice in Malaysia: A system dynamics approach”, International Journal of Supply Chain and Management, Vol.6, No.4, pp. 234-240, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Ecosystem model|ecological]] and [[Economics|economic]] systems, which usually interact strongly with each other.

System dynamics have various "back of the envelope" management applications. They are a potent tool to:
*Teach [[system thinking]] reflexes to persons being coached
*Analyze and compare assumptions and [[mental model]]s about the way things work
*Gain qualitative insight into the workings of a system or the consequences of a decision
*Recognize archetypes of dysfunctional systems in everyday practice

Computer software is used to [[computer simulation|simulate]] a system dynamics [[model (abstract)|model]] of the situation being studied. Running "what if" simulations to test certain policies on such a model can greatly aid in understanding how the system changes over time.  System dynamics is very similar to [[systems thinking]] and constructs the same [[causal loop diagram]]s of systems with feedback.  However, system dynamics typically goes further and utilises simulation to study the behaviour of systems and the impact of alternative policies.&lt;ref name="SysDynSociety"&gt;[http://www.systemdynamics.org/ System Dynamics Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

System dynamics has been used to investigate resource dependencies, and resulting problems, in product development.&lt;ref name="Repenning:2001kx"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Repenning |first=Nelson P. |year=2001 |month= |title= Understanding fire fighting in new product development |journal= The Journal of Product Innovation Management |volume= 18 |issue=5|pages= 285–300|doi= 10.1016/S0737-6782(01)00099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Repenning:1999ng"&gt;Nelson P.

A system dynamics approach to  [[macroeconomics]], known as ''[[Minsky (economic simulator)|Minsky]]'',  has been developed by the economist [[Steve Keen]].&lt;ref name="SForge"&gt;&amp;nbsp;[http://sourceforge.net/blog/january-2014-potm/&amp;nbsp;SourceForge]&amp;nbsp;Minsky&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Project of the month January 2014. Interview with Minsky development team. Accessed January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used to successfully model world economic behaviour from the apparent stability of the [[Great Moderation]] to the sudden unexpected [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]].

===Example===
[[Image:Causal Loop Diagram of a Model.png|thumb|600px|center|Causal loop diagram of a model examining the growth or decline of a life insurance company.&lt;ref name ="Tay Feedback"/&gt;]]

The figure above is a causal loop diagram of a system dynamics model created to examine forces that may be responsible for the growth or decline of [[life insurance]] companies in the [[United Kingdom]]. A number of this figure's features are worth mentioning. The first is that the model's negative feedback loops are identified by ''C's'', which stand for ''Counteracting'' loops. The second is that double slashes are used to indicate places where there is a significant delay between causes (i.e., variables at the tails of arrows) and effects (i.e., variables at the heads of arrows). This is a common causal loop diagramming convention in system dynamics. Third, is that thicker lines are used to identify the feedback loops and links that author wishes the audience to focus on. This is also a common system dynamics diagramming convention. Last, it is clear that a decision maker would find it impossible to think through the dynamic behavior inherent in the model, from inspection of the figure alone.&lt;ref name ="Tay Feedback"&gt;Michael J. Radzicki and Robert A. Taylor (2008). [http://www.systemdynamics.org/DL-IntroSysDyn/start.htm "Feedback"]. In: ''U.S. Department of Energy's Introduction to System Dynamics''. Retrieved 23 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example of piston motion ===
# Objective: study of a crank-connecting rod system.&lt;br /&gt; We want to model a crank-connecting rod system through a system dynamic model. Two different full descriptions of the physical system with related systems of equations can be found  [[Piston motion equations#Position|here]] {{en icon}} and [[:fr:Système bielle-manivelle#Équations horaires|here]] {{fr icon}}; they give the same results. In this example, the crank, with variable radius and angular frequency, will drive a piston with a variable connecting rod length.
# System dynamic modeling: the system is now modeled, according to a stock and flow system dynamic logic.&lt;br /&gt; The figure below shows the stock and flow diagram [[Image:TRUE Piston SFD.png|centre|Stock and flow diagram for crank-connecting rod system|frame]]
# Simulation: the behavior of the crank-connecting rod dynamic system can then be simulated.&lt;br /&gt; The next figure is a 3D simulation created using [[procedural animation]]. Variables of the model animate all parts of this animation: crank, radius, angular frequency, rod length, and piston position.

'''''The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War''''' is a book by [[Lynn H. Nicholas]] and a subsequent documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2001-05/conversation.html|title=On the Trail of Lost Art: A Conversation with Lynn H. Nicholas|work=Humanities, September/October 2000, Volume 22/Number 3|accessdate=2008-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explores the [[Nazi plunder]] of [[looted art]] treasures from occupied countries and the consequences. It covers a range of associated activities: Nazi appropriation and storage, patriotic concealment and smuggling during [[World War II]], discoveries by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], and the extraordinary tasks of preserving, tracking, and returning by the [[Monuments Men|American Monuments officers]] and their colleagues.&lt;ref name="ROE"&gt;{{cite book | last= Nicholas | first= Lynn H. | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | origyear=1994 |date=May 1995 | publisher=[[Vintage Books]] | location=[[New York City]] | isbn=978-0-679-40069-1 | oclc=32531154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas was awarded the [[Légion d'Honneur]] by France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/therapeofeuropa/about/filmmakers.html Nicholas awarded Légion d'Honneur]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the regular accounts of impending destruction of art works, Nicholas also recounts a veneration for art on the part of people of all sides of the conflict, and what amounts to desperate and sometimes heroic activity. The villains, unsurprisingly, are often the Nazis, particularly [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Hermann Göring]]; however, the activities of Western art dealers are often questionable, as well.

==Contents==
The book is chronological, starting with scattered events in the decade before World War II. During this time, the Nazis used their influence and money to acquire artwork, while dealers and the public at large were anticipating war. Discussion of [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi occupation]] starts in the third chapter. The middle of the book discusses Nazi plundering during the war, as well as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] efforts to safeguard their treasures. Midway through the book, the role of American and Allied organizations is introduced, including the frustratingly tentative planning and lack of resources they faced. The book follows the path of liberation as the Allies push back the [[Axis Powers|Axis]], while missing art is searched for and recovered art conserved. The book concludes with chapters about post war activities: resolving problems of ownership, coordinating the return of stolen art, and attempting to collect what was yet missing. Philosophically intriguing are issues of who ultimately owns works of art. Since this last phase of recovery and restitution is ongoing, this book has a bearing on current activities.

==Awards==
The book won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for general non-fiction in 1994.

It was adapted for a film of the same name released in 2006. It was made for 1.3 million USD, with half underwritten by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the remainder underwritten by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], several other foundations, and one private investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Stewart| first =Anna| title =The Rape of Europa: Oscar Documentary Shortlist| work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date =2007-12-07| url =http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=awardcentral&amp;jump=features&amp;id=eoodocumentaries08&amp;articleid=VR1117977230| accessdate =2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the featured vignettes in the film is Jewish refugee [[Maria Altmann]], who in 2006 restituted [[Gustav Klimt]]'s masterpiece ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rapeofeuropa.com/stolenRestitutions.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biography.com/news/woman-in-gold-maria-altmann-biography&lt;/ref&gt; Altmann was portrayed by [[Helen Mirren]] in the 2015 film ''[[Woman in Gold (film)|Woman in Gold]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9233">'''The Void''' is the [[philosophical]] concept of [[nothingness]] manifested. The notion of the Void is relevant to several realms of [[metaphysics]]. The Void is also prevalent in numerous facets of [[psychology]], notably [[logotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1969-17592-001 |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152855/http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1969-17592-001 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifestation of nothingness is closely associated with the contemplation of [[emptiness]], and with human attempts to identify and personify it. As such, the concept of the Void, and ideas similar to it, have a significant and historically evolving presence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/Extracts/void.htm |title=The Void - Nature of Mind |publisher=Ahalmaas.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in artistic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1992.5112 |title=Yves Klein, Harry Shunk, Janos Kender: Leap into the Void (1992.5112) &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creative expression, as well as in academic, scientific and philosophical debate surrounding the nature of the [[human condition]].

In this sense, knowledge or experience of the Void could be said to actually be [[The Cloud of Unknowing|unknowing]], given its inherent [[ineffability]]. In Western mystical traditions, it was often argued that the transcendent 'Ground of Being' could therefore be approached through aphairesis, a form of negation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morley|first1=Simon|title=The Sublime Unknown|url=https://www.academia.edu/2312305/The_Sublime_Unknown|website=academia.edu|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

Western philosophers have discussed the existence and nature of void since [[Parmenides]] suggested it did not exist and used this to argue for the non-existence of change, motion, differentiation, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diels–Kranz numbering system|DK]] fragment B 8.5–6, 8.22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to Parmenides, [[Democritus]] described the universe as only being composed of atoms and void.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]] ix.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]], in Book IV of ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', denied the existence of the Void ({{lang-el|κενόν}}) with his rejection of finite entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath526/kmath526.htm |title=Continuity and the Void |publisher=Mathpages.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were questions as to whether void was truly nothing or if it was in fact filled with other things, with theories of [[Aether theories|aether]] being suggested in the 18th century to fill the void.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]], The Third Book of ''[[Opticks]]'' (1718).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mysticism==
{{Refimprove|date=October 2016}}

[[Peter Matthiessen]] in ''[[The Snow Leopard]]'' (1978) described an experience of sitting on rocks in the Himalayas as leading to an awareness of a Void at the centre, or the source, of phenomenal existence: "These hard rocks instruct my bones in what my brain could never grasp in the Heart Sutra, that 'form is emptiness and emptiness is form' – the Void, the emptiness of blue-black space, contained in everything."

For [[Ken Wilber]] in ''Spectrum of Consciousness'' (1977), the Void is not mere nothingness, and is therefore distinct from something that can be subsumed into the category of nihilism, and is instead "reality before we slice it up into conceptualism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilber|first1=Ken|title=The Spectrum of Consciousness|date=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=8120818482|page=59|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NIhCMFW5wFAC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=%22the+Void%22+sunyata&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5bizelpLAV&amp;sig=Gm3nAAteUOGYg2N2bo9MXcp05PU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zbymU72hDrD60gX7uoA4&amp;ved=0CGsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20Void%22%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he explores the idea of [[Śūnyatā]], which cannot be "called void or not void; or both or neither" but can be referred to as 'the Void' with, again, the proviso that it exists beyond the limit of language.

[[Stanislav Grof]]'s distinction between holotropic and hylotropic experience is important here, with the former encapsulating experiences which connect to the Void.

The Void is also an important concept in martial arts such as [[Aikido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matthews|first1=Niall|title=Emptiness, Space, Ma ai, Irimi, and the True Void|url=http://www.aikiweb.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21552|website=AikiWeb|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particle physics==
[[Atomic physics]], according to [[Paul Brunton]], has proven that the world "derives from a mysterious No-thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/para/24203 |title=Para #24203 - Notebooks of Paul Brunton |publisher=Wisdomsgoldenrod.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar line of argument is explored in ''The Void'' (2007) by [[Frank Close]], who discusses the concept of 'empty space' from [[Aristotle]] through to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Ernst Mach|Mach]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and beyond (including the idea of an 'aether' and current examinations of the [[Higgs field]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Close|first1=Frank|title=The Void|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oabrCbbMx6oC&amp;dq=%22the+void%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|website=Google Books|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perspective on the matter from a scientific angle is the work of the physicist [[Lawrence Krauss]], particularly his 2012 book ''[[A Universe from Nothing]]'', in which he explores the idea of the universe having been derived from a [[Quantum Vacuum|quantum vacuum]] (which may or may not be the same as a philosophical concept of the nothingness of the Void, depending on how it is defined). A further consideration is the enigmatic nature of [[dark energy]] which may be seen as coterminous with the Void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Ethan Siegel|last1=Siegel|first1=Ethan|title=Empty space has more energy than everything in the Universe, combined|url=http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/07/26/empty-space-has-more-energy-than-everything-in-the-universe-combined/|website=Science Blogs|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work has received sustained criticism from [[David Albert]] and others working in both philosophy and physics.

[[File:Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant, Filter Bed - geograph.org.uk - 1450096.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A trickling filter plant in the [[United Kingdom]]: The effluent from the primary settling tanks is sprayed onto a bed of coarse gravel (Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant)]]

A '''trickling filter''' is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] system. It consists of a fixed bed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s, [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[gravel]], [[slag]], [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], sphagnum [[peat moss]], [[porous media|ceramic]], or plastic media over which [[sewage]] or other [[wastewater]] flows  downward and causes a layer of [[microbial]] slime ([[biofilm]]) to grow, covering the bed of media. [[Wikt:aerobic|Aerobic]] conditions are maintained by splashing, diffusion, and either by [[forced-air]] flowing through the bed or natural convection of air if the filter medium is porous.

The terms '''trickle filter''', '''trickling biofilter''', '''biofilter''', '''biological filter''' and '''biological trickling filter''' are often used to refer to a '''trickling filter'''. These systems have also been described as roughing filters, intermittent filters, packed media bed filters, alternative septic systems, percolating filters, attached growth processes, and fixed film processes.

== Process description ==

Typically, sewage flow enters at a high level and flows through the primary settlement tank. The supernatant from the tank flows into a dosing device, often a tipping bucket which delivers flow to the arms of the filter. The flush of water flows through the arms and exits through a series of holes pointing at an angle downwards. This propels the arms around distributing the liquid evenly over the surface of the filter media.
Most are uncovered (unlike the accompanying diagram) and are freely ventilated to the atmosphere.

The removal of [[pollution|pollutants]] from the waste water stream involves both [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[adsorption]] of [[organic compounds]]  and some inorganic species such as [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions by the layer of microbial [[bio film]].  The filter media is typically chosen to provide a very high surface area to volume. Typical materials are often porous and have considerable internal surface area in addition to the external surface of the medium.  Passage of the waste water over the media provides dissolved [[oxygen]] which the bio-film layer requires for the [[biochemical]] [[oxidation]] of the organic compounds and releases [[carbon dioxide]] gas, water and other oxidized end products. As the bio film layer thickens, it  eventually sloughs off  into the liquid flow and subsequently forms part of the secondary  sludge. Typically, a trickling filter is followed by a [[clarifier]] or [[sedimentation tank]] for the separation and removal of the sloughed film.  Other filters utilizing higher-density media such as sand, foam and peat moss do not produce a sludge that must be removed, but require forced air blowers and backwashing or an enclosed anaerobic environment.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Biofilm===
The bio-film that develops in a trickling filter may become several millimetres thick and is typically a gelatinous matrix that contains many species of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[cilliate]]s and [[amoeba|amoeboid]] protozoa, [[annelid]]s, [[Nematode|round worm]]s and insect larvae and many other micro fauna. This is very different from many other bio-films which may be less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Within the thickness of the biofilm both aerobic and anaerobic zones can exist supporting both oxidative and reductive biological processes. At certain times of year, especially in the spring, rapid growth of organisms in the film may cause the film to be too thick and it may slough off in patches leading to the "spring slough".&lt;ref name="staffuni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/consultancy/dladmin/zCIWEMWWT/Activity5/act5.html|title=Municipal Wastewater Treatment Unit|publisher=Staffordshire University|access-date=19 February 2016}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations==

A typical trickling filter is circular and between 10 metres and 20 metres across and between 2 metres to 3 metres deep. A circular wall, often of brick, contains a bed of filter media which in turn rests on a base of under-drains. These under-drains function both to remove liquid passing through the filter media but also to allow the free passage of air up through the filter media. Mounted in the center over the top of the filter media is a spindle supporting two or more horizontal perforated pipes which extend to the edge of the media. The perforations on the pipes are designed to allow an even flow of liquid over the whole area of the media and are also angled so that when liquid flows from the pipes the whole assembly rotates around the central spindle.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt; Settled sewage is delivered to a reservoir at the centre of the spindle via some form of dosing mechanism, often a tipping bucket device on small filters.

Larger filters may be rectangular and the distribution arms may be driven by hydraulic or electrical systems.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt;

==Types==
Single trickling filters may be used for the treatment of small residential septic tank discharges and very small rural sewage treatment systems. Larger centralized sewage treatment plants typically use many trickling filters in parallel.

Systems can be configured for single-pass use where the treated water is applied to the trickling filter once before being disposed of, or for multi-pass use where a portion of the treated water is cycled back and re-treated via a [[Feedback|closed loop]].  Multi-pass systems result in higher treatment quality and assist in removing Total Nitrogen (TN) levels by promoting [[nitrification]] in the aerobic media bed and [[denitrification]] in the anaerobic septic tank. Some systems use the filters in two banks operated in series so that the wastewater has two passes through a filter with a sedimentation stage between the two passes. Every few days the filters are switched round to balance the load. This method of treatment can improve nitrification and de-nitrification since much of the carbonaceous oxidative material is removed on the first pass through the filters.

=== Media types ===
Trickling may have a variety of types of filter media used to support the biofilm. Types of media most commonly used include [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[pumice]], plastic matrix material, open-cell [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], clinker, gravel, [[sand]] and [[geotextiles]].  Ideal filter medium optimizes [[surface area]] for microbial attachment, wastewater retention time, allows air flow, resists plugging is mechanically robust in all weathers allowing walking access across the filter and does not degrade.  Some residential systems require forced aeration units which will increase maintenance and operational costs.

===Industrial wastewater treatment===

The treatment of industrial wastewater may involve specialized trickling filters which use plastic media and high flow rates. Wastewaters from a variety of industrial processes have been treated in trickling filters. Such industrial wastewater trickling filters consist of two types:

* Large tanks or concrete enclosures filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Course ChE 101.11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728064144/http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt |date=2011-07-28 }} Saudi Aramco Engineering Development Program, pages 62-65 including Figure 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vertical towers filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4351729&amp;id=U3c8AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=trickle+filter+%22packed+tower%22+wastewater Biological filter and process] U.S. patent 4,351,729, September 28, 1982, Assigned to Celanese Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.auburn.edu/~davisda/classes/facilities/presentations/Recirc_overview.pdf Lecture] by Dr. Allen Davis, [[Auburn University]], page 6 of 8 pdf pages including schematic of packed tower trickling filter){{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of inexpensive plastic tower packings has led to their use as trickling filter beds in tall towers, some as high as 20 meters.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R. |title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1967|lccn=67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1960s, such towers were in use at: the Great Northern Oil's [[Pine Bend Refinery]] in [[Minnesota]]; the Cities Service Oil Company Trafalgar Refinery in [[Oakville, Ontario]] and at a kraft paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Bryan and D.H. Moeller, ''Aerobic Biological Oxidation Using Dowpac'', Paper 42, Conference on Biological Waste Treatment, Manhattan College, April 20, 1960. [http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~alleman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treated water effluent from industrial wastewater trickling filters is typically processed in a clarifier to remove the sludge that sloughs off the microbial slime layer attached to the trickling filter media as for other trickling filter applications.

Some of the latest trickle filter technology involves aerated biofilters of  plastic media in vessels using blowers to inject air at the bottom of the vessels, with either downflow or upflow of the wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Van Sperling|title= Activated Sludge and Aerobic Biofilm Reactors|edition= |publisher =IWA Publications|year=2007|isbn=1-84339-165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rabbit-erosion.jpg|thumb|An [[erosion|erosion gully]] in Australia caused by rabbits. The release of [[rabbits in Australia]] for hunting purposes has had serious unintended ecological consequences.]]
In the [[social sciences]], '''unintended consequences''' (sometimes '''unanticipated consequences''' or '''unforeseen consequences''') are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/nyregion/robert-k-merton-versatile-sociologist-and-father-of-the-focus-group-dies-at-92.html Robert K. Merton, Versatile Sociologist and Father of the Focus Group, Dies at 92], Michael T. Kaufman, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types:
* ''Unexpected benefit'':  A positive unexpected benefit (also referred to as [[luck]], [[serendipity]] or a [[wikt:windfall|windfall]]).
* ''Unexpected drawback'':  An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy (e.g., while [[irrigation]] schemes provide people with water for agriculture, they can increase [[waterborne diseases]] that have devastating health effects, such as [[schistosomiasis]]).
* ''Perverse result'': A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended (when an intended solution makes a problem worse). This is sometimes referred to as 'backfire'.

==History==
===John Locke===
The idea of ''unintended consequences'' dates back at least to [[John Locke]] who discussed the unintended consequences of [[interest rate]] [[regulation]] in his letter to Sir John Somers, Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/763#lf0128-04_head_002''The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes''], (London: Rivington, 1824 12th ed.). Vol. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Smith===
The idea was also discussed by [[Adam Smith]], the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], and [[consequentialism]] (judging by results).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The Theory of Moral Sentiments|page=93|url=http://metalibri.wikidot.com/title:theory-of-moral-sentiments:smith-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] popularised this concept in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renowned Columbia Sociologist and National Medal of Science Winner Robert K. Merton Dies at 92|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/03/02/robertKMerton.html|publisher=Columbia News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mar03/indextwo.html Robert K. Merton Remembered] Footnotes, American Sociological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merton/&gt;

In "The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action" (1936), Merton tried to apply a systematic analysis to the problem of unintended consequences of deliberate acts intended to cause [[social change]]. He emphasized that his term ''purposive action'', "[was exclusively] concerned with 'conduct' as distinct from 'behavior.' That is, with action that involves motives and consequently a choice between various alternatives".&lt;ref name=Merton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=895|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton's usage included deviations from what [[Max Weber]] defined as rational social action: instrumentally rational and value rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|date=1978|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton also stated that "no blanket statement categorically affirming or denying the practical feasibility of ''all'' social planning is warranted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=904|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everyday usage===
More recently, the ''law of unintended consequences'' has come to be used as an adage or idiomatic warning that an intervention in a [[complex system]] tends to create unanticipated and often undesirable outcomes.&lt;ref name="Norton "&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Norton |first=Rob |editor=[[David R. Henderson]] |encyclopedia=[[Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |title=Unintended Consequences |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html  |year=2008 |edition= 2nd |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0865976658 |oclc=237794267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/mislj71&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/flsulr28&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=28 Florida State University Law Review 2000–2001 Mandatory Minimum Sentences: Exemplifying the Law of Unintended Consequences Comment |publisher=Heinonline.org |date=1993-06-18 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/antil65&amp;div=47&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin to [[Murphy's law]], it is commonly used as a wry or humorous warning against the [[hubris]]tic belief that humans can fully control the world around them.

==Causes==
Possible causes of unintended consequences include the world's inherent [[complexity]] (parts of a system responding to changes in the environment), [[perverse incentive]]s, human [[stupidity]], [[self-deception]], failure to account for human nature, or other [[cognitive bias|cognitive]] or [[emotional bias|emotional]] biases. As a sub-component of complexity (in the scientific sense), the chaotic nature of the universe—and especially its quality of having small, apparently insignificant changes with far-reaching effects (e.g., the [[butterfly effect]])—applies.

[[Robert K. Merton]] listed five possible causes of unanticipated consequences in 1936:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Merton, Robert K|title=On Social Structure and Science|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|year=1996|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo3626245.html|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Ignorance, making it  impossible to anticipate everything, thereby leading to incomplete analysis.
# Errors in analysis of the problem or following habits that worked in the past but may not apply to the current situation.
# Immediate interests overriding long-term interests.
# Basic values which may require or prohibit certain actions even if the long-term result might be unfavourable (these long-term consequences may eventually cause changes in basic values).
# [[Self-defeating prophecy]], or, the fear of some consequence which drives people to find solutions before the problem occurs, thus the non-occurrence of the problem is not anticipated.

In addition to Merton's causes, psychologist Stuart Vyse has noted that [[groupthink]], described by [[Irving Janis]], has been blamed for some decisions that result in unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Can Anything Save Us from Unintended Consequences? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=20-23 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919223200/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/can_anything_save_us_from_unintended_consequences |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinking of ships in shallow waters during wartime has created many artificial [[coral reefs]], which can be scientifically valuable and have become an attraction for recreational divers. Retired ships have been purposely sunk in recent years, in an effort to replace coral reefs lost to [[global warming]] and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/dnrnews/pressrelease2008/020708a.html |title=Maryland Artificial Reef Initiative Celebrates 1 Year Anniversary |publisher=Dnr.maryland.gov |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18853363/ |title=Sinking ships will boost tourism, group says&amp;nbsp;– News&amp;nbsp;– msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090921/NATIONAL/709209873/1042/FOREIGN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132717/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090921%2FNATIONAL%2F709209873%2F1042%2FFOREIGN |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-05-09 |title=Life after death on the ocean floor&amp;nbsp;– The National Newspaper |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbs4.com/local/vandenberg.fish.key.2.1250653.html |title=Sea Life Flourishing On Vandenberg Wreck Off Keys |publisher=cbs4.com |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227174325/http://cbs4.com/local/vandenberg.fish.key.2.1250653.html |archivedate=2009-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdnn.info/news/industry/i061227.html |title=CDNN : Diver Wants to Sink Old Navy Ships off California Coast |publisher=Cdnn.info |date=2006-12-27 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], most [[Medication|drugs]] have unintended consequences ('[[side effect]]s') associated with their use. However, some are beneficial. For instance, [[aspirin]], a [[pain reliever]], is also an [[anticoagulant]] that can help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and reduce the severity and damage from [[thrombotic stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=BBC15Feb2001&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1168850.stm |title=BBC 15 February 2001, ''Aspirin heart warning'' |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-02-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of beneficial [[side effect]]s also leads to [[off-label use]]—prescription or use of a drug for an unlicensed purpose. Famously, the drug [[Viagra]] was developed to lower blood pressure, with its use for treating [[erectile dysfunction]] being discovered as a side effect in clinical trials.

The objective of microfinance initiatives is to foster micro-entrepreneurs but an unintended consequence can be informal intermediation: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413_Microfinance_for_poverty_alleviation_Do_transnational_initiatives_overlook_fundamental_questions_of_competition_and_intermediation|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103–117|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] made [[bicycle helmet|safety helmets]] mandatory for all bicycle riders. While there was a reduction in the number of head injuries, there was also an unintended reduction in the number of juvenile cyclists—fewer cyclists obviously leads to fewer injuries, assuming [[Ceteris paribus|all else being equal]]. The risk of death and serious injury per cyclist seems to have increased, possibly due to [[risk compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclehelmets.org/1241.html |title=Evaluating Head Injuries and Helmet Laws in Australia and New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Vulcan, ''et al.'' found that the reduction in juvenile cyclists was because the youths considered wearing a bicycle helmet unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Maxwell H. |last2=Vulcan |first2=A.

[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition in the 1920s United States]], originally enacted to suppress the alcohol trade, drove many small-time alcohol suppliers out of business and consolidated the hold of large-scale [[organized crime]] over the illegal alcohol industry. Since alcohol was still popular, criminal organisations producing alcohol were well-funded and hence also increased their other activities. Similarly, the [[War on Drugs]], intended to suppress the [[illegal drug trade]], instead increased the power and profitability of drug cartels who became the primary source of the products.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Forero, "Colombia's Coca Survives U.S. plan to uproot it", The New York Times, August 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Podesta and Douglas Farah, "Drug Policy in Andes Called Failure," ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 27, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="streatfeild"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dominic Streatfeild |title=Source Material for ''Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography'': Interview between Milton Friedman and Dominic Streatfeild |date=June 2000 |url=http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |publisher=Dominicstratfeild |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113201345/http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |archivedate=2012-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An open letter |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |publisher=Prohibition Costs |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passenger-side [[airbag]]s in motorcars were intended as a safety feature, but led to an increase in child fatalities in the mid-1990s as small children were being hit by deploying airbags during collisions. The supposed solution to this problem, moving the child seat to the back of the vehicle, led to an increase in the number of children forgotten in unattended vehicles, some of whom died under extreme temperature conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/hot-car-death/ |work=Time |first1=Justin |last1=Worland/Ridgefield |title=Who's To Blame For Hot Car Deaths? |date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk compensation, or the [[Risk compensation|Peltzman effect]], occurs after implementation of safety measures intended to reduce injury or death (e.g. bike helmets, seatbelts, etc.). People may feel safer than they really are and take additional risks which they would not have taken without the safety measures in place. This may result in no change, or even an increase, in morbidity or mortality, rather than a decrease as intended.

The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi, [[Cobra effect|offered a bounty for every dead cobra]]. This was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, enterprising people began breeding cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, they scrapped the reward program, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse, becoming known as the [[Cobra effect]].

[[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Theobald Mathew]]'s temperance campaign in 19th-century [[Ireland]] resulted in thousands of people vowing never to drink [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] again.

It was thought that adding south-facing [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatories]] to British houses would reduce energy consumption by providing extra insulation and warmth from the sun.

Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1960s, the Canadian federal government gave the Catholic Church in Quebec $2.25 per day per psychiatric patient for their cost of care, but only $0.75 a day per orphan. The perverse result is that the orphan children were diagnosed as mentally ill so the church could receive the larger amount of money. This psychiatric misdiagnosis affected up to 20,000 people, and the children are known as the [[Duplessis Orphans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 |title=The Spokesman-Review  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 |title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 |title=The Prescott Courier |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental intervention==

Most modern technologies have negative consequences that are both unavoidable and unpredictable. For example, almost all [[environmental problem]]s, from chemical [[pollution]] to [[global warming]], are the unexpected consequences of the application of modern technologies. [[Traffic congestion]], deaths and injuries from car accidents, [[air pollution]], and global warming are unintended consequences of the invention and large scale adoption of the [[automobile]]. [[Hospital infection]]s are the unexpected side-effect of [[antibiotic resistance]], and even [[human overpopulation]] is the side effect of various technological (i.e., [[Agricultural revolution (disambiguation)|agricultural]] and [[industrial revolution|industrial]]) revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|author1=Huesemann, Michael H.|author2=Joyce A.

Because of the complexity of [[ecosystems]], deliberate changes to an ecosystem or other environmental interventions will often have (usually negative) unintended consequences. Sometimes, these effects cause permanent [[irreversible change]]s. Examples include:

* After about 1900, public demand led the US government to fight [[forest fire]]s in the American West, and set aside land as national forests and parks to protect them from fires. This policy led to fewer fires, but also led to growth conditions such that, when fires did occur, they were much larger and more damaging. Modern research suggests that this policy was misguided, and that a certain level of wildfires is a natural and important part of [[forest ecology]].&lt;ref name="How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joyce|first=Christopher|title=How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/23/159373691/how-the-smokey-bear-effect-led-to-raging-wildfires|work=npr.org|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
