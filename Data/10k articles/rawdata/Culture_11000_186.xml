[[File:Aberlemnokirkyardcropped.jpg|thumb|Aberlemno II: Kirkyard Stone, Class II Pictish Stone]]
The '''Aberlemno Sculptured Stones''' are a series of five Class I and II [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Medieval]] [[Pictish Stones|standing stones]] found in and around the village of [[Aberlemno]], [[Angus, Scotland]].

==Location==
Aberlemno 1, 3 and 5 are located in recesses in the dry stone wall at the side of the road in [[Aberlemno]] ({{gbmapping|NO522559}}). Aberlemno 2 is found in the Kirkyard, 300 yards south of the roadside stones.({{gbmapping|NO5223955554}}) In recent years, bids have been made to move the stones to an indoor location to protect them from weathering, but this has met with local resistance and the stones are currently covered in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Description==

===Aberlemno 1===
[[File:Serpent stone.JPG|thumb|upright|Aberlemno 1]]
Aberlemno 1 is the central roadside stone. It is an unshaped standing stone, bearing incised [[Picts|Pictish]] symbols, defining it under [[J Romilly Allen]] and Joseph Anderson's classification system as a Class I stone.&lt;ref name="Pinkfoot Press 1993 facsimile"&gt;{{citation

The meaning of these symbols is unknown.  They are deeply incised in a bold, confident line, and this stone is considered to be one of the finest and best-preserved Pictish symbol stones still standing in or near its original position.  The other face of the stone exhibits [[prehistoric]] [[Cup and ring mark|cup marks]], showing that it has been re-used.&lt;ref name="roadside"&gt;{{citation|title=Re: The Monument known as Aberlemno, cross slab and symbol stones NW of Village Hall|work=The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979: Entry in the Schedule of Monuments|year=1998|accessdate=18 December 2009| url = http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/eschedule/show?id=90004&amp;OK=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aberlemno 2===
Aberlemno II, found in Aberlemno kirkyard, is a shaped cross-slab, bearing Pictish symbols as well as Christian symbols in relief, defining it as a Class II stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Re: The Monument known as Aberlemno churchyard, cross slab|work=The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979: Entry in the Schedule of Monuments|year=1998|accessdate=18 December 2009| url = http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/eschedule/show?id=90003&amp;OK=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone, carved from Old Red Sandstone, stands {{convert|2.3|m|ft}} tall, {{convert|1.3|m|ft}} wide at the base, tapering to {{convert|0.9|m|ft}} wide at the top, and is {{convert|0.2|m|in}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The west face is inscribed with a quadrilobate [[Celtic Cross]]. The cross bears several styles of Celtic pattern designs. The vertical arms are inscribed with three separate knotwork designs, the horizontal arms with keywork designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central roundel has a spiral design composed of three interconnecting [[triple spiral|triskeles]]. Bordering the cross are a number of Celtic zoomorphic designs, reminiscent of Northumbrian designs and designs from the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref name=Trench/&gt; A hole has been bored through the upper part of the stone some time after its sculpting.

The rear face features two Pictish symbols, a notched rectangle with z-rod and a [[Triple disc (Pictish symbol)|triple disc]]. Below this are nine figures which have been interpreted as a narrative account of a battle.

Until recently, it was thought to date to the mid-8th century,&lt;ref name=Cummings/&gt; but subsequent analysis has suggested a mid-9th century date.&lt;ref name=Trench&gt;{{citation

===Aberlemno 3===
[[File:Ecosse2009106.JPG|thumb|upright|Aberlemno 3]]
The western road-side stone is another Class II stone.  It has an elaborately decorated ringed cross flanked by adoring angels on one side, and a hunting scene on the reverse, below two large Pictish symbols. This stone is known as Aberlemno 3.&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt; This stone has until recently been thought to date from the late eighth century. More recent comparative analyses have suggested that it may be of a later, mid-ninth-century origin.&lt;ref name=Trench/&gt;

Aberlemno 3 has different proportions to the Kirkyard Cross-slab, being relatively tall and thin, with parallel sides which have incised decoration (those of the other cross-slab are plain). The monument's height and decoration on four faces both suggest it is later in date than Aberlemno 2. Its nearest artistic analogies appear to be sculptures from [[Easter Ross]] in northern Scotland, notable the [[Hilton of Cadboll]] stone (now in the [[Museum of Scotland]]), which has a closely similar hunting scene.

===Aberlemno 4===
This stone, found in 1961 is approximately 1.5 metres tall, 0.5 m wide and 0.3 m thick. It has incised symbols on an unworked stone, defining it under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's classification system as a Class I stone.&lt;ref name="Pinkfoot Press 1993 facsimile"/&gt; There are two symbols, a horseshoe and a [[Pictish Beast]]. The anterior portion of the beast symbol (facing right) has suffered some damage due to ploughing, but is still easily visible.

===Aberlemno 5===
The eastern Class I stone is highly eroded and the incised symbols are extremely difficult to make out. This stone is thought to be unfinished or a later fake. This stone is known as Aberlemno 5.&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt;

==The battle scene on Aberlemno 2==
[[File:Pictish Stone at Aberlemno Church Yard - Battle Scene Detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Pictish Stone at Aberlemno Church Yard — battle scene detail]]
On the rear of Aberlemno 2 is a scene showing human figures bearing weapons, apparently engaged in battle. The figures appear in three rows. The top row has an unhelmeted figure on horseback riding behind a helmeted rider, possibly in pursuit. The helmeted rider is armed with a spear and appears to have dropped his sword and shield. The middle row has a helmeted rider armed with a spear and shield facing three unhelmeted infantry soldiers armed with spears, swords and shields. The bottom row shows a mounted and unhelmeted figure and mounted helmeted figure facing each other, both armed with spears. Behind the helmeted rider lies a helmeted casualty, with a bird to his right.

The battle scene has been interpreted in numerous ways. The earliest record of the stone by [[Hector Boece]], from the 16th century, links the scene with the [[Battle of Barry]] (now known to be historically inauthentic):

&lt;blockquote&gt;82. ''Parem cladem nobilissimus Danorum manipulus est sortitus ad Aberlemnonem vicum vix a Bretheno, nunc civitate episcopali sede honestata, quatuor passuum millibus, qui a Scotis interceptus ibidem ferro occubuit. Quo loco ingens lapis est erectus. Huic animantium effigies nonnullis cum characteribus artificiose, ut tum fiebat, quae rem gestam posteritati annunciarent, sunt insculptae.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
82. ''A noble company of Danes suffered a similar slaughter near the village of Aberlemno, a village four miles distant from Brechin (nowadays a city possessing the honour of an episcopal see), which was intercepted by the Scots and put to the sword. Here a great stone was erected, carved with lifelike figures and an artfully-engraved inscription (according to the lights of those days) to record this achievement for posterity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

While it was noted in 1955 by Robert Stevenson, keeper of the [[Museum of Scotland|Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]] that the helmets depicted on the stone were of a general sub-Roman design and the helmeted figures were likely to be Picts,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

This, coupled with the stone's proximity to Dunnichen ({{convert|3|mi|km|0}} to the south) led to the interpretation made by historian Graeme Cruickshank that the scene was a depiction of the Battle of Dun Nechtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Cruickshank's interpretation, published in 1985, 1300 years after the Battle of Dun Nechtain, received general acceptance, although he has been criticised for his suggestions that the stone was created soon after the battle in 685, when the conventional view at the time was that it was sculpted a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The subsequent identification of [[Dunachton]] in [[Badenoch]] as a second candidate for the site of the battle,&lt;ref name=Woolf/&gt; and the revised dating of the stone to the mid 9th century&lt;ref name=Trench/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laing/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laing2/&gt; has weakened Cruickshank's argument somewhat, and alternative interpretations have been made, including that the scene depicts a battle between Picts and [[Vikings]],&lt;ref name=Trench/&gt; or that it is a memorial to 8th century Pictish king [[Óengus I of the Picts|Óengus I]],&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;{{cite book

==Premise==
{{further|List of Anger Management episodes}}
The series revolves around Charlie Goodson (Sheen), a one-time minor league baseball player who struggled to take the next step because of his recurring anger issues. Thanks to a therapist, Dr. Kate Wales ([[Selma Blair]]), Charlie was able to get his issues under control and finally make it to the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]]. But he had a relapse during a big league game, breaking a bat over his knee in anger and causing a career-ending injury.

The incident inspired Charlie to return to school and become an anger management therapist. Charlie is divorced from his one-time wife, Jennifer ([[Shawnee Smith]]), on whom he cheated multiple times during his baseball-playing days. The two still see a lot of each other because they share joint custody of their teenage daughter Sam (Daniela Bobadilla), who has [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].

Charlie has a complicated relationship with Kate, who is not only his therapist, but also his best friend and a sex-only love interest. He holds regular group sessions for anger-management patients in his home, and also does anger therapy at an area prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A.

==Production==
On July 18, 2011, it was announced that a show based on the [[Anger Management (film)|2003 film of the same name]] was in development with [[Charlie Sheen]] starring in the role originally played by [[Jack Nicholson]] from the film. The series was Sheen's first acting role since he was officially fired from the hit [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''.&lt;ref name="development"/&gt;

On October 27, 2011, it was announced that [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] had picked up the series with an initial ten-episode order which, if successful, FX would then order an additional 90 episodes under a syndication model crafted by [[Debmar-Mercury]]. On August 29, 2012 it was announced that the show would be picked up for a further 90 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/anger-management-charlie-sheen-90-episodes/191888|title=FX Picks Up Charlie Sheen's ANGER MANAGEMENT for 90 More Episodes|work=Collider}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 9, 2013, FX president John Landgraf said that there will essentially be "45 new episodes per year". Landgraf also announced that [[Martin Sheen]], who guest-starred in season one as Charlie's on-screen father, would become a season two regular cast member.&lt;ref name=tvline20130109&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2013/01/09/anger-management-season-2-its-always-sunny-horror-story/|title=''Anger Management'' to Run Non-Stop for Two Years, and Other FX News|first=Matt|last=Mitovich|work=tvline.com|date=January 9, 2013|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Martin did appear more frequently on the show, it was only in selected episodes and he was ultimately not promoted to regular cast member.

FX paid a $600,000-per-episode license fee for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connell|first=Michael|title=Why Fox Is Airing New Episodes of Charlie Sheen's 'Anger Management' (Analysis)|url=http://rewired.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/why-fox-is-airing-new-559137|work=The Holywood Reporter|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To boost its sagging season two ratings, FX announced that four episodes (two of them first-run) would air on FX's parent network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on Monday nights in June, starting June 3, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Anger-Management-Episodes-Air-Fox-June-56247.html Anger Management Episodes To Air On Fox In June] West, Kelly at cinemablend.com on May 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Casting announcements began in January 2012, with [[Shawnee Smith]] and [[Selma Blair]] first cast as the two female leads. Smith was cast as Charlie's ex-wife and Blair was cast as Charlie's therapist and possible love interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/FX-Anger-Management-Casts-Shawnee-Smith-Female-Lead-38977.html|title=FX's Anger Management Casts Shawnee Smith As A Female Lead|publisher=Cinemablend.com|date=January 26, 2012|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelman|first=Vlada|url=http://tvline.com/2012/02/03/anger-management-blair-sheen|title=Selma Blair Cast in Charlie Sheen's FX Series Anger Management|publisher=TVLine|date=February 3, 2012|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several actresses tested for the two female lead roles, including [[Julie Benz]], Jenica Bergere, [[Elaine Hendrix]] (who would get a role on the show), [[Kate Reinders]] and [[Nichole Hiltz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/charlie-sheens-anger-management-casting-its-female-leads-see-who-is-testing|title='Anger Management' Casting Female Leads Opposite Charlie Sheen: See Who's Testing|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next to be cast was [[Noureen DeWulf]], in the role of Lacey, a spoiled rich girl who is sentenced to join the therapy group after shooting her boyfriend in the testicles when he cheated on her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/02/jessica-lucas-set-as-lead-of-cw-pilot-cult-noureen-dewulf-joins-anger-management|title=Jessica Lucas Set As Lead of CW Pilot 'Cult', Noureen DeWulf Joins 'Anger Management'|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Arden]] and [[Daniela Bobadilla]] were cast as, respectively, Patrick (an openly gay member of Charlie's therapy group) and Sam (Charlie's teenaged daughter who has [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/02/14/development-update-tuesday-february-14-217414/9633|title=Breaking News – Development Update|publisher=TheFutonCritic.com|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Corbin]] was cast as Ed, a cranky, bigoted [[Vietnam]] veteran and the member of the therapy group who is angry at everyone. Originally billed as a recurring character, the producers decided after just two episodes to make Ed a series regular. [[Derek Richardson (actor)|Derek Richardson]] was the last actor cast in the series, in the role of Nolan, a frequently stoned member of the therapy group whose anger issue is that he has no anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/03/ivana-milicevic-to-star-in-banshee-derek-richardson-joins-anger-management|title=Ivana Milicevic To Star In 'Banshee', Derek Richardson Joins 'Anger Management'|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Austin Green]], who initially made a guest appearance, was promoted to a starring role following the dismissal of Selma Blair. [[Denise Richards]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Cee Lo Green]], and [[Kerri Kenney-Silver]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Erik|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/is-charlie-sheens-anger-management-as-awful-weve-f,81894|title=Is Charlie Sheen's Anger Management as awful as we've feared? &amp;#124; TV &amp;#124; Crosstalk|publisher=The A.V. Club|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; made guest appearances. Guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] made a cameo appearance. Sheen's father, [[Martin Sheen]], who made a guest appearance in season one as Charlie's on-screen father, had an expanded role in the second season. FX president John Landgraf said, "I thought it would be a better series if it was also a multi-generational series".&lt;ref name=tvline20130109/&gt;

===Selma Blair's dismissal===
On June 17, 2013, [[TMZ]] reported that Sheen had told producers that he would refuse to work should Blair turn up to work that day as a result of her being the most vocal among the cast and crew&lt;ref name="BlairFiredDEADLINE"&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/06/future-of-anger-management-co-star-selma-blair-in-limbo-over-falling-out-with-charlie-sheen|title=2ND UPDATE: Charlie Sheen Fired Selma Blair From 'Anger Management' Via Text, Show To Continue Production As Scheduled|publisher=Deadline.com|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding complaints about his being a "menace" to work with – specifically questioning his punctuality and work ethic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/06/17/charlie-sheen-selma-blair-anger-management-fired-war|title=Charlie Sheen – At War With Selma Blair ... She's FIRED!|publisher=TMZ.com|date=June 17, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, TMZ reported that Sheen had told the producers that, if they refused to fire Blair, then he would quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/06/18/charlie-sheen-selma-blair-angermanagement-threat-quit-fx|title=Charlie Sheen Threatens 'Anger Management' Producers – Fire Selma Blair ... Or I'll Quit|publisher=TMZ.com|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, Lionsgate issued a statement confirming that Blair would not be returning to the show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/official-selma-blair-not-returning-570734|title=It's Official: Selma Blair Not Returning to 'Anger Management'|publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a new female lead role would be created to fill the void.&lt;ref name="BlairFiredDEADLINE"/&gt;

The new female lead role was described as a "by-the-book psychiatrist" who joins Charlie to co-author the sex study research he and Kate had been working on before she left and moved to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/06/21/anger-management-charlie-sheen-sexy|title='Anger Management' scoop: Charlie Sheen show seeks 'sexy' new co-star who 'hates herself' &amp;#124; Inside TV &amp;#124; EW.com|publisher=Insidetv.ew.com|date=June 21, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, 2013, FX announced that [[Laura Bell Bundy]] would be replacing Blair as Charlie's new colleague, Dr. Jordan Denby, with production on the first episode featuring Bundy's character beginning that same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1711883/laura-bell-bundy-lands-role-on-anger-management.jhtml Laura Bell Bundy Lands Role on Anger Management] cmt.com on August 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that [[Brian Austin Green]] would have an expanded role following Blair's firing.

====Potential lawsuit====
On September 13, 2013, TMZ reported that Blair was threatening both Sheen and Lionsgate Entertainment for the $1.2 million she would have earned had she not been dismissed from the show but also noted that both sides were talking and attempting to reach a settlement. It was also reported that a decision had already been made prior to her dismissal to write her off the show as "America didn't want to see Charlie with just one girlfriend" – however, the plan was to phase the character out over eight episodes and that, once Sheen heard of Blair's comments, "that process was accelerated" and the character abruptly moved to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/09/13/selma-blair-charlie-sheen-lawsuit-anger-management-lionsgate-wrongful-termination-retaliation|title=Selma Blair Threatens Lawsuit – You Screwed Me Over, Charlie Sheen!|work=tmz.com|date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canceled episode====
In June 2013, a press release for an episode titled "Charlie and Kate Have Sex for Science" stated that the episode was set to air on June 27, 2013, as the twenty-sixth episode of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20130529fx02|title=(#10??) "Charlie and Kate Have Sex for Science"|work=Listings – Anger Management on FX|publisher=the Futon Critic|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the aftermath of Blair's dismissal, the planned broadcast was canceled and replaced with "Charlie and the Hot Nerd" – the first episode produced without Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20130611fx01|title=(#1041) "Charlie and the Hot Nerd"|work=Listings – Anger Management on FX|publisher=the Futon Critic|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of "Charlie and Kate Have Sex for Science" is unknown as all episodes with production codes up to, and including, 1040 (Blair's final episode) have aired. An episode with a similar title, but with different storylines, named "Charlie Does It For Science" aired on December 5, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20131118fx01|title=(#2057) "Charlie Does It for Science"|work=Listings – Anger Management on FX|publisher=the Futon Critic|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Anger Management'' received largely negative reviews. Based on 33 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season of ''Anger Management'' received an average 21% overall "Rotten" approval rating; the website's consensus states, "''Anger Management'' is aggressively so-so, with thin characters and a few groan-worthy gags for every good one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/anger-management/s01|title=Anger Management: Season 1 (2012)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metacritic]] gave the first season of the show a score of 44 out of 100 based on 33 critics' reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/anger-management|title=Anger Management – Season 1 Reviews, Ratings, Credits and More|date=June 28, 2012|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Stasi of the ''[[New York Post]]'' called the series "not so bad", adding "''Anger Management'' is pretty conventional up to and including an idiot laugh track—and a character named Charlie—again. But maybe the familiar is what will keep crazy Charlie [Sheen] from killing himself and others in a blind, drunken, psycho haze on set. Or maybe not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/familiar_sheen_fcnmfa1teRy3bNK6g4iO5I|title=Familiar Sheen|last=Stasi|first=Linda|date=June 18, 2012|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''{{'}}s Nancy DeWolf Smith thought the series was "usually funny, often clever" and added "The accomplishment here is that tight writing and editing, a solid cast with good timing and Mr. Sheen's chops as the ne plus ultra of sitcom performers, make the whole thing feel, if not entirely fresh—then crisp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303649504577494604174929544|title=Second Acts in Several Men's Lives: Anger Management|last=DeWolf Smith|first=Nancy|date=June 28, 2012|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] stated: "''Anger Management'' is Charlie Sheen doing what Charlie Sheen does—on-screen. It's not artful, it's not elegant&amp;nbsp;... It will likely give his fans what they want. And if there are enough of them to trigger the order for the extra 90 episodes, then FX, Helford and everyone else will feel justified in taking another chance on the guy, despite what happened in the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-fxs-anger-management-lets-charlie-sheen-be-charlie-sheen|title=Review: FX's 'Anger Management' lets Charlie Sheen be Charlie Sheen|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|date=June 26, 2012|work=[[HitFix]]|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan stated: "despite the careful attention to image enhancement possibilities, the core ugliness and toxic narcissism of {{'}}''Anger Management''{{'}} are impossible to ignore. ... Whoever {{'}}''Anger Management''{{'}} benefits – and it certainly won't be viewers used to FX's usual scripted fare – whole enterprise is really just image management.

A '''baluster'''—also called '''spindle''' or '''stair stick'''{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}—is a moulded shaft, square or of [[lathe]]-turned form, cut from a rectangular or square plank, one of various forms of [[spindle (furniture)|spindle in woodwork]], made of stone or wood, and sometimes of metal or plastic,&lt;ref&gt;Cast-stone balusters were a development of the 18th century in Great Britain (see [[Coade stone]]), [[cast iron]] balusters a development largely of the 1840s.&lt;/ref&gt; standing on a unifying footing, and supporting the [[coping (architecture)|coping]] of a [[parapet]] or the [[handrail]] of a [[stairway|staircase]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Baluster|volume=3|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiplied in this way, they form a '''balustrade'''.&lt;ref&gt;"A row of balusters surmounted by a rail or coping" 1644. ''[[OED]]''; {{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/balustrade?view=uk|title=AskOxford|accessdate=2007-06-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100157/http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/balustrade?view=uk|archivedate=2007-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individually, a '''baluster shaft''' may describe the turned form taken by a brass or silver candlestick, an upright furniture support, or the stem of a brass chandelier, etc.

[[Image:Illustration Punica granatum2.jpg|thumb|Swelling form of the half-open flower of ''[[Punica granatum]]'', in Italian ''balaustra'']]

==Etymology==
According to ''[[OED]]'', "baluster" is derived through the {{lang-fr|balustre}}, from {{lang-it|balaustro}}, from ''balaustra'', "pomegranate flower" [from a resemblance to the swelling form of the half-open flower (''illustration, below left'')],&lt;ref&gt;The early sixteenth-century theoretical writer Diego da Sangredo (''Medidas del Romano'', 1526) detected this derivation, N. Llewellyn noted, in "Two notes on Diego da Sangredo: 2. The baluster and the pomegranate flower", in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''40''' (1977:240-300); Paul Davies and David Hemsoll's detailed history, "Renaissance Balusters and the Antique", in ''[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]'' '''26''' (1983:1–23, 117–122) p.8 notes uses of the word in fifteenth-century documents and explores its connotations for sixteenth-century designers, pp 12ff.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''balaustium'', from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] βαλαύστιον (''balaustion'').

== History ==
The earliest examples are those shown in the [[bas-relief]]s representing the [[Assyria]]n palaces, where they were employed as window balustrades and apparently had [[Ionic order|Ionic]] capitals.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; As an architectural element the balustrade did not seem to have been known to either the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] or the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower 1974&lt;/ref&gt; but baluster forms are familiar in the legs of chairs and tables represented in Roman bas-reliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Hemsoll 1983:2.&lt;/ref&gt; where the original legs or the models for cast bronze ones were shaped on the lathe, or in Antique marble candelabra, formed as a series of stacked bulbous and disc-shaped elements, both kinds of sources familiar to ''Quattrocento'' designers.

The application to architecture was a feature of the early Renaissance: late fifteenth-century examples are found in the balconies of palaces at [[Venice]] and [[Verona]]. These [[quattrocento]] balustrades are likely to be following yet-unidentified [[Gothic architecture|Gothic precedents]]. They form balustrades of colonnettes&lt;ref&gt;A ''colonnette'' is a miniature column, used decoratively.&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to miniature arcading.

[[File:Balustrade in San Zeno, Verona.JPG|thumb|Stone balusters in the [[Basilica of San Zeno, Verona]]]]

[[Rudolf Wittkower]] withheld judgement as to the inventor of the baluster&lt;ref&gt;H. Siebenhüner, in tracing the baluster's career, found its origin in the profile of the round base of [[Donatello]]'s ''Judith and Holofernes'', c. 1460 (Siebenhüner, "Docke", in Reallexikon zur Deutsche Kunstgeschichte'' vol. 4 1988:102-107)&lt;/ref&gt; and credited [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] with using it consistently as early as the balustrade on the [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] and stairs at the [[Medici]] villa at [[Poggio a Caiano]] (c. 1480),&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Hemsol 1983 note the earliest uses of both types of baluster in fictive classicising thrones and architecture in paintings. They instance an earlier use in real architecture on the main façade of the [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino]], where [[Luciano Laurana]] was employed (p. 6 and pl. 3j).&lt;/ref&gt; and used balustrades in his reconstructions of antique structures. Sangallo passed the motif to [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] (his [[Tempietto]], 1502) and [[Michelangelo]], through whom balustrades gained wide currency in the 16th century.

Wittkower distinguished two types, one symmetrical in profile that inverted one bulbous vase-shape over another, separating them with a cushionlike [[torus]] or a concave ring, and the other a simple vase shape, whose employment by Michelangelo at the [[Campidoglio]] steps (c. 1546), noted by Wittkower, was preceded by very early vasiform balusters in a balustrade round the drum of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie]] (c. 1482), and railings in the cathedrals of [[Aquileia]] (c. 1495) and [[Parma]], in the cortile of San Damaso, Vatican, and [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Antonio da Sangallo]]'s crowning balustrade on the [[Santa Casa]] at Loreto installed in 1535, and liberally in his model for the [[Basilica of Saint Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;These earlier appearances were adduced by Davies and Hemsol 1983:7f.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its low [[center of gravity]], this "vase-baluster" may be given the modern term "dropped baluster".&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Hemsol 1983:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profiles and style changes==
The baluster, being a [[Turning|turned structure]], tends to follow design precedents that were set in woodworking and ceramic practices, where the [[Lathe|turner's lathe]] and the [[potter's wheel]] are ancient tools. The profile a baluster takes is often diagnostic of a particular style of architecture or furniture, and may offer a rough guide to date of a design, though not of a particular example. 

Some complicated [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] baluster forms can be read as a vase set upon another vase. The high shoulders and bold, rhythmic shapes of the [[Baroque]] vase and baluster forms are distinctly different from the sober baluster forms of [[Neoclassicism]], which look to other precedents, like Greek [[amphora]]s. The distinctive twist-turned designs of balusters in oak and walnut English and Dutch&lt;ref&gt;Twist-turned legs on a backstool feature prominently in a conversation piece of a couple in an elaborately fashionable Dutch interior, painted by Eglon van der Neer (1678): [[:File:Elegant Couple in an Interior 1678 Eglon van der Neer.jpg|illustration]].&lt;/ref&gt; seventeenth-century furniture, which took as their prototype the [[Solomonic column]] that was given prominence by [[Bernini]], fell out of style after the 1710s.

Once it had been taken from the lathe, a turned wood baluster could be split and applied to an architectural surface, or to one in which architectonic themes were more freely treated, as on cabinets made in Italy, Spain and Northern Europe from the sixteenth through the seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The architectural invention of the applied half-baluster, with a caveat concerning "the fallacy of first recorded appearances", by [[Filippino Lippi]] in the painted architecture ''all'antica'' of his ''St. Philip revealing the Demon'' in the Strozzi Chapel, [[Santa Maria Novella]], Florence, and in Michelangelo's planned use in the Medici Chapel, is explored by Paul Joannides, "Michelangelo, Filippino Lippi and the Half-Baluster", ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''123''' No. 936 (March 1981:152–154).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern baluster design is also in use for example in designs influenced by the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in a 1905 row of houses in Etchingham Park Road Finchley London England.

Outside Europe, the baluster column appeared as a new motif in [[Mughal architecture]], introduced in [[Shah Jahan]]'s interventions in two of the three great fortress-palaces, the [[Red Fort of Agra]] and [[Delhi]],&lt;ref&gt;"There are no free-standing baluster columns of Shah Jahan's reign in the Fort at [[Lahore]]", according to [[Ebba Koch]] ("The Baluster Column: A European Motif in Mughal Architecture and Its Meaning", ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', '''45''' (1982:251–262) p. 252) but balustrades are a feature of all three.&lt;/ref&gt; in the early seventeenth century. Foliate baluster columns with naturalistic foliate capitals, unexampled in previous Indo-Islamic architecture according to [[Ebba Koch]], rapidly became one of the most widely used forms of supporting shaft in Northern and Central India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ebba Koch 1982:251–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern term '''baluster shaft''' is applied to the shaft dividing a window in [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] architecture. In the south transept of [[St Albans Cathedral|the Abbey in St Albans]], England, are some of these shafts, supposed to have been taken from the old Saxon church. [[Norman architecture|Norman]] bases and capitals have been added, together with plain cylindrical Norman shafts.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Balusters are normally separated by at least the same measurement as the size of the square bottom section. Placing balusters too far apart (to save money) diminishes their aesthetic appeal. Balustrades normally terminate in columns, building walls or more properly in heavy [[newel]] posts because otherwise they will not be structurally strong enough.

Balusters may be formed in several ways. Wood and stone can be shaped on the lathe, wood can be cut from square or rectangular section boards, while concrete, plaster, iron, and plastics are usually formed by molding and casting. Turned patterns or old examples are used for the molds.

The word banister (also bannister) refers to the balusters of a [[stairway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/banister?view=uk |title=AskOxford |accessdate=2007-06-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095709/http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/banister?view=uk |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined as either a [[handrail]], especially on a staircase, or such a handrail together with its supporting structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/banister|title=banister|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Burnside Fountain''' is a non-functioning drinking fountain at the southeast corner of [[Worcester City Hall and Common|Worcester Common]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. It consists of two parts, a [[pink granite]] basin, and a bronze statue of a young boy riding a [[sea turtle]]. The basin was designed by architect [[Henry Bacon]], who later designed the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the figure was created by sculptor [[Charles Y. Harvey]]. Harvey committed suicide before finishing the sculpture, and [[Sherry Fry]] completed the bronze. The Burnside Fountain was commissioned in 1905 by the city of Worcester after Harriet F. Burnside bequeathed [[USD|US]] $5,000 to create a fountain to provide fresh water for people, horses and dogs, in the memory of her father, a prominent lawyer. The fountain was installed in 1912 in Central Square, then moved in 1969 to its current location on Worcester Common. In 1970 the statue was stolen, and was re-installed two years later. An attempted theft occurred in 2004.

The bronze is officially named ''Boy with a Turtle'' but is known to locals as ''Turtle Boy.'' ''Turtle Boy'' has become an unofficial mascot for Worcester, much in the same way the [[Manneken Pis]] is for [[Brussels]]. The Burnside Fountain's popularity is derived mostly from viewers' incorrect interpretation of the statue. Over its 100-year existence, it has been referenced in stories and songs, as well as having a music contest and a [[Microbrewery|microbrew]] named after it.

==Description==
The Burnside Fountain is {{convert|12|ft}} wide, {{convert|5|ft}} tall, and consists of two parts, the basin and the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=132777337JW09.17083&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=ariall&amp;ri=&amp;term=worcester&amp;index=.GW&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;term=&amp;index=.AW&amp;term=boy+with+a+turtle&amp;index=.TW&amp;term=&amp;index=.SW&amp;term=&amp;index=.FW&amp;term=&amp;index=.OW&amp;term=&amp;index=.NW&amp;x=13&amp;y=11#focus Smithsonian Art Inventories Catalog].

These bowls were originally designed as water troughs for horses, and a smaller, lower, bowl located on the rear of the fountain was designed for dogs.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

The [[bronze]] sculpture sits on a circular base in the middle of the basin.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; The sculpture is officially known as ''Boy with a Turtle,''&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; as its figure is of a young boy, in the nude, riding a [[sea turtle]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; In 1986 the Worcester municipal parks and recreation department described the statue with the sentence, "The boy holding the turtle, his hair flying, a sly smile on his face, is charming and disarming."&lt;ref name= "albert"&gt;Southwick, Albert B.

==Background==
Samuel Burnside was a prominent lawyer in Worcester who studied law at [[Dartmouth College]] in the early 1800s.&lt;ref name="WPI"&gt;Garcia, Ryan. Mocadlo, Ryan. Wigley, Margaret.

[[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]. December 15, 2011. Retrieved June 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnside had three daughters, Sophia, Harriet, and Elizabeth, who went on to be called by Frederick Clifton Pierce "the most notable figures in the life of Worcester."&lt;ref name="WPI"/&gt; The notability of the three daughters was due in part to the prestige and wealth Samuel Burnside had accrued as Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas.&lt;ref name="WPI"/&gt; Both before and after Samuel Burnside's death on July 25, 1850, his three daughters were known for charitable works, having donated public gardens and a library to the city of Worcester. One daughter's most well-known donation to the city came in the form of a bequest in her will. In 1904, Harriet Burnside died and left $5,000 in her will to the city of Worcester to build a fountain as a memorial to her father.&lt;ref name="Worcester"&gt;Coombs, Zelotes W.

==History==
When Burnside bequeathed the money for the fountain, she asked that it be designed for use as a drinking trough for horses and also for dogs. The commission was originally intended for [[Daniel Chester French]], but, according to a paper by Zelotes W. Coombs, French turned down the commission due to "pressure of other engagements, however... he did supervise the work."&lt;ref name="Worcester" /&gt; French assigned the design of the basin to [[Henry Bacon]], who would later work with French on the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. The sculpture was assigned to [[Charles Y. Harvey]], a graduate of the [[American Academy in Rome]],&lt;ref name="WPI"/&gt; who had worked with [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] on the [[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]] in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name="Great"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/01/29/100514306.pdf Great Barrignton, Mass]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. January 29, 1912. Retrieved June 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Y. Harvey began work on ''Boy with Turtle'' at his studio in [[New York City]], believing that this work was going to be his masterpiece.&lt;ref name="Great" /&gt; Almost immediately he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown many times in the past.&lt;ref name ="NYT"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/01/29/100514304.pdf Phantom Critics Drive Him to Suicide]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. January 29, 1912. Retrieved June 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself.&lt;ref name="WPI"/&gt; These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to [[Bronx Park]] with two razors, and slit his own throat along the west bank of the [[Bronx River]].&lt;ref name ="NYT" /&gt;

After Harvey's death, [[Sherry Fry]], a fellow American Academy graduate, was invited to finish the work according to the original designs Harvey had laid out.&lt;ref name="WPI"/&gt; Fry completed the sculpture, and it was delivered along with the basin to Worcester in 1912. There had been much discussion about where to install the fountain. Central Square, just off the Worcester Common was chosen with only slight opposition from "market gardeners who had been using the east end of the Common for their summer outdoor market."&lt;ref name="secret"&gt;Southwick, Albert B.[http://www.telegram.com/article/20121011/COLUMN21/110119798/0/NEWS02#.UIK5qqM0lLY The Turtle Boy's dark secret]. ''[[Telegram and Gazette]]''. October 11, 2012. Retrieved January 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was installed in Central Square, There was no dedication ceremony or unveiling for the fountain. A news article on October 11, 1912 stated that Worcester Mayor Philip O’Connell, "believes it will be well to have the fountain placed in use without ceremony.”&lt;ref name="secret" /&gt; This lack of a ceremony is presumably due to Harvey's suicide and the desire to not celebrate such an act.&lt;ref name="secret" /&gt;

By 1912, the use of horse and buggy had fallen out of fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its intended purpose.&lt;ref name= "albert"/&gt; By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use.&lt;ref name="WPI"/&gt; It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the [[Worcester City Hall and Common|Worcester Common]] and turned to face Salem Square.&lt;ref name= "Telegram" /&gt; One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin.&lt;ref name= "Telegram" /&gt; Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days.&lt;ref name="WPI"/&gt;

In 2010, the Burnside Fountain was named one of [[WAAF (FM)|WAAF]]'s "Hill-Man's 25 Greatest Places in Massachusetts."&lt;ref&gt;Durgin, Brittany.

For the last few decades the Burnside Fountain has been in disrepair. A 1986 inventory of public memorials in Worcester, compiled by the municipal parks and recreation department, listed the fountains problems as "chipped stone, water system, bronze surface corrosion, rust staining, litter,"&lt;ref name = "Memorials"&gt;[http://www.worcesterma.gov/uploads/30/e3/30e389596d61ed019995b74f7835f7e8/artworks.pdf An Inventory of Public Memorials Worcester Massachusetts].

Restoration estimates run between [[USD]] $40,000 to $60,000, which is more than the city is willing to spend.&lt;ref name= "Telegram" /&gt; Probably because of this, there are no official plans to restore the fountain, as of June 2012.

The popularity of ''Turtle Boy'' began around the time it was installed in Central Square. In 1916 the Burnside Fountain's boy and turtle appeared in ''The Cloud Bird'', a children's book by Margaret C. Getchell in which each chapter was about a Worcester landmark.&lt;ref name= "albert" /&gt; In the eighth chapter, "The Adventurer in Armor," a small girl finds a young, [[Peter Pan]]-like [[faun]] who had agreed to hold back the turtle. They later go on an adventure upon the turtle's back, but return at the end of the day.&lt;ref name= "albert" /&gt; By the late 2000s "Turtle Boy" was a common term used to align events and objects with Worcester. 
A local music contest was named the "Turtle Boy Music Awards,"&lt;ref&gt;Arsenault, Charlene.

Kristina Wilson, associate professor in the Department of Visual and Performing Arts at Worcester's [[Clark University]], asked people on campus what they thought of ''Turtle Boy''. One person replied "Oh, that's Worcester's monument to [[bestiality]]."&lt;ref name= "Telegram"&gt;Semon, Craig. [http://www.telegram.com/article/20110228/NEWS/102280337 "Turtle Boy nears 100"].

Retrieved June 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson said the sculpture is intended to portray "innocence, joy, and rebirth," and that historically Charles Y. Harvey came from an artistic tradition in which "the human figure is the apex of beauty, and how well you can capture that is the demonstration of your artistic talents." Regarding the artistic merit of the work, Wilson said: "It's unfortunate, because it really does look like something untoward is going on."&lt;ref name= "Telegram" /&gt;

Mostly because of the ambiguity in what the Burnside Fountain is depicting, ''Turtle Boy'' pops up occasionally in [[social media]]. The sculpture also appeared on comedian [[Daniel Tosh]]'s [[Tosh.0]] blog.&lt;ref&gt;Pomranz, Mike. [http://tosh.comedycentral.com/blog/tag/burnside-fountain/ Want to See a Boy Screwing a Turtle?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7124">'''Challenge-based learning''' ('''CBL''') is a framework for learning while solving real-world Challenges. The framework is collaborative and hands-on, asking all participants (students, teachers, families, and community members) to identify Big Ideas, ask good questions, discover and solve Challenges, gain in-depth subject area knowledge, develop 21st-century skills, and share their thoughts with the world.

Challenge-based learning builds on the foundation of [[experiential learning]], leans heavily on the wisdom of a long history of [[progressive education]], shares the many of the goals of [[Service-learning|service learning]], and the activism of [[critical pedagogy]]. The framework is informed by innovative ideas from education, media, technology, entertainment, recreation, the workplace, and society.

== History ==
The challenge-based learning framework emerged from the "Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow—Today" (ACOT2) project initiated in 2008 by Apple, Inc. to identify the essential design principles of a 21st-century learning environment (Apple Inc., 2008). Starting with the ACOT2 design principles, a team from Apple, Inc. worked with exemplary educators to develop, test and implement challenge-based learning.

Using Challenges to frame learning experiences originated from an exploration of reality television, conversations with individuals whose lives center on Challenges, and reflection on personal learning experiences inside and outside of the classroom. When faced with a Challenge, successful groups and individuals leverage experience, harness internal and external resources, develop a plan and push forward to find the best solution. Along the way, there is experimentation, failure, success and ultimately consequences for actions. By adding Challenges to learning environments the result is urgency, passion, and ownership – ingredients often missing in schools.

The initial framework was documented in a white paper written in 2008 and published by Apple, Inc (Nichols and Cator, 2009). Since that time teachers and schools around the world have adopted the framework to improve teaching and learning while allowing students to make an immediate difference in their community.

In 2009 New Media Consortium published an in-depth study of challenge-based learning in classroom practice. The study, which involved 6 schools in the United States, 29 teachers, and 330 students in 17 disciplines, found the approach produced dramatically effective results, especially for the 9th-grade students considered to be most at risk of dropping out (Johnson, et al., 2009).

In 2011 an additional study was conducted to test if the framework applied to a larger [[K20 Center|K-20]] audience and to look deeper into the acquisition of [[21st century skills]]. This study includes 19 schools, 90 teachers and 1500 students from three countries. Once again the research demonstrated that CBL is an effective way to engage students, meet curriculum standards, and gain 21st-century skills. The research also concluded that CBL could be used with students of all ages (Johnson and Adams, 2011).

In 2016 Apple Inc. engaged [[Digital Promise]], and members of the team that created CBL to update the content, manage the website and develop a book (Nichols, et al., 2016).

The updated framework in organized into three phases:
* Engage – Through a process of Essential Questioning, the Learners move from an abstract Big Idea to a concrete and actionable Challenge.
* Investigate – All Learners plan and participate in a journey that builds the foundation for Solutions and addresses academic requirements.
* Act – Evidence-based Solutions are developed, implemented with an authentic audience, and then evaluated based on the results.
Throughout the process, all participants are expected to document the experience, reflect on practice and share the experience with the world.

The CBL framework has been extended into new areas including strategic planning, workplace training (O'Mahony, et al., 2012), and mobile software instruction and development (Santos, et al., 2015).

== Principles ==

Challenge-based learning is a flexible framework, with each implementation, new ideas surface, the framework is reviewed, and the model evolves.

Challenge-based learning provides:

# A flexible and customizable framework that can be implemented as a guiding pedagogy or integrated with other progressive approaches to learning.
# A scalable model with multiple points of entry and the ability to start small and build big,
# A free and open system with no proprietary ideas, products or subscriptions.
# A process that places all Learners in charge, and responsible for the learning.
# An authentic environment for meeting academic standards and making deeper connections with content.
# A focus on global ideas, meaningful Challenges and the development of local and age appropriate Solutions
# An authentic relationship between academic disciplines and real world experience
# A framework to develop 21st-century skills
# Purposeful use of technology for researching, analyzing, organizing, collaborating, networking, communicating, publishing and reflecting.
# The opportunity for Learners to make a difference now.
# A way to document and assess both the learning process and products,
# An environment for deep reflection on teaching and learning

'''Classical liberalism''' is a [[political ideology]] and a [[History of liberalism|branch]] of [[liberalism]] which advocates [[civil liberties]] under the [[rule of law]] with an emphasis on [[economic freedom]]. Closely related to [[economic liberalism]], it developed in the early 19th century, building on ideas from the previous century as a response to [[urbanization]] and to the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].{{sfn|Conway|p=296}}&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite book|first = Richard |last =Hudelson |date = 1999|url = https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Modern%20Political%20Philosophy&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title= Modern Political Philosophy|pages =  37–38|isbn =9780765600219|publisher = M.E. Sharpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dickerson|Flanagan|O'Neill|p=129}} Notable individuals whose ideas contributed to classical liberalism include [[John Locke]],&lt;ref name="Steven M. Dworetz 1994"&gt;Steven M. Dworetz (1994). ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. It drew on the [[Classical economics|classical economic ideas]] espoused by [[Adam Smith]] in Book One of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and on a belief in [[natural law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Joyce Appleby|first = Joyce|last = Appleby|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=83HlqTJjLcgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date = 1992|title = Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical Imagination|page = 58|publisher =Harvard University Press|isbn = 9780674530133}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[utilitarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Gerald F.|last1= Gaus |author2-link= Chandran Kukathas|first2 = Chandran|last2= Kukathas|date = 2004|title = Handbook of Political Theory |page = 422|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dXjXKlb79cgC&amp;pg=PA422#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = SAGE|isbn =  9780761967873}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social progress|progress]].{{sfn|Hunt|p=54}} The term "classical liberalism" was applied in retrospect to distinguish earlier 19th-century liberalism from the newer [[social liberalism]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=52}}

== Evolution of core beliefs ==
Core beliefs of classical liberals included new ideas—which departed from both the older [[Conservatism|conservative]] idea of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|society as a family]] and from the later [[Sociology|sociological]] concept of society as [[Gesellschaft#Gesellschaft|complex set]] of [[social network]]s. Classical liberals believe that individuals are "egoistic, coldly calculating, essentially inert and atomistic"{{sfn|Hunt|p=44}} and that society is no more than the sum of its individual members.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=44–46}}

Classical liberals agreed with [[Thomas Hobbes]] that government had been created by individuals to protect themselves from each other and that the purpose of government should be to minimize conflict between individuals that would otherwise arise in a [[state of nature]]. These beliefs were complemented by a belief that laborers could be best motivated by financial incentive. This belief led to the passage of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], which limited the provision of social assistance, based on the idea that [[Market (economics)|markets]] are the mechanism that most efficiently leads to wealth. Adopting [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]'s population theory, they saw poor urban conditions as inevitable, they believed population growth would outstrip food production and they regarded that consequence desirable because starvation would help limit population growth. They opposed any income or wealth redistribution, which they believed would be dissipated by the lowest orders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=49–51}}

Drawing on ideas of [[Adam Smith]], classical liberals believed that it is in the common interest that all individuals be able to secure their own economic self-interest. They were critical of what would come to be the idea of the [[welfare state]] as interfering in a [[free market]].&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Alan Ryan, "Liberalism", in ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', ed. Robert E. Goodin and Philip Pettit (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1995), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Smith’s resolute recognition of the importance and value of labor and of laborers, they selectively criticized labour's [[group rights]] being pursued at the expense of [[individual rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Evans, M. ed. (2001): ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'', London: Routledge, 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; while accepting [[Economic liberalism|corporations' rights]], which led to [[inequality of bargaining power]].{{sfn|Dickerson|Flanagan|O'Neill|p=132}}&lt;ref name = smith&gt;{{cite book|last =Smith|first = A. |date = 1778|title =  An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|volume = I|chapter = 8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22public+good%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lgx2t0b3Xu&amp;sig=ygsWFIUuw8JhsxYeiXgaiE5LdNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RGFIUfzqNe-N4gTvqoDgDA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22public%20good%22&amp;f=false|publisher = W. Strahan; and T. Cadell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical liberals argued that individuals should be free to obtain work from the highest-paying employers while the [[profit motive]] would ensure that products that people desired were produced at prices they would pay. In a free market, both labor and capital would receive the greatest possible reward while production would be organized efficiently to meet consumer demand.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=46–47}}

Classical liberals argued for what they called a minimal state, limited to the following functions:
* A government to protect individual rights and to provide services that cannot be provided in a free market.
* A common national defense to provide protection against foreign invaders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}
* Laws to provide protection for citizens from wrongs committed against them by other citizens, which included protection of private property, enforcement of contracts and common law.
* Building and maintaining public institutions.
* Public works that included a stable currency, standard weights and measures and building and upkeep of roads, canals, harbors, railways, communications and postal services.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}

They asserted that rights are of a [[Negative and positive rights|negative]] nature, which require other individuals (and governments) to refrain from interfering with the free market, opposing social liberals who assert that individuals have positive rights, such as the right to vote, the right to an education, the right to health care and the right to a living wage. For society to guarantee positive rights, it requires taxation over and above the minimum needed to enforce negative rights.&lt;ref name=Cato_Institut_Kelley&gt;[[David Kelley|Kelly, D.]] (1998): ''A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State'', Washington, DC: [[Cato Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|pp=36–38}}

Core beliefs of classical liberals did not necessarily include [[democracy]] or government by a majority vote by citizens because "there is nothing in the bare idea of majority rule to show that majorities will always respect the rights of property or maintain rule of law".&lt;ref name="RyanA_1995"&gt;Ryan, A. (1995): "Liberalism", In: Goodin, R. E. and Pettit, P., eds.: ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[James Madison]] argued for a constitutional republic with protections for individual liberty over a [[pure democracy]], reasoning that in a pure democracy a "common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole...and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party".&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, [[Federalist No. 10]] (22 November 1787), in Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison, ''The Federalist: A Commentary on the Constitution of the United States'', ed. Henry Cabot Lodge (New York, 1888), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XcllKruLvi4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;vq=%22common+passion+or+interest%22 p. 56].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, classical liberalism developed into [[neo-classical liberalism]], which argued for government to be as small as possible to allow the exercise of [[individual freedom]]. In its most extreme form, neo-classical liberalism advocated [[Social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name="mayne"&gt;Mayne, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right-libertarianism]] is a modern form of neo-classical liberalism.&lt;ref name="mayne"/&gt;

=== Friedrich Hayek's typology of beliefs ===
[[Friedrich Hayek]] identified two different traditions within classical liberalism: the "British tradition" and the "French tradition". Hayek saw the British philosophers [[Bernard Mandeville]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Josiah Tucker]] and [[William Paley]] as representative of a tradition that articulated beliefs in [[empiricism]], the [[common law]] and in traditions and institutions which had spontaneously evolved but were imperfectly understood. The French tradition included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the [[Encyclopédistes|Encyclopedists]] and the [[Physiocrats]]. This tradition believed in rationalism and sometimes showed hostility to tradition and religion. Hayek conceded that the national labels did not exactly correspond to those belonging to each tradition: Hayek saw the Frenchmen [[Montesquieu]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] as belonging to the "British tradition" and the British [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Thomas Paine]] as belonging to the "French tradition".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|first = F. A. |last = Hayek|title = The Constitution of Liberty|location = London|publisher =  Routledge |date= 1976|pages =  55–56|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0otEBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Constitution+of+Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ_a-MwpreAhUQXKwKHaLkCBMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn = 9781317857808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, 'Individualism: True and False', in ''Individualism and Economic Order'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek also rejected the label ''[[laissez-faire]]'' as originating from the French tradition and alien to the beliefs of Hume and Smith.

[[Guido De Ruggiero]] also identified differences between "Montesquieu and Rousseau, the English and the democratic types of liberalism"{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=71}} and argued that there was a "profound contrast between the two Liberal systems".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} He claimed that the spirit of "authentic English Liberalism" had "built up its work piece by piece without ever destroying what had once been built, but basing upon it every new departure". This liberalism had  "insensibly adapted ancient institutions to modern needs" and "instinctively recoiled from all abstract proclamations of principles and rights".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} Ruggiero claimed that this liberalism was challenged by what he called the "new Liberalism of France" that was characterised by egalitarianism and a "rationalistic consciousness".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|pp=81–82}}

In 1848, [[Francis Lieber]] distinguished between what he called "Anglican and Gallican Liberty". Lieber asserted that "independence in the highest degree, compatible with safety and broad national guarantees of liberty, is the great aim of Anglican liberty, and self-reliance is the chief source from which it draws its strength".{{sfn|Lieber|p=377}} On the other hand, Gallican liberty "is sought in government...the French look for the highest degree of political civilization in organizational, that is, in the highest degree of interference by public power".{{sfn|Lieber|pp=382–383}}

== History ==
=== Great Britain ===
Classical liberalism in Britain developed from [[Whigs (British political party)|Whiggery]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], was also heavily influenced by French [[physiocracy]] and represented a new political ideology. Whiggery had become a dominant ideology following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was associated with the defence of the British Parliament, upholding the rule of law and defending [[landed property]]. The origins of rights were seen as being in an [[ancient constitution]], which had existed from [[time immemorial]]. These rights, which some Whigs considered to include freedom of the press and freedom of speech, were justified by custom rather than by [[natural rights]]. They believed that the power of the executive had to be constrained. While they supported limited suffrage, they saw voting as a privilege rather than as a right. However, there was no consistency in Whig ideology and diverse writers including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]] were all influential among Whigs, although none of them was universally accepted.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}}

From the 1790s to the 1820s, British radicals concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasising natural rights and popular sovereignty. [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] adapted the language of Locke to the ideology of radicalism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}} The radicals saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael J. |last=Turner |year=1999 |title=British Politics in an Age of Reform |location=Manchester, England |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-51869 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was greater unity to classical liberalism ideology than there had been with Whiggery. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. They believed that required a free economy with minimal government interference. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers. Some elements of Whiggery opposed this new thinking and were uncomfortable with the commercial nature of classical liberalism. These elements became associated with conservatism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=29–30}}

[[File:1846 - Anti-Corn Law League Meeting.jpg|thumb|250px|A meeting of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in [[Exeter Hall]] in 1846]]
Classical liberalism was the dominant political theory in Britain from the early 19th century until the First World War. Its notable victories were the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829]], the [[Reform Act of 1832]] and the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. The [[Anti-Corn Law League]] brought together a coalition of liberal and radical groups in support of free trade under the leadership of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who opposed militarism and public expenditure. Their policies of low public expenditure and low taxation were adopted by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] when he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Classical liberalism was often associated with religious dissent and [[nonconformism]].{{sfn|Gray|pp=26–27}}

Although classical liberals aspired to a minimum of state activity, they accepted the principle of [[government intervention]] in the economy from the early 19th century with passage of the [[Factory Acts]]. From around 1840 to 1860, ''laissez-faire'' advocates of the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] and writers in ''[[The Economist]]'' were confident that their early victories would lead to a period of expanding economic and personal liberty and world peace, but would face reversals as government intervention and activity continued to expand from the 1850s. [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], although advocates of ''laissez-faire'', non-intervention in foreign affairs and individual liberty, believed that social institutions could be rationally redesigned through the principles of [[utilitarianism]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] rejected classical liberalism altogether and advocated [[Tory democracy]]. By the 1870s, [[Herbert Spencer]] and other classical liberals concluded that historical development was turning against them.{{sfn|Gray|p=28}} By the First World War, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had largely abandoned classical liberal principles.{{sfn|Gray|p=32}}

The changing economic and social conditions of the 19th century led to a division between neo-classical and social (or welfare) liberals, who while agreeing on the importance of individual liberty differed on the role of the state.  Neo-classical liberals, who called themselves "true liberals", saw Locke's ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise]]'' as the best guide and emphasised "limited government" while social liberals supported government regulation and the welfare state. Herbert Spencer in Britain and [[William Graham Sumner]] were the leading neo-classical liberal theorists of the 19th century.{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=596}} Neo-classical liberalism has continued into the contemporary era, with writers such as [[John Rawls]].{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=603}} The evolution from classical to social/welfare liberalism is for example reflected in Britain in the evolution of the thought of [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;See the studies of Keynes by [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], [[Donald Moggridge]] and [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, liberalism took a strong root because it had little opposition to its ideals, whereas in Europe liberalism was opposed by many reactionary or feudal interests such as the nobility, the aristocracy, the landed gentry, the established church and the aristocratic army officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Louis|last= Hartz|title=The Liberal Tradition in America|date=1955|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=e1bQY1CDx2IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter = The Concept of a Liberal Society|isbn = 9780156512695|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] adopted many of the ideals of liberalism, but in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] changed Locke's "life, liberty and property" to the more [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] "[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]".&lt;ref name="Steven M. Dworetz 1994"/&gt; As the United States grew, industry became a larger and larger part of American life; and during the term of its first [[Populism|populist]] [[President of the United States|President]], [[Andrew Jackson]], economic questions came to the forefront. The economic ideas of the [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian era]] were almost universally the ideas of classical liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy M. Brown|title=Explaining the Reagan Years in Central America: A World System Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9N1duU9zgMC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-9813-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom was maximised when the government took a "hands off" attitude toward the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kahan|title=The Homestead Strike: Labor, Violence, and American Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctaTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=3 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-17397-4|page=28|quote=Called the "Jacksonian Era," this era was characterized by greater voting rights for white men, a hands-off approach to economic issues, and a desire to spread U.S. culture and government west (an outlook called "[[Manifest Destiny]]").}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues:
:[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&amp;pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading magazine ''[[The Nation]]'' espoused liberalism every week starting in 1865 under the influential editor [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin|Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] (1831–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Gustav |last = Pollak|url = https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofamer00poll |title= Fifty Years of American Idealism: 1865-1915|date = 1915|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of classical liberalism remained essentially unchallenged until a series of [[Depression (economics)|depressions]], thought to be impossible according to the tenets of [[classical economics]], led to economic hardship from which the voters demanded relief. In the words of [[William Jennings Bryan]], "[[Cross of Gold speech|You shall not crucify the American farmer on a cross of gold]]". Classical liberalism remained the orthodox belief among American businessmen until the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Voegelin&gt;Eric Voegelin, Mary Algozin, and Keith Algozin, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1406338 "Liberalism and Its History"], ''Review of Politics'' 36, no. 4 (1974): 504–520.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a sea change in liberalism, with priority shifting from the producers to consumers. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] represented the dominance of [[modern liberalism]] in politics for decades. In the words of [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]]:&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schelesinger Jr., [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"], in ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When the growing complexity of industrial conditions required increasing government intervention in order to assure more equal opportunities, the liberal tradition, faithful to the goal rather than to the dogma, altered its view of the state. [...] There emerged the conception of a social welfare state, in which the national government had the express obligation to maintain high levels of employment in the economy, to supervise standards of life and labour, to regulate the methods of business competition, and to establish comprehensive patterns of social security.|sign=|source=}}

[[Alan Wolfe]] summarizes the viewpoint that there is a continuous liberal understanding that includes both [[Adam Smith]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Alan|last = Wolfe|url = http://www.tnr.com/blog/alan-wolfe/false-distinction |title = A False Distinction |work = The New Republic|date = 12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The idea that liberalism comes in two forms assumes that the most fundamental question facing mankind is how much government intervenes into the economy... When instead we discuss human purpose and the meaning of life, Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes are on the same side. Both of them possessed an expansive sense of what we are put on this earth to accomplish. [...] For Smith, mercantilism was the enemy of human liberty. For Keynes, monopolies were. It makes perfect sense for an eighteenth-century thinker to conclude that humanity would flourish under the market.

For as Hayek noted: "It is the doctrine on which the American system of government is based. "But, contemporary American conservatism is a novel brew which Micklethwait and Wooldridge rightly note is a mixture of the individualism of classical liberalism and "ubertraditionalism." It represents adherence to the bourgeois organization of society epitomized by that much-maligned word, "Victorian": with its faith in individualism, capitalism, progress, and virtue. Having been silenced by the seemingly endless march of "embedded liberalism" since the New Deal, American conservatism has, since the late 1960s, regrouped, and under Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush created a new powerful political movement. Thus, apart from the brief period of Margaret Thatcher's ascendancy in Britain, it is only in the United States that the classical liberal tradition continues to have political force.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual sources ==
=== John Locke ===
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|160px|[[John Locke]]]]
Central to classical liberal ideology was their interpretation of [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise of Government]]'' and ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'', which had been written as a defence of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although these writings were considered too radical at the time for Britain's new rulers, they later came to be cited by Whigs, radicals and supporters of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Dworetz, ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of later liberal thought was absent in Locke's writings or scarcely mentioned and his writings have been subject to various interpretations. For example, there is little mention of [[constitutionalism]], the [[separation of powers]] and [[limited government]].{{sfn|Richardson|pp=22–23}}

James L. Richardson identified five central themes in Locke's writing: [[individualism]], consent, the concepts of the [[rule of law]] and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in the state of nature as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.{{sfn|Richardson|p=23}}

As a trustee, government was expected to serve the interests of the people, not the rulers; and rulers were expected to follow the laws enacted by legislatures. Locke also held that the main purpose of men uniting into commonwealths and governments was for the preservation of their property. Despite the ambiguity of Locke's definition of property, which limited property to "as much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of", this principle held great appeal to individuals possessed of great wealth.{{sfn|Richardson|pp=23–24}}

Locke held that the individual had the right to follow his own religious beliefs and that the state should not impose a religion against [[Dissenter]]s, but there were limitations. No tolerance should be shown for [[Atheism|atheists]], who were seen as amoral, or to [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], who were seen as owing allegiance to the Pope over their own national government.{{sfn|Richardson|p=24}}

=== Adam Smith ===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Adam Smith]]]]
[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in 1848.{{sfn|Mills|pp=63, 68}} Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow to maximise wealth.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

Smith wrote that as long as supply, demand, prices and competition were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society&lt;ref name = smith/&gt; through profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[[invisible hand]]" directed individuals and firms to work toward the public good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

He assumed that workers could be paid wages as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the "[[iron law of wages]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=65}} His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.{{sfn|Mills|p=66}} He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies and employers' organisations and trade unions.{{sfn|Mills|p=67}} Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income.{{sfn|Mills|p=68}}

Smith's economics was carried into practice in the nineteenth century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}}

=== Classical economics ===
In addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]' theories of population and [[David Ricardo]]'s [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of [[classical economics]]. The pessimistic nature of these theories provided a basis for criticism of capitalism by its opponents and helped perpetuate the tradition of calling economics the "[[dismal science]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] was a French economist who introduced Smith's economic theories into France and whose commentaries on Smith were read in both France and Britain.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}} Say challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. His most important contribution to economic thinking was Say's law, which was interpreted by classical economists that there could be no overproduction in a market and that there would always be a balance between supply and demand.{{sfn|Mills|p=70}} This general belief influenced government policies until the 1930s. Following this law, since the economic cycle was seen as self-correcting, government did not intervene during periods of economic hardship because it was seen as futile.{{sfn|Mills|p=71}}

Malthus wrote two books, ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (published in 1798) and ''[[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of Political Economy]]'' (published in 1820). The second book which was a rebuttal of Say's law had little influence on contemporary economists.{{sfn|Mills|pp=71–72}} However, his first book became a major influence on classical liberalism. In that book, Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.{{sfn|Mills|p=72}}

Ricardo, who was an admirer of Smith, covered many of the same topics, but while Smith drew conclusions from broadly empirical observations he used deduction, drawing conclusions by reasoning from basic assumptions {{sfn|Mills|pp=73–74}} While Ricardo accepted Smith's [[labour theory of value]], he acknowledged that utility could influence the price of some rare items. Rents on agricultural land were seen as the production that was surplus to the subsistence required by the tenants. Wages were seen as the amount required for workers' subsistence and to maintain current population levels.{{sfn|Mills|pp=74–75}} According to his iron law of wages, wages could never rise beyond subsistence levels. Ricardo explained profits as a return on capital, which itself was the product of labour, but a conclusion many drew from his theory was that profit was a surplus appropriated by [[Capitalism|capitalists]] to which they were not entitled.{{sfn|Mills|p=75}}

=== Utilitarianism ===
[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s later writings on the subject foreshadowed the [[welfare state]], it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.{{sfn|Richardson|p=32}}

The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that public policy should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

== Political economy ==
Classical liberals saw utility as the foundation for public policies. This broke both with conservative "[[Traditionalist conservatism|tradition]]" and [[Natural rights#John Locke|Lockean "natural rights"]], which were seen as irrational. Utility, which emphasises the happiness of individuals, became the central ethical value of all liberalism.{{sfn|Richardson|p=31}} Although utilitarianism inspired wide-ranging reforms, it became primarily a justification for ''laissez-faire'' economics. However, classical liberals rejected Smith's belief that the "invisible hand" would lead to general benefits and embraced Malthus' view that population expansion would prevent any general benefit and Ricardo's view of the inevitability of class conflict. ''Laissez-faire'' was seen as the only possible economic approach and any government intervention was seen as useless and harmful. The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] was defended on "scientific or economic principles" while the authors of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601]] were seen as not having had the benefit of reading Malthus.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

However, commitment to ''laissez-faire'' was not uniform and some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on [[free trade]] as Ricardo expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs advocated by [[Richard Cobden]] and the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}} The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''The Economist'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water and granting of patents and copyrights.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}}

''The Economist'' also campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. A rigid belief in ''laissez-faire'' guided the government response in 1846–1849 to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland, during which an estimated 1.5 million people died. The minister responsible for economic and financial affairs, [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Charles Wood]], expected that private enterprise and free trade, rather than government intervention, would alleviate the famine.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}} The [[Corn Laws]] were finally repealed in 1846 by the removal of tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high,&lt;ref&gt;George Miller. ''On Fairness and Efficiency''. The Policy Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-86134-221-8}} p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; but it came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy. ''A Death-Dealing Famine:The Great Hunger in Ireland''. Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-1074-9}}. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee. ''Aspects of British Political History, 1815–1914''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-415-09006-3}}. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free trade and world peace ==
Several liberals, including Smith and Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods between nations could lead to [[world peace]]. Erik Gartzke states: "Scholars like Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Richard Cobden, [[Norman Angell]], and [[Richard Rosecrance]] have long speculated that [[free market]]s have the potential to free states from the looming prospect of recurrent warfare".&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "Economic Freedom and Peace," in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; American political scientists John R. Oneal and Bruce M. Russett, well known for their work on the democratic peace theory, state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J. R.|first2=B. M.|title=The Classical Liberals Were Right: Democracy, Interdependence, and Conflict, 1950–1985|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=41|issue=2|pages=267–294|year=1997|last1=Oneal|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00042|last2=Russet}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The classical liberals advocated policies to increase liberty and prosperity. They sought to empower the commercial class politically and to abolish royal charters, monopolies, and the protectionist policies of mercantilism so as to encourage entrepreneurship and increase productive efficiency. They also expected democracy and laissez-faire economics to diminish the frequency of war.}}

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', Smith argued that as societies progressed from hunter gatherers to industrial societies the spoils of war would rise, but that the costs of war would rise further and thus making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[T]he honours, the fame, the emoluments of war, belong not to [the middle and industrial classes]; the battle-plain is the harvest field of the aristocracy, watered with the blood of the people...Whilst our trade rested upon our foreign dependencies, as was the case in the middle of the last century...force and violence, were necessary to command our customers for our manufacturers...But war, although the greatest of consumers, not only produces nothing in return, but, by abstracting labour from productive employment and interrupting the course of trade, it impedes, in a variety of indirect ways, the creation of wealth; and, should hostilities be continued for a series of years, each successive war-loan will be felt in our commercial and manufacturing districts with an augmented pressure|[[Richard Cobden]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Stringham, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1676244 "Commerce, Markets, and Peace: Richard Cobden's Enduring Lessons"], ''Independent Review'' 9, no. 1 (2004): 105, 110, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}
{{quote|[B]y virtue of their mutual interest does nature unite people against violence and war, for the concept of cosmopolitan right does not protect them from it. The spirit of trade cannot coexist with war, and sooner or later this spirit dominates every people. For among all those powers (or means) that belong to a nation, financial power may be the most reliable in forcing nations to pursue the noble cause of peace (though not from moral motives); and wherever in the world war threatens to break out, they will try to head it off through mediation, just as if they were permanently leagued for this purpose.|[[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], ''The Perpetual Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small, but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets. The belief that free trade would promote peace was widely shared by English liberals of the 19th and early 20th century, leading the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946), who was a classical liberal in his early life, to say that this was a doctrine on which he was "brought up" and which he held unquestioned only until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-9780198292364;jsessionid=4B0FEAE67C6CC2944F0147AFD5045F62?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp; ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''], Oxford University Press, 2006, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of a book on Keynes, Michael S. Lawlor argues that it may be in large part due to Keynes' contributions in economics and politics, as in the implementation of the [[Marshall Plan]] and the way economies have been managed since his work, "that we have the luxury of not facing his unpalatable choice between free trade and full employment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://eh.net/book_reviews/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-economic-paths-to-war-and-peace/ John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace]  Donald Markwell (2006), reviewed by M S Lawlor (February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A related manifestation of this idea was the argument of [[Norman Angell]] (1872–1967), most famously before World War I in ''[[The Great Illusion]]'' (1909), that the interdependence of the economies of the major powers was now so great that war between them was futile and irrational; and therefore unlikely.

The '''computer art scene''', or simply '''artscene''', is the community interested and active in the creation of [[computer art|computer-based artwork]].

==Early computer art==
The history of computer art predates the computer art scene for several decades, with the first experiments having taken place in the early 1950s. Devices like [[plotter]]s and [[teletypewriter]]s were commonly used instead of video display screens. The earliest precursors to [[ASCII art]] can be found in [[radioteletype|RTTY]] art, that is, pictures created by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts with teleprinters using the [[Baudot code]].

In the early days of [[microcomputer]]s, what could be shown on a typical [[computer display|video display screen]] was limited to plain and simple text, such as that found in the [[ASCII]] code set.  In the early 1980s, users of [[IBM PC compatible]] computers began to experiment with ways of forming simple pictures and designs using only the 255 characters within the [[Extended ASCII]] [[character encoding|character set]], specifically known as [[code page]] [[codepage 437|437]], created by [[IBM]].  [[Modem]]s and networking technology allowed computer users to communicate with each other over [[bulletin board system]]s (BBSes); the [[sysop|operators]] of these BBSes used [[ASCII art]] to enhance the aesthetic appearance of their systems.   The common user interface or video mode shared by all systems was [[text user interface|plain text]].  As a result, a "[[Warez (scene)|scene]]" of [[artists]] arose to fill the need for original art to distinguish one BBS from another.

==Evolving technology==

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:TheDraw ANSI.png|thumb|320px|A screenshot of ANSI art]] --&gt;
Many home computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s were able to display 16 colors in 320x200 or 640x200.  At a time when IBM PCs were limited to monochrome (2 colors) or [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] (4 colors), the [[Atari 800]] and [[Commodore 64]] were being used at home to create 16-color art (see upper half of image at right).

In 1985, the [[Commodore Amiga]] arrived with the ability to display 640x480 near-photorealistic 4096-color graphics that could be exported via the NTSC standard.  Eventually this capability was used by Disney animators in movies such as ''The Little Mermaid'' and by TV producers in shows such as ''SeaQuest'' and ''Babylon 5''.

===Online===
As computer technology developed, the [[American National Standards Institute]] X3 committee invented a standard method of terminal control using [[escape sequence]]s called "ANSI X3.64-1979".  This protocol allowed for text and cursor positioning as well as defining foreground and background color attributes for the text.

Eventually, text artists began incorporating this new level of flexibility to the existing medium of [[ASCII art]] by adding color to their text-based art, or animating their art by manipulating the cursor control codes.  This is what is commonly referred to today as "[[ANSI art]]" that is used in many scene nfos.

A decade later, the popularity of ANSI art had increased significantly (largely due to the similarly increasing interest in the BBS) and ANSI artists began to form into "groups", not unlike [[graffiti]] "crews."  The first ANSI group was called [[Aces of ANSI Art]] (AAA).&lt;ref name="BBSDoc"&gt;{{Cite video|people = Jason Scott| title = "BBS: The Documentary"| medium = DVD|publisher = Bovine Ignition Systems|location = Boston, MA| date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though no official founding date can be established for this group, its earliest surviving tribute packs are dated December 1991 and includes art dated back to 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = BBSing.com, Aces of Ansi Art | work = ReadMe file of aaa-8991.zip | url = http://www.bbsing.com/ansiart/acesofansiart/acesofansiart.html | accessdate = March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups like [[ACiD Productions|ACiD]] (ANSI Creators in Demand) and [[iCE Advertisements|iCE]] (Insane Creators Enterprises) quickly began to spring up.  Beginning in June 1992, these groups would release their work in monthly "ARTPACKS,"&lt;ref name="BBSDoc"/&gt; which were collections of ASCII art submitted by the group's various members, as well as news and membership lists.&lt;ref name="BBSDoc"/&gt;  These artpacks were then spread far and wide by BBS users.  Some of the same groups from the 1990s still exist today; their art is now primarily distributed using the [[internet]].

A later method of transmitting graphics over a BBS was developed called Remote Imaging Protocol or [[RIPscrip|RIP]], which required special software on both the BBS and the terminal end.  RIP was still basically text, but the text referred to the positions of lines, curves, fills, and other steps in drawing graphics on an [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] display of 640x350x16 colors.  While RIP never caught on in the BBS world, the art scene embraced it as a form of expression, if not a viable method of displaying art on a BBS.

==VGA to present day==
[[Image:Torak.gif|thumb|250px|256 and 16 color progressive images from 1980s VGA card. [[Dithering]] is used to overcome color limitations.]] 
In 1987 IBM introduced the VGA card.  Early [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] graphics were "high resolution" images, generally using an 8-bit depth (256 colors) and a resolution of 320x200x256, 360x480x256 (hacked [[Mode X]]), or 640x480x16 colors.  VGA was not intended to be displayed via a BBS and the vast majority of the early works in the IBM PC artscene were distributed as coded [[executable]]s called "''loaders''" or "''[[crack intro|intros]]''" rather than raw bitmap images.  In fact, it was considered to be "''[[lamer|lame]]''" to release an uncoded VGA work of art from the early- to mid-1990s, a sure indication that your group was not skilled enough to retain a worthy programmer.

The advent of custom image viewers developed by groups within the artscene, such as ACiD View and iCEView, began to shift the perception of how VGA art should be distributed and what the accepted practice should be.  A coded VGA which did not take any of the advantages of being an executable, like special effects or music, became viewed as an impractical use of disk space—all of this in turn spawned a number of competing image viewers, and even "Viewer Wars" between rival art groups.  Talented underground artists such as CatBones continued to help pioneer and define what is now referred to as the "''hirez artscene''", further championing the move away from coded VGA to stand-alone imagery with his impressive artwork.  ''Hirez'' today implies higher resolutions than before, such as a 1024x768 pixel canvas or larger, greater depth of color, and is created with much more sophisticated and modern software.

==Underground status==
Despite the fact that contributors to the artscene can be found worldwide, the scene continues to remain detached from mainstream bbs and internet culture. This can be seen as a result of the artscene's early affiliations with [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] and software piracy ([[List of warez groups|warez]]) organizations. As early [[demoscene]] [[List of demoscene groups|groups]] were organized by [[cracktros]] coders, artscene members were often found designing the [[.nfo]] files detailing [[warez]] releases. In addition much of the [[ansi art]] provided for warez BBSes was drawn by future members of the artscene. Prior to the popularity of the internet in the 1990s, the most efficient way to distribute software and files across BBSes was via a courier system. Both the warez scene and the artscene utilized this system, and in many cases warez couriers could be found distributing monthly [[artpack]]s.

In addition to  connection that the various [[:Category:Underground computer groups|underground groups]] had, a common attitude and relationship between scene members developed. The general belief that "[[newbies]] are lame" and "veterans are [[leet|elite]]", as well as the use of [[leetspeek]], created an environment that was sometimes difficult for new members to enter. In particular, many artsceners' distrust and bitterness towards new [[America Online]] users in the 1990s may have eroded the possibility for a wider membership base and audience for the artscene.

==Artscene lexicon==
* "Colly" - A collection of multiple works of ASCII art compiled and presented as a single text file.
* "Collab" - A collaborative artwork between two or more artists.  The artists exchange the file and work on it, creating unique works.
* "[[Demoscene compo|Compo]]" - A competitive event which can take place either physically at a [[demoparty]] or on-line.
* "Rip" - Artwork created in the [[Remote imaging protocol|RIPscrip]] format, or an act of [[plagiarism]].
* "Scroller" - An ANSI artwork which is longer than 25 lines is called a "scroller" because it scrolls down the screen on an MS-DOS machine as it is being displayed.
* "Stylerip" - To borrow someone else's artistic style.

*''The spelling "Mazepa" refers to the historical person; the double-p "Mazeppa" is used for the artistic and literary works.''

[[Ivan Stepanovych Mazepa|Ivan Mazepa]] (1639–1709) was a significant figure in the [[history of Ukraine]]. One story about him says that as a young man, he was caught ''[[in flagrante]]'' with a noblewoman, whose husband punished him by tying him naked to a wild horse and setting them free; eventually he reached the Cossacks and became their military leader. This caught the attention of the English poet [[Lord Byron]] ("[[Lady Caroline Lamb#Lord Byron|mad, bad, and dangerous to know]]"), whose ''[[Mazeppa (poem)|Mazeppa]]'' (1819) brought the events to wider attention. His [[narrative poem]] inspired many paintings, particularly by French Romantics, which in turn stimulated musical compositions, stage plays, more poems, and so on. New life was breathed into the equestrian tale when it was transposed to the American [[Wild West]].

==The historical figure==
{{Main|Ivan Mazepa}}
Mazepa served as [[Hetman of Zaporizhian Host]] in 1687–1708. He played an important role in the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709), where after learning that the Russian Tsar, [[Peter the Great]], intended to replace him with [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]], he deserted his army and sided with King [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. The political consequences and interpretation of this desertion have resonated in the national histories both of Russia and of Ukraine. The alienation of Mazepa from Ukrainian historiography continued during the Soviet period, but post-1991 in independent Ukraine there have been strong moves to rehabilitate Mazepa's image, although he remains a controversial figure.

==Byron's poem==
{{Main|Mazeppa (poem)}}
[[File:Mazeppa - Byron.png|thumb|right|300px|Currier and Ives illustration to their 1846 printing of the poem]]
[[Lord Byron]] published his [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] in 1819. According to the poem, the young Mazeppa has a love affair with a Polish Countess Theresa while serving as a page at the Court of King [[John II Casimir Vasa]]. Countess Theresa was married to a much older Count. On discovering the affair, the Count punishes Mazeppa by tying him naked to a wild horse and setting the horse loose. The bulk of the poem describes the traumatic journey of the hero strapped to the horse. The poem has been praised for its "vigor of style and its sharp realization of the feelings of suffering and endurance".&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchand|first=Leslie|date=1968|title=Byron's Poetry: A Critical Introduction|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no historical evidence to support that Mazepa was exiled from Poland because of a love affair, or that he was punished by being strapped to a wild horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blumberg|first=Arnold|date=1995|title=Great Leaders, Great Tyrants?|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=184–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this colorful legend was in circulation before Byron published his poem.  [[Voltaire]] repeats it in ''History of Charles XII, King of Sweden'' (1731). This appears to have been Byron's main source for his poem: his 'Advertisement' to the poem includes three long quotations from this work. Several critics have also speculated that Byron was familiar with the ''Mémoires d'Azéma'' (1764) by the French writer [[André Guillaume Contant Dorville]], as there are significant similarities between the plot of that novel and of Byron's poem.&lt;ref name="Babinski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Babinski|first=H.F.|date=1975|title=The Mazeppa legend in European Romanticism|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first wave of reaction==
[[File:Mazeppa Louis Boulanger.jpg|thumb|Louis Boulanger, ''Mazeppa'']]
Byron's poem was both popular and influential in the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]]. [[Horses in art]] had long been a popular theme, so when the poem was translated into French the same year by [[Amédée Pichot]], a wave of French painters decided to depict Mazeppa's "wild ride", including [[Théodore Géricault]] (1823, now held in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Théodore Gericault {{!}} Mazeppa {{!}} The Met|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/358010|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1824, [[Finnish National Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finnish National Gallery - Art Collections - Mazeppa on the Dying Horse|url=http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?si=A+II+1426&amp;lang=en|website=Finnish National Gallery - Art Collections|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Horace Vernet]] (1826, [[Musée Calvet]] in Avignon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Présentation du musée - ANGLAIS - MUSEUM ROOMS - upstairs 1|url=http://www.musee-calvet-avignon.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=815|website=www.musee-calvet-avignon.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=fr-fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Louis Boulanger]] (1827, the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ordeal of Mazeppa|url=http://mbarouen.fr/en/oeuvres/the-ordeal-of-mazeppa|website=Musée des Beaux-Arts|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=fr|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Boulanger's ''The Ordeal of Mazeppa'' and Vernet's ''Mazeppa and the Wolves'' both competed in the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon of 1827]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

A theatrical version of the story soon appeared: a show called ''Mazeppa, or the Tartar Horse'' premiered at [[Antonio Franconi]]'s [[Cirque Olympique]] in Paris in 1825. This was copied in both the USA and England.&lt;ref name="Mainardi"/&gt;  [[Aleksandr Pushkin]] wrote a poem-response to Byron entitled ''[[Poltava (poem)|Poltava]]'' (1828–29), which opens with an epigraph from the Englishman's poem, and in which he portrays Mazeppa as a villain who betrayed Russians.

[[Victor Hugo]] was inspired by the French Romantic paintings to compose "Mazeppa", one of the major pieces in ''[[Les Orientales]]'' (1829), which he dedicated to Boulanger. The first part of his poem describes Mazeppa's run across Ukrainian plains. The second part compares Mazeppa to a poet banned from the living world because of his eccentricities, the banned poet is attached to the wild horse of his inspiration. The comparison to the poet ends by saying that this crazy trip through suffering finally gives success and glory to the poet.

==The 1830s-1860s==

The playwright [[Henry M. Milner]] wrote ''Mazeppa; or, The wild horse of Tartary. A romantic drama, in three acts. Dramatised from Lord Byron's poem by H.M. Milner, and adapted to the stage under the direction of Mr. Ducrow.''&lt;ref&gt;OCLC 31254994&lt;/ref&gt; (This was [[Andrew Ducrow]], the "Father of British circus [[equestrianism]]" and proprietor of [[Astley's Amphitheatre]].) It appeared in London in 1831. Over the next several years it toured the US, until "at one point, five different productions of the play were showing in San Francisco".&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=Linda A.|last2=Bowers|first2=Carrie|title=Agnes Lake Hickok : queen of the circus, wife of a legend|date=2009|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=9780806139838|chapter=7: Mazeppa Enters the Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Frederick Herring Sr.]], an Englishman who started out as a stagecoach driver, painted several versions of the story: two are "after Horace Vernet" (circa 1833, [[Tate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Mazeppa Surrounded by Horses (after Horace Vernet)’, John Frederick Herring, c.1833 {{!}} Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/herring-mazeppa-surrounded-by-horses-after-horace-vernet-t00189|website=Tate|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Mazeppa Pursued by Wolves (after Horace Vernet)’, John Frederick Herring, 1833 {{!}} Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/herring-mazeppa-pursued-by-wolves-after-horace-vernet-t00188|website=Tate|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1842 "MAZEPPA"{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. In 1846, the American lithographer [[Nathaniel Currier]], of [[Currier and Ives]], prepared four plates, with Byronic quotations; the artworks are now at [[Bridgeman Art Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|date=1993|title=Art in an age of Bonapartism, 1800–1815|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=170–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mainardi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mainardi|first=Patricia|date=2003|title= Husbands, Wives and Lovers: Marriage and its Discontents in Nineteenth-Century France|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conningham|first1=Frederic A.|title=Currier and Ives prints : an illustrated check list.|date=1983|publisher=Crown Publ.|location=New York|isbn=9780517551158|page=36|edition= New, updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juliusz Słowacki]], a major figure in the [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romantic period]], wrote a play entitled ''Mazeppa'' (1840). Although he is now considered the father of modern Polish drama, it was the only one of his dramas that was put on stage during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Murray (2004). Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760–1850. Taylor &amp; Francis. pp. 1059–61. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-423-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Malcolm Rymer]], a British writer of [[penny dreadful]]s, wrote ''Mazeppa; or, The Wild Horse of the Ukraine: A Romance'' (1850).

Musicians were also inspired. [[Carl Loewe]] composed a tone-poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mazeppa - A Tone-Poem after Byron, Op. 27 - Carl Loewe &amp; Linda Nicholson Song - BBC Music|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/tracks/n5z298|website=BBC|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generation after Hugo published his poem, it became the literary inspiration for [[Mazeppa (symphonic poem)|a symphonic poem]] (1851) and [[Transcendental Étude No. 4 (Liszt)|a Transcendental Étude]] (1852) by [[Franz Liszt]].  Another French Romantic painter, [[Théodore Chassériau]], re-interpreted Byron's poem, with ''Cossack girl at Mazeppa 's body'' (1851, [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Une jeune fille cosaque trouve Mazeppa évanoui sur le cheval sauvage - Musées de Strasbourg|url=https://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/oeuvre-musee-des-beaux-arts/-/entity/id/220490|website=www.musees.strasbourg.eu|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Irishman [[Michael William Balfe]] composed a [[cantata]] known as ''The Page'' or ''Mazeppa'' in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=William Alexander|title=Balfe:His Life and Work|date=1882|page=244|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner's play was adapted and [[burlesque]]d over the decades. For example, in 1856 it was re-written as an equestrian burlesque in two acts, by [[blackface]] minstrel entertainer [[Charles "Charlie" White]]. The main antagonist is Castiron, and his daughter is Olinska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contested Interpretations of the Past in Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian Film: Screen as Battlefield|page=149|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mazeppa story became "a well-worn melodrama in dire need of revitalization", which it received from the performer [[Adah Isaacs Menken]]. Other women had played Mazeppa, including [[Charlotte Cushman]], but Menken's interpretation  -- "sexing up" the part, scandalously performing the nude scene clad only in a flesh-colored [[bodystocking]]—really caught the public imagination.&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma Press"/&gt; Many other female Mazeppas followed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slout|first1=William L.|title=En Route to the Great Eastern Circus and Other Essays on Circus History|date=2016|isbn= 978-1-4344-3547-7|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did a new wave of burlesques. ''Mazeppa'' was very popular during the [[American Civil War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sentilles|first1=Renée M.|title=Performing Menken : Adah Isaacs Menken and the birth of American celebrity|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521820707|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the most widely performed drama in the [[American west]] from the 1860s until the turn of the century,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} and was also popular in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|date=2000|title=W.S.

[[Agnes Thatcher Lake]], a [[circus]] performer and equestrian all her life, took a production of ''Mazeppa'' to Europe in 1865, performing before [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828–85)|Prince Karl of Prussia]]. She then took her production across the United States, the only circus to do so, performing under her company's big top tents in towns and cities without a theatre big enough to host a stage show. A 2009 biography of Lake (who later married [[Wild Bill Hickok]]) estimates that two million Americans saw her athletic interpretation of Mazeppa, many more than saw Menken's sexualised one .&lt;ref name="University of Oklahoma Press"/&gt;

In 1877, Albert Aiken wrote a [[dime novel]] called ''The Indian Mazeppa or The Madman of the Plains'', in which the myth is transposed to the [[Wild West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivan Mazeppa|website=University of Manitoba|url=http://umanitoba.ca/centres/ukrainian_canadian/ucco/indianmazeppa.html|accessdate=14 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212231107/http://umanitoba.ca/centres/ukrainian_canadian/ucco/indianmazeppa.html|archivedate=12 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pushkin's poem became the subject of [[Mazeppa (opera)|an opera entitled ''Mazeppa'']], written between 1881 and 1883, with three acts and six scenes. The music is by [[Tchaikovsky]] and the libretto by [[Victor Burenin]]. It is set in Ukraine in the 18th century, and is a story about love, abduction, political persecution and vengeful murder.

In 1910, [[Francis Boggs]] produced a short film based on the stage play of Byron's poem titled ''Mazeppa or the Wild horse of Tartary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title | 0001311 | Mazeppa or the Wild horse of Tartary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1990==

In 1991, [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukraine declared independence]], and Mazeppa rose again in international consciousness. A French [[drama film]] titled ''[[Mazeppa (film)|Mazeppa]]'', based loosely on the lives of the painter Géricault and the equestrian Franconi, won a prize at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2565/year/1993.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Mazeppa |accessdate=2009-08-22|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gericault decided to stay and live with the circus and painted only horses to try and understand the mystery of this animal; Mazeppa embodies a man carried away by his passion.

A Ukrainian film by [[Yuri Ilyenko]] loosely based on historical facts, called ''[[A Prayer for Hetman Mazepa (film)|A Prayer for Hetman Mazepa]]'' was released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323279/ Molitva za getmana Mazepu (2002)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A South African interpretation of the Mazepa-Mazeppa motif describes it as "Romantic Phaethon" ([[Phaethon|a character in Greek mythology]] who drove the sun-chariot too recklessly) and points to its appeal to [[Modernist poetry|Modernist poets]] such as [[Bertol Brecht]] and [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;VOSS, Tony.

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Cuba}}
The music of Cuba, including the instruments and the dances, is mostly of European and African origin. Most forms of the present day are creolized fusions and mixtures of these two great sources. Almost nothing remains of the original Native traditions.

[[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortíz]], the first great Cuban folklorist, described Cuba's musical innovations as arising from the interplay ('transculturation') between African slaves settled on large [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s and Spanish or [[Canary Islands|Canary Island]]ers who grew [[tobacco]] on small farms. The African slaves and their descendants reconstructed large numbers of percussive instruments and corresponding rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Fernando 1952. ''Los instrumentos de la musica Afrocubana''. 5 volumes, La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt; The great instrumental contribution of the Spanish was their [[guitar]], but even more important was the tradition of European [[musical notation]] and techniques of [[musical composition]].

African beliefs and practices are most certainly an influence in Cuba's music. Polyrhythmic [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] is an inherent part of African life &amp; music, as melody is part of European music. Also, in African tradition, percussion is always joined to song and dance, and to a particular social setting. It is not simply entertainment added to life, it ''is'' life.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Fernando 1950. ''La Afrocania de la musica folklorica de Cuba''. La Habana, revised ed 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the meeting of European and African cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized. This creolization of Cuban life has been happening for a long time, and by the 20th century, elements of African belief, music and dance were well integrated into popular and folk forms.

[[File:Banrarra Afro-Cuban dance troupe 3, Havana Jan 2014, image by Marjorie Kaufman.jpg|thumb|Banrarra Afro-Cuban dance troupe
]]The roots of most Afro-Cuban musical forms lie in the [[Cabildo (Cuba)|cabildo]]s, self-organized social clubs for the African slaves, separate cabildos for separate cultures. The cabildos were formed mainly from four groups: the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] (the Lucumi in Cuba); the [[Kongo people|Congolese]] (Palo in Cuba); [[Dahomey]] (the [[Fon people|Fon]] or Arará). Other cultures were undoubtedly present, but in smaller numbers, and they did not leave such a distinctive presence. At the same time, African religions were transmitted from generation to generation throughout Cuba, [[Haiti]], other islands and Brazil. These religions, which had a similar but not identical structure, were known as ''Lucumi'' or ''Regla de Ocha'' if they derived from the [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]], ''[[Palo (religion)|Palo]]'' from Central Africa, ''Vodú'' from Haiti, and so on. The term ''[[Santería]]'' was first introduced to account for the way African spirits were joined to Catholic saints, especially by people who were both baptized and initiated, and so were genuinely members of both groups. By the 20th century, elements of Santería music had appeared in popular and folk forms.&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned 2004. ''Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo''. Chicago. p171; p258.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main rhythmic fusions in Cuban music is the [[Son Cubano|son]]. Other typical Cuban forms are the [[Habanera (music)|habanera]], the [[guaracha]], the [[danzón]], the [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], the [[Bolero#Cuba|bolero]], the [[chachachá]], the [[Mambo (music)|mambo]],the [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-cha]], the [[Punto cubano|punto]], and many variations on these themes.&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned 2004. ''Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo''. Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban music has been immensely popular and influential in other countries. It was the original basis of [[Salsa music|salsa]] and contributed not only to the development of [[jazz]], but also to Argentinian [[Tango music|tango]], Ghanaian [[Highlife|high-life]], West African [[Afrobeat]], and Spanish nuevo [[flamenco]]. Within modern Cuba, there are also popular musicians working in the [[Rock music|rock]] and [[reggaeton]] idioms.

Cuban [[hip-hop]] is one of the latest genres of music to be embraced not only by the country's youth but also, more reluctantly, by the [[Politics of Cuba|government]]. Initially, hip-hop was shunned by the authorities, because of its affiliation to America and capitalism. As more Cuban youth put their own energy and style into the music, Cuban hip-hop eventually became more acceptable. "The Cuban government now sees rap music &amp;ndash; long considered the music of American imperialism &amp;ndash; as a road map to the hearts and minds of the young generation"&lt;ref&gt;Wunderlich, Annelise. 2006. Cuban Hip-hop: making space for new voices of dissent. In ''The vinyl ain't final: hip hop and the globalization of black popular culture'', eds. Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle. London; Ann Arbor, Michigan: Pluto Press. p168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Geoffrey. 2005. ¡Hip hop, Revolución! Nationalizing Rap in Cuba. ''Ethnomusicology'' '''49''', 3: 368-402&lt;/ref&gt; is one opinion.

==Sports==
{{Main|Sport in Cuba}}
{{clarify|text=Fidel Castro's belief in socialism|date=October 2018}} and the benefits of sports (he loved and used to play baseball) has resulted in Cuba's relative international success for a population of 11 million in sporting events such as the [[Olympic Games]]. Unlike in most of Latin America, but like many nations of the Caribbean and some of Central America, [[Association football|football]] is not a major game in Cuba, but is gaining popularity. [[Baseball]] is the most popular sport in Cuba. Introduced by American dockworkers in [[Havana]] in the 19th century, the game has played a role in Cuban independence from [[Spain]]. Banned in 1895 by the Spanish, secret games funded [[José Martí]]'s revolt. Cuban ''peloteros'' rank highly internationally and some have migrated to [[Major League Baseball]] in the United States. The [[Cuba national baseball team]] finished second in the first [[World Baseball Classic]] against the Japanese national team. [[Boxing]] is also rather popular in Cuba. They also enjoy [[basketball]], [[track and field]], [[volleyball]], and [[rugby union]].

Every year, Cuba holds the School Sports Games, a competition for students {{Clarify|date=August 2012}}. The best athletes from age 11 to 16 are invited to be tested for the Schools for Sports Initiation (Spanish [[acronym]]: EIDE). EIDE students attend regular classes, receive advanced coaching and take part in higher level competitions. The top graduates from the school enter one of several Schools of Higher Athletic Performance (Spanish acronym: ESPA).

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Cuban cuisine}}
{{See also|Rationing in Cuba}}
A ration book called a ''libreta'' is supposed to guarantee a range of products from shops, however, there are still massive shortages and even rations are not guaranteed to be delivered timely or at all.

[[Image:VinalesFeast.jpg|thumb|At a [[casa particular]] in [[Viñales]], a pig is prepared for a feast.]]
The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's collapse]] in 1991 ended [[grain]] imports from that country, which were used to feed [[cattle]] and [[chickens]]. In 1991, [[beef]], chicken, [[milk]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]] became scarce.

A lack of fuel for agricultural machinery meant that [[Agriculture|crops]] had to be harvested manually (by people), drastically decreasing Cuba's food production capabilities. These problems have improved a little in recent years, but shortages are still common. To supplement their rations, Cubans resort to non-rationed food stores (where prices are nevertheless several times those of the ''libreta''), or to the [[black market]].

Traditional Cuban food is, as most cultural aspects of this country, a [[syncretism]] of Spanish, African and Caribbean cuisines, with a small but noteworthy [[Chinese food|Chinese]] influence. The most popular foods are [[Black turtle bean|black beans]], [[rice]], and [[meat]].

One example of traditional Cuban cuisine, or ''criollo'' as it is called, is ''[[Moros y Cristianos (food)|moros y cristianos]]'', "[[Moors]] and [[Christianity|Christians]]", rice with [[Black turtle bean|black beans]]. ''Criollo'' uses many different seasonings, with some of the most common being [[onion]] and [[garlic]]. [[Cassava]], rice, beans, eggs, [[tomato]]es, [[lettuce]], chicken, beef and [[pork]] are all common ingredients.

[[Coffee]] is of high quality and grown mainly for export.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Cuba}}

[[Image:Cuba xmas decorations.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas decorations on a religious house in [[Santiago de Cuba]].]]
Cuba's policy on religion has changed much since 1959, when religious Cubans were persecuted and could be denied jobs or an education by the government.

In the 1970s, the relationship between the government and religious institutions (especially the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) began to improve. By 1976, the state granted Cuban citizens religious freedom, with some restrictions. In 1992, the [[constitution]] was amended to allow total religious freedom. About 60% of Cubans today are [[Catholic]].&lt;ref name="Religion in Cuba"&gt;''[http://www.prolades.com/cra/regions/caribe/cub/cub-rd.htm]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Catholic traditions were lost, but the church has imported the Mexican [[Christmas play]] ([[pastorela]]) trying to reconnect Cubans to [[Christianity]]. Cuba is a primarily Christian country.

Another large religion in Cuba is [[Santería]]. Santería is a [[syncretism|blend]] of Catholicism and traditional [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba religions]]. When African [[Slavery|slaves]] first arrived in Cuba during the 16th century, they were taught a few simple [[prayers]] and were [[Baptism|baptised]] by the Spanish. The slaves combined this limited form of Catholicism with their traditional religions to create Santería, which survives to this day. During colonial times and into the early Republic, many Cubans suffered from intense ethnocentrism and confused Afro-Cuban religion with black magic and witchcraft. This caused them to associate practitioners of Santería and other Afro-Cuban cultures with criminals and the underworld, and to discriminate against practitioners without understanding the nature of their religion.  Because most practitioners of Santería in those years were of African heritage, racist attitudes emerged around the religion, and many whites in Cuba considered it to be subversive and threatening. Those who practiced Santería often resorted to secrecy as a way to avoid persecution. [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]], [[Lydia Cabrera]], and Rómulo Lachatañeré are considered the founders of Afro-Cuban studies in Cuba and were the first to give scholarly attention to Santería as an important religion in Cuba.&lt;ref name=Castellanos&gt;Castellanos, Jorge.  "Introduction", ''Afro-Cuban Myths, Rómulo Lachatañeré''. Princeton: Marcus Wiener Publishers, 2005: vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
As a former colony of Spain, Cuba uses the [[Spanish language]]. After the [[Cuban Revolution]], the term ''compañero/compañera'', meaning "comrade", came to gradually replace the traditional ''señor/señora'' as the universal polite title of address for strangers. A significant number of [[Afro-Cuban]]s as well as  biracial Cubans speak [[Haitian Creole]]. Haitian Creole is the second-most spoken language as well as a recognized one in Cuba, with approximately 300,000 speakers - about 4% of the population. (Haiti was a French colony - [[Saint-Domingue]] - from the early 17th century, and the final years of the 1791&amp;ndash;1804 [[Haitian Revolution]] brought a wave of French settlers fleeing with their Haitian slaves to Cuba.)

Many words from Cuban [[Amerindian language]]s have entered common usage in both Spanish and English, such as the [[Taíno language|Taíno]] words ''[[canoe|canoa]]'', ''[[tobacco]]'' and ''[[hurricane|huracán]]''. Some of the place names are Indian, such as [[Guanabacoa]] and [[Guanajay]].

[[English language|English]] is often used in big cities.

== Etiquette ==
When speaking to the elderly, or to strangers, Cubans speak more formally as a sign of respect. They shake hands upon greeting someone and farewelling them. Men often exchange friendly hugs (''abrazos'') and it is also common for both men and women to greet friends and family with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Informalities like addressing a stranger with 'mi corazón' (''my heart''), 'mi vida' (''my life''), or 'cariño' (''dear'') occur commonly.

== Cuban family life ==
The Revolution of 1959 sparked the turning point in Cuban family life by promoting women's equality. New laws and policies resulted in women being educated, employed, and increased their civil/human rights. Cuban revolutionary thought promoted class equality rather than gender equality, but women still benefited indirectly from social changes. Because Cubans, like many Latin Americans, tend to live together as a nuclear family, grandparents often provide childcare for women in the household who work outside the home, or attend school. The Maternity Law actually 'created' the working woman in [[Cuba]] [state when this law was passed, and what it says]. "Whereas in 1955, 13 percent of the workforce was women, by 1989, the number had risen to 38.7 percent of the workforce in Cuba.".&lt;ref&gt;Skaine, Rosemarie. The Cuban Family: Custom and Change in an Era of Hardship. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2004. Print. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[The Family Code of 1975]], especially Article 26 of the code, called for women and men to take equal responsibility for domestic labor and childcare.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Carrie. "Sexual Politics and Socialist Housing: Building Homes in Revolutionary Cuba." Gender &amp; History 21.3 (2009): 608-27.Web. 15 May 2012. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Marriages, divorce, children's rights, adoption, and marital property were addressed in this new law, as were the division of family responsibilities, equal rights for marriage partners, and the sharing of household tasks. However, there were still 'personal' obligations that women had to assume with marriage, such as 'maternal rights,' which were a norm in Cuban traditional society. Despite progressive measures imposed by law, some traditions remained intact, and new norms for the Cuban family took time to develop.

=== Marriage ===
Marriage rates in Cuba have traditionally been significantly stagnant. In the 1980s and the early 1990s marriage rates were relatively high, with 151 and 171 marriages per every 1000 inhabitants respectively. Women [university] educated tended to get married at an older age, and have fewer children; compared to "publicly schooled" educated women. Informal relations between a married man and an unmarried woman has been evaluated as such; "28% were women under 30 while the percentage of married women in that time was 23% (as of the late 1980's)." &lt;ref name="Skaine, Rosemarie 2004"&gt;Skaine, Rosemarie. The Cuban Family: Custom and Change in an Era of Hardship. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2004. Print. 62&lt;/ref&gt; "Women under the age of 20 were 21% opposed to the 7% of women married at that age (still in the same time period).".&lt;ref name="Skaine, Rosemarie 2004"/&gt; Yet, this is seen as a typical circumstance in Cuba at that time. Legal marriages vs. illegal marriages are 35% vs. 28%. On average in the 1980s most people got married around 19 to 20 years old, still, with a more developed educational system women are becoming more independent, studying, and working better jobs, that since "1994 most people are now getting married around the ages of 30-35.".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Skaine, Rosemarie. The Cuban Family: Custom and Change in an Era of Hardship. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2004. Print. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divorce ===
Divorce rates have been a growing fight in Cuba. When the revolution of 1959 occurred, divorce rates were starting to be observed for the first time. Comparing this information throughout different time periods in Cuban life, in "1960 it was 0.1%,  0.3% in the 1980's, 0.35% in 1990, 0.41% in 1991, 0.51% in 1992.".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This contributed to the fact Cubans moving away from the Catholic Church and therefore divorce was no longer a social stigma as it had been in the past. Also, when the economy started picking up and in 1998, the divorce rate returned to the rate in "1990 of 0.35%, and {{as of|2002|lc=y}} 0.354%.".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The divorce rate skyrocketed in 1991 and 1992 to a point of collapse, in an almost instantaneous result of the secession of the [[USSR]]. "The import/export dropped about 80%," &lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Carrie. "Sexual Politics and Socialist Housing: Building Homes in Revolutionary Cuba." Gender &amp; History 21.3 (2009): 608-27.Web. 15 May 2012. 620&lt;/ref&gt; petroleum that was received by Russia ceased, and this did not rebuild (economically) until 2000, when agricultural growth started to pick up. However, Cuba hit rock bottom in 1994, only two years after the succession of the USSR. This was during the [[Special Period]] in Cuba which created additional strain on marriages and split families apart for economic reasons.

=== Birth control/abortion ===
Cuba is somewhat [[pro-choice]] despite the historically strong [[Catholic]] influence on moral culture in the nation. When Cuba moved away from the Catholic Church, abortion was legalized and negative social and religious consequences for women faded. The Church has little to no impact on the way women think about abortion. The use of contraceptives, birth control, and abortions seem to keep family sizes somewhat small and "modern" in comparison to other [[Latin American]] countries.

=== One-parent families ===
"The state does not give any special aid to one parent families; however, it gives special needs to the children of single parent families. The Cuban government supports women being economically independent, though, dislikes the results of higher divorce rates, more underage impregnated teens, and female-headed households.".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Skaine, Rosemarie. The Cuban Family: Custom and Change in an Era of Hardship. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2004. Print. 64&lt;/ref&gt; With the Family Code of 1975, which aimed at strengthening the standard (two-parent nuclear family), was not the case. Remarriage and re-coupling was common, so divorce rates reflected a minority of Cuba's population as divorce. "As of 1992, couples under the ages of 20 were likely to get divorced," &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as were couples in urban areas. It is estimated that around "200,000 single parents are present in Cuba." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; As a matter of fact, observations in the Cuban community in "1992 shows that 15-20% of households with children are headed by women alone." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

=== Protection of minors and adoption ===
Pre-Revolutionary attempts for children shelters, protection houses, and places to keep children off the street were clearly expressed by Skaine:
As of the 1600s when the "House of the Abandoned" was founded, however was soon neglected, and in 1705 a new management took over the house and named it "Foundling House" though this too was unsuccessful. The "House of Charity" was founded before the revolution, nevertheless, also took its place in the shadows of success because protection of the children and the conditions in which they lived were not guaranteed. In 1959, the Ministry of Social Welfare was created and the houses were not part of the state. Now it was the state that had to provide for the minors. In 1960 the Government assigned the [[Federation of Cuban Women]] (FCW) to take charge of these houses, and set them up accordingly; ages 0–3 (homes with cradles), ages 3–6 (pre-scholastic farms), ages 6–12 (scholastic farms), ages 12–18 (youthful farms). This was then refined with The Family Code of 1975 (giving certain rights/obligations to parents), the Code of the Childhood and the Youth, approved in 1978, and the Decree Law 76 of January 1984 (which created a national network of centers that took care of minors without shelter). This new law centered on children up to the age of 5 with daycare, helped with homes for minors ages 6–17, and also helped children who were in school past the age of 17.&lt;ref&gt;Skaine, Rosemarie. The Cuban Family: Custom and Change in an Era of Hardship. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2004. Print. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
This gave rise for adoption. The Family Code of 1975 made adoption legal for the protection of minors who were without families. "There were a few stipulations with this, i.e. the adopters had to be 25 years or older, economically stable, morally sound, and be able to conduct their selves as sound parents." &lt;ref&gt;Skaine, Rosemarie. The Cuban Family: Custom and Change in an Era of Hardship. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2004. Print. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Complete adoption is most prominent in Cuba. Complete adoption consists of severing all ties with the adoptees biological parents and that in the adopted family and the child has all the same rights as an actual 'biological' child of that family. Legally adopted children are looked upon as biological children.

== Women ==
[[File:Three generations of women, Havana, Cuba Jan 2014 image by Marjorie Kaufman.jpg|thumb|Three generations of women]]The [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] government claims to have improved [[women's rights]] since the revolution, and today, most women work outside of the home. They are assisted by things such as [[childcare]] facilities, which are common in Cuba. In 1974, the Family Code was passed, giving men and women equal rights and responsibilities for housework, childrearing and education. However, despite government policy, and as with much of Latin America, ''[[machismo]]'' is common, and stereotypes of women continue to exist.

In the [[Special Period]] of Cuba, the time after the Soviet Union collapsed and was no longer able to support Cuba financially, leading the small communist nation to seek more tourism. As tourism increased, there followed an increase in [[prostitution in Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Facio, Elisa. Jineterismo during the  Special Period. ''Global Development Studies'', '''1''', 3-4 Winter 1998-Spring 1999. {{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/EthnicStudies/ethnicstudiesjournal/archive/Volume%20I%201/Jineterismo.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416074629/http://www.colorado.edu/EthnicStudies/ethnicstudiesjournal/archive/Volume%20I%201/Jineterismo.html |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women and dance ===
A dance style recently emerged, which involves fast and suggestive shaking of the women's lower torso section, simulating sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reggaeton-in-cuba.com/en/dance-perreo-movement.htm “Perreo: Body Language and Movement.”] ''Reggaeton in Cuba''&lt;/ref&gt; With this type of dance, the woman's body is seen as more "solo", with moves such as the {{lang|es|despelote}} (all-over-the-place) and {{lang|es|tembleque}} (shake-shudder) and the {{lang|es|subasta de la cintura}} (waist auction). This idea has offended other women, who see this kind of inappropriate, as degrading, forcing them to live up to expectations of pleasing their male partners.&lt;ref name="Fairley, Jan 2008"&gt;Fairley, Jan. 2008. "How to Make Love With Your Clothes On: Dancing Reggaeton, Gender and Sexuality in Cuba." ''Reading Reggaeton.'' (forthcoming, Duke University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairley says people in Cuba used to dance by facing their partners, and that nowadays it is often a "back to front" dance. She states that the way women dances with reggaeton can be compared with sex position and pornography, and claims that Cuba has "open and healthy attitudes toward sexuality".&lt;ref name="Fairley, Jan 2008"/&gt;

==Literature==
{{Main|Cuban literature}}
{{See also|List of Cuban writers}}

Cuban literature began to develop its own style in the early 19th century. The major works published in Cuba during that time dealt with issues of [[colonialism]], [[slavery]] and the mixing of races in a creole society. Notable writers of this genre include [[Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda]], and [[Cirilo Villaverde]], whose novel ''[[Cecilia Valdés]]'' was a landmark. Following the abolition of slavery in 1886, the focus of Cuban literature shifted to themes of independence and freedom as exemplified by [[José Martí]], who led the [[modernismo|modernista]] movement in Latin American literature. The poet [[Nicolás Guillén]]'s famous ''Motivos del son'' focused on the interplay between races. Others like [[Dulce María Loynaz]], [[José Lezama Lima]] and [[Alejo Carpentier]] dealt with more personal or universal issues. And a few more, such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]] and [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], earned international recognition{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} in the postrevolutionary era.

===Testimonial literature===
Cuba is the birthplace of the literary genre that is called testimonial literature. In 1970 Cuba's literary forum [[Casa de las Américas]] recognized testimonial literature as an official literary genre. [[Miguel Barnet]]'s literary texts were foundational in launching this new genre. Specifically Barnet's 1966 ''[[Biografía de un Cimarrón]]'' (Biography of a Runaway Slave), where he recorded the oral history of former slave [[Esteban Montejo]], is used to place testimonial literature on the literary platform of Casa de las Américas.&lt;ref&gt;Maldonado-Class, Joaquin. ''El intellectual y el sujeto testimonial en la literature latinoamericana''. Madrid: Editorial Pliegos, 2008. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Casa de las Américas is a government agency responsible for promoting cultural development, the revolutionary government supports this literary addition and finds it aligned with the spirit of the revolution. In this way, testimonial literature serves the revolutionary ideology in providing a voice for the people, specifically a group of people who were underrepresented and formerly oppressed prior to the Cuban Revolution. For the purpose it serves, this literary genre then gets accredited beyond Cuba and becomes a representative genre in other revolutionary countries, where empowering the majority of its people is important.

According to the author of testimonial texts, a testimony is significant because it uses a direct source: A person's account of current aspects in Latin American reality. Testimonial literature is then defined within the boundaries of autobiographical accounts, documentary narratives, eyewitness reports, and oral histories that are later transcribed into a literary format.&lt;ref&gt;Maldonado-Class, J. ''El intellectual'', 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Years after the 1950s and 1960s, a time of political and social unrest in Cuba, testimonial literature acknowledged personal accounts of historical figures such as that of [[Ernesto Che Guevara]] and other rebel leaders. Testimonial literature also acknowledged the diaries and letters of ordinary people, such as Olga Alonso, Daura Olema, Mercedes Santos, Mirta Muñiz, and Sandra Gonzalez, women that participated in the [[literacy campaign]] and other voluntary programs after the triumph of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kumaraswami, Parvathi. Pensamos que somos historia porque sabemos que somos historia: Context, Self and Self-construction in Women's Testimonial Writing from Revolutionary Cuba. ''Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'', 2006, 83.6. 524-537.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 [[Daisy Rubiera Castillo]]'s testimonial biography of her mother, [[Maria de los Reyes Castillo Bueno]], ''[[Reyita: The Life of a Black Cuban Woman in the Twentieth Century]]'', was a finalist in Casa de las Américas' literary competition. Described as the first Cuban testimonial narrative that used gender as an analytical tool, it constitutes the closest perspective with direct knowledge of the experience we have of Black Cuban women's lives since the period of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Luis, William. "La mujer negra en Cuba: Entrevista a Daisy Rubiera Castillo, autora de Reyita…" ''Caribe: Revista de Cultura y Literatura'' Summer, 3.1. 2000: 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of testimonial literature is [[Juan Francisco Manzano]]'s (1797–1853) ''[[Autobiography of a Slave]]'', which is the only known autobiography written by a slave in Cuba. Though self written many years prior to the identification of testimonial literature, Manzano's personal account of his life as a house slave is worthy of mention, as it fits perfectly into the criteria of this genre, providing a voice for the voiceless.&lt;ref&gt;Manzano, J. "Autobiography of a Slave." ''The Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics''. Ed. Chomsky, Carr, and Smorkaloff. Durham: Duke University Press, 2004. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7368">'''Dance is present in mythology and religion''' globally. Dance has certainly been an important part of [[ceremony]], [[ritual]]s, [[celebration (party)|celebration]]s and [[entertainment]] since before the birth of the earliest human [[civilization]]s. [[Archeology]] delivers traces of dance from [[prehistory|prehistoric times]] such as the 5,000-year-old [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] paintings in [[India]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC.

One of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and in the telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of "love making." Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="lecomte"&gt;Nathalie Comte. "Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World". Ed. Jonathan Dewald. Vol. 2. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. p94-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] [[altered state of consciousness|trance states]] in healing rituals. Dance is still used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian [[rainforest]] to the [[Kalahari Desert]].&lt;ref name='guenther'&gt;Guenther, Mathias Georg. 'The San Trance Dance: Ritual and Revitalization Among the Farm Bushmen of the Ghanzi District, Republic of Botswana.' Journal, South West Africa Scientific Society, v30, 1975-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early manuscript describing dance is the [[Natya Shastra]] on which is based the ''modern''  interpretation of [[classical Indian dance]] (e.g. [[Bharathanatyam]]).

== Greek mythology ==

In a classical Greek song, [[Apollo]], the god of medicine, music and poetry, one of the twelve greater gods and son of the chief god [[Zeus]], was called The Dancer. In a Greek line Zeus himself is represented as dancing.  [[Terpsichore]] is one of the nine Muses, representing dancing and dramatic chorus. In [[Sparta]], a province of ancient Greece, the law compelled parents to exercise their children in dancing from the age of five years.  They were led by grown men, and sang hymns and songs as they danced.  
In very early times a [[Greek chorus]], consisting of the whole population of the city, would meet in the market-place to offer up thanksgivings to the god of the country.  Their jubilees were always attended with hymn-singing and dancing.

==Dance in Scriptures==
The [[Torah]], the [[Psalms]], and many other scriptures reference dance:

[[Old Testament]]
*'''A Time to Dance:'''
**Ecclesiastes 3:4
*'''Social Dance in celebration of what God has done:'''
**Exodus 15:20;
**Judges 21:21 - 23
*'''In celebration before the Lord:'''
**2 Samuel 6:14-16;
**1 Chronicles 15:29
*'''Social dancing in celebration of a god:'''
**Exodus 32:19;
**1 Kings 18:26 (The act of celebrating a false god is condemned here)
*'''A child's dance:'''
**Judges 11:34;
**Job 21:11
*'''Celebration of warriors:'''
**1 Samuel 18:6-7;

*'''For the king: '''
**'''Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:22'''

===Hindu scriptures===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:classical Indian dance.jpg|right]] --&gt;
From a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, [[Nataraja]]. In the Hindu scriptures, every god has his or her own style ([[lasya]] and [[tandava]] respectively represent two aspects of dance) we read about 23 celestial beings called [[Apsaras]]es who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.

The dance in the Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses [[devadasi]]'s worshiped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. [[Natyashastra]] is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.

The temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the [[classical Indian dance]]rs are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.

===Buddhism===
See [[Seungmu]]

===Chinese mythology===
*[[Lion dance]]

===Christianity ===
In the [[Protoevangelium of James]], it is reported that [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]] danced before the [[Ark of the Covenant]] in the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] at the time of her [[Presentation of the Virgin|presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0847.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the history of Christianity, several denominations and independent congregations prohibited social dancing for various reasons;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/dihtml/diessay8.html Western Social Dance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; however, dance has always been a part of the social life of many Christians. Christian lyrics are found in the sounds of Ballroom, Country, Rock and Roll, Latin, Night Club, and other dance music. [[Ballet]] originated in Italy at weddings.

Numerous examples of traditional dance can be found in modern [[Roman Catholic]] communities. The Brazilian dance and martial art of [[capoeira]] (particularly [[capoeira angola]]) is regularly performed—including between ''capoeiristas'' of different sexes—to lyrics and ''ladinhas'' (litanies) praising God, the saints, and the Virgin. In a similar vein, several genres of dance music in [[Romani people]]/[[Romani people|Romani]] culture involve religious themes and lyrics. In the Philippines, the ''[[Subli]]''&amp;mdash;a devotional dance of the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]] in [[Batangas (province)|Batangas Province]]&amp;mdash;honours the [[True Cross]]. Finally, the celebrations of [[Carnival]] and [[Mardi Gras]] feature dance.

Many [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostal]] [[Protestant]] denomonations practice dance during worship services. Congregants frequently dance during services as an act of worship. Some Charismatics practice [[prophetic dance]], a religious practice in which practitioners believe they are representing what the Lord is doing through their movements. This is often accompanied with banners, ribbons and, instruments. [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)|Bethel Church]] in [[Redding, California]] has a school where people who wished to be trained in prophetic dance can go.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11705">[[File:EcoCAR final SATURN copy.jpg|thumb|400px|right|An international university competition which challenges teams to lead in the development of advanced automotive technologies]]
'''EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge''' is a three-year competition that builds on the 19-year history of [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]] [[Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions (AVTC)|advanced vehicle technology competitions]] by giving engineering students the chance to design and build advanced vehicles that demonstrate leading-edge automotive technologies, with the goal of minimizing the environmental impact of personal transportation and illustrating pathways to a sustainable transportation future. The DOE has again joined [[General Motors|General Motors (GM)]], the [[Government of Canada]] (Transport Canada, Natural Resources Canada), and other sponsors for this new competition series, named the EcoCAR Challenge. [[Argonne National Laboratory]], a DOE research and development facility, will organize and operate the EcoCAR Challenge. Some previous types of advanced vehicle technology competitions include FutureTruck, FutureCar, and [[Challenge X]]. These type of competitions are usually supported by one or more of the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)#United States and Canada|Big Three American Automobile Manufacturers]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocarchallenge|title=EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge|website=www.ecocar2.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background on EcoCAR ==
The DOE announced a Notice of Program Interest for North American colleges and universities with accredited engineering programs to compete for the opportunity to participate in EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge—a new international collegiate vehicle engineering competition—through a request-for-proposal (RFP) process in 2008.

EcoCAR seeks to advance the level of vehicle technology capable of reducing petroleum consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions while demonstrating the real-world performance of a range of technology options. Schools interested in receiving an RFP describing in detail the requirements for competing for one of the up to 17 available slots in EcoCAR were invited to express their interest.

== Technology Development ==
The technologies explored in EcoCAR are identical to those being investigated by the automotive industry to meet the demands of improved energy efficiency and dramatic reductions in [[Greenhouse gas]] (GHG)s, as well as to address [[Zero-emissions vehicle|California zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV)]] regulations. These technologies include full-function electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell hybrid vehicles. The only fuels approved for use in EcoCAR are [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|E10 ethanol]], [[E85|E85 ethanol]], [[Biodiesel|B20 biodiesel]], compressed gaseous hydrogen, and the energy carrier electricity.

Teams selected will design and integrate advanced-technology powertrains, lightweight materials, and aerodynamic improvements into a production vehicle. Using this approach, EcoCAR will explore pathways for future vehicles while giving the student participants the knowledge and experience they need to rapidly develop critical engineering skills and become the next generation of leaders in the automotive industry.

EcoCAR is based on a real-world integrated vehicle design and development process. Teams of engineers from the selected schools will develop their vehicles following a modified GM Global Vehicle Development Process (GVDP) for each phase of the three-year competition. By the end of the competition, the sponsors expect fully developed vehicles equivalent to prototypes ready for a production decision. While applying proven methods for engineering successful prototype vehicles, students will learn real-world engineering skills that will make them highly effective in the automotive industry. At the conclusion of each of EcoCAR’s three years, a week-long competition involving all of the participating schools will take place at a GM vehicle proving ground or other appropriate location in [[North America]].

== Participation ==
[[File:Seed Money.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Virginia Tech's Team Leader, Adam Robinson, accepting GM's Seed Money]]
Teams will receive $10,000 in seed money in Year One, a wide range of powertrain components, a vehicle donated by GM, and technical and mentoring support from the competition sponsors. EcoCAR teams will also have a GM mentor knowledgeable in technologies relevant to the team assigned to assist them during the competition. Substantial funds will also be provided to each university to support a full-time graduate student who will provide the team with leadership and continuity over the three-year program.

Schools will be required to match cash seed money donations from EcoCAR sponsors and to provide class credit for students participating in the competition, release time equal to at least one class per semester for a faculty advisor from the engineering school, and logistical and promotional support for their team. Teams may also be asked to match seed money each year to support a full-time, graduate-level engineering team leader. A signed letter of support will be required from the Dean of the Engineering Department with each proposal. If accepted into EcoCAR, each school will be required to sign an annual Good Faith Agreement reaffirming the school's full support of their team and explicitly stating its willingness to participate in all EcoCAR activities with at least one faculty advisor in attendance.

== Outreach ==
[[File:MiddleSchoolOutreach.jpg|thumb|255px|right|Virginia Tech team members Mark Meyer, left, and Graham Burkholder, right, show how their hybrid controller works to interested middle school students.]]
As part of the competition, EcoCAR teams are required to participate in different types of outreach events. These events include things such as press releases, community outreach, K-12 education, etc. Each team is asked to reach out to their communities and get them interested in EcoCAR.

== Year One results ==
In Year One (2009), teams use modeling and simulation to develop their vehicle architecture. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocar-challenge_media|title=EcoCAR Challenge_Media|website=www.ecocar2.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocarchallenge/Y1%20Program.pdf|title=Y1 Program.pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=Y1 Program.pdf|publisher=|page=5|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Editora Globo S.A.''' (Globo Editors) is a [[Brazil]]ian publishing house, property of [[Fundação Roberto Marinho]]. It began as a [[bookstore]] called '''Livraria do Globo''', created in [[Porto Alegre]], in December 1883, by [[Laudelino Pinheiro de Barcellos]] and [[Saturnino Alves Pinto]].

==History==
The [[bookstore]] "Livraria do Globo" begun as in a little store located at "Rua da Praia" Number 268. The bookstore was open daily from 6:30&amp;nbsp;am to 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm, including Saturdays. With a little business success, the bookstore started working as a copy and paperwork center, making bookbidings and other small services and the building where it was located underwent a slight remodeling.

Its first [[branch store]] was created in [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul|Santa Maria]], near the old ferryway center of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The "Livraria do Globo's" owners decided to create an own magazine, called "[[Revista do Globo]]".

In the 1940s, the bookstore company reached its top success, with three [[branch stores]] in '''Brazil's South Region''' and offices in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo]]. In 1986, the bookstore was sold to [[Rio Gráfica Editora]], property of [[Fundação Roberto Marinho]], that decided to rename its publishing house to Editora Globo, which continues as the current name.

==Main titles==
These are the main titles published by '''Editora Globo''' (books are not included because there are innumerous titles published on many  different subjects):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15504">[[File:Aspects of music illustration.png|thumb|This notation indicates differing pitch, dynamics, articulation, instrumentation, timbre, and rhythm (duration and onset/order).]]

[[Music]] can be [[music analysis|analysed]] by considering a variety of its '''elements''', or [[property (philosophy)|parts]] (aspects, characteristics, features), individually or together. A commonly used list of the main elements includes pitch, timbre, texture, volume, duration and form. The elements of music may be compared to the [[elements of art]] or [[design elements and principles|design]].

==Selection of elements==

According to [[Howard Gardner|Howard]] {{harvtxt|Gardner|1983|loc=104}}, there is little dispute about the principal constituent elements of music, though experts differ on their precise definitions. Harold Owen bases his list on the qualities of sound: pitch, timbre, intensity, and duration {{harv|Owen|2000|loc=6}}. Most definitions of music include a reference to sound ({{harvnb| Google.com.au |2015}}; {{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003}}) and sound perception can be divided into six cognitive processes. They are: [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[duration (music)|duration]], [[loudness]], [[timbre]], [[texture (music)|sonic texture]] and  [[Sound localization|spatial location]] ({{harvnb|Burton|2015|loc=22–28}}).

A '''parameter''' is any element that can be manipulated ([[musical composition|composed]]) separately from other elements or focused on separately in an educational context.{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=bolded term}} [[Leonard B. Meyer]] compares distinguishing parameters within a culture by their different constraints to distinguishing independent parameters within music, such as melody, harmony, timbre, "etc." {{harv|Meyer|1989|loc=21n44}}. The first person to apply the term ''[[parameter]]'' to music may have been [[Joseph Schillinger]], though its relative popularity may be due to [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]] {{harv|Grant|2005|loc=62n85}}. ''Gradation'' is gradual change within one parameter, or an overlapping of two blocks of sound.

Meyer gives melody, rhythm, timbre, harmony, "and the like" {{harv|Meyer|1973|loc=9}}, while Narmour lists, melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, tessitura, timbre, tempo, meter, texture, "and perhaps others" {{harv|Narmour|1988|loc=326}}. According to McClellan, two things should be considered, the quality or state of an element and its change over time {{harv|McClellan|2000|loc=142}}. [[Alan P. Merriam|Alan P.]] {{harvtxt|Merriam|1964|loc=32–33}} proposed a theoretical research model that assumes three aspects are always present in musical activity: concept, behaviour, and sound. [[Virgil Thomson|Virgil]] {{harvtxt|Thomson|1957|loc=vii}} lists the "raw materials" of music in order of their supposed discovery: rhythm, melody, and harmony; including [[counterpoint]] and [[orchestration]]. Near the end of the twentieth century music scholarship began to give more attention to social and physical elements of music&lt;!-- (see Keller and Rieger 2009)--&gt; {{harv|Moran|2013|loc=59}}. For example: [[concert|performance]], [[sociomusicology|social]], [[women in music|gender]], [[dance]], and [[musical theater|theater]].

==Definition of music==
[[File:Circular definition of musicality.png|thumb|[[Circular definition]] of "musicality"]]
{{Main|Definition of music}}
Does the definition of music determine its aspects, or does the combination of certain aspects determine the definition of music? For example, [[intensional definition]]s list aspects or elements that make up their subject.

Some definitions refer to music as a score, or a composition ({{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb| Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb| Oxforddictionaries.com}}): music can be read as well as heard, and a piece of music written but never played is a piece of music notwithstanding. The process of [[sight-reading|reading music]], at least for trained musicians, involves a process, called "inner hearing" or "audiation" by Gordon, where the music is heard in the mind as if it were being played {{harv|Gordon |1999}}. This suggests that while sound is often considered a required aspect of music, it may not be.

[[Jean Molino|Jean]] {{harvtxt|Molino|1975|loc=43}} points out that "any element belonging to the total musical fact can be isolated, or taken as a strategic variable of musical production." Nattiez gives as examples [[Mauricio Kagel]]'s ''Con Voce'' [with voice], where a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. In this example sound, a common element, is excluded, while gesture, a less common element, is given primacy. However Nattiez goes on to say that despite special cases where sound is not immediately obvious (because it is heard in the mind): "sound is a minimal condition of the musical fact" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=43}}.

==Universal aspect==
{{anchor|Invariances}}{{anchor|Invariance}}
There is disagreement about whether some aspects of music are [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], as well as whether the concept of music is universal. This debate often hinges on definitions. For instance, the fairly common assertion that "tonality" is a universal of all music may necessarily require an expansive definition of tonality. A [[pulse (music)|pulse]] is sometimes taken as a universal, yet there exist solo vocal and instrumental genres with free and improvisational rhythms no regular pulse {{harv|Johnson|2002|loc=62}}, one example being the [[alap]] section of an [[Indian classical music]] performance. Harwood questions whether a "cross-cultural musical universal" may be found in the music or in the making of music, including performance, hearing, conception, and education {{harv|Harwood|1976|loc=522}}.

One aspect that is important to bear in mind when examining multi-cultural associations, is that an English-language word (i.e. the word "music"), not a universal concept, is the object of scrutiny. For this reason it is important to approach apparently equivalent words in other languages with caution. Based on the many disparate definitions that can be found just in English language dictionaries ({{harvnb| Google.com.au |2015}}; {{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Music|1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003}}), it seems there is no agreement on what the word "Music" means in English,{{original research inline|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--Drawing a conclusion from comparing several dictionaries is Original Research.--&gt; let alone determining a potentially equivalent word from another culture.

Kenneth Gourlay describes how, since different cultures include different elements in their definitions of music, dance, and related concepts, translation of the words for these activities may split or combine them, citing Nigerian musicologist Chinyere Nwachukwu's definition of the Igbo term "nkwa" {{harv|Nwachukwu|1981|loc=59}} as an activity combining and/or requiring singing, playing musical instruments, and dancing {{harv|Gourlay|1984|loc=35}}. He then concludes that there exists "nonuniversality of music and the universality of nonmusic."

==Other terms==
Other terms used to discuss particular pieces include:
* [[Musical note|Note]]—an abstraction that refers to either a specific pitch or rhythm, or the written symbol
*[[chord (music)|Chord]]—a [[simultaneity]] of notes heard as some sort of unit
*[[Chord progression]]—a succession of chords ([[simultaneity succession]])

The '''National Emblem of the [[Laos|Lao People's Democratic Republic]]''' shows the national shrine [[Pha That Luang]]. A dam is pictured which as a symbol of power generation at the [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] Nam Ngum, an [[asphalt]] street is also pictured, as well as a stylized watered field. 

In the lower part is a section of a [[gear wheel]].  The inscription on the left reads "Peace, Independence, Democracy" ([[Lao Language|lao]] script: ສັນຕິພາບ ເອກະລາດ ປະຊາທິປະໄຕ) and on the right, "Unity and Prosperity" ([[Lao Language|lao]] script: ເອກະພາບ ວັດຖະນາຖາວອນ.)

== History ==
The coat of arms was modified in August 1991 in [[Revolutions of 1989|relation to the]] [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]]. The Communist [[red star]] and [[hammer and sickle]] were replaced with the national shrine at [[Pha That Luang]].  The coat of arms is specified in the Laotian constitution:

{{quote|The National Emblem of the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] is a circle depicting in the bottom part one-half of a cog wheel and red ribbon with inscriptions [of the words] "Lao People's Democratic Republic", and [flanked by] crescent-shaped stalks of fully ripened [[rice]] at both sides and red ribbons bearing the inscription "Peace, Independence, Democracy, Unity, Prosperity".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">A '''farewell speech''' or '''farewell address''' is a speech given by an individual leaving a position or place. They are often used by public figures such as politicians as a to the preceding career, or as statements delivered by persons relating to reasons for their leaving. The term is often used as a euphemism for "retirement speech", though it is broader in that it may include geographical or even biological conclusion. In the [[Classics]], a term for a dignified and poetic farewell speech is ''apobaterion'' (ἀποβατήριον), standing opposed to the ''epibaterion'', the corresponding speech made upon arrival.

Many U.S. presidential speeches have been given the moniker "farewell address" since George Washington's address in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4624166/presidential-farewell-addresses/|title=Barack Obama's Farewell Address and 6 Other Memorable Presidential Goodbyes|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable examples:

'''''Friar Rush''''' (''{{lang|nds|Broder Rusche}}'', ''{{lang|de|Bruder Rausch}}'', ''{{lang|gmq|Broder Ruus}}'') is the title of a medieval [[Low German]] legend, surviving in a 1488 edition in verse form. During the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous [[High German languages|High German]], Scandinavian (Danish and Swedish), Dutch and English translations and adaptations in ''Volksbuch'' or [[chap book]] form were printed. The first High German edition dates to 1515, printed in [[Strasbourg|Strassburg]].
The story along with those of [[Till Eulenspiegel]], [[Faust]] and [[Solomon and Marcolf|Marcolf]] was among the most successful popular literature in [[16th-century Germany]].
The various adaptations vary in their style and focus, some intending to set a moral example or criticize excesses in monastic life, others simply intending to amuse the reader.

A connection between Friar Rush and [[Hödekin]], a [[kobold]] figure of German folklore, was suggested by the Shakespeare scholar [[George Lyman Kittredge]],&lt;ref&gt;Kittredge (1900), noted in Frank Wadleigh Chandler, ''The Literature of Roguery'' (1907, vol. I:56ff).&lt;/ref&gt; who noted the connection has been made in [[Reginald Scott]]'s ''Discoverie of Witchcraft'', 1584. Kittredge (1900) criticizes the then-common identification of Friar Rush with [[Robin Goodfellow]] as simplistic.

==Narrative==
In the narrative, the [[devil]] enters a monastery posing as a man called ''Bruder Rausch'' (''Broder Ruus'' and variants, in the English version ''Frier Rush''; the [[Early Modern German]] ''{{lang|nds|Rusche}}'', ''{{lang|de| Rausch}}'' is the term for a loud swooshing noise&lt;ref&gt;note that English ''[[:wikt:rush|rush]]'' is of Latinate origin, but was assimilated in usage to  [[Middle High German|MHG]] ''[[:wikt:rauschen|rûschen]]'' (whence also [[Modern German]] ''{{lang|de|[[:wikt:Geräusch|Geräusch]]}}'' "noise"; [[Old English]] ''hrýscan'') held to be "quite unconnected in origin" by the [[OED]].&lt;/ref&gt;). Acting as a [[trickster|prankster]], Friar Rush causes various episodes of commotion among the monks. Working in the kitchen, Friar Rush takes to organizing women for the abbot and the other monks every night. On one occasion, he is about to be chastised by the cook for being delayed. Rush throws the cook into a boiling cauldron and takes his place, working to the satisfaction of the monks for seven years, but constantly causing strife among them. Rush's demonic identity is finally discovered by the abbot, who expels him from the monastery by means of the sacred mass. In the High German version, Rush then travels to England and possesses the king's daughter. He is again exorcized after the abbot is called in from Saxony for the purpose, who banishes the demon inside a hill near the monastery.

==Friar Rush in other works==
Friar Rush appears in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] playwright [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''If This Be Not a Good Play the Devill is in It.''

Nineteenth-century German writer [[Wilhelm Hertz]] published a novel ''Bruder Rausch'' in 1882 based on the story.

The [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]] Psychology subject test is a standardized test used in admission decisions by some graduate programs in psychology in several English-speaking countries, especially in the United States.

==Structure==
There are three major components to this test: (1) Experimental, (2) Social, and (3) Other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.1488512ecfd5b8849a77b13bc3921509/?vgnextoid=e1a52d3631df4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=6ef946f1674f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD |title=Educational Testing Service webpage for GRE Psychology subject test |publisher=Ets.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The score ranges from 200 to 880, although 90% of test-takers score between 440 and 760, with 50th percentile around 615.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/GRE/pdf/gre_0910_psychology_practice_book.pdf Graduate Record Examination Psychology Test Practice Book (2009).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806182630/http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/GRE/pdf/gre_0910_psychology_practice_book.pdf |date=August 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average score on Psychology subject test is 577 at Master's level and 633 at Doctoral level.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727040004/http://www.psichi.org/images/site_pages/10_2_norcross_table3.jpg An article by Norcross et al. (2006) on Psi Chi website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Test Item Development'''

The questions used for the GRE Psychology Test are written by a committee of six faculty members (many who did not know how the test was designed until they were asked to join the committee) from various colleges and universities throughout the United States. Each member writes 15-20 test items each year, as well as, many other faculty members write and submit additional items. These items are then discussed by the committee over a three-day session. During this time, the members accept, reword, or reject the submitted items from the various faculty members. After the draft of questions are assembled, the test is then given to a GRE Sensitivity Committee to screen for items that may not “represent ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, and other groups in a favorable light and that the items are not likely to offend anyone” (Kalat &amp; Matlin, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;25). Items are not put on the test as “experimental items” that will not be scored. However, point-biserial correlations and percentage of students who answered each item correctly are examined after each administration of the test.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Kalat, J. W., &amp; Matlin, M. W. (2000). The GRE Psychology Test: A useful but poorly understood test. ''Teaching of Psychology''. ''27''(1) 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Admissions==
Some graduate programs do not require submission of Psychology subject test scores, whereas in other programs it is recommended or mandatory. Among those universities that do require Psychology subject test, the minimal requirements may also vary. For example, applicants for the Ph.D. program in Clinical Psychology at [[Hofstra University]] are required to have a Psychology subject score not lower than 65th percentile (about 660 points)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Colleges/HCLAS/PSY/phdcp/phdcp_admreq.html |title=Admission requirements for a Ph.D. program in Clinical Psychology at Hofstra University |publisher=Hofstra.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609191107/http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Colleges/HCLAS/PSY/phdcp/phdcp_admreq.html |archive-date=2008-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictiveness of the GRE Psychology Test==
Based on data collected from 1986 to 1990, correlations were conducted between first-year graduate school GPAs and undergraduate GPA, as well as, various different GRE tests and subtests. The GRE Psychology Test shows to correlate better with first-year graduate school GPAs than does the GRE General Test (''r'' = .33); the GRE Psychology Test correlates equivocally with undergraduate GPA correlations (both equal ''r'' = .37). However, it is also stated that a GRE subject test correlates with degree attainment only ''r'' = .21. While it has strong correlations when comparing to some facets of graduate school, overall it does not predict who will graduate and who will not.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;

'''Hayati Fashion Week''' (HFW) is an annual series of events when [[modest fashion]] collections from Nigeria and other African countries are shown to the press and general public. HFW was founded by [[Fatima Togbe]] in 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/dont-just-mind-the-gap-fill-it-fatima-togbe-a-woman-taking-initiative-with-hayati-magazine/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV429uiKDHo&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fatimatogbe.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;.

The inaugural event took place in 2017 and was sponsored by the [http://medicaidcancerfoundation.org/ Medicaid Cancer Foundation] (MCF)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ccr4XhjTTg&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stylebymolekor.com/?p=7967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://barakahsthoughts.com.ng/2017/07/23/hfw17-hayati-fashion-week-2017/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://thatbavagal.wordpress.com/2017/08/20/hayati-fashion-week-takes-abuja-by-storm/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://leemlarh.com/2017/07/24/hayati-fashion-week-2017/&lt;/ref&gt;. Other sponsors include [http://dunescenter.com/ Dunes Center], [[Pandora (jewelry)|Pandora]], [[Nestle]] brand [[Maggi]], [[Vlisco]] and [http://arithandpaul.com/ Arith &amp; Paul].

Hayati Fashion Week was created as a response to the lack of representation of [[modest fashion]] on major [[Nigerian fashion]] platforms. It has provided designers, models, artists and other businesses who cater to the Nigerian [[Modest|modest industry]], a platform to showcase their creativity, passion, and work, directly to their desired audience&lt;ref&gt;https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/salihat-rahaman-the-making-of-abaya-diva/&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''hive | Propolis''''' is a science fiction and dystopian novel by [[Daniel D.W.]] and the first volume of [[The Hive Transmedia Project]].  The book was published by [[Mythos Media]] and [[HiveTech Media]] on May 10, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hivetech.media |title=hive Volume I, Propolis by Daniel Dw |year=2015 |publisher=''Mythos Media &amp; HiveTech Media'' |accessdate=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains decipherable easter eggs as well as scannable QR codes for music, animation, videos and a [[transmedia]] storyline.

==Plot summary==
In the year 2023, Millions connect to Hive (human interface for virtual evolution), an augmented-reality technology that consolidates an individual's devices and technology into a holographic visual display that is projected from their mind. The system creates a collective consciousness with its users and their communication is transferred through a virtual telepathy. Meanwhile, The Disconnected are left in its wake; forced to adapt to a primitive lifestyle in the outskirts of Hive cities. Conflict is inevitable, however the reality behind Hive may be even stranger than anyone realized.  
 
Propolis follows nine-year-old [[Samantha Plessis]], as she witnesses her family opt into beta testing this new product to receive health insurance benefits to treat her immune disorder. Since her disease prevents her from connecting to Hive, she becomes gradually alienated by her family, whose method of communication is now changing. Her mother, father and sister attitudes and moods change from her perspective; becoming less patient with her, and doing things out of the ordinary. Their consequential negligence and alienation lead to choices that threaten her safety, and for two years she compares her family to empty cicada chassis'. During an update for the beta-testers to the full version on [[Hive Day]] in 2025, Samantha watches her family and a number of people in her town collapse at once to their death. She then is adopted by her grandfather and moves to his farm, where he informs her of his predictions of an upcoming war.

Meanwhile, HiveTech CEO Miles Parker, struggles for control of his company with his father, Dr. Lewis Dean Parker. Dr. Parker lives omnipresently on the Hive servers, as a digital copy of his human consciousness after he was cryogenically frozen pre-mortem in 2015. After Miles becomes distraught over the millions dying from the update, Dr. Parker uploads a sedative called "propolis" into his system. Miles then becomes complacent and Dr. Parker reveals that Hive in the future will become "the agency of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25506008-hive |title=hive Propolis on Goodreads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
* [[Samantha/Camellia Plessis]] is a nine-year-old girl from southern New Jersey. Samantha suffers from [[Bruton's disease]] which prevents her from connecting to Hive. She has a fondness for nature and discovery, and portrays a budding intelligence greater than most people her age. But, her mood becomes darker and depressed as her family's method of communication becomes more thought-based through Hive. She has a growing distrust of Jared Plessis after finding out that he is an adoptive father, and watching him become more callous after connecting to Hive. 
* Jared Plessis is the husband of Joan and father to Samantha and Melody. He reacts quickly based on his emotion and inferiority complex which manifests as hidden jealousy and pride, while having a deep need to be seen as a strong role model and head of his family. While using Hive, he becomes obsessed. He feels that it is sucking in his conscious into another world - and desires it to do so - because of his resentment toward his dull life. 
* Joan Plessis is a caring mother, which she feels extends to her husband, who strikes her as an overgrown child. While she uses Hive along with Melody and Jared, she begins to neglect a normal amount of verbal and physical communication with Samantha. She over uses her beta-version of Hive and her allotted data transfer runs out, making her [[catatonic]]. Jared turns her Hive connection off temporarily and she suffers from intense withdrawal. 
* Miles Parker is the CEO and spokesperson for HiveTech, the company that created the Hive product. He is motivated to carry on his late father's work. 
* Dr. Lewis Dean Parker is Miles' father and inventor. He exists only as a digital copy of his human consciousness on the HiveTech servers, but in fact still controls most of the development of the product.
* Melody Plessis is Samantha's sister who struggles with acceptance with her peers. 
* Alexa Thierry is Joan's best friend and Samantha's pediatrician. 
* Lucien Thierry is Alexa's husband, who is a painter and philosopher. His paintings give inspiration and perspective to Samantha. 
* Emerson Thierry is the nine-year-old son to Alexa and Lucien. Emerson is an active kid who is confrontational. He is connected to the full-version of Hive because his older brother, Michael, is an application developer at HiveTech.

The '' Information Center for Israeli Art '' is the largest collection of primary resources documenting the history of the Israeli art in [[Israel]]. Over 12,000 artists files are housed in the Center in the [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]].

==History==
As a research center within the Israel Museum, the Information Center for Israeli Art houses materials related to a broad variety of Israeli visual art and artists. All regions of the country and numerous eras and art movements are represented. In addition to the papers of artists, the Center collects documentary material from art galleries, art dealers, and art collectors. It also houses a collection of over 700 Israeli art-related videos and publishes a selection of over 5,800 Israeli artist biographies online.

The Information Center reopened in June 2011, after extensive museum renovations. The Center offers its visitors a wealth of material collected since 1975, now easily accessible through the computerized information system. Center visitors from all around the world can enjoy services providing them with digital information by email.

The Information Center for Israeli Art documents and catalogs information about Israeli artists and their work from the very beginning of Israeli art till today. The center encompasses over 12,800 artists – painters, sculptors, photographers, graphic designers, industrial designers, ceramicists, silversmiths and more. The material in the Center is collected into artist files, for prominent and well-known artists as well as those who have not been widely exhibited. The database and artist files include biographical information, newspaper clippings and articles regarding art shows in Israel and abroad, invitations to exhibitions, films, slides, catalogs and photographs or artwork.

The Information Center for Israeli Art contains important and unique collections from many galleries and artists. One example of this is the [[Debel Gallery]] Archives. The Debel Gallery was established in 1973 in Jerusalem. Since January 2007 the Debel Gallery Archive is housed within the '''Information Center for Israeli Art''' at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. It includes background material, exhibition histories, photos of invitations from 1973 to 1990, recordings of interviews with artists, correspondence with artists, and much more.
An additional collection of rich visual material documenting Israeli art is the [[Israel Zafrir]] Photographer Archive, containing over 10,000 photographs of Israeli artwork and artists. The [[Gabriel Talphir]] Archive consists of letters and photographs sent by artists to the well known art critic and author.  The [[Nahum Zolotov]] Archive, also found in the Center, contains sketches and notations from the renowned Israeli architect. The Frank E. van Raalte Film Archive contains over 100 films interviewing Israeli artists. The Bat Sheva and [[:he:יצחק כץ (מנהל)|Yitzhak Katz]] Archive contains personal writings and letters of artists including [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Israel Paldi]] and [[Arieh Lubin]]. The Artifact Gallery&lt;ref&gt;The Artifact Gallery was active in Tel Aviv in the 1980's. Aya Miron, Curator, Department of Israel Art at the Israel Museum, correspondence, 20.8.2013&lt;/ref&gt; Archive contains exhibitions and artists files including [[Nahum Tevet]], [[Philip Rantzer]] and [[Diti Almog]]. In addition, the [[Max (Mordechai) Farbmann]] and the [[Jakob Eisenscher]] Archives include photographs, letters and newspaper articles about these Israeli artists.

As of January 2010, new information received by the Information Center for Israeli Art is filed digitally.  In 2011, the Center database had been enriched with over 25,000 newspaper articles, and the number of exhibitions documented in the Center surpassed 15,000. The Center website offers bilingual information on 5800 selected Israeli artists and includes a short biography, thousands of Israeli works of art from the Israel Museum collection and other art collections from around the world as well as a comprehensive list of exhibitions for each artist.

'''''Insidious''''' is a series of American [[horror film]]s created by [[Leigh Whannell]]. There are four films in the franchise – ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' (2010), ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]'' (2013), ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3]]'' (2015) and ''[[Insidious: The Last Key]]'' (2018) – which have grossed a total of $539 million worldwide on a combined budget of $26.5 million.

The first two films were directed by [[James Wan]], while the third film was directed by [[Leigh Whannell]], who also served as the screenwriter for all four films. [[Adam Robitel]] directed the fourth installment. [[FilmDistrict]] released the first and second films, while [[Focus Features]] and [[Universal Pictures]] handled the third and fourth, respectively.

The first two films center on a couple who, after their son mysteriously enters a [[coma]]tose state and becomes a vessel for [[ghost]]s in an [[astral plane]], are continuously haunted by demons of a hellish realm known as ''the Further'' until they take from the family what they want most: life. The third film, a prequel, focuses on the same psychic who helped the family; this time she comes to the aid of a young girl who calls out to the dead, and the fourth follows her when her own family becomes haunted. All plots are depicted as case files of [[demonologist]]s.

{{main article|Insidious: Chapter 2}}

'''''Insidious: Chapter 2''''' was also directed by [[James Wan]].

The film was released on September 13, 2013. It was a box-office success, grossing over $160 million worldwide, but received mixed reviews.

{{main article|Insidious: Chapter 3}}

'''''Insidious: Chapter 3''''' is the third film in the series, written and directed by [[Leigh Whannell]].

===''Insidious: The Last Key'' (2018)===
{{main article|Insidious: The Last Key}}
Prior to the release of ''Insidious: Chapter 3'', Leigh Whannell was asked, "If there is a ''Insidious: Chapter 4'', would that be a sequel to ''Chapter 3'', another prequel to the original or will it continue in this timeline or go to a whole new timeline?" Whannell replied, "I don't know. I haven't really thought about it yet. But for the purposes of this interview, I'll say that I'd like to explore the time between this film and the first film. That whole area there where Elise has rediscovered her gift, I think you could have a lot of adventures before she arrives. So I think there is a lot of room there. We've kind of established Lin [Shaye] in this particular film as kind of this superhero, so that would be kind of interesting to explore in the other films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/leigh-whannell-discusses-ideas-insidious-4/|title=Insidious: Chapter 4 Will Take Place Closer To First Film|date=21 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on May 16, 2016, that ''Chapter 4'' will have an October 20, 2017, release date with Whannell writing, Jason Blum, Oren Peli and James Wan producing, Adam Robitel directing, and Lin Shaye returning to reprise her role as Elise Rainier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/687015-insidious-4-is-coming-to-theaters-october-2017|title=Insidious 4 is Coming to Theaters October 2017|publisher=ComingSoon.net|last=|first=|date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3391342/insidious-4-announces-writer-director-release-date/|title=‘Insidious 4’ Announces Writer, Director, and Release Date|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|date=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2016, the film was given a new release date for 2018, and pushed it back to January 5, 2018.

The '''Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children''' (KABC) is a clinical instrument (psychological [[diagnostic test]]) for assessing cognitive development. Its construction incorporates several recent developments in both psychological theory and statistical methodology. The test was developed by [[Alan S. Kaufman]] and [[Nadeen L. Kaufman]] in 1983 and revised in 2004. The test has been translated and adopted for many countries, such as the Japanese version of the K-ABC by the Japanese psychologists Tatsuya Matsubara, Kazuhiro Fujita, Hisao Maekawa, and [[Toshinori Ishikuma]].

The KABC also gives special attention to certain emerging testing needs, such as use with [[handicapped]] groups, application to problems of [[learning disabilities]], and appropriateness for [[cultural]] and [[natural language|linguistic]] [[minorities]]. The authors rightly caution, however, that success in meeting these special needs must be judged through practical use over time. They also point out that the KABC should not be regarded as "the complete test battery"; like any other test, it should be supplemented and corroborated by other instruments to meet individual needs, such as the [[Stanford-Binet]], [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]], [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]], [[McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA)|McCarthy scales]], or [[neuropsychological test]]s.

==History==

The original KABC was developed from [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological theory]], merging left brain-right brain research on cerebral specialisation (e.g., Sperry, 1968) with Luria’s sequential simultaneous processing dichotomy (Luria, 1966) and work in cognitive psychology. The KABC  focuses on the processes needed to solve problems rather than their content i.e. verbal vs. non verbal. The KABC was one of the first intelligence tests to be principally derived from strong theoretical basis and the first intelligence test to be based in neuropsychological theory (Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 1997). An important feature of the KABC is that it yielded smaller than average score differences than was typical between African American and European American ethnic groups, making it particularly useful when assessing children of difference ethnicities.

The second edition (KABC-II) which was published in 2004, is an individually administered measure of the processing and cognitive abilities of children and adolescents aged 3–18. As with the original KABC, the KABC-II is a theory-based instrument. However the KABC-II differs in its conceptual framework and test structure. While the KABC is grounded in simultaneous/sequential processing approach the KABC-II incorporates two distinct theoretical models. The KABC-II is grounded in a dual theoretical foundation: the [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory|Cattell-Horn-Carroll]] (CHC) psychometric model of broad and narrow abilities and [[Alexander Luria|Luria]]’s neuropsychological theory of processing.

There are a number of important revisions in the KABC-II:

* The age range has been widened, additional scales developed and the theoretical foundation expanded.
* Eight of the original 16 subtests can be found in the KABC-II and 10 new subtests have been introduced.
* Four subtests have been removed from the measurement of Simultaneous processing: Magic Window, Spatial Memory, Photo Series and Matrix Analogies.
* Three have been retained: Triangles, Face Recognition and Gestalt Closure and three new ones have been added: Conceptual Thinking, Block Counting and Rover.
* The Learning Ability scale is new as is the Planning Scale. The Knowledge scale is made up of two original subtests (Expressive Vocabulary and Riddles) and a new addition Verbal Knowledge.

With the KABC-II, the examiner can choose which theoretical model to follow. Typically the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model is useful for children from a mainstream cultural and language background. Or if Crystallized Ability would not be a fair indicator of the child’s cognitive ability, examiners may choose the Luria model which excludes verbal ability.

==Test format==
The KABC-II has 18 subtests of two types: core and supplementary. Before testing the examiner decides which model to follow: Luria or CHC.  The subtests are grouped into 4 or 5 scales depended on the age and interpretive model chosen. Luria’s model consists of four scales: Sequential Processing Scale, Simultaneous processing Scale, Learning Ability and Planning Ability. CHC model renames these: Short Term Memory (Gsm), Visual Processing (Gv), Long Term Storage and Retrieval (Glr) and Fluid Reasoning (Gf) plus an additional 5th scale Crystallised Ability (Gc).

KABC-II scales and their subtests include:

'''Simultaneous/Gv'''

* Triangles: the child assembles several foam triangles to match a picture.
* Face Recognition: the child looks a photographs of one or two faces for 5 seconds and then selects the correct face/faces shown in a difference pose from a selection.
* Block Counting: The child counts the number of blocks in a picture of a stack of blocks, some of the blocks are partially hidden.
* Conceptual Thinking: The child selects one picture from a set of 4 or 5 which does not belong with the set.
* Rover: The child moves a toy dog to a bone on a grid that contains several obstacles trying to find the quickest path to the bone.
* Gestalt Closure: The child mentally fills in the gaps in a partially completed inkblot drawing and names or describes the object/action depicted in the drawing.
* Pattern Reasoning (ages 5 and 6).
* Story Completion (ages 5 and 6).

'''Sequential/Gsm'''

* Word Order: The assessor reads the names of common objects, the child the touches a series of silhouettes of these objects in the same order they were read out in.
* Number Recall: The assessor reads a string of numbers and the child repeats the string in the same order. The strings range from 2 to 9 digits.
* Hand Movements: the child copies a series of taps the examiner makes on the table with the fist, palm or side of the hand.

'''Planning/Gf'''

* Pattern Reasoning (ages 7–18): the child is shown a series of stimulus that form a logical linear pattern with one stimulus missing. The child selects the missing stimulus from several options.
* Story Completion (ages 7–18): the child is shown a row of pictures that tell a story, some pictures are missing. The child selects several pictures from a selection that are needed to complete the story and places them in the correct location.

'''Learning/Glr'''

* Atlantis: the assessor teaches the child nonsense names for pictures of fish, shells and plants. The child then has to point to the correct picture when read out the nonsense name.
* Atlantis Delayed: the child repeats the Atlantis subtest 15–25 minutes later to demonstrate delayed recall.
* Rebus: the assessor teaches the child the word or concept associated with a rebus (drawing) and the child reads aloud phrases and sentences composed of these rebuses.
* Rebus Delayed: the child repeats the Rebus subtest 15–25 minutes later to demonstrate delayed recall of paired associates.

'''Knowledge(Gc) included in the CHC model only

* Riddles: the examiner says several characteristics of a concrete or abstract verbal concept, and the child has to point to it or name it.
* Expressive Vocabulary: measures the Childs ability to say the correct names of objects and illustrations.
* Verbal Knowledge: the child selects from an array for 6 pictures the one that corresponds to a vocabulary word or answers a general information question.

KABC-II yields two general intelligence composite scores: Mental Processing Index (MPI; Luria’s model) and Fluid-Crystallised Index (FCI; CHC model). The Luria model takes 25–60 minutes to administer while the CHC model takes 30–75 minutes to administer depending on the child’s age.

==Psychometric properties==
The KABC-II was standardised between 2001 and 2003 on 3,025 3- to 18-year-olds in 39 states and the District of Columbia. The KABC-II is co normed with the [[Alan S. Kaufman#Overview_of_Kaufman.27s_tests|KTEA-II]] (Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004b). Correlation studies have been completed with: KABC, [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]], WISC-III, [[WPPSI]]-III, [[KAIT]], WJ-III COG, [[PIAT]]-R, WJ-III ACH and [[WIAT]]-II. Special group studies (clinical validity studies) included: those with Emotional Disturbances, [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Autism|Autistic Disorder]], [[Intellectual disability]], Learning Disability (Written expression, Mathematics and Reading) and those classed as Gifted.

The internal consistency reliability coefficient for core and supplementary subtests demonstrate the KABC-II has good reliability. The median reliability for the 3-6 age band is .85 (range .69-.92) and .87 (range .74-.93) for 7-18. Retest reliabilities of the global scales ranged from 0.72 to 0.94 where retest stability increasing with age.

==Uses==
The KABC-II helps to identify an individual’s strengths and weaknesses in cognitive ability and mental processing. The information proved by the KABC-II can facilitate clinical and educational planning, treatment planning and placement decisions. As with most psychological assessments the utility can be improved when combined with other tools.

==Translations==
The approach to understanding intelligence with the most supported and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing. It is also by far the most widely used in practical settings. Intelligence quotient (IQ) tests include the Stanford-Binet, Raven's Progressive Matrices, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. There are also psychometric tests that are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related construct such as scholastic aptitude. In the United States examples include the SSAT, the SAT, the ACT, the GRE, the MCAT, the LSAT, and the GMAT.[1]
Intelligence tests are widely used in educational,[18] business, and military settings because of their efficacy in predicting behavior. IQ and g (discussed in the next section) are correlated with many important social outcomes—individuals with low IQs are more likely to be divorced, have a child out of marriage, be incarcerated, and need long-term welfare support, while individuals with high IQs are associated with more years of education, higher status jobs and higher income.[19] Intelligence is significantly correlated with successful training and performance outcomes, and IQ/g is the single best predictor of successful job performance.[1][20]

"'''Maamme'''" ({{IPA-fi|ˈmɑːmːe̞ˣ|lang}}) or "'''Vårt land'''" ({{IPA-sv|ˈvoːrt ˈlanːd|langfi}}; both meaning "Our Land") is [[Finland]]'s [[national anthem]]. The music was composed by the [[German people|German]] immigrant [[Fredrik Pacius]], with (original [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) words by [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]], and with this music it was performed for the first time on 13 May 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finland.fi/life-society/the-finnish-national-anthem/ |title=The Finnish national anthem |website= This Is Finland |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was written for the 500th anniversary of [[Porvoo]] and for that occasion it was Runeberg himself who wrote the music.&lt;ref name="Richly3"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gábor|first=Richly|date=|year=2010|title=A finn nemzeti himnusz|trans-title=The Finnish national anthem|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00300/00381/00145/richly.htm|journal=Kortárs|language=Hungarian|volume=54|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem has been influenced by the "[[Szózat]]" (Appeal) of [[Mihály Vörösmarty]],
both in style and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leffler Béla.|title=A Szózat hatása Runeberg " Vårt land " c. költeményére|journal=Irodalomtörténet|year=1918|volume=7|issue=2|pages=218–221|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/02500/02518/00040/pdf/EPA02518_irodalomtortenet_1918_03-04_208-223.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The melody of "Maamme" is also used for the national anthem of [[Estonia]] with a similarly themed text, "[[Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm]]" ("My Fatherland, My Happiness and Joy", 1869).&lt;ref name="TUGLAS"/&gt; It is also considered to be the ethnic anthem for the [[Livonians]] as "[[Min izāmō]]" ("My Fatherland").

==History==
{{Listen|type=music|filename=RAI-OdeonA228022 02.ogg|title="Maamme"|description=Finnish national anthem performed in 1929, with Heikki Klemetti conducting, music composed by [[Fredrik Pacius]] (2:09)}}
[[File:Vårt land - front page.jpg|thumb|Frontpage of Vårt land by [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]]]]
[[File:VartLandStatue.JPG|thumb|The Swedish words of the Vårt Land poem appear in Johan Ludvig Runeberg's monument in Helsinki. Sculptor [[Walter Runeberg]].]]

The original poem, written in 1846 but not printed until 1848, had 11 [[stanza]]s and formed the prologue to the verse cycle ''[[The Tales of Ensign Stål]]'' ("Fänrik Ståhls Sägner"), a classic example of [[Romantic nationalism]]. The current [[Finnish language]] text is usually attributed to the 1889 translation of ''Ensign Stål'' by [[Paavo Cajander]],  but in fact originates from the 1867 translation by [[Julius Krohn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runeberg.net/fin/b_2_t.html Käännökset (Translations)] - [[:commons:Runeberg Museum|Runeberg Museum]] site (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlit.fi/oppimateriaali/kielijaidentiteetti/main.php?target=jlruneberg J. L. Runeberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315113153/http://www.finlit.fi/oppimateriaali/kielijaidentiteetti/main.php?target=jlruneberg |date=2007-03-15 }} - [[Finnish Literature Society]] site (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Tales of Ensign Stål'' were much appreciated throughout all of [[Scandinavia]]. Up until the time of [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland's independence]] in 1917&amp;ndash;18, when the song began to be recognized as specifically applying to Finland, Pacius's tune and Runeberg's text were often also sung in [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]. Note that in the original Swedish text there is no reference to Finland (except for in verses 4 and 10, which are rarely sung), only to a country in the north, but the Finnish text explicitly refers to Finland. The poem's theme is, furthermore, remarkably similar to that of the national anthems of Sweden ([[Du gamla, Du fria]]) and Norway ([[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

There is no law regarding an official national anthem in Finland, in the way the [[Coat of arms of Finland|Coat of arms]] and [[flag of Finland]] are legally defined. Instead its position has been established gradually by convention over the years.&lt;ref name="TUGLAS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuglas.fi/v%C3%A5rt_land_maamme_mu_isamaa,_mu_%C3%B5nn_ja_r%C3%B5%C3%B5m |title=Vårt land - Maamme - Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm  |last1= Lassander |first1= Uolevi |date=1998 |website= Tuglas Society | language=fi |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, "Maamme" is firmly established by convention. Children learn it in school; in formal occasions it is sung both in Finnish and in Swedish. It is played at sporting events, such as the [[Olympics]]. In the 1880s and in the 1920s there were more attempts to replace it with a Finnish language version but these ceased by the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Richly"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richly Gábor|year=2010|title=A finn nemzeti himnusz|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00300/00381/00145/richly.htm|journal=Kortárs|volume=54|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Finns have proposed that the Finnish national anthem be changed to "[[Finlandia Hymn|Finlandia]]" by [[Jean Sibelius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europeanasounds.eu/news/maamme-our-country-brief-history-of-the-finnish-national-anthem |title="Maamme" (Our country), brief history of the Finnish national anthem  |last1= Gronow |first1= Pekka |date=  |website= Europeana |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;   with lyrics by [[V.A. Koskenniemi]] (Finnish) and [[Joel Rundt]] (Swedish). There are also those who simply prefer "Finlandia" as a musical piece, although critics claim that it is difficult to sing.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

It is said that Pacius composed the tune in four days. It was popular throughout the 19th century, but established as national anthem only after Pacius' death.&lt;ref name="PACIUS"/&gt;

The melody of "Maamme" has similarities with the German drinking song "Papst und Sultan". Many believe that Fredrik Pacius intentionally or unintentionally copied parts of the tune.&lt;ref name="PACIUS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pacius.fi/index.php?catid=76&amp;blogid=5 |title=The Story of Vårt Land  |last1= Holmqvist |first1= Christian |date=  |website=  Pacius 200 years |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Finnish patriotic song, "Sotilaspoika", composed by Pacius, also includes similarities with "Papst und Sultan".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Lyrics==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
The original lyrics consist of eleven verses but it is customary to sing the first verse and the last verse, unless the people gathered are mixed Finnish and Swedish speaking. In the later case three verses are sung: the first in Finnish, the first in Swedish and the last in Finnish.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

'''Mathematical fiction''' is a genre of creative fictional work in which mathematics and mathematicians play important roles. The form and the medium of the works are not important. The genre may include short stories, novels or plays; comic books; films, videos, or audios. One of the earliest, and much studied, work of this genre is [[Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions]], an 1884 satirical novella by the English schoolmaster [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]]. Mathematical fiction may have existed since ancient times, but it was recently rediscovered as a genre of literature; since then there has been a growing body of literature in this genre, and the genre has attracted a growing body of readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janice Padula|title=Mathematical fiction for  senior students and undergraduates: Novels, plays, and film|journal=Australian Senior Mathematics Journal|volume=20|issue=2|pages=36–44|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ744036.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darren Glass|title=MAA REview of The Shape of Content: Creative Writing in Mathematics and Science|url=http://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-shape-of-content-creative-writing-in-mathematics-and-science|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Abbot's Flatland spawned a sequel in the 21st century: a novel titled ''[[Flatterland]]'', authored by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and published in 2001.

Alex Kasman, a Professor of Mathematics at [[College of Charleston]], who maintains a database of works that could possibly be included in this genre, has a broader definition for the genre: Any work "containing mathematics or mathematicians" has been treated as mathematical fiction. Accordingly, ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]], ''[[War and Peace]]'' by [[Lev Tolstoy]], ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]], and several similar literary works appear in Kasman's database because these works contain references to mathematics or mathematicians, even though mathematics and mathematicians are not important in their plots. According to this broader approach, the oldest extant work of mathematical fiction is ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'', a comedy by the Ancient Greek playwright [[Aristophanes]] performed in 414 BCE. Kasman's database has a list of more than one thousand items of diverse categories like literature, comic books and films.&lt;ref name="Kasman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alex Kasman|title=Mathematical Fiction|url=http://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/|publisher=Alex Kasman|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematical Fiction Website Achieves Milestone|url=http://www.ams.org/gnews#!news_id=1171|publisher=American Mathematical Society|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maya Sharma|title=Stories for Mathematicians: The Mathematical Fiction Homepage|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2012/09/30/stories-mathematicians-mathematical-fiction-homepage/#sthash.cLdHW0QU.dpbs|website=AMS Blogs|publisher=American Mathematical Society|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mimizuka-M1773.jpg|thumb|upright|left]]
Traditionally, [[samurai|Japanese warriors]] brought back the heads of enemies slain on the battlefield as proof of their deeds.  [[Rhinotomy|Nose collection]] in lieu of heads became a feature of the second Korean invasion.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;{{rp|p. 195}} &lt;ref name="Hawley158"/&gt; Remuneration was paid to soldiers by their ''[[daimyō]]'' commanders based on the severed heads upon submission to collection stations, where inspectors meticulously counted, recorded, salted and packed the noses bound for Japan.&lt;ref name="Hawley475"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawley494"/&gt; However, because of the number of civilians killed along with soldiers, and crowded conditions on the ships that transported troops, it was far easier to just bring back noses instead of whole heads.&lt;ref name="Hawley158"/&gt; Hideyoshi was especially insistent upon receiving noses of people his samurai had killed as proof that his men really were killing people in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592-98'', London: Osprey, 2008 p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese chroniclers on the second invading campaign mention that the ears hacked off the faces of the massacred were also of ordinary civilians&lt;ref name="Wakizaka"/&gt; mostly in the provinces [[Gyeongsang]], [[Jeolla]], and [[Chungcheong]].&lt;ref name="Hawley"/&gt;{{rp|pp. 475–476}}  In the second invasion [[Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi's]] orders were thus:
{{cquote|Mow down everyone universally, without discriminating between young and old, men and women, clergy and the laity—high ranking soldiers on the battlefield, that goes without saying, but also the hill folk, down to the poorest and meanest—and send the heads to Japan.&lt;ref name="Hawley465"/&gt;}}
One hundred and sixty-thousand Japanese troops had gone to Korea where they had taken 185,738 Korean heads and 29,014 Chinese ones, a grand total of 214,752.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;{{rp|p. 230}}&lt;ref name="ZGR"/&gt;  As some might have been discarded, it is improbable to enumerate how many were killed in total during the war.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt;

Adopted from Turnbull (2002)&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;]] --&gt;The Mimizuka was dedicated September 28, 1597.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt; Though the exact reasons as to its construction are not entirely known, scholars contend that during the second Japanese invasion of Korea in 1597, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] demanded his commanders show receipts of their martial valor in the destruction, dispatching congratulatory letters to his high-ranking warriors in the field as evidence of their service.  Hideyoshi then ordered the relics entombed in a shrine on the grounds of [[Hōkō-ji (Kyoto)|Hokoji Temple]], and set Buddhist priests to work praying for the repose of the souls of the hundreds of thousands of Koreans from whose bodies they had come; an act that chief priest [[Saishō Jōtai]] (1548–1608) in a fit of toadyism would hail as a sign of Hideyoshi's "great mercy and compassion."&lt;ref name="Hawley"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Samuel |last=Hawley |title=The Imjin War: Japan's Sixteenth Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China |year=2005 |page=501 |isbn=89-954424-2-5 |publisher=Royal Asiatic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shrine initially was known as {{nihongo|''hanazuka''|鼻塚}}, Mound of Noses, but several decades later this would come to be regarded as too cruel-sounding a name, and would be changed to the more euphonious but inaccurate {{nihongo|''mimizuka''|耳塚}}, Mound of Ears, the misnomer by which it is known to this day.&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elisonas&gt;{{Cite book|first3=Jurgis |last3=Elisonas |title=The Inseparable Trinity: Japan's Relations with China and Korea, (''in'' The Cambridge History of Japan.

===Effect on modern foreign relations===
The Mimizuka is almost unknown to the Japanese public unlike to the Koreans.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; The British historian Stephen Turnbull called the Mimizuka "...Kyoto's least mentioned and most often avoided tourist attraction".&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592-98'', London: Osprey, 2008 p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque, which was later removed, stood in front of the Ear Mound in the 1960s with the passage, "One cannot say that cutting off noses was so atrocious by the standard of the time."  Most guidebooks do not mention the Ear Mound, and only a few Japanese or foreign tourists visit the site.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; The majority of visiting tourists are Korean&amp;nbsp;– Korean tour buses are often seen parked near the Ear Mound.

In 1982, not a single Japanese school [[textbook]] mentioned the Ear Mound.  As of 1997, the mound is referred to in about half of all high-school history textbooks according to Shigeo Shimoyama, an official of [[Jikkyo (publisher)|Jikkyo]], a publishing company.  The publisher released the first Japanese text book mentioning the Ear Mound in the mid-1980s.  The Education Ministry of Japan at that time opposed the description as "too vivid" and pressured the publisher to reduce the tone and also to praise Hideyoshi for religiously dedicating the Ear Mound to store the spirits of the killed people.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;

In the 1970s under the [[Park Chung-hee]] administration, some of the officials of the South Korean government asked Japan to level the monument.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt; However, most Koreans said that the mound should stay in Japan as a reminder of past savagery.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt;
Activity since the 1990s is aptly conveyed thus:&lt;ref name="Hawley"/&gt;{{rp|pp. 585–586}}
{{cquote|In 1990 a Korean Buddhist monk named Pak Sam-jung traveled to Kyoto and, with the support of a private local organization, concluded a ceremony in front of the tomb to comfort the spirits residing there and guide them home to Korea.  Over the next six years the Japanese organization that hosted this event spearheaded a drive to get the mimizuka itself sent home, submitting a petition bearing twenty-thousand signatures to Kyoto city officials, and pledging to bear the cost of excavating the contents of the tomb and shipping them to Korea, together with the nine-meter-high earthen mound and the stone pagoda on top.  When Pak Sam-jung returned to Kyoto in 1996, the tomb's return seemed imminent. "These noses were cut off as trophies of war for Toyotomi Hideyoshi," he announced upon leaving Seoul.  "They have been there in Kyoto for four-hundred years. It is now our duty to see them returned to Korea to assuage the grief of the 126,000 people whose remains are buried there."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In the end the necessary permission to move the mimuzuka was not forthcoming from the Japanese government. It was decided that, as an officially designated national cultural asset, the tomb should stay where it was. It remains in Kyoto to this day, little known and not often visited, and not well marked for tourists. It is just west of [[Kyoto National Museum]] and [[Toyokuni Shrine (Kyoto)|Toyokuni Jinja]], the Shinto shrine dedicated to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was deified as a [[kami]] after his death. Funding from the government is insufficient to care for the site, so the work is done by local residents, who volunteer to cut the grass and tidy up the grounds.&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;}}

On September 28, 1997, the 400th anniversary of the Mimizuka, a ceremony was held in respect for those killed, which people of all nationalities and faiths attended. The current caretaker of Mimizuka as of August 2009 is Shimizu Shirou (清水四郎).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="만행 사과하고파"..."귀무덤" 지킨 日노인|date=2009-08-14|url=http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200908140228|accessdate=2009-12-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608203248/http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200908140228|archivedate=2011-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=October 2007}}
The term '''mixed-blood''' in the [[United States]] is most often employed for individuals of mixed [[European ethnic groups|European]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry.  Some of the most prominent in the 19th century were mixed-blood or mixed-race descendants of [[fur traders]] and Native American women along the northern frontier. The fur traders tended to be men of social standing, and they often married or had relationships with daughters of Native American chiefs, consolidating social standing on both sides. They formed the upper tier of what was for years in the 18th and 19th centuries a two-tier society at settlements at [[trading posts]], with other Europeans, American Indians and mixed-blood or [[Métis]] workers below them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/bieder-sault-ste-marie-and-the-war-of-1812.pdf Robert E. Bieder, "Sault Ste. Marie and the War of 1812:A World Turned Upside Down in the Old Northwest"], ''Indiana Magazine of History'', XCV (Mar 1999), accessed 13 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixed-blood is also used occasionally in [[Canada|Canadian]] accounts to refer to the nineteenth century [[Anglo-Métis]] population rather than Métis, which referred to people of [[First Nations]] and [[French people|French]] descent.

Similarly in the Southeast, the Cherokee and other tribes started having inter-generational marriage and sexual relationships with the Europeans in the early 1700s. Many Cherokee bands and families were quick to see the economic benefits of having trade, land and business dealings with Europeans, strengthened through marriages. Prominent Cherokee and Creek leaders of the 19th century were of mixed-descent but, born to Indian mothers in [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] societies, they identified fully and were accepted as Indian and grew up in those cultures.&lt;ref name="perdue"&gt;David A. Sicko, Review: ''"Mixed Blood" Indians: Racial Construction in the Early South'' by Theda Perdue, ''The Florida Historical Quarterly,'' Vol. 83, No. 2 (Fall, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned persons of mixed-blood ancestry in United States' history are many. One such example is [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]], who guided the [[Mormon Battalion]] from [[New Mexico]] to the city of [[San Diego]] in [[California]] in 1846, and then accepted an appointment there as ''alcalde'' of Mission San Luis Rey.  Both his parents worked with the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], his mother ''[[Sacagawea]]'' as the invaluable [[Shoshone]] guide, and his French-Canadian father [[Toussaint Charbonneau]] as an interpreter of Shoshone and [[Hidatsa]], cook and laborer.  J.B. Charbonneau is depicted on the United States dollar coin along with his mother ''Sacagawea''.

Another example is [[Jane Johnston Schoolcraft]], inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2008, in recognition of her literary contributions.  She is recognized as the first Native American literary writer and poet, and the first Native American poet to write in an indigenous language.  Jane Johnston was the daughter of a wealthy [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] fur trader and his [[Ojibwe]] wife, who was daughter of an Ojibwe chief.  Johnston Schoolcraft was born in 1800 and lived most of her life in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]], where she grew up in both cultures and learned [[french language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Ojibwe]].  She wrote in English and Ojibwe. She married [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]], who became a renowned ethnographer, in part due to her and her family's introduction to Native American culture. A major collection of her writings was published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesoundthestarsmake.com/ Robert Dale Parker, ''Jane Johnston Schoolcraft''], University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, accessed 11 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Erdrich]] is one of the best known contemporary Native American authors, whose fiction deals with the Ojibwe-American heritage of her [[Minnesota]] and reservation upbringing.  She is of Ojibwe, German-American, and French ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/weekly/interview960506.html Robert Spillman, "The Salon Interview: Louise Erdrich"], Salon.com, accessed 16 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Among her many awards have been a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] (1984), the latter for her early novel ''[[Love Medicine]]''.  In numerous novels over the last 20 years, she has created a richly imagined fictional universe of Native American and European American small town and reservation life.

''[[Mestizo]]'' is the contemporary term of choice for [[Hispanic]] individuals (whether US-born or immigrant) of a similar mixed ancestry (Indigenous and European), but based on different groups.  Many Hispanic-Americans who have identified as "white" are of Spanish descent, having had ancestors in the [[southwestern United States]] for several generations prior to annexation of that region into the United States. However, identification on the US Census has historically been limited by its terminology, and the option to only select one "race" in the past. Others have classified themselves as mestizo, particularly those who also identify as [[Chicano]].  Hispanics of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] and [[Cubans|Cuban]] descent are most numerous on the East Coast, especially in [[Florida]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New England]].

The most recent Hispanic immigrants, who arrived during mid-century until today, have mainly identified as [[mestizo]] or [[Amerindian]]. They have come from [[Mexico]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].  Of the over 35 million Hispanics counted in the Federal 2000 Census, the overwhelming majority of the 42.2% who identified as "some other race" are believed to be mestizos—a term not included on the US Census but widely used in Latin America.  Of the 47.9% of Hispanics who identified as "White Hispanic", many acknowledge possessing Amerindian ancestry, as do many European Americans who identify as "White".  Hispanics identifying as multiracial amounted to 6.3% (2.2 million) of all Hispanics; they likely included many mestizos as well as individuals of mixed Amerindian and African ancestry.

 [[File:Month - Knuckles (en).svg|thumb|right|320px|[[Knuckle mnemonic]] for the number of days in each month of the [[Gregorian Calendar]]. Each knuckle represents a 31-day month.]]
A '''mnemonic''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ə|ˈ|m|ɒ|n|ᵻ|k}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Concise Oxford English Dictionary (Computer Software): ''entry "mnemonic"'' |editor1-last=Soanes |editor1-first=Catherine |editor2-last=Stevenson |editor2-first=Angus |editor3-last=Hawker |editor3-first=Sara |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=29 March 2006 |edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first "m" is silent) '''device''', or '''memory device''', is any learning technique that aids information retention or retrieval (remembering) in the human [[memory]]. Mnemonics make use of elaborative encoding, retrieval cues, and imagery as specific tools to encode any given information in a way that allows for efficient storage and retrieval. Mnemonics aid original information in becoming associated with something more accessible or meaningful—which, in turn, provides better retention of the information. Commonly encountered mnemonics are often used for lists and in [[auditory system|auditory]] form, such as short poems, [[acronym]]s, or memorable phrases, but mnemonics can also be used for other types of information and in [[visual]] or [[kinesthetic]] forms. Their use is based on the observation that the human mind more easily remembers spatial, personal, surprising, physical, sexual, humorous, or otherwise "relatable" information, rather than more abstract or impersonal forms of information.

The word "mnemonic" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word μνημονικός (''mnēmonikos''), meaning "of memory, or relating to memory"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmnhmoniko%2Fs μνημονικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to [[Mnemosyne]] ("remembrance"), the name of the goddess of memory in [[Greek mythology]]. Both of these words are derived from μνήμη (''mnēmē''), "remembrance, memory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmnh%2Fmh μνήμη], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Mnemonics in antiquity were most often considered in the context of what is today known as the [[art of memory]].

Ancient Greeks and Romans distinguished between two types of memory: the "natural" memory and the "artificial" memory. The former is inborn, and is the one that everyone uses instinctively. The latter in contrast has to be trained and developed through the learning and practice of a variety of mnemonic techniques.

Mnemonic systems are techniques or strategies consciously used to improve memory. They help use information already stored in long-term memory to make memorisation an easier task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|display-authors=etal|title=Psychology the Science of Behavior|page=245|publisher=Pearson Canada, United States of America|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The general name of '''mnemonics''', or ''memoria technica,'' was the name applied to devices for aiding the memory, to enable the mind to reproduce a relatively unfamiliar idea, and especially a series of dissociated ideas, by connecting it, or them, in some artificial whole, the parts of which are mutually suggestive.&lt;ref name="EB1"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Mnemonics|volume=18|pages=629–630}} - and respective bibliography for this specific section.&lt;/ref&gt; Mnemonic devices were much cultivated by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[sophist]]s and [[philosopher]]s and are frequently referred to by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. In later times the poet [[Simonides]] was credited for development of these techniques, perhaps for no reason other than that the power of his memory was famous. [[Cicero]], who attaches considerable importance to the art, but more to the principle of order as the best help to memory, speaks of [[Carneades]] (perhaps Charmades) of [[Athens]] and [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] as distinguished examples of people who used well-ordered images to aid the memory. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] valued such helps in order to support facility in public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;The method used is described by the author of ''Rhet ad Heren.'' iii. 16-24; see also [[Quintilian]] (''Inst. Or.'' xi. 2), whose account is, however, obscure. In his time the art had almost ceased to be practiced.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek and the Roman system of mnemonics was founded on the use of mental places and signs or pictures, known as "topical" mnemonics. The most usual method was to choose a large house, of which the apartments, walls, windows, statues, furniture, etc., were each associated with certain names, phrases, events or ideas, by means of symbolic pictures. To recall these, an individual had only to search over the apartments of the house until discovering the places where images had been placed by the imagination.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Giordano Bruno Campo dei Fiori cropped.jpg|thumb|Detail of [[Giordano Bruno]]'s statue in [[Rome]]. Bruno was famous for his mnemonics, some of which he included in his treatises ''De umbris idearum'' and ''Ars Memoriae''.]]

In accordance with said system, if it were desired to fix a historic date in memory, it was localised in an imaginary town divided into a certain number of districts, each of with ten houses, each house with ten rooms, and each room with a hundred quadrates or memory-places, partly on the floor, partly on the four walls, partly on the roof. Therefore, if it were desired to fix in the memory the date of the invention of printing (1436), an imaginary book, or some other symbol of printing, would be placed in the thirty-sixth quadrate or memory-place of the fourth room of the first house of the historic district of the town.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Except that the rules of mnemonics are referred to by [[Martianus Capella]], nothing further is known regarding the practice until the 13th century.&lt;ref name="EB1"/&gt;

Among the voluminous writings of [[Roger Bacon]] is a tractate ''De arte memorativa''. [[Ramon Llull]] devoted special attention to mnemonics in connection with his ''ars generalis.'' The first important modification of the method of the Romans was that invented by the German poet [[Konrad Celtes]], who, in his ''Epitoma in utramque Ciceronis rhetoricam cum arte memorativa nova'' (1492), used letters of the [[alphabet]] for associations, rather than places. About the end of the 15th century, [[Petrus de Ravenna]] (b. 1448) provoked such astonishment in [[Italy]] by his mnemonic feats that he was believed by many to be a [[necromancer]]. His ''Phoenix artis memoriae'' ([[Venice]], 1491, 4 vols.) went through as many as nine editions, the seventh being published at [[Cologne]] in 1608.

About the end of the 16th century, [[Lambert Schenkel]] (''Gazophylacium'', 1610), who taught mnemonics in [[France]], Italy and [[Germany]], similarly surprised people with his memory. He was denounced as a [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] by the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]], but in 1593 he published his tractate ''De memoria'' at [[Douai]] with the sanction of that celebrated theological faculty. The most complete account of his system is given in two works by his pupil [[Martin Sommer]], published in [[Venice]] in 1619. In 1618 John Willis (d. 1628?) published ''Mnemonica; sive ars reminiscendi'',&lt;ref&gt;[[English language|English version]] by Leonard Sowersby, 1661; extracts in [[Gregor von Feinaigle]]'s ''New Art of Memory'', 3rd ed., 1813.&lt;/ref&gt; containing a clear statement of the principles of topical or local mnemonics. [[Giordano Bruno]] included a ''memoria technica'' in his treatise ''De umbris idearum,'' as part of his study of the ''ars generalis'' of [[Ramon Llull|Llull]]. Other writers of this period are the [[Florence|Florentine]] Publicius (1482); [[Johannes Romberch]] (1533); [[Hieronimo Morafiot]], ''Ars memoriae'' (1602);and  B. Porta, ''Ars reminiscendi'' (1602).&lt;ref name="EB1"/&gt;

In 1648 [[Stanislaus Mink von Wennsshein]] revealed what he called the "most fertile secret" in mnemonics — using consonants for figures, thus expressing numbers by words (vowels being added as required), in order to create associations more readily remembered. The philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] adopted an alphabet very similar to that of Wennsshein for his scheme of a form of writing common to all languages.

Wennsshein's method was adopted with slight changes afterward by the majority of subsequent "original" systems. It was modified and supplemented by [[Richard Grey (priest)|Richard Grey]] (1694-1771), a priest who published a ''Memoria technica'' in 1730. The principal part of Grey's method is briefly this:
{{quote|To remember anything in [[history]], [[chronology]], [[geography]], etc., a word is formed, the beginning whereof, being the first syllable or syllables of the thing sought, does, by frequent repetition, of course draw after it the latter part, which is so contrived as to give the answer. Thus, in history, the [[Genesis flood narrative|Deluge]] happened in the year [[before Christ]] two thousand three hundred forty-eight; this is signified by the word Del-''etok'', Del standing for Deluge and ''etok'' for 2348.&lt;ref name="EB1"/&gt;}}(His method is comparable to the [[Hebrew alphabet#Numeric values of letters|Hebrew system]] by which letters also stand for numerals, and therefore words for dates.)

To assist in retaining the mnemonical words in the memory, they were formed into memorial lines. Such strange words in difficult [[hexameter]] scansion, are by no means easy to memorise. The [[vowel]] or [[consonant]], which Grey connected with a particular figure, was chosen arbitrarily.

A later modification was made in 1806 [[Gregor von Feinaigle]], a German [[monk]] from [[Salem, Baden-Württemberg|Salem]] near [[Lake Constance|Constance]]. While living and working in [[Paris]], he expounded a system of mnemonics in which (as in Wennsshein) the numerical figures are represented by letters chosen due to some similarity to the figure or an accidental connection with it. This alphabet was supplemented by a complicated system of localities and signs. Feinaigle, who apparently did not publish any written documentation of this method, travelled to [[England]] in 1811. The following year one of his pupils published ''The New Art of Memory'' (1812), giving Feinaigle's system. In addition, it contains valuable historical material about previous systems.

Other [[mnemonist]]s later published simplified forms, as the more complicated menemonics were generally abandoned. Methods founded chiefly on the so-called laws of association (cf. [[Mental association]]) were taught with some success in Germany.&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;A simplified form of Feinaigle's method was published by [[Aimé Paris]] (''Principes et applications diverses de la mnémonique'', 7th ed., Paris, 1834). The use of symbolic pictures was revived in connection with the latter by Antoni Jaźwińsky of Poland. His system was published by the Polish general J. Bem, under the title ''Exposé général de la méthode mnémonique polonaise, perfectionnée à Paris'' (Paris, 1839). Various other modifications of the systems were advocated by subsequent mnemonists right through the 19th century. More complicated systems were proposed in the 20th century, such as the ''Keesing Memory System'', the ''System of Memory and Mental Training'', and the Pelman memory system.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
; 1. Music mnemonics
: Songs and jingles can be used as a mnemonic. A common example is how children remember the alphabet by singing the ABC's.

; 2. Name mnemonics (acronym)
: The first letter of each word is combined into a new word. For example: VIBGYOR (or ROY G BIV) for the colours of the rainbow or HOMES for the [[Great Lakes]].

; 3. Expression or word mnemonics
: The first letter of each word is combined to form a phrase or sentence -- e.g. "Richard of York gave battle in vain" for the colours of the rainbow.

; 4. Model mnemonics
: A model is used to help recall information.{{clarification needed|date=September 2017}}

; 5. Ode mnemonics
: The information is placed into a poem or [[doggerel]], -- e.g. 'Note socer, gener, liberi, and Liber god of revelry, like puer these retain the 'e'' (most Latin nouns of the second declension ending in -er drop the -e in all of the oblique cases except the vocative, these are the exceptions).

; 6. Note organization mnemonics
: The method of note organization can be used as a memorization technique.{{clarification needed|date=September 2017}}

; 7. Image mnemonics
: The information is constructed into a picture -- e.g. the German weak declension can  be remembered as five '-e's', looking rather like the state of Oklahoma in America, in a sea of '-en's'.

; 8. Connection mnemonics
: New [[knowledge]] is connected to knowledge already known.

; 9. Spelling mnemonics
: An example is "''i'' before ''e'' except after ''c'' or when sounding like ''a'' in ''neighbor'' and ''weigh''".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seattleu.edu/media/learning-assistance-programs/files/9-Types-of-Mnemonics-for-Better-Memorya4b4.pdf Types of mnemonics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications and examples==
{{main|List of mnemonics}}
A [[list of mnemonics|wide range of mnemonics]] are used for several purposes. The most commonly used mnemonics are those for lists, numerical sequences, foreign-language acquisition, and medical treatment for patients with memory deficits.

===For lists===
&lt;!-- EDITORIAL NOTE: Do not add mnemonics here, unless they are particularly illustrative.  See "List of mnemonics" article instead --&gt;
A common mnemonic for remembering lists is to create an easily remembered acronym, or, taking each of the initial letters of the list members, create a memorable phrase in which the words with the same acronym as the material. Mnemonic techniques can be applied to most memorisation of novel materials.

Some common examples for first letter mnemonics:
* "Memory Needs Every Method Of Nurturing Its Capacity" is a mnemonic for spelling 'mnemonic.'
* To memorize the metric prefixes after Giga(byte), think of the candy, and this mnemonic. Tangiest PEZ? Yellow! TPEZY. Tera, Peta, Exa, Zetta, Yotta(byte).
* "Maybe Not Every Mnemonic Oozes Nuisance Intensely Concentrated" is perhaps a less common mnemonic for spelling 'mnemonic', but it benefits from being a bit humorous and memorable.
* The order of [[Sharp (music)|sharps]] in [[key signature]] notation is F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯, A♯, E♯ and B♯, giving the mnemonic "Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle". The order of [[flat (music)|flats]] is the reverse: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭ and F♭ ("Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father").&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KeoqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22Father%20Charles%20goes%20down%20and%20ends%20battle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_u4wUc_dNo220QHi-oHYDw&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Father%20Charles%20goes%20down%20and%20ends%20battle%22&amp;f=false Educational Plans in Music Teaching]'', The Quarterly Music Review, Vol. 1, 1885&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This mnemonic is significant for its long history and its reversibility --&gt;
* To memorise the colours of the [[rainbow]]: the phrase "[[Richard III of England|Richard Of York]] Gave Battle In Vain" - each of the initial letters matches the colours of the rainbow in order (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). Other examples are the phrase "Run over your granny because it's violent" or the imaginary name "Roy G. Biv".
* To memorise the North American [[Great Lakes]]: the acronym HOMES - matching the letters of the five lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.happychild.org.uk/acc/tpr/mne/1199gtlk.htm Great Lakes Mnemonic]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To memorise [[Electronic color code|colour codes]] as they are used in [[electronics]]: the phrase "Bill Brown Realised Only Yesterday Good Boys Value Good Work"  represents in order the 10 colours and their numerical order: black (0), brown (1), red (2), orange (3), yellow (4), green (5), blue (6), violet or purple (7), grey (8), and white (9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gambhir|first=R.S.|title= Foundations Of Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-Qpy0KQayIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=resistor+code+mnemonic|volume=2|year=1993|publisher=New Age International|isbn=81-224-0523-1|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To memorise chemical reactions, such as [[redox]] reactions, where it is common to mix up oxidation and reduction, the short phrase "LEO (Lose Electron Oxidation) the lion says GER (Gain Electron Reduction)" or "Oil Rig" can be used - which is an acronym for "Oxidation is losing, Reduction is gaining".&lt;ref name="Mnemonic Methods"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glynn, Shawn|title=Mnemonic Methods|year=2003|publisher=The Science Teacher|pages=52–55|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/214619949

* To memorise the names of the planets and Pluto, use the [[planetary mnemonic]]: "My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos" or "My Very Easy Method Just Speeds Up Naming Planets" or "My Very Educated Mother Just Showed Us Nine Planets"- where each of the initial letters matches the name of the planets in our solar system (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, [Pluto]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0603/questions_answers/ |title=Questions and Answers on Planets |accessdate=2008-07-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208183938/http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0603/questions_answers/ |archivedate=February 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To memorise the sequence of [[stellar classification]]: "Oh, Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me" - where O, B, A, F, G, K, M are categories of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.mnemonic-device.com/astronomy/oh-be-a-fine-girl-kiss-me/ |website = Mnemonic Devices Memory Tools|title = Mnemonic Oh, Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me! in Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For numerical sequences and mathematical operations===
Mnemonic phrases or poems can be used to encode numeric sequences by various methods, one common one is to create a new phrase in which the number of letters in each word represents the according digit of pi. For example, the first 15 digits of the mathematical constant [[pi]] (3.14159265358979) can be encoded as "Now I need a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics"; "Now", having 3 letters, represents the first number, 3. [[Piphilology]] is the practice dedicated to creating mnemonics for pi.

Another is used for "calculating" the multiples of 9 up to 9 × 10 using one's fingers. Begin by holding out both hands with all fingers stretched out. Now count left to right the number of fingers that indicates the multiple. For example, to figure 9 × 4, count four fingers from the left, ending at your left-hand index finger. Bend this finger down and count the remaining fingers. Fingers to the left of the bent finger represent tens, fingers to the right are ones. There are three fingers to the left and six to the right, which indicates 9 × 4 = 36. This works for 9 × 1 up through 9 × 10.

For remembering the rules in adding and multiplying two signed numbers, Balbuena and Buayan (2015) made the letter strategies LAUS (like signs, add; unlike signs, subtract) and LPUN (like signs, positive; unlike signs, negative), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://apjeas.apjmr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/APJEAS-2.3-Revised-Mnemonics-and-Gaming1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===For foreign-language acquisition===
Mnemonics may  be helpful in learning foreign languages, for example by transposing difficult foreign words with words in a language the learner knows already, also called "cognates" which are very common in the Spanish language. A useful such technique is to find [[linkword]]s, words that have the same pronunciation in a known language as the target word, and associate them visually or auditorially with the target word.

For example, in trying to assist the learner to remember ''ohel'' (אוהל), the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for ''tent'', the linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] proposes the memorable sentence "''Oh hell'', there's a raccoon in my ''tent''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.professorzuckermann.com/anglo-hebraic-lexical-mnemonics&lt;/ref&gt;. The memorable sentence "There's a ''fork'' in ''Ma’s leg''" helps the learner remember that the Hebrew word for ''fork'' is ''mazleg'' (מזלג).&lt;ref name="zuckermann1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann]] |first1=Ghil'ad |year=2011 |title=Mnemonics in Second Language Acquisition |journal=Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=302-309 |url=https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol44/iss4/21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Similarly, to remember the Hebrew word ''bayit'' (בית), meaning ''house'', one can use the sentence "that's a lovely ''house'', I'd like to ''buy it''."&lt;ref name="zuckermann1" /&gt; The linguist [[Michel Thomas]] taught students to remember that ''estar'' is the Spanish word for ''to be'' by using the phrase "to be a star".&lt;ref name="howtomaster"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Master a Foreign Language|url=http://www.buildyourmemory.com/foreignlanguage.php|website=buildyourmemory.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325051730/http://www.buildyourmemory.com/foreignlanguage.php|archivedate=2015-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Spanish example is by using the mnemonic "[[Vin Diesel]] Has Ten Weapons" to teach irregular command verbs in the you form. Spanish verb forms and tenses are regularly seen as the hardest part of learning the language. With a high number of verb tenses, and many verb forms that are not found in English, Spanish verbs can be hard to remember and then conjugate. The use of mnemonics has been proven to help students better learn foreign languages, and this holds true for Spanish verbs. A particularly hard verb tense to remember is command verbs. Command verbs in Spanish are conjugated differently depending on who the command is being given to. The phrase, when pronounced with a Spanish accent, is used to remember "Ven Di Sal Haz Ten Ve Pon Sé", all of the irregular Spanish command verbs in the you form. This mnemonic helps students attempting to memorize different verb tenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irregular Spanish Imperatives Made Easy by Vin Diesel|url=http://www.alwaysspanish.com/2013/02/irregular-spanish-imperative-made-easy.html|website=AlwaysSpanish.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another technique is for learners of [[Grammatical gender|gendered languages]] to associate their [[mental image]]s of words with a colour that matches the gender in the target language. An example here is to remember the Spanish word for "foot," ''pie,'' [pee-ay] with the image of a foot stepping on a pie, which then spills blue filling (blue representing the male gender of the noun in this example).

For French verbs which use etre as a participle: DR and MRS VANDERTRAMPP: descendre, rester, monter, revenir, sortir, venir, arriver, naître, devenir, entrer, rentrer, tomber, retourner, aller, mourir, partir, passer.

===For patients with memory deficits===
Mnemonics can be used in aiding patients with memory deficits that could be caused by [[head injuries]], [[strokes]], [[epilepsy]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and other neurological conditions.

In a study conducted by Doornhein and De Haan, the patients were treated with six different memory strategies including the mnemonics technique. The results concluded that there were significant improvements on the immediate and delayed subtest of the RBMT, delayed recall on the Appointments test, and relatives rating on the MAC from the patients that received mnemonics treatment. However, in the case of stroke patients, the results did not reach statistical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 =das Nair|first1 = RD |last2= Lincoln|first2 = NB|title = Cognitive rehabilitation for memory deficits following stroke|page = 2 |date= 8 July 2008 |work = The Cochrane Collaboration |publisher = JohnWiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002293.pub2|url = http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/34518/1/Nair_et_al-2007-The_Cochrane_library.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Academic study of the use of mnemonics has shown their effectiveness. In one such experiment, subjects of different ages who applied mnemonic techniques to learn novel vocabulary outperformed control groups that applied [[contextual learning]] and free-learning styles.&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levin |first1=Joel R. |last2=Levin |first2=Mary E. |last3=Glasman |first3=Lynette D. |last4=Nordwall |first4=Margaret B. |title=Mnemonic vocabulary instruction: Additional effectiveness evidence |journal=[[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] |date=April 1992 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=156–174 |doi=10.1016/0361-476x(92)90056-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mnemonics vary in effectiveness for several groups ranging from young children to the elderly. Mnemonic learning strategies require time and resources by educators to develop creative and effective devices. The most simple and creative mnemonic devices usually are the most effective for teaching. In the classroom, mnemonic devices must be used at the appropriate time in the instructional sequence to achieve their maximum effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seay|first1=Sharon S.|last2=McAlum|first2=Harry G.|url=https://www.abacademies.org/articles/aeljvol14no-22010.pdf|title=The use/application of mnemonics as a pedagogical tool in auditing|journal=Academy of Educational Leadership Journal|date=May 2010|volume=14|issue=22|pages=33–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mnemonics were seen to be more effective for groups of people who struggled with or had weak [[long-term memory]], like the elderly. Five years after a mnemonic training study, a research team followed-up 112 community-dwelling older adults, 60 years of age and over. Delayed recall of a word list was assessed prior to, and immediately following mnemonic training, and at the 5-year follow-up. Overall, there was no significant difference between word recall prior to training and that exhibited at follow-up. However, pre-training performance gains scores in performance immediately post-training and use of the mnemonic predicted performance at follow-up. Individuals who self-reported using the mnemonic exhibited the highest performance overall, with scores significantly higher than at pre-training. The findings suggest that mnemonic training has long-term benefits for some older adults, particularly those who continue to employ the mnemonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=O’Hara |first=Ruth |last2=Brooks |first2=John O. |last3=Friedman |first3=Leah |last4=Schröder |first4=Carmen M. |last5=Morgan |first5=Kevin S. |last6=Kraemer |first6=Helena C. |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/621661024 |title=Long-term effects of mnemonic training in community-dwelling older adults |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |date=October 2007 |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=585–590 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2006.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This contrasts with a study from surveys of medical students that approximately only 20% frequently used mnemonic acronyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Brotle|first=Charles D.|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/c8b49a854f79871b3c092645422eea11/|title=The role of mnemonic acronyms in clinical emergency medicine: A grounded theory study|degree=EdD|date=2011|publisher=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, the process of aging particularly affects the [[medial temporal lobe]] and [[hippocampus]], in which the [[episodic memory]] is synthesized. The episodic memory stores information about items, objects, or features with spatiotemporal contexts. Since mnemonics aid better in remembering spatial or physical information rather than more abstract forms, its effect may vary according to a subject's age and how well the subject's medial temporal lobe and hippocampus function.

This could be further explained by one recent study which indicates a general deficit in the memory for spatial locations in aged adults (mean age 69.7 with standard deviation of 7.4 years) compared to young adults (mean age 21.7 with standard deviation of 4.2 years). At first, the difference in target recognition was not significant.

The researchers then divided the aged adults into two groups, aged unimpaired and aged impaired, according to a [[neuropsychological testing]]. With the aged groups split, there was an apparent deficit in target recognition in aged impaired adults compared to both young adults and aged unimpaired adults. This further supports the varying effectiveness of mnemonics in different age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reagh|first1=Zachariah M.|last2=Roberts|first2=Jared M.|last3=Ly|first3=Maria|last4=DiProspero|first4=Natalie|last5=Murray|first5=Elizabeth|last6=Yassa|first6=Michael A.|title=Spatial discrimination deficits as a function of mnemonic interference in aged adults with and without memory impairment|journal=Hippocampus|date=March 2014|volume=24|issue=3|pages=303–314|doi=10.1002/hipo.22224|pmid=24167060|pmc=3968903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, a different research was done previously with the same notion, which presented with similar results to that of Reagh et al. in verbal mnemonics discrimination task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ly|first1=Maria|last2=Murray|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Yassa|first3=Michael A.|title=Perceptual versus conceptual interference and pattern separation of verbal stimuli in young and older adults|journal=Hippocampus|date=June 2013|volume=23|issue=6|pages=425–430|doi=10.1002/hipo.22110|pmid=23505005|pmc=3968906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies (notably "[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]]") have suggested that the [[short-term memory]] of adult humans can hold only a limited number of items; grouping items into larger chunks such as in a mnemonic might be part of what permits the retention of a larger total amount of information in short-term memory, which in turn can aid in the creation of long-term memories.

'''Muka''' is prepared fibre of [[New Zealand]] [[Phormium|flax]] ({{lang-mi|links=yes|harakeke}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=muka |title=Māori Dictionary |work=maoridictionary.co.nz |year=2011 |quote=(noun) prepared flax fibre.

A variegated flax, with bright green leaves, yellow stripes, orange edges and midrib, while the fiber of this flax is white and shiny.  |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prepared primarily by scraping, pounding and washing, it is a key material in [[Māori traditional textiles]] where it is usually used in [[tāniko]] or twined weaving.

In pre-European times, muka was widely used by the [[Māori people|Māori]] and was the primary fibre used for weaving clothing. ''Patu muka'' or pounding stones were a distinct tool type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=132710 |title=Patu muka - Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |work=collections.tepapa.govt.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early colonial period, muka was a trade staple, often being traded for muskets with devastating effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/flax-and-flax-working/3 |title=The early flax trade - Flax and flax working &amp;mdash; Te Ara|work=teara.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=The Māori producers were not paid in cash but in goods – usually muskets. The trade therefore had a lasting impact on Māori society. With firearms, conflicts between tribes turned into full-scale wars. Tribes competed for control of the flax trade and thus the supply of muskets. |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well into the European era it was used for paper, clothing and sacking, with large commercial workings [[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/manawatu-and-horowhenua-places/8/4 |title=Last flax cut, Foxton - Manawatū and Horowhenua places  &amp;mdash; Te Ara  |work=teara.govt.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Māori Renaissance|Māori renaissance]] the resurgence in traditional [[Tāniko|Māori weaving]] has seen up-swing in the use of muka, especially for art and high-end craft items. Usually woven muka is distinguished from woven (unprepared) flax which is only suitable for coarse work such as bags ([[Kete (basket)|kete]]) and panels.

The '''''New Hampshire Troubadour''''' was a monthly magazine supported by the State Planning and Development Commission of [[New Hampshire]] which was originally published from 1931-1951.&lt;ref name="pherald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastnh.com/arts/book-of-the-week/nh-troubadour-sings-again/|title=NH Troubadour Sings Again|work=Portsmouth Herald|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was subsequently published under several private owners and titles, most prominently as ''New Hampshire Profiles''.&lt;ref name="troubhist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtroubadour.com/history/|title=History|work=The New Hampshire Troubadour|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120623144704/http://www.nhtroubadour.com/history/|archivedate=June 23, 2012|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Frisian''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] spoken between the 8th and 16th centuries in the area between the [[Rhine]] and [[Weser]] on the European [[North Sea]] coast. The Frisian settlers on the coast of South Jutland (today's Northern Friesland) also spoke Old Frisian but no medieval texts of this area are known. The language of the earlier inhabitants of the region between the [[Zuiderzee]] and Ems River (the [[Frisii|Frisians]] mentioned by [[Tacitus]]) is attested in only a few personal names and place-names. Old Frisian evolved into [[Middle Frisian]], spoken from the 16th to the 19th century.

In the early Middle Ages, [[Frisia]] stretched from the area around [[Bruges]], in what is now [[Belgium]], to the [[Weser]] River in northern [[Germany]]. At the time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern [[North Sea]] coast. This region is referred to as Greater Frisia or Frisia Magna, and many of the areas within it still treasure their Frisian heritage. However, by 1300, their territory had been pushed back to the Zuiderzee (now the [[IJsselmeer]]), and the Frisian language survives along the coast only as a substrate.

The people from what are today northern Germany and Denmark who settled in [[England]] from about 400 onwards came from the same regions and spoke more or less the same language as the people who lived in Frisia (as medieval Friesland is usually called to distinguish it from the present-day regions with that name). Hence, a close relationship exists between Old Frisian and [[Old English language|Old English]].

==Phonology==
{{see also|Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law}}

===Early sound developments===
[[File:Pagina's codex roorda.jpg|thumb|The [[Codex Roorda]] is a medieval document with [[Latin]] and Old Frisian law texts.]]

Generally, Old Frisian phonologically resembles Old English. In particular, it shares the palatalisation of [[velar consonant]]s also found in Old English. For example, whereas the closely related Old Saxon and Old Dutch retain the velar in ''dag'', Old Frisian has ''dei'' and Old English has ''dæġ'' {{IPA|[dæj]}}. When followed by front vowels the Germanic {{IPA|/k/}} changed to a {{IPA|/tʃ/}} sound. The Old Frisian for ''church'' was ''tzirke'' or ''tzerke'', in Old English it was ''ċiriċe'' {{IPA|[ˈtʃiritʃe]}}, while Old Saxon and Old Dutch have the unpalatalised ''kirika''. Another feature shared between the two is Anglo-Frisian brightening, which fronted ''a'' to ''e'' under some circumstances. In unstressed syllables, ''o'' merges into ''a'', and ''i'' into ''e'' as in Old English.

The old Germanic diphthongs *''ai'' and *''au'' become ''ē''/''ā'' and ''ā'', respectively, in Old Frisian, as in ''ēn''/''ān'' ("one") from Proto-Germanic *''ainaz'', and ''brād'' from *''braudą'' ("bread"). In comparison, these diphthongs become ''ā'' and ''ēa'' (''ān'' and ''brēad'') in Old English, and ''ē'' and ''ō'' (''ēn'' and ''brōd'') in Old Saxon. The diphthong *''eu'' generally becomes ''ia'', and Germanic *''iu'' is retained. These diphthongs initially began with a syllabic (stressed) ''i'', but the stress later shifts to the second component, giving to ''iā'' and ''iū''. For example, ''thiād'' ("people") and ''liūde'' from Proto-Germanic *''þeudō'' and *''liudīz''.

Between vowels, ''h'' generally disappears (''sian'' from *''sehwaną''), as in Old English and Old Dutch. Word-initial ''h-'' on the other hand is retained. Old Frisian retains ''th'' in all positions for longer than Old Dutch and Old Saxon do, showing the gradual spread of the shift from ''th'' to ''d'' from south to north, beginning in southern Germany in the 9th century as part of the [[High German consonant shift]], but not reaching Frisian until the 13th or 14th century.

==Grammar==
Old Frisian (c. 1150&amp;ndash;c. 1550) retained [[Declension|grammatical cases]]. Some of the texts that are preserved from this period are from the 12th or 13th centuries, but most are from the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, all these texts are restricted to legal writings. Although the earliest written examples of Frisian—stray words in a Latin context—are from approximately the 9th century, there are a few examples of [[runic]] inscriptions from the region which are older and in a very early form of the Frisian language. These runic writings however usually consist of no more than inscriptions of a single or few words.

==Corpus==
There are some early Frisian names preserved in Latin texts, and some [[runic]] ([[Futhorc]]) inscriptions, but the oldest surviving texts in Old Frisian date from the 13th century, in particular official and legal documents. They show a considerable degree of linguistic uniformity.

'''Old Prussian''' is an extinct [[Baltic language]] once spoken by the [[Old Prussians]], the [[Baltic peoples]] of [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] (not to be confused with the [[Prussia|later and much larger German state]] of the same name)—after 1945 northeastern [[Poland]], the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of [[Russia]] and southernmost part of [[Lithuania]].

The language is called Old Prussian to avoid confusion with the German dialects [[Low Prussian]] and [[High Prussian]] and the adjective ''Prussian'', which is also often used to relate to the later German state. Old Prussian began to be written down in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] in about the 13th century, and a small amount of literature in the language survives.

==Original territory==
In addition to Prussia proper, the original territory of the Old Prussians might have included eastern parts of [[Pomerelia]] (some parts of the region east of the [[Vistula River]]). The language might have also been spoken much further east and south in what became [[Polesia]] and part of [[Podlasie]], with the conquests by [[Rus (people)|Rus]] and [[Poles]] starting in the 10th century and the [[Ostsiedlung|German colonisation]] of the area that began in the 12th century.{{clarify|date=August 2012}}

==Relation to other languages==
Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct [[Western Baltic languages]], namely [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Galindian language|Galindian]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/37147068/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%85_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2._%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B_%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82_3-4_2017._%D0%A1._95-124 Tarasov I. The balts in the Migration Period. P. I. Galindians, pp. 100-108.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sudovian language|Sudovian]]. It is related to the [[Eastern Baltic languages]] such as [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and more distantly related to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]. Compare the Old Prussian ''{{lang|prg|semmē}}'', {{lang-ru|земля́}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|zemljá}}), {{lang-lv|zeme}} and {{lang-lt|žemė}}.

Old Prussian contained loanwords from Slavic languages (e.g., Old Prussian ''{{lang|prg|curtis}}'' "hound", like Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|kùrtas}}'' and Latvian ''{{lang|lv|kur̃ts}}'', comes from Slavic (compare {{lang-uk|хорт}}, {{lang|uk-Latn|khort}}; {{lang-pl|chart}}; {{lang-cs|chrt}}, as well as a few borrowings from Germanic, including from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (e.g., Old Prussian ''{{lang|prg|ylo}}'' "awl" as with Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|ýla}}'', Latvian ''{{lang|lv|īlens}}'') and from [[Scandinavian languages]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50949/Baltic-languages/74885/Loanwords-in-Baltic Encyclopædia Britannica article on Baltic languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

From these borderlands the movement penetrated Little Poland which was the nucleus for the extensive kingdom. [...] In the mean time the movement proceeded likewise among the nobles of Great Poland; here the type was [[Lutheran]], instead of Reformed, as in Little Poland. Before the Reformation the Hussite refugees had found asylum here; now the Bohemian and Moravian brethren, soon to be known as the Unity of the Brethren (q.v.), were expelled from their home countries and, on their way to Prussia (1547), about 400 settled in [[Poznań|Posen]] under the protection of the Gorka, [[Leszynski]], and [[Ostrorog]] families."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuania]], [[France]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]],&lt;ref name="scots"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/prussia/part3-3.htm |title=Scots in Eastern and Western Prussia, Part III – Documents (3) |accessdate=2007-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kingdom of England|England]],&lt;ref name="Eastland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elbing.de/Eastland.pdf |title=Elbing |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730075606/http://www.elbing.de/Eastland.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Austria]] (see [[Salzburg Protestants]]) found refuge in Prussia during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and thereafter. Such immigration caused a slow decline in the use of Old Prussian, as the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] adopted the languages of their more recently arrived co-citizens, particularly [[German language|German]]. Baltic Old Prussian probably ceased to be spoken around the beginning of the 18th century due to many of its remaining speakers dying in the [[famine]]s and [[bubonic plague]] epidemics which harrowed the [[East Prussia]]n countryside and towns from 1709 until 1711.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070926162334/http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Engl.pdf Donelaitis Source, Lithuania] &lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic regional dialect of [[Low German]] spoken in Prussia (or [[East Prussia]]), called [[Low Prussian]] (cf. [[High Prussian]], also a Germanic language), preserved a number of Baltic Prussian words, such as ''{{lang|de|kurp}}'', from the Old Prussian ''{{lang|prg|kurpi}}'', for ''[[shoe]]'' in contrast to common Low German ''{{lang|nds|Schoh}}'' (standard German ''{{lang|de|Schuh}}'').

Until the 1930s, when the [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist]] government of Germany began a program of [[Germanisation]], and 1945, when the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and Poland annexed [[East Prussia]], one could find Old Prussian river- and place-names there, such as ''{{lang|prg|Tawe}}'' and ''{{lang|prg|Tawellningken}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haack |first1=Hermann |title=Stielers Hand-Atlas |date=1930 |publisher=Justus Perthes |page=Plate 9 |edition=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Prussian-language geographical names within the territory of (Baltic) Prussia. Georg Gerullis undertook the first basic study of these names in ''{{lang|de|Die altpreußischen Ortsnamen}}'' ("The Old Prussian Place-names"), written and published with the help of Walter de Gruyter, in 1922.
* Prussian personal names.&lt;ref name="Trautmann"&gt;Reinhold Trautmann, ''[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060220021331/http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Tr_APN.pdf Die altpreußischen Personennamen]'' (''The Old Prussian Personal-names'').

* Separate words found in various historical documents.
* Vernacularisms in the former German dialects of East and West Prussia, as well as words of Old Curonian origin in Latvian, and West-Baltic vernacularisms in Lithuanian and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]].
* The so-called Basel Epigram, the oldest written Prussian sentence (1369).&lt;ref name = "Basel"&gt;[http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/bpt.htm Basel Epigram]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schaeken.nl/lu/research/online/editions/baselepigram/ The Old Prussian Basel Epigram]&lt;/ref&gt; It reads: {{Verse translation |lang=prg

:This jocular inscription was most probably made by a Prussian student studying in [[Prague]] ([[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]]); found by Stephen McCluskey (1974) in manuscript MS F.V.2 (book of physics ''{{lang|la|Questiones super Meteororum}}'' by [[Nicholas Oresme]]), fol. 63r, stored in the [[Basel University]] library.
* Various fragmentary texts:&lt;br/&gt;Recorded in several versions by Hieronymus Maletius in [[Sudovian]] Nook in the middle of the 16th century, as noted by [[Vytautas Mažiulis]], are:
*# ''{{lang|prg|Beigeite beygeyte peckolle}}'' ("Run, run, devils!")
*# ''{{lang|prg|Kails naussen gnigethe}}'' ("Hello our friend!")
*# ''{{lang|prg|Kails poskails ains par antres}}'' – a drinking toast, reconstructed as ''{{lang|prg|Kaīls pas kaīls, aīns per āntran}}'' ("A healthy one after a healthy one, one after another!")
*# ''{{lang|prg|Kellewesze perioth, Kellewesze perioth}}'' ("A carter drives here, a carter drives here!")
*# ''{{lang|prg|Ocho moy myle schwante panicke}}'' – also recorded as ''{{lang|prg|O hoho Moi mile swente Pannike}}'', ''{{lang|prg|O ho hu Mey mile swenthe paniko}}'', ''{{lang|prg|O mues miles schwante Panick}}'' ("Oh my dear holy fire!")
* A manuscript fragment of the first words of the {{lang|la|[[Pater Noster]]}} in Prussian, from the beginning of the 15th century: ''{{lang|prg|Towe Nüsze kås esse andangonsün swyntins}}''.
* 100 words (in ''strongly'' varying versions) of the Vocabulary by a friar Simon Grunau, a historian of the [[Teutonic Knights]], written {{circa|1517–1526}} in his ''{{lang|de|Preussische Chronik}}''. Apart from those words Grunau also recorded an expression ''{{lang|prg|sta nossen rickie, nossen rickie}}'' ("This (is) our lord, our lord").
* The so-called Elbing Vocabulary, which consists of 802 thematically sorted words and their German equivalents. Peter Holcwesscher from [[Malbork|Marienburg]] copied the manuscript around 1400; the original dates from the beginning of the 14th or the end of the 13th century. It was found in 1825 by Fr Neumann among other manuscripts acquired by him from the heritage of the Elbing merchant A. Grübnau; it was thus dubbed the ''{{lang|la|Codex Neumannianus}}''.
* The three Catechisms&lt;ref name = "Catechisms"&gt;[http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Kat.pdf Prussian Catechisms].&lt;/ref&gt; printed in {{lang|de|[[Königsberg]]}} in 1545, 1545, and 1561 respectively. The first two consist of only 6 pages of text in Old Prussian – the second one being a correction of the first into another Old Prussian dialect. The third catechism, or ''Enchiridion'', consists of 132 pages of text, and is a translation of [[Luther's Small Catechism]] by a German cleric called Abel Will, with his Prussian assistant Paul Megott. Will himself knew little or no Old Prussian, and his Prussian interpreter was probably illiterate, but according to Will spoke Old Prussian quite well. The text itself is mainly a word-for-word translation, and Will phonetically recorded Megott's oral translation. Due to this fact, Enchiridion exhibits many irregularities, such as the lack of case agreement in phrases involving an [[article (linguistics)|article]] and a [[noun]], which followed word-for-word German originals as opposed to native Old Prussian syntax.
* Commonly thought of as Prussian, but probably actually [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (at least the adage, however, has been argued to be genuinely West Baltic, only an otherwise unattested dialect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=Eugen
|title=Die sigmatischen Modus-Bildungen der indogermanischen Sprachen.

&lt;/ref&gt;):
*# An adage of 1583, ''{{lang|prg|Dewes does dantes, Dewes does geitka}}'': the form ''{{lang|prg|does}}'' in the second instance corresponds to Lithuanian future tense ''{{lang|lt|duos}}'' ("will give")
*# ''{{lang|prg|Trencke, trencke!}}'' ("Strike! Strike!")

==Grammar==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
With other monuments being merely word lists, the grammar of Old Prussian is reconstructed chiefly on the basis of the three Catechisms. There is no consensus on the number of [[case (grammar)|cases]] that Old Prussian had, and at least four can be determined with certainty: nominative, genitive, accusative and dative, with different [[desinence]]s. There are traces of a [[vocative case]], such as in the phrase ''{{lang|prg|O Deiwe Rikijs}}'' "O God the Lord", reflecting the inherited [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] vocative ending *''{{PIE|-e}}''. There was a [[definite article]] (''{{lang|prg|stas}}'' m., ''{{lang|prg|sta}}'' f.); three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter, and two numbers: singular and plural. Declensional classes were ''{{lang|prg|a}}''-stems, ''{{lang|prg|ā}}''-stems (feminine), ''{{lang|prg|ē}}''-stems (feminine), ''{{lang|prg|i}}''-stems, ''{{lang|prg|u}}''-stems, ''{{lang|prg|ī}}''/''{{lang|prg|jā}}''-stems, ''{{lang|prg|jā}}''/''{{lang|prg|ijā}}''-stems and consonant-stems. Present, future and past tense are attested, as well as [[optative]] forms (imperative, permissive), infinitive, and four participles (active/passive present/past).

==Revived Old Prussian==
A few linguists and philologists are involved in [[language revival|reviving]] a reconstructed form of the language from Luther's catechisms, the Elbing Vocabulary, place names, and Prussian loanwords in the [[Low Prussian dialect]] of German. Several dozen people use the language in Lithuania, Kaliningrad, and Poland, including a few children who are natively bilingual. The Prusaspirā Society has published their translation of [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[The Little Prince]]''. The book was translated by Piotr Szatkowski (Pīteris Šātkis) and released in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.pl/en/article/little-prince-published-in-prussian "Little Prince Published in Prussian"], Culture.PL, 2015/02/17&lt;/ref&gt; The other efforts of Baltic Prussian societies include the development of online dictionaries, learning apps and games. There also have been several attempts to produce music with lyrics written in the revived Baltic Prussian language, most notably in the Kaliningrad Oblast by [[Romowe Rikoito]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ROMOWE RIKOITO - Undēina |publisher= Dangus |url= http://www.dangus.net/releases/albumai/043_RomoweRikoito.htm |accessdate= 29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Kellan and Āustras Laīwan, but also in Lithuania by [[Kūlgrinda (band)|Kūlgrinda]] in their 2005 album ''Prūsų Giesmės'' (Prussian Hymns),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Senoji prūsų kalba atgimsta naujausioje grupės KŪLGRINDA plokštelėje |publisher= Dangus |url= http://www.dangus.net/news/nauja418.htm |accessdate= 29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Latvia by Rasa Ensemble in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Power of Song: Nonviolent National Culture in the Baltic Singing Revolution|url=https://books.google.lv/books?id=_TfOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12|last=Smidchens|first=Guntis|publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|isbn=978-0-295-99310-2|year=2014|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Valdis Muktupāvels]] in his 2005 [[oratorio]] "Pārcēlātājs Pontifex" featuring several parts sung in Prussian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Oratorio |url= http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/oratorio.htm |accessdate= 29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important in this revival was [[Vytautas Mažiulis]], who died on 11 April 2009, and his pupil Letas Palmaitis, leader of the experiment and author of the website ''Prussian Reconstructions''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/index.htm Prussian Reconstructions]&lt;/ref&gt; Two late contributors were Prāncis Arellis ([[:lt:Pranciškus Erelis|Pranciškus Erelis]]), Lithuania, and Dailūns Russinis (Dailonis Rusiņš), Latvia. After them, Twankstas Glabbis from [[Kaliningrad oblast]] and Nērtiks Pamedīns from East-Prussia, now Polish [[Warmia-Mazuria]] actively joined.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''''On the Frontier: A Melodrama in Two Acts''''', by [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], was the third and last play in the Auden-Isherwood collaboration, first published in 1938. 

The play tells the story of the outbreak of war between the fictional European countries of Ostnia and Westland. Some of the action takes place in the "Ostnia-Westland Room", an imaginary setting in which two rooms, one in an Ostnian household, one in a Westland household, each occupy half the stage, and the family in one house are unaware of the family in the other - although the son and daughter of the two families sense each other's existence. Other scenes take place in the office of the Westland dictator. The play ends in a visionary scene between the two lovers who have never met in real life.

The play was produced in October 1938 at the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre]], in a production by the [[Group Theatre (London)]]. The [[incidental music]] for the play was composed by [[Benjamin Britten]].

The '''pantheism controversy''' ({{lang-de|Pantheismusstreit}}) was an event in German cultural history that lasted between 1785–1789 which had an effect throughout Europe.

==History==
A conversation between the German philosopher [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] and the German dramatist [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in 1780 led Jacobi to a protracted study of [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s works. Lessing had avowed that he knew no philosophy, in the true sense of that word, save [[Spinozism]].

Jacobi's ''Über die Lehre des Spinozas'' (1st ed. 1785, 2nd ed. 1789) expressed sharply and clearly his strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] group, led by [[Moses Mendelssohn]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure [[materialism]], because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]. Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and [[pantheism]]. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which [[Immanuel Kant]] rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to [[antinomy|antinomies]] in thought.

Jacobi was ridiculed for trying to reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was denounced as an enemy of reason, as a [[pietist]], and as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] in disguise, and was especially attacked for his use of the ambiguous term ''Glaube'' ([[German (language)|German]]: "belief, faith"). 

Willi Goetschel argues that Jacobi's publication significantly shaped the reception of Spinoza's doctrine for centuries following its publication, obscuring the nuance of Spinoza's philosophic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goetschel|first1=Willi|title=Spinoza's Modernity: Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine|date=2004|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=0299190803|pages=12-13|ref=Goetschel2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pantheism controversy is also notable for its development of and influence upon prominent philosophical terms in German culture, including the idea of [[nihilism]] and claims that [[God is dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 74 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobi's next important work, ''[[David Hume]] Über den Glauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus'' (1787), was an attempt to show not only that the term ''Glaube'' had been used by the most eminent writers to denote what he had employed it for in the ''Letters on Spinoza'', but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in the appendix, Jacobi came into contact with the [[critical philosophy]], and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching examination.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and [[deism]]. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
*the unity of all that exists;
*the regularity of all that happens; and
*the identity of spirit and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, &amp; Co.|location=Boston|page=147|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pizza''' is a savory [[Dish (food)|dish]] of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of [[Leavening agent|leavened]] wheat-based [[dough]] topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a  wood-fired oven.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|144843|id=144843}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--See also Italian Wikipedia https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza--&gt; In formal settings, like a restaurant, pizza is  eaten with knife and fork, but in casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten [[finger food|while held in the hand]]. Small pizzas are sometimes called [[pizzetta]]s.   

The term ''pizza'' was first recorded in the 10th century in a [[Latin]] manuscript from the [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] town of [[Gaeta]] in [[Lazio]], on the border with [[Campania]].&lt;ref name=MartinMaiden/&gt; Modern pizza was invented in [[Naples]], and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Hanna|title=American Pie|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/american-pie|publisher=American Heritage Magazine|accessdate=4 May 2012|date=April–May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is one of the most popular foods in the world and a common [[fast food]] item in Europe and North America, available at  [[List_of_pizza_chains|pizzeria]]s (restaurants specializing in pizza),  restaurants offering [[Mediterranean cuisine]], and via [[pizza delivery]].&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baofu 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last=Baofu | first=P. | title=The Future of Post-Human Culinary Art: Towards a New Theory of Ingredients and Techniques | publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publisher | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4438-4484-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7QwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA281 | page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies sell ready-baked [[Frozen food|frozen]] pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven. 

The ''Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana'' (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is  a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1984 with headquarters in [[Naples]] which aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.&lt;ref name=AVPN&gt;{{cite web|title=Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN)|url=http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/eng_chisiamo.php|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, upon Italy's request, [[Neapolitan pizza]] was registered with the [[European Union]] as a [[Traditional Speciality Guaranteed]] dish.&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the European Union, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:034:0007:0016:EN:PDF Commission regulation (EU) No 97/2010], 5 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Trademark Association, [http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/EUROPEANUNIONPIZZANAPOLETANAObtainsTraditionalSpecialityGuaranteedStatus.aspx European Union: Pizza napoletana obtains "Traditional Speciality Guaranteed" status], 1 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Pizza-3007395.jpg|thumb|Pizza with cheese and toppings, cut into slices]]
The word "pizza" ({{IPA-it|ˈpittsa|lang}}) first appeared in a Latin text from the [[Central Italy|central Italian]] town of [[Gaeta]], then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta ''duodecim pizze'' ("twelve pizzas") every [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], and another twelve every [[Easter Sunday]].&lt;ref name=MartinMaiden&gt;{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Maiden |website=yourDictionary.com |title=Linguistic Wonders Series: Pizza is a German(ic) Word |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/pizza.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030115224054/http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/pizza.html |archivedate=2003-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Salvatore Riciniello (1987) ''Codice Diplomatico Gaetano'', Vol. I, La Poligrafica&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested etymologies include:
*  [[Byzantine Greek]] and [[Late Latin]] ''pitta'' &gt; ''pizza,'' ''cf.'' Modern Greek [[pita|pitta]] bread and the Apulia and Calabrian (then [[Catepanate of Italy|Byzantine Italy]]) ''pitta,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Babiniotis |first=Georgios |date=2005 |title=Λεξικό της Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας |trans-title=[[Dictionary of Modern Greek]] |language=el |publisher=Lexicology Centre |isbn=960-86190-1-7 |page=1413}}&lt;/ref&gt; a round flat bread baked in the oven at high temperature sometimes with toppings. The word ''pitta'' can in turn be traced to either [[Ancient Greek]] πικτή (''pikte''), "fermented pastry", which in Latin became "picta", or Ancient Greek πίσσα (''pissa'', [[Attic dialect|Attic]] πίττα, ''pitta''), "pitch",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pizza |title=''Pizza'', at Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2383267 |title=''Pissa'', Liddell and Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''pḗtea'', "bran" (''pētítēs'', "bran bread").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=pizza&amp;r=66 |title=''Pizza'', at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[:it:Vocabolario etimologico della lingua italiana|Etymological Dictionary of the Italian Language]] explains it as coming from dialectal ''pinza'' "clamp", as in modern Italian ''pinze'' "pliers, pincers, tongs, forceps". Their origin is from [[Latin]] ''pinsere'' "to pound, stamp".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=pizza 'pizza'], ''Online Etymology Dictionary"&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]] word ''bizzo'' or ''pizzo'' meaning "mouthful" (related to the English words "bit" and "bite"), which was brought to Italy in the middle of the 6th century AD by the invading [[Lombards]].&lt;ref name=MartinMaiden /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garzantilinguistica.it/ricerca/?q=pizza|title=Pizza|work=Garzanti Linguistica|publisher=De Agostini Scuola Spa|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This is the origin favored by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] though the entry notes that it is unattested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Oxford English Dictionary: The definitive record of the English language |publisher=Oed.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Foods similar to pizza have been made since the [[neolithic age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-20/food/fo-1104_1_italian-pizza |title=A Stone-Age Snack :  History: Pizza topped with tomatoes, pepperoni and cheese is only 100 years old, if that.

P. Edwards (2007), p.199&lt;/ref&gt; An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the [[Aeneid]], when Celaeno, queen of the [[Harpies]], foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, [[Aeneas]] and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcc.dickinson.edu/eimmart-aeneas-and-trojans-fulfill-anchises-prophecy|title=Aeneas and Trojans fulfill Anchises' prophecy.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051513/http://dcc.dickinson.edu/eimmart-aeneas-and-trojans-fulfill-anchises-prophecy|archivedate=2017-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in [[Naples, Italy|Naples]] in the 18th or early 19th century.&lt;ref name=Helstosky21&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helstosky|first1=Carol|title=Pizza: A Global History|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion|location=London|isbn=1-86189-391-4|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, cheese, and basil. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims.&lt;ref name=Helstosky21 /&gt; Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries, and pizzerias keep this old tradition alive today. 

A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, ''[[pizza Margherita]]'', was invented in 1889, when the [[Palace of Capodimonte|Royal Palace of Capodimonte]] commissioned the Neapolitan [[wikt:pizzaiolo|pizzaiolo]] (pizza maker) [[Raffaele Esposito]] to create a pizza in honor of the visiting [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]]. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pizza Margherita: History and Recipe | url = http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy-featured/recipes/pizza-margherita-history-and-recipe | work = Italy Magazine | date = 14 March 2011 | accessdate = 23 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although recent research casts doubt on this legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Was margherita pizza really named after Italy's queen? | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/20515123 | work = BBC Food | date = 28 December 2012 | accessdate = 31 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An official letter of recognition from the Queen's "head of service" remains on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.se/books?isbn=0767932110|title=isbn:0767932110 - Sök på Google|website=books.google.se|language=sv-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizza is prepared fresh, [[Frozen food|frozen]], and as portion-size slices or pieces. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.

Another form of uncooked pizza is available from [[take and bake pizzeria]]s. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold to customers to bake in their own [[Conventional ovens|ovens]]. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to complete at home before baking in an oven.

===Cooking===
In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a [[conveyor belt]] oven or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood or coal-fired [[masonry oven|brick oven]]. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a [[peel (tool)|peel]], and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmI2YJ1vMxMC&amp;pg=PA3 | title=Make Great Pizza at Home | publisher=Taste of America Press | author=Owens, Martin J. | year=2003 | pages=3 | isbn=0-9744470-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When made at home, it can be baked on a [[pizza stone]] in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly in a metal oven results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chen |first1=Angus |title=Pizza Physics: Why Brick Ovens Bake The Perfect Italian-Style Pie |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/07/23/630544154/pizza-physics-why-brick-ovens-bake-the-perfect-italian-style-pie |accessdate=25 July 2018 |work=[[NPR]] |date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aficionado home-chefs sometimes use a specialty wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. Dome-shaped pizza ovens have been used for centuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.californo.co/collections/pizza-oven-kits/|title=pizza oven kits|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Californo|accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is one way to achieve true heat distribution in a wood-fired pizza oven. Another option is grilled pizza, in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. [[Greek pizza]], like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.

When it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With [[mass production]] of pizza, the process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables. Pizzerias nowadays can even opt for hi tech pizza preparation tables that combine mass production elements with traditional techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automated pizza preparation table|url=http://rotopizza.club/|publisher=rotopizza.club|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crust===
[[File:Hot pizza.jpg|thumb|A pizza just removed from an oven, with a close-up view of the ''cornicione'' (the outer edge)]]

The bottom of the pizza, called the 'crust', may vary widely according to style; thin as in a typical hand-tossed [[Neapolitan pizza]], or thick as in a deep-dish [[Chicago-style pizza|Chicago-style]]. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the ''cornicione''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braimbridge|first1=Sophie |last2=Glynn|first2=Joanne |title=Food of Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXUkqkBA-DkC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2005|publisher=Murdoch Books|isbn=978-1-74045-464-3|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pizza dough often contains sugar, both to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeAngelis|first=Dominick A.|title=The Art of Pizza Making: Trade Secrets and Recipes|date=December 1, 2011|publisher=The Creative Pizza Company|isbn=0-9632034-0-1|pages=20–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain [[Papa John's Pizza]] in 1984, and has since become popular when eating pizza, especially the crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shrikant|first1=Adit|title=How Dipping Sauce for Pizza Became Oddly Necessary|url=https://www.eater.com/2017/7/27/16021832/pizza-dipping-sauce-papa-johns-garlic-dominos-sauce|website=Eater|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheese===

[[Mozzarella]] is commonly used on pizza, with the highest quality [[buffalo mozzarella]] produced in the surroundings of Naples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/magazine/buffalo-mozzarella-craig-ramini.html?pagewanted=all|title=Go Ahead, Milk My Day|first=Sam|last=Anderson|publisher=NYTimes|date=October 11, 2012|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, other cheeses have been used as pizza ingredients (particularly Italian cheeses), including [[provolone]], [[Pecorino Romano|pecorino romano]], [[ricotta]], and [[scamorza]]. Less expensive [[processed cheese]]s or [[cheese analogue]]s have been developed for [[mass-market]] pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable [[shelf life]]. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of [[vegetable oil]], manufacturing and culture processes, [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] whey proteins and other changes in manufacture. In 1997 it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was {{convert|1|e6t|short ton|abbr=off}} in the U.S. and {{convert|100000|t|short ton|abbr=off}} in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Cheese Science |last=Fox |first=Patrick F.; () |year=2000 |publisher=Aspen Pub |location= |isbn=0-8342-1260-9 |page=482 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oRp5VCVTQQC&amp;pg=PA482&amp;dq=pizza+cheese |accessdate= |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular variant of pizza in Italy is [[Sicilian pizza]] (locally called ''sfincione'' or ''sfinciuni''),&lt;ref name="WiseGeek"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Sicilian Pizza?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-sicilian-pizza.htm|work=WiseGeek|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PyNb-aKOlqAC&amp;pg=PT55&amp;dq=Sfincione |title=Made In Sicily  | author = Giorgio Locatelli |publisher= |date=2012-12-26 |accessdate=2013-07-04|isbn=978-0-06-213038-9  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a thick-crust or deep-dish pizza originating during the 17th century in [[Sicily, Italy|Sicily]]: it is essentially a [[focaccia]] that is typically topped with tomato sauce and other ingredients.

=== Argentina ===
[[Argentina]], and more specifically [[Buenos Aires]], received a massive [[Immigration to Argentina|Italian inmigration]] at the turn of the 19th century. Immigrants from [[Naples]] and [[Genoa]] opened the first pizza bars, though over time Spanish residents came to own the majority of the pizza businesses. 

Standard [[Argentine]] pizza has a thicker crust, called "media masa" (half dough) than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese. Argentine gastronomy tradition, served pizza with [[fainá]], which is a Genovese chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza, and [[Moscato d'Asti|moscato wine]]. The most popular variety of pizza is called "muzarela" (mozzarella), similar to [[Neapolitan pizza]] (bread, tomato sauce and cheese), but made with a thicker "media masa" crust, triple cheese and tomato sauce, usually also with olives. It can be found in nearly every corner of the  country; [[Buenos Aires]] is considered the city with the most pizza bars by person of the world.&lt;ref name="TapasMagazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tapasmagazine.es/buenos-aires-la-ciudad-de-la-pizza/|work=Tapas Magazine|title=Buenos Aires: la ciudad de la pizza|author=Leire Gómez|date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular varieties include jam, tomato slices, red pepper and [[longaniza]]. Two Argentine born varieties of pizza with [[onion]], are also very popular: [[fugazza with cheesse]] and [[fugazzetta]]. The former one consists in a regular pizza crust topped with cheese and onions; the later has the cheese between two pizza crusts, with onions on top.&lt;ref name="Acuña-DeDónde"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2036460-la-historia-de-la-pizza-argentina-de-donde-salio-la-media-masa|work=La Nación|title=La historia de la pizza argentina: ¿de dónde salió la media masa?|author=Cecilia Acuña|date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/inventores-fugazza-queso_0_By1xAZUk0Yx.html|work=Clarín|title=Los inventores de la fugazza con queso|date=12 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common toppings for pizza in the United States include ground beef, mushrooms, onions, [[pepperoni]], pineapple, garlic, olives, peppers, carrots, tomatoes, spinach, anchovies, chicken, bacon, ham and sausage. Distinct regional types developed in the 20th century, including [[California-style pizza|California]], [[Chicago-style pizza|Chicago]], [[Greek pizza|Greek]], [[New Haven-style pizza|New Haven]], [[Detroit-style pizza|Detroit]], [[St. Louis-style pizza|St. Louis]], and [[New York-style pizza|New York]] styles.&lt;ref name="cuip.uchicago.edu"/&gt; The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York's Little Italy in 1905&lt;ref name="LonelyPlanet"&gt;{{cite book |title=New York City 7 |last=Otis |first=Ginger Adams |year=2010 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location= |isbn=1741795915 |page=256 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btN9Lh8v3OQC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=New+York-style+pizza&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mLG3UMq2LonVigKogoHADg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20York-style%20pizza&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then regions throughout the U.S. offer variations, including deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, [[Pizza Rolls|rolled]] and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.

Another variation is grilled pizza, created by taking a fairly thin, round (more typically, irregularly shaped) sheet of yeasted pizza dough, placing it directly over the fire of a grill and then turning it over once the bottom has baked and placing a thin layer of toppings on the baked side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What Can I Bring?

==Health issues==
Some [[mass-produced]] pizzas by [[fast food]] chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy balance of ingredients. Pizza can be high in [[salt]], fat and [[calories]] ([[food energy]]). The [[USDA]] reports an average sodium content of 5,101&amp;nbsp;mg per {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} pizza in fast food chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6802?qlookup=21299&amp;max=25&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;new=1 |title= Basic Report 21299 |publisher= National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference |date= 2014-09-28 |access-date= 2014-09-28 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141107033741/http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6802?qlookup=21299&amp;max=25&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;new=1 |archive-date= 2014-11-07 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are concerns about negative health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/science/surveillance/fsis2004branch/fsis5804 |title= Survey of pizzas |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=2004-07-08 |accessdate=2009-04-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228212200/http://www.food.gov.uk/science/surveillance/fsis2004branch/fsis5804 |archivedate=2005-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food chains have come under criticism at various times for the high salt content of some of their meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7050585.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Fast food salt levels "shocking" |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-10-18 |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6472">'''Project Re-ED''', the Project on the Re-Education of Emotionally Disturbed Children, is a program to provide effective and affordable mental health services for children. The program focuses on teaching a child effective ways of acting in and responding to the child’s social groups (family, schools, peer groups) and also working with those social groups to help them provide a more supportive environment for the child. It began as a pilot project in the 1960s at two residential facilities in Tennessee and North Carolina. It later expanded to more facilities, and the principles of treatment developed in the project have been replicated and adapted in many other programs. 

== History ==
The program was initiated by an 8-year grant awarded in 1961 by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] to the [[Peabody College|George Peabody College for Teachers]] (then a separate school, now part of [[Vanderbilt University]]) along with the states of Tennessee and North Carolina. [[Nicholas Hobbs]], a psychology professor and chair the Division of Human Development at Peabody College, was the project’s primary developer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Warren, S. (2007). Project Re-ED. In C. Reynolds et al.(Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of special education: A reference for the education of children, adolescents, and adults with disabilities and other exceptional individuals''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. Retrieved from http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileyse/project_re_ed/0&lt;/ref&gt; The two states each provided a small residential school – Cumberland House in Nashville, TN and Wright School in Durham, NC –  and at the end of the grant period the states assumed responsibility for continuing and funding the program.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lewis, W. W. (1971). Project Re-ED: The program and a preliminary evaluation. In H. C. Rickard (Ed.), ''Behavioral intervention in human problems''. Elmsford, NY: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a couple of decades, more than two dozen re-ed schools had been established, and many more facilities had applied principles developed in the re-ed program.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Habel, J. (1998). Precipitating myself into just manageable difficulties: Constructing an intellectual biography of Nicholas Hobbs. In DeMarrias, K. (Ed.), ''Inside stories: Qualitative research reflections''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was a response to a 1954 study from the [[Southern Regional Education Board]] and the National Institute of Mental Health which noted the lack of adequate services and facilities for emotionally disturbed children available at the time in the southeast United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The structure of the Re-ED program was inspired in large part by residential programs in post-World War II Scotland and France addressing mental health needs in children resulting from effects of the war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These programs were staffed largely by teachers who received primarily on-the-job practical training in psychological therapy. Following that model, Project Re-ED carefully selected effective, experienced teachers with demonstrated adaptability and creativity, and provided them with one year of graduate level practical and theoretical training in working with emotionally disturbed children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Philosophy == 
Development of the program was guided by [[social learning theory]] and ecological theory, and the program takes an educational rather than a therapeutic approach.

Following social learning theory, the program considers it important to focus on assisting children to learn new and more positive ways to interact with others in a social setting. 

Following ecological theory, the program emphasizes a holistic approach of addressing issues in the family, school, peer group, and other social settings of a child’s life together at the same time. This way, counsellors can see how troubling issues in each of these social settings influence each other, rather than addressing each setting in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Duchnowski, A. J. Kutash, K. &amp; Friedman, R. M. (2002). Community-based interventions in a system of care and outcomes framework. In B. J. Burns, &amp; K. Hoagwood (Eds). ''Community treatment for youth: Evidence-based interventions for severe emotional and behavioral disorders''. New York: Oxford University Press, pp.16-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach of the re-education method is to view emotionally disturbed children’s problems as symptoms resulting from problems in the child’s social settings. So, rather than seeing the goal as curing a child’s mental illness in long-term private, individual therapy, the program seeks to restructure a child’s environment and teach the child how to act more constructively and positively within that environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  

== Evaluation ==
Follow-up studies indicate that the program does effectively attain its goal of restoring and improving social operation of children and their environment in a relatively short amount of time  (with an average stay in the program of about 7 months) relative to similar children not in the program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study of the results in children ages 6-12 found a substantial reduction in problem behaviors among former students in the program, with greater gains associated with younger age and a longer stay in the program.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, E., Farmer, E. M. Z., Apperson, J., Mustillo, S., &amp; Simmers, D. (2006). Treatment and posttreatment effects of residential treatment using a re-education model. ''Behavioral Disorders'', 31(3), 312-322.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found positive results among adolescents in the program, including among students who had not done well in other programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, S. R., Murphy, J., Devaney, A., &amp; Hultman, T. (2000). Ecological outcomes of adolescents in a psychoeducational residential treatment facility. ''American Journal of Orthopsychiatry'', 70(4), 491-500. doi:10.1037/h0087807 &lt;/ref&gt; Both of these studies noted, however, the difficulty of determining what specific aspects of such a program influence which positive results. In general, the program is judged a viable and effective means of providing help to emotionally disturbed children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Rastra''' is a tradename for a particular [[insulating concrete form]] (ICF) used to make walls for buildings. It is one of the earliest such products, in production since 1972, and is composed of [[concrete]] and thastyron.  Thastyron is a mixture of plastic foam and binder that is composed of eighty-five percent recycled post consumer [[polystyrene]] waste that are molded into blocks.  The main components of rastra are cement, water and expanded polystyrene.

==Production==
Rastra is [[sustainable]] in its production because no energy is used in the curing process, and only one to three [[kilowatt hour]] (kWh) is required to make each block.  After the blocks are trimmed to exact size, the remaining debris is recycled to create new blocks. No byproducts are released in the production process that are considered a burden to the environment.&lt;ref name=rastra&gt;[http://www.rastra.com Rastra Insulated Concrete Form System (ICF) Construction Building Blocks For Houses &amp; Commercial Buildings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
Rastra blocks come in different sizes, and can be easily cut with woodworking tools to form the desired shape. These blocks are commonly attached together with clamps or glue to form a grid-like system. [[Rebar]] is then run through the grid, which is then filled with concrete.

==History==
Polystyrene concrete was invented in 1960.  [[BASF]], a German chemical conglomerate, originally created this product, but found no successful applications.  An Austrian-Swiss-based company modified the product and created what is known as Rastra.&lt;ref name=rastra /&gt;

==Fire rating==
As a thermal barrier, Rastra has a four-hour fire rating with no flame spread and no smoke development.  A five-hour fire endurance test of a ten-inch-thick wall with temperatures exceeding two thousand degrees Fahrenheit on the face of the wall showed that the wall did not conduct heat.  This lowers the number of health hazards during a fire and also makes building repairs easier afterwards.&lt;ref name=rastra/&gt;

==Physical properties==
Thastyron has a [[compressive]] strength of 56 [[pound-force per square inch]] (psi) and a [[tensile strength]] of 43 psi.  Rastra has a low toxicity level.  Rastra is highly frost, fungus, and mildew-resistant.  The sound insulation is greater than 50 [[decibel]](dB).&lt;ref name=rastra /&gt;

==Insulation==
As a heat insulation, rastra keeps a room at a constant temperature and evens out temperature changes, both of which can lower energy use.  It also has a low heat penetration depth.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3807">In mathematics and computer science, a '''rational series''' is a generalisation of the concept of [[formal power series]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] to the case when the basic algebraic structure is no longer a ring but a [[semiring]], and the [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s adjoined are not assumed to [[Commutative property|commute]].  They can be regarded as algebraic expressions of a [[formal language]] over a finite [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]].

==Definition==
Let ''R'' be a [[semiring]] and ''A'' a finite alphabet.

A ''noncommutative polynomial'' over ''A'' is a finite formal sum of words over ''A''.  They form a semiring &lt;math&gt;R\langle A \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''formal series'' is a ''R''-valued function ''c'', on the [[free monoid]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, which may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{w \in A^*} c(w) w \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The set of formal series is denoted &lt;math&gt;R\langle\langle A \rangle\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and becomes a semiring under the operations

:&lt;math&gt;c+d : w \mapsto c(w) + d(w) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c\cdot d : w \mapsto \sum_{uv = w} c(u) \cdot d(v) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

A non-commutative polynomial thus corresponds to a function ''c'' on ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of finite support.

In the case when ''R'' is a ring, then this is the ''Magnus ring'' over ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Helmut | last=Koch | title=Algebraic Number Theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1997 | isbn=3-540-63003-1 | zbl=0819.11044 | series=Encycl. Math. Sci. | volume=62 | edition=2nd printing of 1st | page=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''L'' is a language over ''A'', regarded as a subset of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; we can form the ''characteristic series'' of ''L'' as the formal series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{w \in L} w &lt;/math&gt;

corresponding to the [[Indicator function |characteristic function]] of ''L''.

In &lt;math&gt;R\langle\langle A \rangle\rangle&lt;/math&gt; one can define an operation of [[Kleene star|iteration]] expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; S^* = \sum_{n \ge 0} S^n &lt;/math&gt;

and formalised as

:&lt;math&gt;c^*(w) = \sum_{u_1 u_2 \cdots u_n = w} c(u_1)c(u_2) \cdots c(u_n) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The ''rational operations'' are the addition and multiplication of formal series, together with iteration.
A '''rational series''' is a formal series obtained by rational operations from &lt;math&gt;R\langle A \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Abax from Darius Vase.jpg|thumb|Abax depicted on the [[Darius Vase]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Michael R.|title=A history of computing technology|year=1998|publisher=IEEE Computer Soc.|location=Los Alamitos, Calif.|isbn=978-0-8186-7739-7|page=56|edition=2nd ed., 2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

A '''sand table''' uses constrained sand for modelling or educational purposes. The original version of a sand table may be the abax used by early Greek students. In the modern era, one common use for a sand table is to make terrain models for [[military plan]]ning and [[wargaming]].

==Abax==
An abax was a table covered with sand commonly used by students, particularly in Greece, to perform studies such as writing, geometry, and calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1958:177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

An abax was the predecessor to the [[abacus]]. Objects, such as stones, were added for counting and then columns for place-valued arithmetic. The demarcation between an abax and an abacus seems to be poorly defined in history;&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah 2000:125–126 and others&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, modern definitions of the word ''abacus'' universally describe it as a frame with rods and beads&lt;ref&gt;See American Heritage definition of "abacus" in External Links below&lt;/ref&gt; and, in general, do not include the definition of "sand table".

The sand table may well have been the predecessor to some [[board games]]. ("The word abax, or abacus, is used both for the reckoning-board with its counters and the play-board with its pieces, ...").&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1879:28&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abax'' is from the [[Old Greek#Evolution from Ancient to Modern Greek|old Greek]] for "sand table".&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage:abacus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghubar==
An Arabic word for sand (or dust) is ''ghubar'' (or ''gubar''), and Western numerals (the [[decimal]] digits 0&amp;ndash;9) are derived from the style of digits written on ''ghubar'' tables in North-West Africa and Iberia, also described as the 'West Arabic' or 'gubar' style.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J. J.,  and E. F. Robertson, ''The Arabic numeral system http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use==
[[File:Marine table2.gif|thumb|Marines view a sand table model  of the operating area of [[Exercise Desert Punch]] constructed on the desert floor near [[Yuma, Arizona]].]]
Sand tables have been used for [[military plan]]ning and [[wargaming]] for many years as a field expedient, [[Scale (map)|small-scale map]], and in [[Military training|training]] for [[Battle|military actions]]. In 1890 a Sand table room was built at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] for use in teaching cadets military tactics; this replaced the old sand table room in a pre-college building, in which the weight of the sand had damaged the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Preston `Canada`s RMC: A History of the Royal Military College` (University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sand tables increasingly fell out of favour with improved maps, aerial and satellite photography, and later, with digital terrain simulations. More modern sand tables have incorporated [[Augmented reality|Augmented Reality]], such as the [[Augmented Reality Sandtable (ARES)]] developed by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/yp5w8y/the-armys-new-projection-mapped-sandtable|title=Design Digital Terrain with the Army's Projection-Mapped Sandtable|last=Mufson|first=Beckett|date=November 5, 2014|work=Vice Creators|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, virtual and conventional sand tables are used in operations training.

In 1991, "Special Forces teams discovered an elaborate sand-table model of the Iraqi military plan for the defense of Kuwait City. Four huge red arrows from the sea pointed at the coastline of Kuwait City and the huge defensive effort positioned there. Small fences of concertina wire marked the shoreline and models of artillery pieces lined the shore area. Throughout the city were plastic models of other artillery and air defense positions, while thin, red-painted strips of board designated supply routes and main highways."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/timeline/022891.htm Arab Forces, Marines Take Kuwait City]'' – ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 28 February 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Google Earth]] users looking at satellite photography of China found a several ''kilometre'' large "sand table" scale model, strikingly reminiscent of a mountainous region ([[Aksai Chin]]) which China occupies militarily in a disputed zone with India, 2400&amp;nbsp;km from the model's location. Speculation has been rife that the terrain is used for military exercises of familiarisation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/chinese-xfile-excites-spotters/2006/07/20/1153166503699.html Chinese X-file excites spotters]'' – ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 20 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/from-sky-see-how-china-builds-model-of-indian-border-2400-km-away/9972/ From sky, see how China builds model of Indian border 2400 km away]'' – ''[[indianexpress.com]]'', 4 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded the Ashirward Prayer Centre as a venue for faith healing. Murdered rationalist [[Narendra Dabholkar]] had filed a police complaint against Sebastian and his associates for practicing [[alleged black magic]].&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/controversial-miracle-man-passes-away-in-vasai/story-7ffxk1zATKeY2xQaZSOKQM.html |title=Controversial ‘miracle man’ passes away in Vasai &amp;#124; mumbai news |publisher=Hindustan Times |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and police had closed down the prayer center for its alleged black magic activities.

Sebastian shot to fame after his videos of ‘healing patients’ went viral on YouTube and other social media platforms.&lt;ref name=q /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india.com/news/cities/healer-baba-dr-sebastian-martin-found-dead-at-his-vasai-residence-1413654/ |title=Healer Baba Dr Sebastian Martin found dead at his Vasai residence |publisher=India.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebastian, a severe diabetic patient, died on 17 August 2016 at Bhuigaon after a prolonged illness. Some critics wrote articles about him stating that if he could heal others, why couldn't he heal himself.

'''''Skylanders: SuperChargers''''' is a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[3D platformer|platformer]] video game developed by [[Vicarious Visions]] and [[Beenox]] and published by [[Activision]]. It was released on September 20, 2015 for [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[Wii U]], and was released on October 18, 2015 for [[iOS]]. '''''Skylanders: SuperChargers Racing''''' was released as a standalone title for [[Wii]] and the [[Nintendo 3DS]] on the same date, and it features only the racing portion developed by Beenox. The game is the fifth installment of the ''[[Skylanders]]'' series. It introduces vehicles for the first time in the series.

==Gameplay==
Similar to its predecessors, ''Skylanders: SuperChargers'' is a "toy-to-life" video game in which players can place toy figurine on the "Portal of Power", which allows players to play as the figurine-represented character in-game. The game introduces a redesigned "Portal of Power", in which the surface has become larger and wider so as to accommodate vehicles, which is of larger size than typical characters.&lt;ref name="GI gameplay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/06/03/21-things-you-need-to-know-about-skylanders-superchargers.aspx?|title=21 Things You Need To Know About Skylanders: SuperChargers|first=Andrew|last=Reinier|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 3, 2015|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles are one of the newly introduced features in ''SuperChargers''. According to Activision, about 50% of the game must be completed through driving. Vehicles are divided into three classes, which include land vehicles, sea vehicles and sky vehicles. With the use of ground vehicles and water vehicles, players can race on land or dive underwater on several different tracks, while the flying ship features an "autopilot system" which can guide players to their destination automatically. Players can have the option to accelerate and decelerate the ship.

Each track is filled with obstacles, which players must evade, and each has its own alternate routes, which can help a player to reach the finish line faster. Players must defeat a [[boss (gaming)|boss]] before they reach the finish line and they must solve a puzzle before they proceed.&lt;ref name="GS gameplay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-vehicles-change-skylanders-superchargers/1100-6427739/|title=How Vehicles Change Skylanders: SuperChargers|first=Zorine|last=Te|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 3, 2015|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can also collect parts for vehicles to upgrade it. A customization screen automatically opens up after the player collects a part. Player can also choose to purchase mods to upgrade the vehicle via an in-game currency called "Gearbits", which can be earned through completing missions and stages. Each character has their own matching vehicles, and once the player finds out the correct combination, the character will enter a "Supercharge" state, which grants the vehicle additional abilities.&lt;ref name="GS gameplay"/&gt; The 117 characters introduced in the series since ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'' will still be playable in ''SuperChargers'', but the game will only include 20 new figurines, due to the inclusion of vehicles. Returning characters, such as Stealth Elf and Trigger Happy are re-imagined with new abilities and a new upgrade tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/vehicles-make-a-major-difference-in-skylanders-superch-1708676754|title=Vehicles Make A Massive Difference In Skylanders: Superchargers|first=Mike|last=Fahey|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=June 3, 2015|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Nintendo]] versions of the game exclusively feature special guest appearances by [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] and [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] of the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' series fame, whom have Skylanders toy figures that can double as [[Amiibo]] figures for other games.

The game can also be played [[co-operative gameplay|cooperatively]] with another player. Only one vehicle can be used, with one player driving while the other one defends against threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Finder.com.au|url=http://www.finder.com.au/skylanders-superchargers|title=Will Skylanders: SuperChargers include a "Mario Kart" Mode?|date=2015-06-03|accessdate=June 3, 2015|first=Chris|last=Stead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skystones minigame return in a deeper more refined form. The traps collected in ''Skylanders: Trap Team'' will directly play into this, adding a unique Skystone to play. As per previous iterations, a Starter Pack including a portal will be available in shops, however, consumers will also be able to download the title at a cheaper price, and use their existing portal from ''Skylanders: Trap Team''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Grab It Magazine|url=http://www.grabitmagazine.com/blog/post/16-things-i-learned-about-skylanders-superchargers-from-my-demonstration/|title=16 Things I Learned About Skylanders: SuperChargers from My Demonstration|date=2015-06-03|accessdate=June 3, 2015|first=Chris|last=Stead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Characters===
{{Main article|List of Skylanders characters}}
''Skylanders: SuperChargers'' introduces twenty matching pairs of vehicles and Superchargers. There are numerous variant figures of Skylanders and vehicles. There are also trophies that allow the players to race as villains; these come in racing action packs. A Kaos trophy is included in the dark edition of the game's starter pack.

===Plot===
Kaos narrates his previously failed plans as he tells the Portal Masters that he has captured Master Eon, Flynn, Cali, and Hugo. Now that Kaos has control of the portals, he tells the players that they are getting cut off from Skylands forever. Hugo manages to get through to the Portal Masters stating that they must place a land vehicle on the portal so that they can get the Skylanders to Skylands. Once that is done, the Skylanders infiltrate a transport ship owned by Count Moneybone where they manage to free Hugo, Cali, and Flynn. Hugo tells them that there are other prisoners on the transport ship that need freeing too. Upon getting topside, Flynn, Cali, and Hugo see a contraption that is "eating the sky." Hugo's book glows as Master Eon's message states that he has been taken captive and that Kaos has used the Darkness to construct the Sky Eater. In order to combat it, a special team of Skylanders called the SuperChargers have been assembled to help combat the Sky Eater utilizing special rift engines that utilize the same technology as the portals.

At Motley Meadows, the Skylanders find that it is under the attack of the Sky Eater and they rescue the inhabitants. Back on the transport ship, they work to take out Count Moneybone's fighter ships that are targeting the escape pods that he had activated and asks the Portal Master to bring in help. Upon gaining control of the lead ship, they fall back to the Skylander Academy. Kaos learns from Glumshanks that some of the Trolls have been complaining about the Darkness getting bigger from the skies that it eats. Count Moneybone tells Kaos the status on Master Eon's confinement.

Hugo discovers that he has the sock of Master Eon. The Skylanders head to the Cloudscraper Mountains to seek out the Cloudbreather Dragon, who can track Master Eon to where he is being held with the scent of the sock. However, the forces of Kaos have seized the mountain and try to kidnap the Dragon. The Superchargers liberate the dragon just in time. The Cloudbreather Dragon tells them that Eon is currently trapped in the Land of The Undead. However, in order to get there, they must upgrade the Skylander's vehicles Rift Engines using the Thunderous Bolt from Cloud Kingdom. However, upon arrival, it seems that the place has been overtaken by Kaos, courtesy of Lord Stratosfear. He will not allow the Skylanders to take the bolt, so they must defeat him first. The Skylanders take down the transport ships invading the kingdom and attack Lord Stratosfear's Storm Generator. Upon Lord Stratosfear's defeat, all of the vehicles are upgraded by the Thunderous Bolt to travel to the Land of The Undead.

The Superchargers make it to the outskirts of the Detention Center and learn about the Perspective gates, which shifts gravity according to the position of the gate. Fighting their way though the prison and freeing as many prisoners as possible, Count Moneybone is defeated and Eon is freed. Kaos then learns of the defeat, but before he can act, the Darkness becomes sentient and proceeds to lead Kaos in the direction he needs.

Meanwhile, Master Eon tells the Superchargers that they need to defeat the threat of the Darkness by finding out how the Ancients defeated it the last time; however, the only records of this is in the Spell Punk Library, which only a Spell Punk can navigate. The Superchargers go to BattleBrawl Island in order to defeat SpellSlamzer, a Spell Punk. The Superchargers then head to the Spell Punk Library, where they learn that the Darkness was let into Skylands by "The Dark Rift Engine", a super powerful Rift Engine, and the Core of Light was developed as a weapon against the Darkness, but it was never completed. They decide to seek the author of a book, Pomfrey Le Fuzzbottom in hopes that he can tell them how to complete the Core of Light.

At the Sky Eater, Kaos is convinced by the Darkness to rule the universe, not just Skylands. Glumshanks tries to talk Kaos out of it, but the Darkness convinces Kaos to fire Glumshanks. Glumshanks, now jobless, leaves the Sky Eater and is taken to the Skylander Academy. Buzz is suspicious of Glumshanks, but agrees to give him a trial basis.

The Superchargers head to Gladfly Glades, where they meet a strange collector who promises to give them Fuzzbottom if they can reach him, while shrunk to microscopic size. The Superchargers get to Fuzzbottom, who tells them that the last part of the Core of Light is The Eye of the Ancients, which will turn it into a weapon against the Darkness. However, it is in possession of a Lobster Titan, and the only way to match the Titan's power is to use the Kolossal Kernel, which is in possession of their old enemy, Cluck, who has also started a fast food chain called Cap'n Cluck's King Size Chicken. However, this is a front for a chicken army, led by Cluck, and financed by the money he gets from selling his chicken, which he is growing with the Kolossal Kernel. The Superchargers defeat Cluck and take the Kolossal Kernel, which Mags then pops into popcorn. The Superchargers then use the Kolossal Kernel to grow to titan size and defeat the Lobster Titan, gaining the Eye of the Ancients.

Mags then completes the Core of Light, but Kaos has been warned by the Darkness that the Core of Light has been completed, and attacks the Skylander Academy, destroying the Core of Light for good. Glumshanks then sacrifices himself so that the Superchargers can escape. They escape, but they now have no weapon against the Darkness. Pandergast then announces the Ridepacolypse Demolition Derby, and the grand prize is Glumshanks. The Skylanders win the derby and get Glumshanks back.

Back at the Academy, Glumshanks proposes that the Superchargers use the Dark Rift Engine to send the Darkness back where it came from. Eon tells them that the Vault of the Ancients is the most likely place that the Dark Rift Engine could be. The Superchargers, Flynn, Tessa and Glumshanks head to the vault, where they meet a flower-like Watch Wraith named Pluck, who gives the Superchargers the ability to attract and repulse things (or "Push" and "Pull"). The Superchargers recover the Dark Rift Engine, but cannot use their "Push" or "Pull" powers outside of the Vault.

Once the Superchargers return, they are attacked by Sky Pirates who kidnap Mags. The Superchargers get on the Flying Bandit Train and fight Captain BlubberBeard, who wants Mags to make their train go faster. BlubberBeard is defeated and Mags finishes modifying the Dark Rift Engine to send the Darkness back to where it came from.

Meanwhile, Kaos is confronted by an imaginary Glumshanks, who is trying to stop him from destroying all of Skylands. Kaos begins to doubt that he is doing the right thing in destroying Skylands. He confronts the Darkness about this, but the Darkness threatens to take away his powers, so Kaos opens a Mega Rift to destroy all of Skylands.

The Superchargers, Flynn, Cali and Glumshanks then launch an all out attack on the Sky Eater and make it to Kaos's throne room, where Kaos attacks the Superchargers with the full Power of the Darkness, but he still loses. The Darkness then freezes everyone except for Kaos. Kaos then gets fed up with the Darkness telling him what to do and activates the Dark Rift Engine, and escapes with the Superchargers and their allies. The credits then roll.

Suddenly, the Darkness pulls the Rift back open and sucks in the credits. The Darkness then put the remains of the Sky Eater as armor and Eon tells the player that all of their training has led them to this battle, with the Darkness pulling the Superchargers into a void. The Superchargers defeat the Darkness and go back to the Academy, where Kaos tells them that just because the Darkness is gone does not mean that evil is still out there and joins the Academy as "the Ultimate Evil Consultant of Ultimate Evil" until he can find out how to get his powers back. Cali asks Buzz if that's a real job, and Buzz says that this is the best way to keep an eye on Kaos for the moment. Flynn then says that they need to do something awesome, which Cali, Buzz, Tessa, Mags, and Hugo all try saying their own versions of "Boom", but Flynn doesn't like them, Flynn finally suggests they all do it together. Everyone then says their own versions of "Boom!". Eon then narrates the player out, until Kaos interrupts him, taking over the closing narration. The credits roll (for real this time).

[[File:SpeakBirdSpeakAgain.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Speak, Bird, Speak Again'' Palestinian folktales]]
'''''Speak, Bird, Speak Again: A book of Palestinian folk tales''''' is a book first published in English in 1989 by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] authors [[Ibrahim Muhawi]] and professor of sociology and anthropology at [[Bir Zeit University]] [[Sharif Kanaana]].

After the original English book of 1989, a French version, published by [[UNESCO]], followed in 1997, and an Arabic one  in [[Lebanon]] in 2001.

The book contains a collection of 45 Palestinian folk tales drawn from a collection of two hundred tales narrated by women from different areas of historic Palestine (the [[Galilee]], the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza City|Gaza]]). The stories collected were chosen on the basis of their popularity, their aesthetic and narrative qualities, and what they tell about popular Palestinian culture dating back many centuries. The authors spent 30 years collecting the material for the book.

The English version of the book is studied as part of literature courses at both [[University of California at Berkeley]] and [[Chicago University]], and Kana'nah himself taught the study of the book in the masters programs at Bir Zeit University.

Some of the folk tales from ''Speak, Bird, Speak Again'' have been used in other collections/books:
*'''Margareth Read MacDonald''', Alik Arzoumanian (ill), (2006):  ''Tunjur! Tunjur! Tunjur! A Palestinian Folktale,'' {{ISBN|978-0-7614-5225-6}}, is based on the "Tunjur, Tunjur" story, first told by Fatme Abdel Qader, Arrabe, Galilee, for  ''Speak, Bird, Speak Again.''
*'''Sonia Nimr''' (Introduction by [[Ghada Karmi]]), (2007): ''Ghaddar the Ghoul and other Palestinian Stories,'' {{ISBN|978-1-84507-523-1}}, contains the story "Hasan and the Golden Feather", which is based on the story entitled "Bushel of Gold" (or "The Golden Pail") in   ''Speak, Bird, Speak Again.''

==Controversy==
{{seealso|Islamization of the Gaza Strip}}
In 2007 the [[Hamas]]-run [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) banned the book  and issued a directive to pull Professor Kanaana's book from school libraries and destroy it, however, the ban was later lifted. The book was misinterpreted, explained the author, "since it was not meant to be taught to children, as it is taught at the masters and doctorate level [in literature studies]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/artsentertainment/article/188337 Hamas school book ban sparks anger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/833519.html Hamas bans Palestinian folk tales book from schools]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6445465.stm Hamas reverse on schoolbook ban]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;ID=20077 Dr Kana'nah: Burning my book "Speak Bird, Speak Again" is like burning my son]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabamericannews.com/newsarticle.php?articleid=7857 Book ban turns intra-Palestinian fight cultural] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315144739/http://www.arabamericannews.com/newsarticle.php?articleid=7857 |date=2007-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palestinian novelist [[Zakariya Mohammed]] warned that Hamas' decision to ban the book, which is a collection of 45 folk tales, was "only the beginning" and he urged intellectuals to take action. He said: "If we don't stand up to the Islamists now, they won't stop confiscating books, songs and folklore".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/hamas-orders-book-of-palestinian-folk-tales-pulled-from-schools-439025.html Hamas orders book of Palestinian folk tales pulled from schools], Tuesday, 6 March 2007.

==Synopsis==
In a bustling office in [[Mumbai]], Kartik Krishnan ([[Kartik Krishnan]]) sits behind his desk coding [[HTML]] websites when he chances upon a blog on cinema featuring [[Independent filmmakers]]. This sparks his intentions to make his own [[short film]], thus leading him to contact Srinivas Sunderrajan ([[Vishwesh K]]), an independent filmmaker who had met Kartik's idol and famed director [[Quentin Tarantino]] at an international film festival, who in turn agrees to guide Kartik through the process.

As Kartik begins piecing the story, cast and screenplay together, several inexplicable phenomena start emerging in his life including a sinister stalker ([[D Santosh]]) dressed in official government clothing; and the sudden appearance of a strange future-telling antique toy.

Troubled with these bizarre developments and the unresolved feelings that he harbours for Swara Bhaskar ([[Swara Bhaskar]]), his colleague, Kartik embarks on an extraordinary journey that transcends love, life and logic itself.

==Cast==
* [[Kartik Krishnan]] as Kartik Krishnan
* [[Vishwesh K]] as Srinivas Sunderrajan
* [[Swara Bhaskar]] as Swara Bhaskar &amp; 'Maya'
* [[D Santosh]] as 'System'

==Production==
The film was shot on weekends over nearly a year since most of the actors had day jobs and they could only afford to spare the weekend. Also, since there were no location permits, the cast and crew used to sometimes end up without a location for a week, which meant the shoot had to be shifted to the next week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saiff.org/2010/index.php?p=behindthefilm&amp;id=1003 |title=India's First Mumblecore Filmmaker: An Interview with Srinivas Sunderrajan |author= Sousan Hammad|year=2010 |publisher=South Asian International Film Festival |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the cast were all good friends of Sunderrajan, they agreed to work for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloids/shot-circuit-142 |title= Shot circuit |date=31 December 2010 |work=Deccan Chronicle |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of the 'time stretch' happened because of location unavailability. And when the location was ready, the actors would be unavailable due to other commitments. True to [[guerrilla filmmaking]], many times the extras and the crowd in the frames did not even know that shooting was being done.

At any given point of time, only the director, the cinematographer and the lead actor, and depending on which location was being filmed - the secondary character was present on the sets. Mid-way through shooting the original script, the main location (the protagonist's house) collapsed. One day the building was there, and the next day the third floor caved in on the second. And so the location was cordoned off, even though 60 percent of shooting was still left to be done at that location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moifightclub.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/kartik-krishnan-fills-up-the-blanks-of-the-untitled-kartik-krishnan-project/ |title= Kartik Krishnan fills up the blanks of The Untitled Kartik Krishnan Project |author= Kartik Krishnan |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The script was outlined, yet completely improvised by the actors with the director often giving the actors a free hand. In keeping with its [[meta fiction]] genre, the film's characters were named after the actors who played them and many instances in the film have been based on real events which transpired between the cast and crew.

The initial edit was done on a borrowed [[MacBook|Macbook]] (in-between shooting days) and later the [[post production]], [[VFX]] &amp; [[Sound Design]] ([[Vijesh Rajan]]) of the film was done in a one-month time-span on a home computer so that it could be sent out within several film festivals' deadlines. After seeing an initial screening, director [[Anurag Kashyap]] helped to promote the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/I-make-movies-as-I-love-cinema-Anurag/articleshow/6090740.cms |title=I make movies as I love cinema: Anurag |author=Arpita Nath |date=26 June 2010 |work=Times of India|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As they respond to contemporaneous [[News|events]] and [[politics]], [[the arts]] take on political as well as social dimensions, becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;

A widespread observation is that a great [[skilled worker|talent]] has a free spirit. For instance [[Pushkin]], who some scholars regard as Russia's first great writer,&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"&gt;[[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1981) ''[[Lectures on Russian Literature]]'', lecture on ''Russian Writers, Censors, and Readers'', pp.13-4&lt;/ref&gt; attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he "instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants."&lt;ref name="Nab81Censors"/&gt;

==History of art and social and political change==
According to Groys, "[[Art]] has its own power in the world, and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics."&lt;ref name=Groys&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--deadlink&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;[[Cf.]] Silver 11, as qtd. in [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n2_v55/ai_18533947/pg_3 book rev.] by Graham: "Power attracts artists and in turn promotes the artists who succeed within that power structure."  Silver's "specific goal [is] … to present works of art with a greater depth of treatment and a more historical and contextual view of their audiences and cultures than most survey volumes", and Graham focuses particularly on the way that Silver "chose and organized his topics [in this textbook] to investigate relations between art and power."&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Pertaining to such politically-intractable phenomena as the [[List of conflicts in the Middle East#Modern conflicts|Modern conflicts]] in the Middle East, however, some artists and social critics believe that "art is useless as a tool for political change."&lt;ref name=Slackman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, nevertheless, examples where artists employ art in the service of political change.

== The role of poetry ==

{{Quote|text=Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.|sign=[[Percy B. Shelley|Percy Bysshe Shelley]]|source=''[[A Defence of Poetry]]''}}

The Italian poet [[Ungaretti]], when interviewed on transgression by director [[Pasolini]] for the 1964 ''[[Love Meetings]]'' documentary, said that the foundation of [[poetry]] is to transgress all laws: "I am a poet and as such I begin transgressing all the laws by doing poetry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pasolini]] (1964) ''[[Love Meetings]]'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EerTTC-YO8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Situationist International===
The [[Situationist International]] (SI), a small group of international political and artistic agitators with roots in [[Marxism]], [[Lettrism]] and the early 20th-century European artistic and political [[avant-garde]]s formed in 1957, aspired to major social and political transformations; before disbanding in 1972 and splitting into a number of different groups, including the Situationist Bauhaus, the Antinational, and the [[Second Situationist International]], the first SI became active in Europe through the 1960s and elsewhere throughout the world and was characterized by an [[anti-capitalist]] and [[surrealist]] perspective on [[aesthetics]] and politics, according to Italian art historian [[Francesco Poli]].&lt;ref name=Poli&gt;{{cite book|last=Poli|first=Francesco|others=Trans. F. Scarpelli and A. Andreacchio|title=I situazionisti e la loro storia|editor=Guy Debord and Gianfranco Sanguinetti|publisher=Manifestolibri|location=Rome|year=2006|pages=63|isbn=978-88-7285-438-9 |quote=caratterizzato da un'ideologia dell'estetico e del politico di matrice marxista e surrealista.|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of the situationists, Italian scholar Mirella Bandini observes, there is no separation between art and politics; the two confront each other in [[revolutionary]] terms .&lt;ref name=Bandini&gt;{{cite book|last=Bandini|first=Mirella|title=L'estetico, il politico. Da Cobra all'Internazionale situazionista 1948-1957|publisher=Costa &amp; Nolan|year=1999|pages=408|isbn=978-88-7648-344-8|language=Italian|quote=Per la prima volta dopo il surrealismo, arte e politica vengono affrontate insieme in termini rivoluzionari.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, revolutionary ideas have emerged first among artists and intellectuals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} That's why a precise mechanism to defuse the role of artists and intellectuals is to relegate them into specialized, compartmentalized disciplines, in order to impose unnatural [[dichotomies]] as the "separation of art from politics". Once artistic-intellectual works are separated from current events and from a comprehensive critique of society, they are sterilized and can be safely integrated into the [[official culture]] and the public discourse, where they can add new flavours to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of [[The Society of the Spectacle|the society of the spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Poster art===
"Not content with claiming [[Left-wing politics|leftwing]] music", posters for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the UK recycled iconic art styles of "[[Socialism|socialist]] revolution" to communicate its political message in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Entropa''===
Czech [[sculptor]] [[David Černý]]'s ''[[Entropa]]'', a sculpture commissioned to mark the Czech presidency of the [[European Council|European Union Council]] during the first semester of 2009, illustrates how art can come into conflict with politics, creating various kinds of controversy in the process, both intentionally and unintentionally.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entropa'' attracted controversy both for its [[stereotype]]d depictions of the various [[European Union|EU]] member states and for having been a creation of Černý and two friends rather than, as Černý purported, a collaboration of 27 artists from each of the member states.&lt;ref name="CTK"/&gt;  Some [[European Union|EU]] members states reacted negatively to the depiction of their country, with [[Bulgaria]], for instance, deciding to summon the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Ambassador to [[Sofia]] in order to discuss the illustration of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] country as a collection of [[squat toilet]]s (ČTK).  This "Europe-wide [[hoax]] … reveals deeper truths" not only about the countries but "about art itself" (Gavrilova).

===Russian aesthetics===
According to Esti Sheinberg, a lecturer in music at the [[University of Edinburgh]], in her book ''Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Shostakovich'', in "the traditional Russian perception of the arts", an "interrelationship between artistic technique and ideological content is the main aesthetic criterion" (ix; [[cf.]] Blois).

===Classical music===
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] did not use the original title "Ode to Freedom" of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s [[lyric poem|lyric]], known in English as "[[Ode to Joy]]" (1785), in setting it to music in the final movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (1824), which "[[Napoleon]]ic censors had forced the poet to change to 'Ode to Joy'."&lt;ref name=VanGelder&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], on 9 November 1989, that Christmas Day, when [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducted a performance of Beethoven's Ninth at the site of the former [[East Germany|East German]]&amp;ndash;[[West Germany|West German]] border in Berlin, a concert [[Public Broadcasting Service|telecast nationally]] in the United States, he substituted ''Freedom'' for ''Joy'' to reflect his own "personal message".&lt;ref&gt;

===Folk and protest music===

In February 1952, the [[United States Customs Service]] seized the passport of [[Paul Robeson]], preventing him from leaving the United States to travel to the Fourth Canadian Convention of the [[International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers]], in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada; but, after "The convention heard Robeson sing over the telephone", the union organized "a concert on the US-Canada border".&lt;ref name="Robeson"&gt;

|accessdate=2009-07-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the account of the "Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration": "Robeson sang and spoke for 45 minutes. He introduced his first song stating 'I stand here today under great stress because I dare, as do you—all of you, to fight for peace and for a decent life for all men, women and children' … [and, accompanied by Lawrence Brown on piano,] proceeded to sing spirituals, folk songs, labour songs, and a passionate version of [[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]], written for him in the [1920s], slowly enunciating 'show a little grit and you land in jail', underlining the fact that his government had turned the entire country into a prison for Robeson and many others."&lt;ref name="Robeson"/&gt;

In the 1960s the songs of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], and others protested further [[racism]], war, and the [[military-industrial complex]], continuing an American artistic tradition of political protest founded during its [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial era]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Restrictions on live-music venues===
====In the United States====
In force from July 1985 until May 2002 and considered by its opponents a [[Draco (lawgiver)#"Draconian"|Draconian]] "anti-music law", the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] (TDO), imposing restrictions on clubs admitting those under the legal drinking age of 21 in [[Seattle]], Washington, was still the subject of protracted political and legal opposition in [[United States Federal Courts|U.S. Federal Court]] in early 2002, when a suit filed by the Joint Artists and Music Promotions Action Committee (JAMPAC) in 2000 was still being adjudicated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2002, Judge Lasnik ruled for the City of Seattle on JAMPAC's suit, finding no Constitutional infringement of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and deciding that the matter is a political one for the [[Seattle City Council]] to decide, not the courts; during the course of the suit, Mayor Schell's successor, [[Greg Nickels]], a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Seattle City Council, and, on 12 August 2002, the new All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) replaced the TDO,&lt;ref&gt;

In May 2008 a "Promoters Ordinance" proposed by the [[Chicago City Council]] aroused opposition in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], for being regarded as overly restrictive and stifling [[Freedom of speech|free expression]].&lt;ref&gt;

====In the United Kingdom====
{{See|Licensing Act 2003#Impact on live music}}
Following the implementation of the [[Licensing Act 2003]], the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] cited "the interest of public order and the prevention of terrorism" as reasons for expecting promoters of [[live music]] events to complete the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]'s [[Form 696]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the perceived "demand" for the information solicited on such "[[risk assessment]]" forms motivated [[Jon McClure]], lead singer with [[Reverend and The Makers]], to post an [[Internet petition|electronic petition]] in the "E-Petitions" section of the official website of [[Gordon Brown]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]], at  Number10.gov.uk, in order to facilitate protest against what McClure alleges is "[[Racism|racial discrimination]]" occasioned by such bureaucratic constraints,&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins: "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to Scrap the unnecessary and draconian usage of the 696 Form from London music events".&lt;ref name="McClure"/&gt;  By 11 November 2008, according to Orlowski, "A dozen London boroughs [had] implemented a '[[risk assessment]]' [Form 696] policy for live music that permits the [[Metropolitan Police Service|police]] to ban any live music if they fail to receive personal details from the performers 14 days in advance."&lt;ref name="Orlowski"/&gt;  Orlowski points out: &lt;blockquote&gt;The demand explicitly singles out performances and musical styles favoured by the black community: [[Garage rock|garage]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], and [[Master of ceremonies|MCs]] and [[Disc jockey|DJs]]. ... However all musical performances – from one man playing a guitar on up – are subject to the demands once implemented by the council. And the threat is serious: failure to comply 'may jeopardise future events by the promoter or the venue'. ... UK Music chief [[Feargal Sharkey]] ... speaking to the [[Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee|Department of Culture Media and Sport]]'s hearing on venue licensing today [11 Nov. 2008] [concluded that] ... 'Live music is now a threat to the prevention of [[terrorism]]'. ... In response, Detective Superintendent Dave Eyles from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Met]]'s clubs and vice office told us that 10,000 such [[Risk Assessment]]s would be processed this year. He said they weren't [[Wiktionary:compulsory|compulsory]]: ... 'We can't demand it – we recommend that you provide it as best practice. But you're bloody silly if you don't, because you're putting your venue at risk.'&lt;ref name="Orlowski"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  By early March 2009, over 16,000 British citizens or residents had signed McClure's E-Petition, which remained open to potential signatories until 1 December 2009.&lt;ref name="McClure"/&gt;

'''Torchy Blane''' is a fictional female reporter starring in a series of films in the 1930s. [[Warner Bros.]] produced nine films between 1937 and 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystery Movie Series of 1930s Hollywood – Torchy Blane: The Investigative Reporter|first=Ron|last=Backer|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786469757|page=258|date=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torchy Blane series were popular [[B movie|second features]] during the later 1930s and were mixtures of mystery, action, adventure, and fun. 

==Character==
During the pre-[[World War II]] period, newspaper reporter was one of the few roles in American cinema that portrayed women positively, as intelligent, competent, self-reliant, and career-oriented&amp;mdash;virtually equal to men. Of these role models, Torchy Blane, a beautiful, headline-hunting, wisecracking female reporter was perhaps the best known. The typical plot of movies featuring the character have the resilient, fast-talking Torchy solving a crime (the central element of the film's plot) before her less-than-perceptive boyfriend, loud-mouthed police detective Steve McBride, can.

==Development==
In 1936, [[Warner Bros.]] began to develop an adaptation of the ''MacBride and Kennedy'' stories by detective novelist Frederick Nebel. For the film version, Kennedy is changed to a woman named Teresa "Torchy" Blane and is now in love with MacBride's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/smart-blonde-v110648|title=Smart Blonde (1936)|publisher=All Movie|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torchy was loosely based on Kennedy. She was also more compatible with the [[Hays code]] than a faithful on-screen adaptation of Kennedy would have been. 

The first film was based on Nebel's ''Macbride and Kennedy'' story "No Hard Feelings." The story was later adapted again as the 1941 film ''[[A Shot in the Dark (1941 film)|A Shot in the Dark]]''. Director [[Frank McDonald (director)|Frank MacDonald]] immediately knew who he wanted for the role of Torchy Blane. [[Glenda Farrell]] had already played hard-boiled reporters in earlier [[Warner Bros.]] films, ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933) and ''[[Hi, Nellie!]]'' (1934), she was quickly cast in the first Torchy Blane movie, ''[[Smart Blonde]]'', with [[Barton MacLane]] playing detective Steve McBride. Farrell and MacLane would co-star in seven of the nine Torchy Blane films by Warner Bros. ''Smart Blonde'' were released on January 2, 1937, the film was a surprise hit, and Warner Bros. made eight more movies from 1937 to 1939. 

In the fifth Torchy Blane film, ''Torchy Blane in Panama'' (1938), Warner Bros. replaced Farrell and MacLane (a pairing that was loved by the moviegoing public) with [[Lola Lane]] and [[Paul Kelly (actor)|Paul Kelly]] as Torchy and Steve. Negative fan reaction led Warner Bros. to recast Farrell and MacLane in the leading roles. They starred in three more Torchy Blane films. In 1939, Farrell left the studio, and Warner Bros. recast the roles with [[Jane Wyman]] and [[Allen Jenkins]]. The public again reacted negatively to the new casting. ''Torchy Blane... Playing with Dynamite'' (1939) would be the final film in the series. A leftover Torchy Blane script was adapted into the 1939 film ''[[Private Detective (film)|Private Detective]]'', also starring Jane Wyman. The only actor appearing in all nine Torchy Blane films was [[Tom Kennedy (American actor)|Tom Kennedy]] as Gahagan, McBride's slow-witted cop sidekick given to bursts of poetry.

==Portrayals==
In seven of the nine films featuring the character, Torchy Blane was played by [[Glenda Farrell]]. In her role as Torchy, Farrell was promoted as being able to speak 400 words in 40 seconds. On her portrayal of the character, Farrell said in her 1969 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' interview: "So before I undertook to do the first Torchy, I determined to create a real human being&amp;mdash;and not an exaggerated comedy type. I met those [news-women] who visited Hollywood and watched them work on visits to New York City. They were generally young, intelligent, refined and attractive. By making Torchy true to life, I tried to create a character practically unique in movies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Women of Warner Brothers: The Lives and Careers of 15 Leading Ladies, with Filmographies for Each|first=Daniel|last=Bubbeo|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=0786411376|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[Superman]] co-creator [[Jerry Siegel]] credited Glenda Farrell's portrayal of Torchy Blane as the inspiration for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' reporter [[Lois Lane]] and the name of actress Lola Lane as his inspiration for Lois' name.&lt;ref&gt;Letters to the Editor, ''Time'' magazine (May 30, 1988), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joanne Siegel]], Siegel's wife and the original model for Lois Lane, also cited Farrell's portrayal of Torchy as Siegel's inspiration for Lois.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: The Complete History, the Life and Times of the Man of Steel'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7842">[[File:FrançoisBoucher,TriumphOfVenus(1740)detail.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Carl Michael Bellman]] sang of Ulla Winblad in ''[[Epistles of Fredman|Fredman's Epistle]]'' 25, which seems to depict a [[Rococo]] scene like [[François Boucher]]'s 1740 ''Birth of Venus'', which then hung in [[Drottningholm Palace]], near [[Stockholm]]]]

'''Ulla Winblad''' was a semi-fictional [[Fictional character|character]] in many of [[Carl Michael Bellman]]'s works. She is at once an idealised [[rococo]] goddess and a tavern prostitute, and a key figure in Bellman's songs of ''[[Fredmans epistlar|Fredman's Epistles]]''. The character was partly inspired by [[Maria Kristina Kiellström]] (1744-1798).

== A dual character ==
[[File:"Ulla Winblad kära syster. Du är eldig, qvick och yster...". Fredmans Epistel 3.jpg|thumb|Illustration for "Ulla Winblad kära syster. Du är eldig, qvick och yster...". [[Fredman's Epistle]] No. 3, by Carl Wahlbom (1810-1858)]]

[[Paul Britten Austin]] summarizes Ulla Winblad's dual nature: 
: "''Ulla'' is at once a nymph of the taverns and a goddess of a rococo universe of graceful and hot imaginings".&lt;ref name=BA67&gt;Britten Austin, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}

''[[Epistles of Fredman|Fredman's Epistles]]'' are distinctive in combining realism - drink, poverty, gambling, prostitution, old age - with elegant mythological rococo flourishes, enabling Bellman to achieve both comic and elegiac effects. Britten Austin cites Afzelius:&lt;ref name=BA67/&gt;{{rp|81–82}}

{{quote|Several of the most personal poems are staged with a heavy overlay of classical mythology ... It is as if a curtain with a whole rococo world of gods and goddesses on rosy clouds ... were suddenly raised, revealing a tavern-interior with shaky chairs, spilled and shattered glasses, staggering clients and sluttish barmaids [N. Afzelius).]}}

The sluttiest of the barmaids "on the rosiest mythological clouds" is of course Ulla Winblad. In Epistle 36, (''Concerning Ulla Winblad's flight''), Bellman "at his most rococo" describes Ulla asleep in a tavern bedroom - while the owner peeps through the keyhole and three excited drunks wait outside. As she wakes, three rococo cupids assist her with make-up, perfume, and her hair. Then she runs into the bar, revives herself with a glass of brandy, and leaves with the blindest of the waiting fellows, "leaving the inmates of the tavern, shaken, to contemplate ''Ulla's'' glass where she has left it, empty and broken on the bar."&lt;ref name=BA67/&gt;{{rp|82–83}}

== ''Ulla'' and the real Maria Kristina Kiellström ==
[[File:The steps on Skeppsbro etching by Elias Martin detail.jpg|thumb|350px|Detail from etching "The steps on Skeppsbro" depicting a scene in [[Stockholm]]'s harbour by [[Elias Martin]], 1800. The central figure is popularly supposed to represent Ulla Winblad.]]

The fictional Ulla Winblad and the real [[Maria Kristina Kiellström]] have frequently been confused, but were not at all the same.&lt;ref&gt;Kleveland, 1984. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Kiellström, born in 1744 in a poor family, did borrow her stepmother's surname, Winblad (the name means ''vine-leaf''). About 1763, she found a job in a silk factory. At the age of about twenty Kiellström became notorious for being made pregnant by a Swedish nobleman, Count Wilhelm Schildt. And in 1767, while without regular employment, she was accused of wearing a red silk cape, a banned luxury item: but unlike Ulla, she was acquitted. By 1770, Kiellström had moved out of the town centre; she and another girl, whose name was Ulla, were both officially recorded as being suspected by their landlord of "loose living".&lt;ref name=BA67/&gt;{{rp|84–85}}

Bellman met Kiellström in about 1769. Soon afterwards, he sang of Ulla Winblad for the first time in Fredman's Epistle number 25, entitled ''Which is an attempt at a pastoral in Bacchanalian taste, written on Ulla Winblad's crossing to Djurgården''.&lt;ref name=BA67/&gt;{{rp|86}} It begins with [[rococo]] "angels, dolphins, zephyrs and the whole might of Paphos (compare the illustration of Boucher's ''Birth of Venus'') and musical flourishes on the horn ("Corno") and ends with Ulla as "my nymph" and the sentiment "May love come into our lives".&lt;ref&gt;Bellman, 1790. Epistle 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellman worked up the silk cape incident into the beautiful rococo Epistle 28, where Fredman sees a "goddess", elegantly dressed, with illegally flounced and frilled petticoats.&lt;ref name=BA67/&gt;{{rp|86}}

Kiellström married a customs officer, Eric Nordström, in 1772: Bellman found him his job. The couple lived very close to Bellman, and ''Norström'' too appears in the Epistles; a "quarrelsome violent man" and a drinker, he died in a police cell. Kiellström was still attractive enough to remarry at the age of 42; her second husband, 11 years younger than her, complained that she was "generally and in printed songs known for passionate living."&lt;ref name=BA67/&gt;{{rp|89}}

== The mythic ''Ulla'' ==
[[File:Fredmans Epistel 71 music start.jpg|thumb|350px|The start of Fredman's Epistle no 71, ''[[Ulla, min Ulla, säj, får jag dig bjuda|Ulla, my Ulla, say may I offer you reddest strawberries in milk and wine...]]'']]

Fredman's Epistle 71, "the apogee, perhaps, of all that is typically ''bellmansk''" evokes the Swedish countryside at Djurgården in summertime, as Bellman imagines riding out of town and finding Ulla at her window.&lt;ref name=BA67/&gt;{{rp|155}} The song is called a Pastorale, and titled "To Ulla at her window, Fisherman's Cottage, lunchtime, one summer's day". It begins&lt;ref&gt;Bellman, 1790. Epistle 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Fredmans_epistel_n:o_71 Swedish Wikisource: Fredmans epistel n:o 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''[[Ulla, min Ulla, säj, får jag dig bjuda]]
:rödaste smultron i mjölk och vin,...''

:Ulla, my Ulla, say may I offer you

The '''Wiener Werkstätte''' (engl.: ''Vienna Workshop''), established in 1903 by [[Koloman Moser]] and [[Josef Hoffmann]], was a production community of visual artists in [[Vienna, Austria]] bringing together architects, artists and designers working in ceramics, fashion, silver, furniture and the graphic arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vienna Secession: a History|url=http://www.theviennasecession.com/a-history/|website=theviennasecession.com|accessdate=29 September 2016|date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as a pioneer of [[Modernism|modern]] design, and its influence can be seen in later styles such as [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design: From William Morris to Walter Gropius'', Yale University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War I]], the workshop was beset by financial troubles and material shortages. Attempts to expand the workshop's base were unsuccessful, and ultimately it was forced to close in 1932.

==Origins==
The enterprise evolved from the [[Vienna Secession]], founded in 1897 as a progressive alliance of artists and designers. From the start, the Secession had placed special emphasis on the applied arts, and its 1900 exhibition surveying the work of contemporary European design workshops prompted the young architect Josef Hoffmann and his artist friend Koloman Moser to consider establishing a similar enterprise.
	
Finally in 1903, with backing from the industrialist Fritz Wärndorfer, the Wiener Werkstätte began operations in three small rooms; it soon expanded to fill a three-story building with separate, specially designed facilities for metalwork, leatherwork, bookbinding, woodworking and a paint shop. The range of product lines also included; leather goods, enamel, jewellery, postcards and ceramics. The Wiener Werkstätte even had a millinery department.

==Style==
Beginning with the 14th Exhibition of the [[Vienna Sezession]] in 1902, the radical distinctiveness of certain Viennese artists began to emerge, setting a foundation for the widespread [[Modernism|Modernist]] movement; this became known as '''Wiener-Werkstätte-Stil''' (literally, the Vienna Workshops Style). Among the innovators was the Viennese architect [[Josef Hoffmann]]. His [[Cubism|cubist]] sculpture created in 1902 marked a break into independence for many Viennese artists. His works from this period are especially remarkable when one considers that the term "cubism" only found its way into the art lexicon around 1907 to describe the work of [[Pablo Picasso]].

==Production==
Most of the objects produced in the Wiener Werkstatte were stamped with a number of different marks: the trademark of the Wiener Werkstatte, the monogram of the designer and that of the craftsman, who created it. The Wiener Werkstatte had about 100 employees in 1905, of whom 37 were masters of their trade.

The seat of the venture was in Neustiftgasse 32–34, where a new building was adapted to their requirements. Eventually the project  exhausted Wärndorfer's fortune. The circle of customers of the Wiener Werkstatte and Josef Hoffmann mainly consisted of artists and Jewish upper middle class supporters of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Several branches of the workshop were opened in Karlsbad 1909, Marienbad, Zürich 1916/17, New York 1922, Berlin 1929. 
	
In architectural commissions such as the [[Sanatorium Purkersdorf]] and the [[Palais Stoclet]] in Brussels, the Wiener Werkstätte was able to realize its ideal of the Gesamtkunstwerk (total artwork), a coordinated environment in which everything down to the last detail was consciously designed as an integral part of the whole project.

For several years, beginning in 1904, the Wiener Werkstätte had its own carpentry workshop. Josef Hoffmann designed a furniture line noted for its simple forms for the firm of Jacob &amp; Josef Kohn. But only few pieces of furniture were made there. Most of the furniture known as Wiener Werkstätte Furniture were made by cabinet-makers as: Portois &amp; Fix, Johann Soulek, Anton Herrgesell, Anton Pospisil, Friedrich Otto Schmidt and Johann Niedermoser. Some historians now believe that there are no existing original products of the Wiener Werkstätte Furniture division.	

From 1905, the Wiener Werkstatte produced handpainted and printed silks. The Backhausen firm was responsible for the machine-printed and woven textiles. In 1907, the Wiener Werkstätte took over distribution for the Wiener Keramik, a ceramics workshop  headed by [[Michael Powolny]] and [[Berthold Löffler]]. And in the same year Moser, embittered by the financial squabbling, left the Wiener Werkstätte, which subsequently entered a new phase, both stylistically and economically.

==Expansion==

The founding of textile and fashion divisions in 1909 and 1910 brought a further shift in the Wiener Werkstätte's emphasis—away from the architectural and toward the ephemeral. After a close brush with bankruptcy in 1913, Wärndorfer left to America and the following year Otto Primavesi, a banker from Moravia, took over as chief financier and patron.

During and immediately following the First World War the Wiener Werkstatte was influenced by a new generation of artists and craftsmen. It was Dagobert Peche whose ornamental, almost baroque fancies exerted the most palpable influence.  
After the war, material shortages encouraged experimentation with less durable, less expensive materials such as wood, ceramics and papier-mâché. One of the ceramics contributors was [[Walter Bosse]].&lt;ref&gt;Schreyer-Hartmann, Cherica,  and Hans-Hagen and Johanna Hottenroth.  ''Walter Bosse Leben Kunstund Handwerk 1904–1979''.  Vienna:  Verlag Christian Brandstätter, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The original, grand Gesamtkunstwerk vision became diluted and submerged by the Kunstgewerbliches—the artsy-craftsy.

At the beginning of the 1920s, Philipp Hausler attempted to eliminate the "bad habits" and "extravagances" which devoured so much money by broadening the workshop's base. The WW artists, however, insisted upon their accustomed exclusivity, and Hausler left in 1925."&lt;ref name=MAK&gt;Vienna Museum of Applied Arts&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to expand the workshop's scope—adding such items as wallpaper to its limited program of industrial licenses, and establishing branches in Berlin, New York and Zurich—were not particularly successful. The Werkstätte's financial situation grew desperate due to the effects of the war and the onset of the worldwide Depression in 1929. In the 1932 it was compelled to declare bankruptcy and closed.&lt;ref name=MAK/&gt;

==Legacy==
With its avant-garde, artistic, yet timeless designs, the Wiener-Werkstaette-Stil influenced generations of architects and designers in the 20th century. The [[Bauhaus]] in Germany, [[Art Deco]] in America from 1920 to 1940, Scandinavian design from 1940-1960 (see for example [[Arne Jacobsen]]), as well as Italian design (see [[Mario Bellini]]) between 1960 and 1980, were all strongly influenced by the Wiener Werkstätte.

A work representative is the [[Stoclet Palace]] in Brussels, which is considered a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' of the company.

The chocolate company [[Altmann &amp; Kühne]] uses many of the designs of the company for its chocolate boxes, as does [[Demel]].
