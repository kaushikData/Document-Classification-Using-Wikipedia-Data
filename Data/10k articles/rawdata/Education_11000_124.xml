      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5266">'''Aaron McMillan''' (11 February 1977{{spaced ndash}}14 May 2007) was an [[Australia]]n classical [[pianist]].

He attended Glenaeon [[Rudolf Steiner]] School in [[Middle Cove, New South Wales|Middle Cove]], [[Sydney]] where his first piano teacher was Coral Patterson who still teaches there. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Aaron was also a keen basketballer.  At age 15 he captained his local basketball team to a state championship and was named most valuable player.  Aaron was hoping to gain selection in the national basketball team at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]].  After an injury during training forced his departure from the sport, he then moved to his next passion, music.  He continued piano studies with [[Neta Maughan]], the teacher of [[Michael Kieran Harvey]], [[Simon Tedeschi]], and her own daughter [[Tamara Anna Cislowska]].  At age 16 he was the youngest Australian pianist to gain a Licentiate Diploma of Music with distinction. He took part in the 1996 [[Sydney International Piano Competition]].

In addition to performing, he became an entrepreneur.  He organised and financed many of his own concerts and recordings, but also set up a company called "Wayfarer" to promote other musicians.  He organised a concert at the Sydney Town Hall where 20 Australian composers performed their own works - these included [[Dulcie Holland]], [[Miriam Hyde]] and [[Elena Kats-Chernin]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

As an adult his other love was [[cricket]].  He coached other players and through the game he met [[Gavin Robertson]] and [[Steve Waugh]], and [[Tim Farriss]] from [[INXS]], who all became his friends.

In 2001, McMillan was diagnosed with [[hemangiopericytoma]], a rare [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]].  It was discovered while he was being photographed for the cover of an album. A small pimple on his eyelid prompted him to see a doctor, who diagnosed the condition.  He was operated on by [[Charles Teo|Charlie Teo]] and the tumor was successfully removed.  The first of two ''[[Australian Story]]'' programs on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC television]], entitled ''Playing for Time'', followed his surgery at [[Sydney]]'s [[Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney|Prince of Wales Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;ABC [http://www.abc.net.au/programsales/s1123397.htm article] retrieved on 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Among his various charity work, he was an ambassador for Charlie Teo's "Cure for Life Foundation".  The tumour returned in 2003.  It did not respond to treatment, and by 2005 he could no longer play the piano. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

McMillan performed solo at the [[Sydney Opera House]] on two occasions. Because of his illness, he could not perform at a planned third concert but instead made it an opportunity for him to present other pianists.   He released a 9-CD box set of his recordings, which he produced from his bed in the palliative care unit of [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney|St Vincent's Hospital]] in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]].  The [[Governors of New South Wales|Governor of New South Wales]], [[Marie Bashir]], officiated at the release.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;ABC News [http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200705/s1921751.htm article] retrieved on 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His story is told in Susan Wyndham's book, "Life In His Hands", which deals with both Aaron and Charlie Teo, his neurosurgeon.

He died on 14 May 2007 at St Vincent's Hospital. Just three days prior to his death, at his hospital bedside, he was awarded a [[Mo Awards|Mo Award]] for services to the entertainment industry.&lt;ref name="article"/&gt;

== Family ==

His parents, Brian McMillan, and Gail née Robinson, met on a [[meditation]] retreat. Soon after Aaron's birth, his father left to become a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk in [[Thailand]], and did not see his son again until he was 15.  In the meantime, the marriage was dissolved, and his mother married Giles Puckett, and they had two additional children.  Aaron, an only child, gained two siblings.  Aaron was influenced by his grandparents' Roman Catholicism, by Rudolf Steiner's [[anthroposophy]], by his father's Buddhism, and other spiritual ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wyndham, obituary ''Musician excelled at keyboard and on court'', The Age, 22 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''academic certificate''' is a document that certifies that a person has received specific [[education]] or has passed a [[Test (assessment)|test]] or series of tests.

In many countries, a certificate is a qualification attained in [[secondary education]]. For instance, students in the [[Republic of Ireland]] sit the [[Junior Certificate]] and follow it with the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]]. Similarly, other countries have awards, for instance, in [[Australia]] the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) in [[New South Wales]], the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] (VCE) in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], etc., is the examination taken on completion of secondary education. In parts of the [[United Kingdom]] the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) is the normal examination taken at age 16 and the [[General Certificate of Education]] (GCE) Advanced Subsidiary Level (AS-level) and [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|Advanced Level]] (A-levels) are taken at 17 and 18.

In many other countries, certificates are qualifications in higher education. For example, in the Republic of Ireland, the [[National Certificate]], which is soon to be replaced by the "[[Higher Certificate]]". These have the titles Certificate (at an undergraduate level), Graduate Certificate (at an undergraduate level, but requiring the completion of a prior undergraduate degree for admission) and Postgraduate Certificate (at a postgraduate level). In [[Hong Kong]], students take the exams to receive [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]]. Certificate is below the standard of the associate degree, diploma, higher diploma and advanced diploma, which are below the bachelor's degree. Postgraduate certificates are taken after the bachelor's degree and are sometimes more vocationally oriented than master's degrees.

In Australia, a certificate is a qualification offered by a university or other higher education provider which is shorter than a degree or diploma. Certificates are generally provided by [[TAFE]] colleges or non-academic Registered Training Organizations (often workplaces). There are four ranks of Certificate in Australia, indicated by [[Roman Numerals|Roman Numeral]], e.g., Cert. IV in Horticulture. The time spent varies, but in general a Certificate I will be granted after a course of only a few weeks, while a Cert. IV may take up to twelve months. A [[Diploma]] directly follows Cert. IV and may rightly be considered equivalent to a hypothetical Certificate V.

In the [[United Kingdom]], a [[Certificate of Higher Education]] (CertHE) requires successful completion of 120 [[CATS points|credits]] at level four of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (level 7 of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework). This is equivalent to one year of full-time university education at first year level. Each credit is equivalent to a nominal ten hours of study, and as such the CertHE is 1,200 hours of study. This compares with 360 credits (spanning levels 4, 5 and 6/480 credits spanning levels 7 to 10 in Scotland) for an [[honours degree|honours]] [[bachelor's degree]], and 240 credits (spanning level 4 and 5/7 and 8 in Scotland) for a [[Diploma of Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|date=November 2014|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|access-date=2017-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305083730/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A certificate can also be a vocational qualification of between 13 and 36 [[Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme|credits]] at any of the levels of the [[Regulated Qualifications Framework]], the level being specified in the qualification title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-the-general-conditions-of-recognition|publisher=Ofqual|date=13 July 2016|title=Guidance to the 'General Conditions of Recognition'|pages=56–57|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a certificate may be offered by an institute of higher education.  These certificates usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge about a certain vocational or professional subject. [[Certificate program]]s can be completed more quickly than associate degrees and often do not have general education requirements.  [[Graduate certificate]]s represent completion of studies beyond the bachelor's degree, yet short of a [[masters degree]].
 
In the State of [[Maryland]], a Certificate of Merit was, until recently, issued to graduating high-school [[twelfth grade|seniors]] who met certain academic requirements (such as completion of advanced courses and a cumulative GPA of 3.00); the statewide certificate has since been replaced by "endorsements" defined by each local school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcps.k12.md.us/curriculum/hsi/MSDE_HSGrad_Jan2006.pdf |publisher=Montgomery County Public Schools |format=PDF |title=Maryland State Department of Education High School Graduation Question and Answers }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also may be awarded as a necessary certification to validate that a student is considered competent in a certain specific networking skill area in [[information technology]]. Thus a [[computer engineer]] or [[computer science]] graduation most likely will have to obtain additional certificates on and pertaining to the specific technologies or equipment used by the hiring corporation; if not, such employer may suffer unwanted penalties like foregoing (voiding the contract) the protections of a certain level of customer service or warranties.

== Higher level academic certificates ==

It is becoming more common for higher education institutions to award certificates to continuing education students.  These certificates vary, usually involve rigorous courses, and can be affiliated with many associations. Examples would include [[Certified Management Accountant|CMA]] or [[Certified General Accountant|CGA]].  University certificates are also becoming more common ways for people to engage in areas of interest while working full-time.  They can be completed with a minimum grade in a series of university courses, and are sometimes taken as a way to further one's professional career (either by requirement or choice).  They are gaining credence and ground in both the academic world and the working world.

'''Academic grading in Croatia''' is regulated by the [[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|Ministry of Science, Education and Sports]].

==Grading scale (numerical and descriptive)==
In Croatia the following official grade scale applies to elementary school, high school and university students:
{|class="wikitable"
|-
! align="right" | 1 (0-50%)
| Insufficient ({{lang|hr|nedovoljan}})
|-
! align="right" | 2 (51%-69%)
| Sufficient ({{lang|hr|dovoljan}})
|-
! align="right" | 3 (70%-79%)
| Good ({{lang|hr|dobar}})
|-
! align="right" | 4 (80%-89%)
| Very good ({{lang|hr|vrlo dobar}})
|-
! align="right" | 5 (90%-100%)
| Excellent ({{lang|hr|odličan}} in schools, {{lang|hr|izvrstan}} at universities)
|}

1 ({{lang|hr|nedovoljan}}) is a failing grade, while grades 2 through 5 are passing grades.

Many teachers use minus and plus symbols as grade modifiers. For example, "−5" denotes a grade slightly lower than "excellent", while "+4" denotes a grade slightly higher than "very good". Half-grades such as "4/5" are also used. These modifiers are unofficial and do not appear in final grade reports.

At universities, a grading scale from 5 to 10 was used prior to Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia. The other former Yugoslav countries retained the old scale, while Croatia changed it to match the scale used in primary and secondary education.{{fact|date=October 2014}}

==Conduct grading==
Conduct ({{lang|hr|vladanje}}) is graded on a 3-point descriptive scale:
* Poor ({{lang|hr|loše}})
* Good ({{lang|hr|dobro}})
* Exemplary ({{lang|hr|uzorno}})

In practice, most students receive "exemplary" conduct grades. Conduct grade does not count towards the grade point average.

==Grade point average==
[[Grade point average]] is calculated as the arithmetic mean of all numerical grades:
*1.00–1.99 Insufficient
*2.00–2.49 Sufficient
*2.50–3.49 Good
*3.50–4.49 Very good
*4.50–5.00 Excellent

==Grade inflation==
A significant [[grade inflation]] has been observed in primary education and, to a lesser degree, in secondary education. In the 2008/09 school year, almost 168,000 out of 365,000 elementary school students were graded "excellent" by their grade point average. Parent pressure on teachers has been identified as a major cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/inflacija-petica-u-osnovnim-skolama-odlikasa-je-vise-50-posto-clanak-20508 Inflacija Petica]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">'''Action with Lao Children (ALC)''' is a [[continuation]] of [[Education in Laos (post-1990)]]

==Background==

'''Action with Lao children (ALC)''' is a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]], [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organisation]]. ALC aims to achieve a fair [[global society]] by improving the [[dissemination]] of education so as to equip children with the rights and ability to create their own future. ALC focuses on promoting [[Literacy|literate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l education and creating a conducive environment to [[nurture]] children's ability to learn by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action with Lao Children |url=http://www.alc.org.la/alc/ |accessdate=11 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127214322/http://www.alc.org.la/alc/ |archivedate=27 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1982 by Chanthasone Inthavong, ALC first started as the "Association for sending picture books to Lao children", then expanded their activities to include publishing of books in Laos. Their activities started in Japan and spread into Laos where Laotians took charge. They have currently two offices situated in Laos and Japan.

ALC seeks to fulfill its [[goal|objective]]s through the [[implementation]] of 5 different projects aimed at improving the schooling experience of Lao children. These projects [[:wikt:emphasis|emphasize]] on the culture of reading and writing.

==Initiatives==

'''The Book Publishing Project''' facilitated the production of various categories of books written in the Lao language by Lao writers and illustrators. It also introduced picture books which are hard to come by in Laos. As of May 2009, about 690,000 books with 148 titles have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sumitomo Corporation |url=http://www.sumitomocorp.co.jp/english/topics/2009/20090323_193504.html |accessdate=15 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128095214/http://www.sumitomocorp.co.jp/english/topics/2009/20090323_193504.html |archivedate=28 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Reading Promotion Project''' was implemented to improve the reading environment of Lao children through increased accessibility to books. It consists of the "Book Distribution Project" and "School Library Project". As a result of these efforts, books have been distributed to over 3000 primary and secondary schools in Laos since 1992. 190 school libraries have also been opened to encourage children to pick up reading as a habit. People living in the remote areas or villages of ethnic minorities benefit the most from this project since availability of education is lower there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4. International Board On Books For Young People|url=http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=888|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fully utilize the books distributed, Reading Promotion Seminars are organized for teachers to teach them the importance and pleasure of reading and the proper management of libraries.

In 1994, the first '''Children's Cultural Center (CCC)''' was established in Vientiane. These centers serve to change the Lao educational environment by creating platforms where the children can perform and express themselves. This is in line with the promotion of children rights stated in the UN Charter of the Rights of the Child. Activities implemented in these centers include drawing, handicraft, traditional dance and music. At present, there are 20 CCCs nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'espace Tokyo|url=http://www.tokyo-icc.jp/english/lespace/one_point/op_0811.html|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
ALC has been successful as proven by the falling failure rates in exams and rates of absentism in class. However, there are limitations to the programmes implemented. Close monitoring of schools has proven that many teachers fail to fully utilize books and motivate children to read. This is attributed to the limited time given to them to fully grasp the contents during the seminar. Skills learnt are also not transferred to the successors upon resignation. Besides, quality improvement of Lao language education is hindered due to the incapabilities of teachers in that aspect. In order to address these issues, ALC needs to do more by looking into the improvement of teaching methods of teachers.

'''Alois Hába''' (21 June 1893 – 18 November 1973) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[composer]], [[music theorist]] and teacher. He belongs to the important discoverers in [[modern classical music]], and major composers of [[microtonal]] music, especially using the [[Quarter tone|quarter-tone]] scale, though he used others such as [[Equal temperament#Other equal temperaments|sixth-tones]] (e.g., in the 5th, 10th and 11th String Quartets), [[Equal temperament|fifth-tones]] (Sixteenth String Quartet), and [[72 equal temperament|twelfth-tones]]. From the other mictrotonal conceptions, he discussed a "three-quarter tone" system (see [[three-quarter tone flat]] and the [[neutral second]]) in his theoretical works&lt;ref&gt;Myles Lee Skinner, "Toward a Quarter-Tone Syntax: Analyses of Selected Works by Blackwood, Haba, Ives and Wyschnegradsky", PhD diss.

== Life ==

Alois Hába was born in the small town of [[Vizovice]] in [[Moravian Wallachia]], into a family of 10 children. When he was five years old it was discovered that he had [[absolute pitch]]. He and his family often played and sang their native Wallachian folk songs, actively participated in church singing and folk-music performances. In school, Alois became very interested in the musical aspects of the Czech language, above all in [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[rhythm]], [[accent (music)|accent]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[timbre (music)|timbre]] of the speech. In 1908 he entered the teacher's training college in [[Kroměříž]], where he began to develop an interest in Czech national music, analyzing the works of [[Bedřich Smetana]]. Already at that time he found out from his textbooks that the European system of music was not the only one in the world and that even some European music had in the past used different scales than the ones used in his time. He therefore started to develop his own point of view in this issue. After finishing his studies, he got a job as teacher in Bílovice, a small town near the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] (now [[Slovakia|Slovak]]) border. Simultaneously, he continued his own musical studies and in 1913 wrote his first compositions, displaying an unwillingness to "follow the rules", which he maintained all his life. Hába was dissatisfied by small-town life, and in 1914, he moved to Prague and became a pupil of [[neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]] composer [[Vítězslav Novák]]. Here he was interested in analysing the works of [[Claude Debussy]], [[Max Reger]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], and [[Richard Strauss]], and in [[harmonization]] of [[Moravia]]n folk music.

=== Vienna ===

During [[World War I]], he served in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Army]] on the Russian and Italian front from 1915 until early 1918, when he was moved to [[Vienna]], where he worked in the music department of the [[Minister of War (Austria-Hungary)|Austrian-Hungarian Ministry of War]]. There he almost immediately became a student of [[Franz Schreker]], who brought out his more radical tendencies. At that time, Hába wrote his first quarter-tone piece, [[suite (music)|Suite]], consisting of three [[fugues]] in the quarter-tone system, composed for two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart. Remaining in Vienna after the war, Hába attended the concerts produced by [[Arnold Schönberg]]'s [[Society for Private Musical Performances|Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen]], and became particularly influenced by the "athematic" style used by Schönberg in his ''[[Erwartung]]''. First publications  of his compositions included the String Quartet No.&amp;nbsp;2, his first major quarter-tone work which was composed in 1920. At that time, his lifelong friendship with [[Hanns Eisler]] – with whom he shared political beliefs (Hába became an ardent communist at this time) as well as musical opinions – began.

=== Berlin ===

Hába found his first success as a composer in Berlin, where he followed his teacher Schreker in late 1920. He published his first theoretical treatise (in Czech), the small booklet ''Harmonické základy čtvrttónové soustavy'' (Harmonic Essentials of the Quarter-tone System). In 1923, he met [[Ferrucio Busoni]], who had advocated the sixth-tone system and encouraged Hába to continue his work in microtonality. The same year, Hába began to attempt the establishment of a school of microtonal music, but as the Nazis started to gain power in Germany, he came under attack and was driven out of Berlin. He returned to Prague and managed to get a job teaching workshops at the [[Prague Conservatory]].

=== Prague ===

In July 1923 at the festival of modern music in [[Donaueschingen]], the Amar-Hindemith Quartet played Hába’s quarter-tone String Quartet No.&amp;nbsp;3. His name began to appear alongside other representatives of his generation’s avant-garde musicians and, thanks to him, [[Czechoslovakia]] became one of the first member countries of the [[International Society for Contemporary Music]]. Hába wrote several theoretical articles on microtonality, [[athematicism]], and church modes at this time. In 1925 he wrote his major theoretical work ''New Harmony-Textbook of the Diatonic, Chromatic, Quarter-, Third-, Sixth-, and Twelfth-tone Systems'' (if necessary, see: [[diatonic scale|diatonic]], [[chromatic (music)|chromatic]]). He designed and had built two quarter-tone pianos by early 1924 and a third in 1925. In 1927, the Czech branch factory of the German piano firm [[August Förster]] in the North [[Bohemia]]n town of [[Jiříkov]]  built for him a sixth-tone [[harmonium]], patterned mostly after the design by Busoni.

After the premiere of his quarter-tone opera ''Matka'' (Mother) in 1931, introducing a practically athematic concept, Hába emerged as a leader of Czech modernist music and became internationally well known as one of the most important [[avantgarde]] composers. This opera also uses two quarter-tone [[clarinet]]s and two quarter-tone [[trumpet]]s, which were built especially for this work. In 1934, he composed the opera ''Nová země'' (The New Earth) in the [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone system]]. Athematic constructions characteristic of his work appeared also later in the opera ''Přijď království tvé'' (Thy Kingdom Come) (1940), which is written in the sixth-tone system.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica, "[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/250719/Alois-Haba Alois Hába: Czech Composer]", Encyclopædia Britannica Online (accessed 12 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In all three operas, Hába expressed his bold [[socialist]] viewpoint, that caused controversies already at the time. For instance, the production of Nová Země (the plot of which deals with the [[Holodomor]] in Ukraine and how the Holodomor in a Ukrainian village is defeated by [[socialisation of production]] and founding the [[kolkhoz]] Nová Země (The New Earth) by [[National Theatre, Prague|National Theatre]] in Prague in 1936 had to be cancelled by intervention from the Ministry of Culture as [[Communism|communist]] and [[Soviet Union|pro-soviet]] [[propaganda]].

In 1933, when [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]] became director of the Prague Conservatory, Hába was made a full professor and established the Department of Quarter-tone and Sixth-tone Music. Here he had much influence over his many students. It was also the early 1930s that saw the writing of what is probably Hába’s most important orchestral work, the symphonic fantasy ''Cesta života'' (The Path of Life). The 1930s also shaped Hába’s political stance and philosophy of life. His strong sense of social commitment found an intellectual basis in the [[anthroposophical]] teachings of [[Rudolf Steiner]].

In 1939 the German [[Nazi]]s occupied Czechoslovakia and banned performance of Hába's work. They closed down the Prague Conservatory in 1941 and prevented him from teaching. During the war Hába wrote a continuation of his ''Theory of Harmony'', completed, as already mentioned, a sixth-tone opera (which was never produced), and considered constructing a twelfth-tone harmonium.

After [[World War II]], he resumed teaching and held several administrative positions. At the turn of forties and fifties, the work of Alois Hába was affected by the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, becoming transitionally simplified, much more "thematic" and [[tonality|tonal]], and also setting texts projecting [[communist ideology]]. He was nevertheless unable to rid himself of the label of “formalist” stuck onto him by [[Marxist]] [[aesthetics]].

In 1953 he was sent into retirement, but in his own words it was only at that point that he achieved real creative freedom. In 1957 he was named an honorary member of the ISCM. When Hába returned to his style, he continued in his [[experimental music]]al studies, which culminated in the 1960s with the use of fifth tones in his Sixteenth String Quartet in 1967. This work was premiered in the same year at the ISCM festival in Prague, performing by Novák Quartet.
 
Hába was a prolific composer and continued to compose almost to the end of his life. He taught and influenced many musicians. Besides followers in his own country, Hába attracted students from southern [[Slavs|Slavic]] countries ([[Slovenia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]]), [[Lithuania]], [[Turkey]], and elsewhere. The Prague Conservatory in general enjoyed an international reputation, and a great deal of credit for that goes to the contacts and pioneering efforts of Alois Hába. Despite these facts, he died in relative obscurity in Prague in 1973.

== Concept ==

{{quote|Quarter-tone music, Hába was convinced, would represent a major enrichment of [[Europe]]an musical language. As he repeatedly stated, it was the genuine folk music of his own native region that led him to the idea of enriching European musical language with smaller intervals than the half-tones that are usual in European genuine folk music.

It was with these words that Alois Hába introduced a concert of works composed by himself and his students on 13 March 1945 in the Municipal Library in Prague:
{{quote|Often just raising the apex of a melody by a mere half-tone, a quarter-tone or a sixth-tone, just prolonging or shortening a certain passage by a single beat, just livening up or rearranging the rhythm will be enough to achieve some satisfactory musical expressivity. This work is like polishing a precious stone. Perfect polishing increases its value. And only the ability to do such polishing guarantees composers perfection in their creative work and certainty in their ability to evaluate their own work and that of others.}}

All three areas of Alois Hába’s activity – composing, teaching, and organizing – evince one of his fundamental characteristics: the courage to move into a territory where no one else had thus far dared go. Hába was not some kind of “microinterval fanatic” as is sometimes assumed. He did offer his students this path, but he never compelled them to travel it. He was an example of musical perseverance, and although the worldwide universal musical language which he strove to create proved to be a [[utopia]], his importance for the development of music in the 20th century is unparalleled.&lt;ref name="VR"&gt;Vlasta Reittererová, "[http://www.rozhlas.cz/klasika/composers/_zprava/alois-haba--1217141 Alois Hába]", Český rozhlas website (accessed 12 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Works ==

Alois Hába's works total 103 opuses, the majority of which are various kinds of [[chamber music]]. Among the most important are his [[string quartet]]s, which document and demonstrate the development of his style. In addition to quarter tones, Hába used sixth-tones in his String Quartets nos. in the 5, 10, and 11, as well as in Six Pieces for Sixth-tone Harmonium or String Quartet (1928), Duo for Sixth-tone Violins (1937), ''Thy Kingdom Come'', a Sixth-tone Musical Drama in Seven Scenes (1937–42), Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Violin (1955), and Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Cello (1955).

'''Antonio Cornazzano''' (c. 1430 in [[Piacenza]] – 1484&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of Dance|last = Kassig|first = Gayle|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2007|isbn =9780736060356|location = Champaign, IL|pages = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ferrara]]) was an Italian poet, writer, biographer, and [[Choreography|dancing master]].

In the city of Piacenza, which was then in the Duchy of [[Milan]], Antonio Cornazzano was born probably in 1432. His father, Bonifacio Cornazzano was a well-known lawyer and his mother, Costanza Bagarotti, belonged to the small nobility from Piacentine territory. Cornazzano studied at the university of [[Siena]] between 1444–47, and in 1450 he was in Rome, probably in the service of a high prelate. He then found his way to Milan in 1455, where he served Duke [[Francesco Sforza]], and wrote a long poem in praise of the Duke, his 'De gestis Francisci Sfortiae' or 'Sforziade'. He also wrote a small treatise on the art of dancing, a life of the Virgin Mary and a Latin scurrilous collection of 'novellae' "De proverbiorum origine". After attending the Duke's funeral in 1466, he left Milan. He moved to Venetian territory and, for a time, worked with the condottiere Bartolomeo Colleoni, whose biography Cornazzano wrote in Latin. In Venice, he worked with the printer Nicolas Jenson, and published a "Life of Christ". In 1475, he moved to the court of Ferrara, where he wrote important works; a short treatise on government, and one on military art (c. 1476) in prose. He later turned the latter into a terza rima poem. He died in Ferrara in 1484.

==Cornazzano's Poetic Life==
There is a manuscript in the Estense Library in Modena, Italy, written in 15th or 16th century script. It contains four poetic Italian works by Corazzano in ''terza rima''- a form of stanza that requires a set of three lines that rhyme. ''Terza rima'' was first used by Italian Dante Alighieri. Of the four works, three were published, along with a number of his poems in the same style. The title of ''Opera nova'' were given to these selections published in 1517 and 1518. Of Cornazzano's four works mentioned above, one, the first of the series,''De mulieribus admirandis'', was never published (but see C. FAHY, "The 'De mulieribus admirandis' of Antonio Cornazzano" in LA BIBLIOFILIA, 52 (1960) pp.&amp;nbsp;144–174). It, in fact, has grown in obscurity over the many years since its creation until it has nearly been wiped from history's rich pages. It has even received little, if any attention from the scholarly men of Italy.
(The above is rather sketchy) for accurate, reliable and scholarly information,

See: R.L. BRUNI and D. ZANCANI, Antonio Cornazzano: La tradizione testuale, Florence, Olschki 1992.

There is another article in English on Cornazzano, apart from Fahy's, by D. ZANCANI, 'Antonio Cornazzano's "De l'integrita' de la militare arte"', in "Chivalry in the Renaissance, ed. by S. Anglo, Woodbridge, Boydell 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–24.

==Cornazzano's Life Of Dancing==
Cornazzano's dancing master was [[Domenico da Piacenza]], who was perhaps better known as Domenico da Ferrara. Cornazzano was a fellow student with Guglielmo Ebreo. He once said this concerning his dancing master, he is the ''king of the art''. Cornazzano published his Libro dell'arte del danzare in 1455 a treatise on dancing in the 15th century.

An '''autonomous university''' typically refers to a [[university]] that exercises independent control over its day-to-day operations and curriculum.  It is generally associated with universities or institutions and implies that the sponsoring state does not have control over academic matters of the school. Conversely, universities that are not autonomous generally have their academic programs and/or curriculum controlled and even dictated by the state's the [[Ministry of Education]] or government agency regulating higher education.

Brilliant is intended to discover and cultivate the mathematical and scientific thinking skills of students, professionals, and hobbyists around the world.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/07/23/203677692/giving-brightest-kids-the-cram-school-experience-online|title = Giving Brightest Kids The 'Cram School' Experience, Online|last = Kurwa|first = Nishat|date = July 23, 2013|accessdate = September 28, 2014|publisher = [[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates via a [[freemium]] business model.

==History==

Brilliant was founded in 2012.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; At the Launch Festival in March 2013, CEO and co-founder [[Sue Khim]] presented the idea of Brilliant, catching the eye of venture capitalist [[Chamath Palihapitiya]].&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=techcruch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/11/backed-by-social-captial-brilliant-org-is-finding-and-challenging-the-brightest-technical-talent-in-the-world/|title = Backed By Social+Capital, Brilliant.org Is Finding And Challenging The Brightest, Technical Talent In The World|last = Rao|first = Leena|date = August 11, 2013|accessdate = September 28, 2014|work=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Khim further outlined the vision for Brilliant at [[TEDx]].&lt;ref name=tedx &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnQCYZ8Oz8Q|title=Scouting for Intellect: Sue Khim at TEDxUChicago 2013|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=June 4, 2013|website=YouTube|publisher=TedX|access-date= July 15, 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, ''[[TechCrunch]]'' reported that Brilliant.org had raised money from Palihapitiya's [[Social+Capital Partnership]] as well as from [[500 Startups]], [[Kapor Capital]], [[Learn Capital]], and [[Hyde Park Angels]], and that the website had over 100,000 users.&lt;ref name="techcruch" /&gt; As of July 2017, the website has over 4 million registered users and 1.75 million [[Facebook]] likes.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brilliantorg|title = Brilliant.org|publisher = [[Facebook]]|date = July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''DeFunis v. Odegaard''''', 416 U.S. 312 (1974),{{ref|citation}} was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the case had become [[mootness|moot]] and so declined to render a merits decision on it. [[United States|American]] student Marco DeFunis, who had been denied [[university and college admissions|admission]] to the [[University of Washington]] [[law school|School of Law]] in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] before he was provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case, was slated to [[graduation|graduate]] within a few months of the decision being rendered.&lt;ref&gt;Karabel, Jerome. ''The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.'' Boston: Mifflin, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court rejected the assertion that the case was in one of two exceptions to the mootness doctrine that were raised by the [[plaintiff]]. The case did not constitute "voluntary cessation" on the part of the [[defendant]] law school, as the plaintiff was now in his final quarter, and the law school could take no action to deny him the ability to graduate. Also, it was not a question that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review" because the plaintiff would never again face the situation, and others who might raise the same complaint in the future might be able to receive the courts' full review.

DeFunis argued that materials brought to light during discovery and entered into evidence in the trial court showed that his initial denial of admission to the law school was the result of the operation of the law school's [[affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] policy, favoring the admission of minority applicants over better-qualified white candidates. Although the Court refused to consider the case on the merits in ''DeFunis'', the issue of affirmative action returned to the Court without any problem of mootness, with an opinion on the merits achieved in ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]''.

== Background ==
In 1970, Marco DeFunis, a white man, applied for entry to the law program at the University of Washington. He was denied even though the year in question would be his final year. DeFunis, believing he had been rejected because of affirmative action, thought the school had taken applicants who were approved because of not their accomplishments but their race.

He took his case to court and stated that of affirmative action violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

== Lower courts ==
The case was first heard in the Superior Court of Washington, in which the University of Washington moved to have the case dismissed on the grounds that relief could not be granted. The court rejected the proposed dismissal and filed an injunction that forced the school to admit DeFunis. The university argued that it used a complex formula to predict applicants' success, the Predicted First-Year Average (PFYA), but it was not the only thing taken into account during the application process.

Applicants with higher PFYA scores were reviewed and were presented by a committee member before the whole committee. The committee member who represented a student was usually up to chance but not in the case of African American and other minority students. Their files were reviewed by three specific board members: Professor [[Geoffrey Crooks]] (director of the school's Council on Legal Education Opportunities program), [[Vincent Hayes]] (a second-year black law student), and Associate Dean [[Robert S. Hunt]] (the sole evaluator of the files of minorities other than African Americans). The court found that in reviewing the files of minority applicants, the committee attached less weight to the PFYA in making a total judgmental evaluation as to the relative ability of the particular applicant to succeed in law school. Also, the chairman testified that although the same standard was applied to all applicants (the relative probability of the individual succeeding in law school), minority applicants were directly compared to one another, but they were not compared to applicants outside of the minority group. As a result, the committee admitted a group of minority applicants, placed a group of such applicants on a waiting list, and rejected other minority applications. The dean of the law school testified that the law school has no fixed admissions quota for minority students but that the committee sought a reasonable representation of such groups in the law school. He added that the it has accepted no unqualified minority applicants but only those whose records indicated that they were capable of successfully completing the law school program. Because of the judgmental factors in the admissions process, as outlined, the ultimate determination of applicants to whom admission was offered did not follow exactly the relative ranking of PFYAs. Of those invited, 74 had lower PFYAs than plaintiff; 36 of them were minority applicants, 22 were returning from military service, and 16 were applicants judged by the committee as deserving invitations on the basis of other information contained in their files. There were 29 applicants with higher PFYAs than plaintiff's were denied admission. Of the 36 minority group students invited 18 actually enrolled in the first-year class. The law faculty was, as the court observes, motivated by a laudable purpose: to increase the number of minority students studying law and with the avowed purpose of equalizing opportunities among applicants who come from the lower income and economic groups with those who come from the higher. That policy of ethnic minority selection apparently was not to apply to faculty positions, as the record does not show that any qualified white applicant for the teaching staff was refused or that any faculty member ousted to make room for law teachers with questionable credentials from a minority ethnic group.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Citation|title=DeFunis v. Odegaard|date=March 8, 1973|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9453942554395172690&amp;q=defunis+v.+odegaard&amp;as_sdt=4000006&amp;as_vis=1|volume=507|pages=1169|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court's reflected heavily on the Supreme Court's ruling on ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' when it began ruling and so the injunction was filed. The Supreme Court of Washington had strong opinions on the case, with Justice Hale going as far to say, "Preferential treatment under the guise of 'affirmative action' is the imposition of one form of racial discrimination in place of another. The questions that must be asked in this regard are: must an individual sacrifice his right to be judged on his own merit by accepting discrimination based solely on the color of his skin? How can we achieve the goal of equal opportunity for all if, in the process, we deny equal opportunity to some?"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Justice Hunter concurred "The majority supports a laudable purpose — to enable students of certain minority races to enter the University of Washington School of Law in order that ultimately there will be a greater representation of practicing lawyers of those races in the legal profession — with which purpose I do not disagree. This must not be accomplished, however, by clear and willful discrimination against students of other races as the Admissions Committee of the University of Washington School of Law has done in this case by denying admission to the respondent, Marco DeFunis, Jr, to this school, as found by the trial court and amply supported by the record."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Supreme Court ==
When the case reached the Supreme Court, DeFunis was already in his final year of law school. The court ruled it moot since neither party had anything to gain from the court's ruling.

While Tom Snyder originally created games that would suit the "one-computer classroom" model, this series was part of a new gaming focus of "choice-driven discussion generators".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1993/03/24/26soft.h12.html|title=Reaction to Software on Slavery Raises Issues Surrounding New Types of Media|last=West|first=Peter|date=March 24, 1993|website=Education Week|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software was designed specifically to foster acamedic discussions within the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schoolnet.org.za/conference/sessions/nh/WB_Research.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An online learning extension named ''Decisions, Decisions Online'' was also created.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/awards/past/r1199-16.shtml|title=Best of '99: Decisions, Decisions Online|last=|first=|date=1999|website=Education World|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Each game puts the players (recommended to be a classroom) into a scenario based on actual facts and encourages them to come up with solutions. An example is in the title ''Decisions, Decisions: Prejudice'', in which the players take the role of the mayor of a tourist town, in which a newspaper has editorialised against a business trading racial memorabilia.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Students discuss the problem in teams, then enter their strategies into the computer, which advances the story, leading to 300 alternate paths.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Members of the team receive booklets from the perspective of an adviser to the decision maker, for instance in ''Decisions, Decisions: The Environment'', they could be a campaign manager, and environmentalist, a scientist, and an economist; players then debate this conflicting information to reach a justifiable compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=4wb3IHdIjzIC&amp;pg=PA52|title=Easy Ways to Make Technology Work for You: From Grade Books to Graphic Organizers|last=Dockterman|first=David A.|date=2002|publisher=Scholastic Inc.|isbn=9780439437615|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Bay Waldorf School''' (EBWS) is an independent, non-sectarian  Waldorf School in [[El Sobrante, California]], on the east side of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. It is based on the principles of [[Waldorf education]]. Located on 11 acres of land, the school is adjacent to [[Wildcat Canyon]], a 2,427-acre regional park with hiking trails and panoramic views of the area.

Founded in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] in 1980, East Bay Waldorf School offers classes from prekindergarten through grade 8, as well as parent-child classes for infants-age 3 years. Curriculum is based upon the principles of Waldorf Education, and accredited by the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA).&lt;ref name="Association of Waldorf Schools of North America"&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of Waldorf Schools of North America|url=http://www.whywaldorfworks.org/04_awsna/awsna_accredited_schools.asp|website=whywaldorfworks.org |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

The East Bay Waldorf School’s 11-acre campus includes two large fields, an edible garden, eucalyptus and pine groves, several playgrounds designed to integrate play with nature, and farm animals. The outdoor space is augmented by [[Wildcat Canyon]], a 2,427-acre regional park with hiking trails that lead directly from the school.

==Curriculum==

The East Bay Waldorf School offers a balanced, comprehensive curriculum based on the principles of [[Waldorf Education]], conceived by the Austrian educator, scientist and philosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]] during the 1920s. The Waldorf movement, represented by over 1000 schools worldwide, pioneered the education of the “whole child” introducing the “head, heart and hands” approach to learning.

Waldorf teachers integrate art, music and movement into every academic subject, which helps students better engage and absorb the academic material.  Each year of the curriculum is designed to be developmentally-specific to the growing child.

During the kindergarten years, the focus is on creative play, being outdoors in nature, artistic work, storytelling, and meaningful practical work such as baking bread, sweeping, or woodworking. The teachers develop children’s capacity for later academic learning by supporting this free, creative play, encouraging children’s imaginative capacities, modeling behavior and creating a predictable environment of reverence and beauty.

In the elementary school grades, the day begins with a two-hour class known as “main lesson.” Devoted to a theme in language arts, math, science, or social studies, main lesson blocks last for 3–4 weeks. The latter part of the day is spent in “practical arts” such as handwork, music, Spanish or German language classes, physical education, Eurythmy (a form of movement), as well as language arts and mathematics. Daily chores and significant outdoor time are also essential to the Waldorf approach.

Assessment is [[Formative assessment|formative]] (careful observation with an ongoing qualitative focus on what needs to be developed), rather than [[Summative assessment|summative]] (typically grades and testing), and teachers stay with the same class for several years, up to an eight-year period.

Waldorf education emphasizes moral qualities such as beauty, truth and inherent goodness. Teachers strive to surround the children with these elements through aesthetically-pleasing classrooms, meaningful activity, and the content of the curriculum.  For example, history is taught through legends and biographies that illuminate human strength and heroism in the face of adversity.

The use of television, computers and hand-held devices is discouraged for elementary school students at the East Bay Waldorf School. Electronic media is viewed as detrimental to the healthy development of children, and to the cultivation of creativity, perseverance and problem solving. The East Bay Waldorf School considers education to be much more than acquiring information and skills; therefore learning is a human-to-human endeavor that electronic devices do not support.

==Events==

The East Bay Waldorf School recognizes the cycles of the year by celebrating a variety of seasonal festivals and events, including Michaelmas, Harvest Faire, Wanderer’s Way, the Spiral of Light, and the May Faire. Several of these events are open to the public.

'''Edge Foundation''', commonly referred to as ''''Edge'''', is an independent education foundation, dedicated to raising the status of practical and vocational learning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.co.uk edge.co.uk homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK. Its aim is for young people to have the opportunity to achieve their potential,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.co.uk/Pages/AboutEdge.aspx?ContainerID=348 About Edge page on edge.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222235940/http://www.edge.co.uk/Pages/AboutEdge.aspx?ContainerID=348 |date=2008-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that the UK’s future workforce is equipped with the skills to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5311480.stm bbc.co.uk article on 'looming skills shortage']&lt;/ref&gt;

Edge believes that there are many paths to success. They think that vocational and practical education should be valued just as highly as academic choices. To make this happen, they run campaigns and projects that challenge academic snobbery, stimulate demand for practical learning, and supply innovative learning opportunities.

==Aims==
As well as a better public perception of practical learning, Edge would like to see fundamental changes in the UK education system, including better careers guidance, more opportunities for practical and work-based learning, more employer engagement and an overhaul of teacher training, especially in practical subjects.

==History==
In 2003 educational services provider [[Edexcel]] was partially sold to [[Pearson PLC]]. The trustees of Edexcel opted to use the proceeds of the sale to set up an educational foundation: '''Edge''' was formed in November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edexcel.org.uk/about/whatwedo/history/ Edexcel website history page]&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of the foundation identified the promotion of practical and vocational learning as the new organisation's primary objective. Since its inception '''Edge''' has invested millions of pounds in practical learning schemes and initiatives run by other organisations, as well as running its own projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.co.uk/docs/action/all/ Edge Action page on edge.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502192020/http://www.edge.co.uk/docs/action/all/ |date=2008-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edge projects and campaigns==

===Next Step campaign===
In August 2008 '''Edge''' published the Next Step Guide, which was distributed in the Guardian newspaper. The supplement aimed to promote a wide range of education options for young people, particularly practical and vocational routes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.co.uk/Pages/ProjectsDetail.aspx?ContainerID=506&amp;ContainerName=Projects The Next Step Guide on the Edge website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114204614/http://www.edge.co.uk/Pages/ProjectsDetail.aspx?ContainerID=506&amp;ContainerName=Projects |date=2009-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business in schools===
This is a campaign to encourage employers to get involved in education and help schools and colleges provide work-related learning experiences for young people. It is piloted in Hertfordshire and Yorkshire and the Humber, and it is planned to extend it throughout the country in autumn 2009. The website www.businessinschools.co.uk allows schools and colleges to register their details and select the work-related learning opportunities in which they’re interested. Employers can then visit the site and find nearby schools and colleges in need of their help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinschools.co.uk/  Business in Schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

===VQ Day===
On 23 July 2008 the inaugural VQ Day took place, celebrating the success of those with vocational qualifications across the UK. '''Edge''' led the VQ Day celebrations, with support from many of the leading players in the vocational education community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vqday.org.uk/ VQ Day website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/groups/974549@N22/ VQ Day photos on Flickr]&lt;/ref&gt; The next VQ Day will be held on 24 June 2009.

===Another Way Forward campaign===
In 2007 '''Edge''' launched its first mainstream advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edgecampaign.co.uk Edge campaign website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227180642/http://www.edgecampaign.co.uk/ |date=2008-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The television ad features a father giving his son a driving lesson, and forcing him to drive the wrong way down a dual carriageway. The captions over the film read: "Are you pushing your kids in the wrong direction?", "An academic route isn't always the right option".

===Edge Academies===
'''Edge''' is funding two new schools under the Government's controversial academy schools scheme;&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/newschools/story/0,,2037502,00.html Article from Guardian online 'Brown to expand school academies scheme']&lt;/ref&gt; one in Milton Keynes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/schools/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=48632 Article on Milton Keynes academy school on council website]&lt;/ref&gt; and one in Bulwell, Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/news_page/news_about_nottingham_-_childrens_services_/academies_seek_planning_approval.htm Article on Nottingham City Council website]&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools will be housed in brand new buildings and are due to open in time for the 2009/10 school year.
====Academies====
* [[The Bulwell Academy]] (co sponsored with '''The Bulwell Academy Trust'''and now with '''Creative Education Trust''')

===University Technical Colleges===
'''Edge''' is a co-sponsor of the [[University Technical College]]s programme, in conjunction with the [[Baker Dearing Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utcolleges.org/about/our-sponsors/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619033128/http://www.utcolleges.org/about/our-sponsors/ |archivedate=2012-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge into Space===
'''Edge''' invited young people aged 13–17 to invent a device that could be used by in space. Twelve winning teams were taken to the NASA space centre in Houston, USA.

===Ice Edge===
Edge asked young people to come up with a practical idea to combat climate change. Forty-one winners were taken to the Arctic to see climate change at first-hand and carry out experiments with leading scientists.

===Edge Awards===
The Edge Awards take place annually, and reward companies for giving practical learning opportunities to young people. They also reward individual young people who have used vocational learning as a springboard to successful careers. Previous winners include diamond-setting apprentice Alasdair Craig and Suffolk-based juice bar MyJuice.

==Other projects funded by Edge==

===horsesmouth.co.uk===
horsesmouth.co.uk is a website billed as "the first dedicated website for informal e-mentoring". It brings together the expertise of volunteer online mentors, with young people who need a mentor's help. Its tagline reads: "Someone needs what you know. Someone knows what you need."

'''Education in Norway''' is mandatory for all children aged 6–16.

The [[school year]] in [[Norway]] runs from mid August to late June the following year. The [[Christmas|Christmas holiday]] from mid December to early January historically divides the Norwegian school year into two [[Academic term|terms]]. Presently, the second term begins in the beginning of January.

==History of education in Norway==

Organized [[education]] in Norway dates as far back as [[Middle Ages|medieval times]]. Shortly after Norway became an [[Diocese|archdiocese]] in 1153, [[cathedral school]]s were constructed to educate priests in [[Trondheim]], [[Oslo]], [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] and [[Hamar]].

After the [[Lutheranism|reformation]] of Norway in 1537, (Norway entered a [[Denmark-Norway|personal union]] with [[Denmark]] in 1536) the cathedral schools were turned into Latin schools, and it was made mandatory for all [[market town]]s to have such a school.&lt;ref name="A New Deal for Norwegian Higher Education"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aamodt|first1=Per|title=A New Deal for Norwegian Higher Education?|journal=European Journal of Education|date=1990|volume=25|issue=2|pages=171–185|jstor=1503087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1736 training in reading was made compulsory for all children, but was not effective until some years later, when [[ambulatory school]]s (''omgangsskoler'') were also established. In 1827, Norway introduced the ''folkeskole'' (''people's school''), a primary school which became mandatory for 7 years in 1889 and 9 years in 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ''folkeskole'' was abolished, and the ''grunnskole'' (''foundation school'') was introduced.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cultice|first1=Wendell|title=The School System of Norway|journal=The Clearing House|date=1967|volume=42|issue=2|pages=119–121|jstor=30183285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally poorer counties like [[Finnmark]] and [[Hedmark]] have the highest shares of inhabitants who only have completed the compulsory [[primary education]], with numbers as high as 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Her bor de med høyest utdanning|url=http://www.tautdanning.no/default.aspx?did=9095962|access-date=2016-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415024830/http://tautdanning.no/default.aspx?did=9095962|archive-date=2016-04-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education today==
The Norwegian school system can be divided into three parts: Elementary school (''Barneskole'', ages 6–13), lower secondary school (''Ungdomsskole'', ages 13–16), and upper secondary school (''Videregående skole'', ages 16–19).  The Barneskole and Ungdomsskole levels are compulsory, and are commonly referred to as ''Grunnskole'' (literally translates to "'ground-school").

Elementary and lower secondary school are mandatory for all children aged 6–16. Before 1997, mandatory [[education]] in [[Norway]] started at the age of 7. Students often have to change school when they enter lower secondary school&lt;ref&gt; Nilssen, Fred Harald. (2014, 25. juni). Grunnskolen. In Store norske leksikon. [https://snl.no/grunnskolen].&lt;/ref&gt; and almost always have to change school when they enter upper secondary school, as many schools only offer one of the levels.
===Primary school (''Barneskole'', Grades 1–7, ages 6–12)===
In the first year of primary school, students spend most of their time playing educational games and learning social structures, the alphabet, basic addition and subtraction, and basic English skills. In Grades 2-7, they are introduced to [[mathematics]], [[English language|English]], [[science]], [[Religious education|religion]] (focusing not only on Christianity but also on all other religions, their purpose, and their history), [[aesthetics]], and [[music]], complemented by [[geography]], [[history]], and [[social studies]] in the fifth grade. No official grades are given at this level. However, the teacher often writes a comment, analysis, and sometimes an unofficial grade on tests. Tests are to be taken home and shown to parents. There is also an introductory test to let the teacher know if the student is above average or is in need of some assistance at school.

===Lower secondary school (''Ungdomsskole'', Grades 8-10, ages 13-16)===
When the students enter lower secondary school, at age 12 or 13, they begin getting grades for their work. Their grades together with their location in the country will determine whether they get accepted to their high school of choice or not. From eighth grade, students can choose one elective (''valgfag''). Typical offered subjects are [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as well as additional English and Norwegian studies. Before the educational reform of August 2006, students could choose a practical elective instead of the languages. Teens born in 1999 and later could once again choose a practical elective upon starting lower secondary school, thus getting the option to choose two electives.

A student may take the Grade 10 exam in a particular subject early as long as he or she has been granted an exemption from further instruction in the elementary/middle school curriculum of that subject.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;[http://www.udir.no/Brev/_lover-og-regler/tolkningsuttalelser/-2-1---Mulighet-for-a-avlegge-grunnskoleeksamen-pa-et-tidligere-tidspunkt-enn-10-trinn/ in Norwegian ''§ 2-1 - Mulighet for å avlegge eksamen før 10. trinn'']{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] fifteen-year-olds performed better in [[OECD]]s [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] than other [[Scandinavia]]n countries, with significant improvement since 2006. In mathematics, however, the top scoring 10% were estimated to lag three years behind the top scoring students in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pisa.no/pisa2009/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120061242/http://www.pisa.no/pisa2009/index.html |archivedate=2011-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper secondary school (''Videregående skole'', Grades VG1-VG3, ages 16-19)===
[[Secondary education]] in Norway is primarily based on public schools: In 2007, 93% of upper secondary school students attended public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://statbank.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/selectvarval/Define.asp?MainTable=ElevVGsEierfor3&amp;SubjectCode=04&amp;ProductId=04.02&amp;nvl=True&amp;mt=0&amp;pm=y&amp;PLanguage=0&amp;nyTmpVar=true | title=Statistics Norway: Upper secondary school students by type of study and school ownership | publisher=[[Statistisk Sentralbyrå]] (Norwegian) - select all regions, all 'studieretning', all 'eierforhold', year 2007 revidert. Click 'vis tabell' ('show table'), compute percentages from result.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 2005, Norwegian law held private secondary schools to be illegal unless they offered a "religious or pedagogic alternative", so the only private schools in existence were religious ([[Christian school|Christian]]), [[Waldorf education|Steiner/Waldorf]], [[Montessori school]]s, and {{ill|lt=Danielsen|Danielsen Foundation|no|Egill Danielsens Stiftelse}}. The first "standard" private upper secondary schools opened in the fall of 2005.

Prior to 1994 there were three branches of upper secondary schooling: "General" (language, history, etc.), "mercantile" (accounting, etc.), and "vocational" (electronics, carpentry, etc.) studies. The high school reform of 1994 ("Reform 94") merged these branches into a single system. Among the goals of the reform was that everybody should have a certain amount of "general studies" large enough to make them eligible for higher education later, meaning more theory in vocational studies, and it should be possible to cross over from one education path to another without losing too much credit. In the old system, two years of carpentry would be wasted if you wanted to switch to general studies, but in the new system you could keep credit for at least half of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Palmer|title=The Norwegian System of Public Secondary Education|journal=[[The School Review]]|volume=44.8|issue=1936|pages=608–14|jstor=10.2307/1080362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of the reform ''Kunnskapsløftet'' ("the knowledge promise" or "the lifting of knowledge", the word ''løfte'' having two meanings) in the fall of 2006, a student can apply for a general studies (''studiespesialisering'') or a vocational studies (''yrkesfag'') path. Inside these main paths there are many sub-paths to follow. An upper secondary school usually offers general and vocational curriculum.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=World+TVET+Database&amp;ct=NOR | title=TVET in Norway | publisher=[[UNESCO]]-UNEVOC | date=2013 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocational studies usually follow a typical structure named the "2+2 model": After two years of school training (with workshops and short internship in industry), the student goes in apprenticeship for two years in an enterprise or a public institution. The apprenticeship is divided into one year of training and one year of effective work. Some vocational curriculum are nonetheless entirely school-based, and other include 3 years of apprenticeship instead of 2.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt;

The new reform makes the incorporation of [[Information technology|IT]] into the schooling mandatory, and many counties (responsible for the public high schools) offer laptops to general studies students for free or for a small fee. Kunnskapsløftet also makes it harder to switch between electives that you take in the second and third year in the general studies path.

Students graduating upper secondary school are called ''[[Russefeiring|Russ]]'' in Norwegian. Most of them choose to celebrate with lots of parties and festivities, which, impractically, take place a few weeks before the final examinations of the final year.

== Educators in Norwegian schools ==

The titles of educators in Norwegian schools vary with the degrees they have.

*Pre-school teacher (''Førskolelærer'' or ''barnehagelærer''): These teachers are primarily employed in [[kindergarten]]s and the first four grades of primary school. To become a pre-school teacher in Norway requires a [[bachelor's degree]] from a university college. 
*Adjunct teacher (''Adjunkt''): These teachers primarily work between the 5th and 10th grades of lower secondary school, but some are also employed in high schools, usually in minor subjects. To become an adjunct requires a bachelor's degree in a particular subject from a university or university college. Many adjuncts have studied other courses at a lower level, which they teach as a secondary subject (a mathemathics teacher may have studied physics at a lower level, but teaches both). In addition, a one-year course in [[pedagogy]] is required.
*Lecturer (''Lektor''): Lecturers work in upper secondary school and high schools, from 8th grade up to the third year of high school. Lecturers have a master's degree from a university, along with a pedagogy course. Lecturers usually have a more academic approach to teaching than other teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordland|first1=Eva|title=Teacher Training for Norwegian Schools|journal=International Review of Education |date=1969|volume=15|issue=1|pages=65–74|jstor=10.2307/3442072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher education==
{{main|Higher education in Norway}}

Higher education is anything beyond upper secondary school, and normally lasts 3 years or more. To be accepted to most higher education schools you must have attained a general university admissions certificate (''generell studiekompetanse''). This can be achieved by taking general studies while in upper secondary school or through the law of 23/5 where a person must be above 23 years of age, have 5 years of combined schooling and work experience and have passed exams in Norwegian, mathematics, natural sciences, English and social studies. Some degrees also require special electives in second and third grade (e.g. maths and physics for engineering studies.)
[[File:NTNU Trondheim Mainbuilding.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The main building of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.]]

Where there are more applicants than students admitted, applicants are ranked based on their grades from upper secondary school. To gain access to studies commonly requiring a high GPA, like medicine, law and engineering, many students re-sit their upper secondary school examinations to improve their grades.

Higher education is broadly divided into:

* [[University|Universities]], which concentrate on theoretical subjects (arts, humanities, natural science), Supply bachelor (3 yrs), master (5 yrs) and PhD (8 yrs) titles. Universities also run a number of professional studies, including law, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and psychology, but these are generally separate departments that have little to do with the rest of the university institution.
* [[University college]]s (''høyskole''), which supply a wide range of educational choices, including university degrees at bachelor, master and PhD levels, engineering degrees and professional vocations like teacher and nurse. The grade system is the same as it is for universities.
* Private schools, which tend to specialize in popular subjects with limited capacity in public schools, such as [[business management]], [[marketing]] or [[fine art]]s. Private schools do not loom large on the horizon, although the fraction of students attending private schools is 10% in higher education, compared to 4% in secondary and 1.5% in primary education.

There are no formal distinction between vocational and non-vocational higher education.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt;

=== Timeline of Norwegian higher education ===

Before the 19th century the main source for higher education of Norwegians were the [[University of Copenhagen]].
* 1750: The [[Norwegian Military Academy]] is established as the "Free Mathematical School" with officer training and technical disciplines such as geographic surveying, drawing, fortification and mathematics.
* 1757: The "Mining Seminar" is established at [[Kongsberg]] to train engineers for the Kongsberg Mines. This education was moved to the Royal Frederik's University in Christiania (Oslo) in 1814 (three years after the establishment of this university).
* 1811: The [[University of Oslo]] is established as Universitas Regia Fredericiana modeled on the [[University of Berlin]] (the "Humboldt Model").
* 1859: The [[Norwegian University of Life Sciences]] is established as an agricultural school at [[Ås, Akershus|Ås]], [[Akershus]]
* 1910: The [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] is established in [[Trondheim]].
* 1936: The [[NHH|Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]] is established in [[Bergen]].
* 1943: The [[BI Norwegian Business School]] (BI) is established as a merchant school.
* 1946: The [[University of Bergen]] is established.
* 1961: The [[Oslo School of Architecture and Design]] is established.
* 1972: The [[University of Tromsø]] is established.
* 2005: Stavanger University College is given status as university, thus becoming the [[University of Stavanger]].
* 2007: Agder University College (established 1994) is given status as university, thus becoming the [[University of Agder]].
* 2011: Bodø University College becomes  [[University of Nordland]], the eighth university in Norway.
* 2014: [[Telemark University College]], [[Buskerud University College]] and [[Vestfold University College]] merge to form the University College of South-Eastern Norway
*2018: The University College of South-Eastern Norway gain university status, becoming the [[University of South-Eastern Norway]]

==Grading==

Norway has  multiple different [[Grade (education)|grading]] systems, both unique ones and ones that have been based on foreign grading systems. The formerly most common system of grades used at university level was based on a scale running from 1.0 (best) through 6.0 (worst) with 4.0 or below being considered passing grades.

The way the new [[Bologna system]] was introduced implies that students who had started their studies while the old system still was in effect will graduate with transcripts containing grades from both systems (i.e. both numbers and letters).

Lower levels of education use a scale running from 1 through 6, with 6 being the highest and 2 the lowest passing grade. For non-final tests and mid-term evaluations the grades are often postfixed with + or - (except 6+ and 1-) and it is also common to use grades such as 5/6 or 4/3 indicating borderline grades. However, the grades students get on their final paper are either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. A 6 is the equivalent to an A+, a 5 to an A or A-, 4 in the B range, 3 in the C range and so on.

'''English version school''' is a system of education in [[Bangladesh]] that follows the national curriculum and based upon textbooks translated from the [[Bengali language]] into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=English version school in shaping life |url=http://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/108917/English-version-school-in-shaping-life- |newspaper=Daily Sun |access-date=2017-04-05 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 52 English version schools in [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bdeduarticle.com/how-english-version-education-going-on/|title=How English Version Education going on?|website=Bangladesh Education Article|accessdate=March 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the first Internet based English version school opened in Gazipur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/06/18/internet-based-english-medium-school-reaches-kankarparha-in-coxs-bazar|title=Internet-based English medium school reaches Kankarparha in Cox's Bazar|work=bdnews24.com|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English version significantly lacks quality in its textbooks, and many guidance books, available for the Bangla version, are also missing in school level. The condition of English version is too poor as they don't have many textbooks let alone the quality of the textbooks. English version schools are not available in most citie,s and more schools are Bangla version in small cities and upazilas.

== History ==
The government of Bangladesh opened the first English version schools in cadet colleges in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstoday.com.bd/index.php?option=details&amp;news_id=2375474&amp;date=2014-04-13|title=Teacher crisis in English version schools|last=Ahmed|first=Hafez|date=|website=www.newstoday.com.bd|publisher=New Age|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English version is different from [[English-medium education#Bangladesh|English medium schools]]. While English medium schools follow the curriculum of [[Edexcel]] or [[Cambridge International Examinations|Cambridge International Examination]], English version schools follow the national curriculum and hold national examinations in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Spolsky |first=Bernard |last2=Sung |first2=Kiwan |year=2015 |title=Secondary School English Education in Asia: From policy to practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66GsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT81|publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn=978-1-317-64275-6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; English versions schools are usually less costly than English medium schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dhakamirror.com/metropolitan/english-medium-schools-pocketing-money/ |title=English medium schools pocketing money |newspaper=Dhaka Mirror |access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the '''European Lifelong Learning Indicators''' ('''ELLI''') is an initiative of the non-profit [[Bertelsmann Stiftung]] to monitor the state of [[lifelong learning]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsmann Stiftung. ''[http://www.elli.org/en/about-elli/the-elli-project.html/ What is the ELLI Project?]''&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the ELLI project is the ELLI Index. The ELLI index is an annually updated composite indicator summarizing the state of lifelong learning for European countries. The ELLI IT platform is an online portal that provides access to regional data related to learning and socio-economic outcomes in Europe.

The ELLI Index is an annual measure of lifelong learning at national and sub-national levels in Europe. The ELLI Index is a [[composite (finance)|composite index]] created from several other variables. The variables used to create the ELLI Index describe the different learning environments of school, community, work and home life. The variables cover the range of ages from birth to post-retirement. The ELLI Index measures learning in four different domains taken from the [[UNESCO]] framework completed by [[Jacques Delors]] that include learning to know, learning to do, learning to live together and learning to be.&lt;ref&gt;Delors et al. ''Learning: the treasure within. Report to UNESCO of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century''. UNESCO, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual framework: UNESCO dimensions of learning===
The ELLI project references the conceptual framework developed by [[UNESCO]]'s International Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century under the leadership of [[Jacques Delors]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. ''[http://www.unesco.org/delors/ UNESCO  Task Force on Education for the Twenty-first Century]''&lt;/ref&gt; Its report identifies four pillars of lifelong learning: "learning to know", "learning to do", "learning to live together" and "learning to be".&lt;ref&gt;Delors et al. ''[http://www.unesco.org/delors/delors_e.pdf Learning: The Treasure Within]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The conceptual framework of ELLI&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, Bryony, Cartwright, Fernando, &amp; Schoof, Ulrich. ''[http://www.ccl-cca.ca/pdfs/CLI/ELLI_EU_20102608_EN.pdf Making Lifelong Learning Tangible]'' Bertelsmann Stifung, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a revised version of the UNESCO framework. The revisions are based on changes that reflect the European context and European policy environment and have been adapted according to existing data. The operationalization of the dimensions defined by UNESCO using data sources was developed by the Canadian Council on Learning for the Canadian Composite Learning Index (CLI).&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Council on Learning. ''[http://www.cli-ica.ca/en/about/about-cli/pillars.aspx The four pillars of lifelong learning'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Learning to know – the formal education system ====
The dimension of learning to know predominantly assesses the learning of young people within the formal education system.  By including data on the formal system, ELLI measures the input and outcomes of the area in which most ministries of education allocate the majority of their budget and on which policy decision making and policy directions currently place their emphasis. In terms of investment, this dimension contains indicators on total expenditure on education and training. The range of learning opportunities for formal education that are included in ELLI are pre-school, school, higher education and adult education institutions. This pillar also measures learning outcomes from traditional core disciplines such as math, science and reading in secondary schools, as well as completion and attainment rates for post-secondary education. The learning to know pillar covers the majority of the political priorities related to education as stated by European member states.&lt;ref&gt;European Council and European Commission. ''Key competences for a changing world: Draft 2010 joint progress report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the Education &amp; Training 2010 work programme''. European Council and European Commission, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Council. ''Europe 2010: A new European strategy for growth and jobs''. European Council, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Learning to do – vocational learning ====
This  dimension measures  the  participation rates, learning opportunities and investment (by  employers,  government  and individuals) in job-related skills. These skills can improve economic performance and social inclusion through  increasing  job  prospects  and  career  opportunities  for the  individual  and  improve  competitiveness  of  the  enterprise, region  or  country.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein, L. ''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4127173 The contribution of adult learning to health and social capital]'' Routledge: Oxford Review of Education, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://telegraphjournal.canadaeast.com/opinion/article/1063371/ Extending the learning curve]''. Telegraph-Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This dimension predominantly  measures adults’ continual professional development at their place of work through formal, non-formal and informal learning opportunities. It also measures students’ participation in the vocational track  of  the  formal  education  system  which,  depending  on the  country/region,  can  also  include  young  people  within compulsory  education.  The  variables used to construct this dimension predominantly  reflect  investment  in learning  by  employers,  government  and  individuals.

==== Learning to live together – learning for social cohesion ====
This dimension measures   individual-level   attitudes and dispositions  that  promote  social  cohesion  such  as  trust, intercultural   competence   and   political   and   community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, R. ''Bowling alone: The collapse and revival of American community''. Simon and Schuster, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning and education has long been
considered more than an issue of creating  skills  for  employability  and  has  been  part  of  a  social policy  tool  to  sustain  democracy,  create  social  mobility  and increase  levels  of  health  and  social  inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. ''Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education''. Free Press, 1916/1966.&lt;/ref&gt; This dimension tries  to  capture  the  learning  of  the  values  of democracy,  tolerance  and  trust  and  the  skills  and  interest  to be able to engage other people. Learning  to  live  together  starts  at  home,  with learning  from  parents  and  siblings,  and  continues  through interactions at school and work and through involvement in civil society  organizations.  In  most  European  countries there  is  a  specific curriculum  subject  on  citizenship  through which  many  of  these  competences  are  developed;  however, research has indicated that it is the level of democracy at school that is the key driver for developing these competences.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, T et al. ''Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study (CELS): Sixth Annual Report. Young people's civic participation in and beyond school: Attitudes, intentions and influences''. DCSF, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The investment of individuals, families, communities and countries is often much more hidden for the learning to live together dimension as there are fewer exams and qualifications in  this  field  compared  to  traditional  subject-based  disciplines.

==== Learning to be – learning as personal growth ====
This dimension predominantly measures self-directed learning and individuals’ efforts and investment in learning. This learning is facilitated by government provision and information provided on  learning opportunities, but these provisions are considerably less than the provisions for compulsory formal education.&lt;ref&gt;Schuller, T and [[David Watson (academic)|Watson, D.]] ''Learning through life: Inquiry into the future for lifelong learning''. Niace, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This dimension captures informal and  implicit  learning  that  happens  through  engagement  and participation in the home and through community and cultural activities.  The  implicit  learning  measures  include  activities undertaken  in  which  the  individual  does  not  set  out  with  a learning objective in mind and for which there is no certification of learning  achievements  from  participation.  Nevertheless, learning is often highly successful through this style of learning because participation is usually motivated by personal interest. Learning in the home often makes use of the internet, incidental access to information, virtual communities and virtual relationships. In  addition  to  implicit  learning,  there  is  one  indicator  in  this dimension  on  explicit  participation  in  lifelong  learning.  This indicator, which could potentially fit in all dimensions, is placed here because individuals participate in learning for many  reasons.  Ultimately,  participation  in  lifelong  learning  is largely voluntary, which means that those who choose to engage in it are more likely to be motivated by the interests of personal growth and development, which is the focus of this dimension.

===Purpose===
ELLI is a heuristic for understanding [[lifelong learning]] across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.elli.org/fileadmin/user_upload/About_ELLI/Documents/Interview-Glueck-Lernen-Wellbeing.pdf/ Happiness must be learned]''. Gütersloh, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, lifelong learning is understood as a continual process of personal and social development and is understood to reflect not only the benefits that employability and a competitive economy offer but also the individual and social benefits of health, happiness and citizen empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;Akerman, R. Vorlaus, J. and Brown J.''The social and personal benefits of learning: a comprehensive review of international research''. Bertelsmann Stiftung, (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this perspective, the objectives of learning need to reflect a holistic understanding of the individual and combine a variety of knowledge, skills, values and attitudes. From this perspective, the aim of learning is to enhance the qualities of self-esteem, resilience and a positive attitude towards learning and to develop critical thinking and the ability to learn new things. The ELLI index is the first [[composite (finance)|composite index]] used to describe lifelong learning in Europe.

===Uses and limitations===
The ELLI Index can be used to understand how a country or region is performing in relation to others in the field of lifelong learning. The ELLI Index should be interpreted as the a summary of the context and outcomes of lifelong learning as they relate to the social and economic well-being of regions.&lt;ref name="elli.org"&gt;Cartwright, Fernando &amp; Rhode, Martin.  ''[http://www.elli.org/fileadmin/user_upload/About_ELLI/Documents/100830_Methodo_eng_final.pdf Methodological Basis of the ELLI Index]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ELLI Index does not provide an in-depth evaluation of a country or region's policy and performance on lifelong learning. The assumptions used in the creation of the ELLI Index may not be an appropriate basis for comparison for all contexts. When the results are taken out of their specific context there is the risk that they may be oversimplified or misused to make biased or partisan specific policy claims.&lt;ref&gt;Saisana, Michaela, et al. ''Handbook on constructing composite indicators. Methodology and user guide''. JRC/OECD, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The ELLI Index is a starting point for analysis; specific research questions may be more appropriately addressed with more specific data.

===Methodology ===
The ELLI Index is created using a statistical algorithm to combine data provided by statistical agencies and commercial providers into five values for each region with sufficient data.&lt;ref name="elli.org"/&gt; This method uses a combination of [[principal components analysis]] and [[linear regression]] to produce the values for the sub-indices representing the separate learning dimensions. The values for the four learning dimensions  are combined to produce the overall ELLI index using [[inverse-variance weighting]]. This methodology was developed for the CLI and subsequently validated by an independent review and sensitivity analysis
&lt;ref&gt;Saisana, Michaela. ''[http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/111111111/4973/1/eur23274_fulldocument.pdf 2007 Composite Learning Index: Robustness Issues and Critical Assessment]''. Joint Research Centre: European Communities, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ELLI Index Europe 2010 – results===

The overall ELLI Index results show that the Nordic countries Denmark, Sweden and Finland and, in addition, the Netherlands
rank highest. Particularly Denmark and Sweden have been the most successful countries in Europe at implementing the idea of
lifelong and lifewide learning.

The top performers are followed by a group of countries that consist of mainly Central European and Anglo-Saxon countries.
The next group of countries, which are below the EU average, are from Southern and Eastern Europe and range from the Czech
Republic to Poland. The lowest performing group of countries is also in Southern and Eastern Europe,
including Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. However, there are many exceptions to these general patterns. Slovenia,
a former communist country and new member of the European Union, performs well, scoring above the EU average and on par
with Germany.

Further details are documented in: Bertelsmann Stiftung, The ELLI Index 2010, Making Lifelong Learning Tangible.

==IT platform==
The ELLI IT platform (www.elli.org) provides access to regional data related to learning and socio-economic outcomes in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsmann Stiftung. ''[http://www.elli.org/nc/en/indicators/data-table.html ELLI Portal]''&lt;/ref&gt; Theplatform is a [[web application]] interface to a [[geodatabase]]. Currently the regional units in the database are the 27 countries of the European Union and subnational administrative units ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] levels defined by [[Eurostat]]. In the current stage the values for subnational administrative units are only available for Germany. The data populating the databased are provided by [[Eurostat]], regional governments and private data providers.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsmann Stiftung. ''[http://www.elli.org/nc/en/login.html ELLI Portal Login]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ELLI IT platform has basic [[database application]] functions of querying and updating. Users may add new data for existing geographic entities but may not create new geographic entities. All queries and updates to the database are [[managed query|managed]] by the [[user interface]] of the ELLI IT platform.

Users are provided with tools like scorecards, charting, Google [[motion chart]]s and mapping that may be used to visualize and communicate the data  for a specific region in the platform. All of the data provided by the ELLI IT platform may be displayed on a customizable map.

==Report on learning==
Learning takes place on the regional level. Local authorities want to know and manage lifelong learning in the regional level. Therefore, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is developing an ELLI-learning report, which allows to display indicators of learning. The selected indicators are selected according to their importance for steering and monitoring resources for learning and monitoring the results of learning. The ELLI Report on learning is developed in cooperation with the SOFI, Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofi-goettingen.de/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
Despite representing a small part of the ELLI project, the majority of the media response has been to the ELLI Index. Coverage in media has included national news magazines in several countries in Europe and in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, Heinz Peter.

The '''European Master's in Translation''' ('''EMT''') is a partnership project between the [[Directorate-General for Translation]] (DGT) of the [[European Commission]] and a number of universities from a wide range of European countries. EMT is a quality label for translation programmes that offer a [[Master's degree]]. The DGT awards the label to higher education programmes that meet the EMT quality standards for translator training. Master programmes that meet these standards can become members of the EMT network. The initial project was launched in 2006 and the first network was set up in December 2009, following a rigorous selection in which applicant university programmes were evaluated by academic assessors. This first EMT Network consisted of 34 universities in 16 European countries. In 2011, 20 more programmes were selected, bringing the total number of members to 54 programmes in 20 European countries. In the most recent selection round in 2014, EMT membership increased to 63 member programmes from 22 countries, including two non-EU members (from Switzerland). The project serves as a model in its approach to convergence in higher education in Europe, in the broad context of the [[Bologna Process|Bologna process]].


'''Why was the EMT set up?'''

There is a growing demand for highly qualified translators who can provide multilingual communication in both the public and the private sector. Due to the quickly evolving translation markets, professional translators need to cope with activities not traditionally regarded as ‘pure' translation, such as localisation, editing, subtitling or project management. Professionally oriented translator training is needed in order to ensure a good match between graduate competences and employer requirements.

'''What do EMT universities offer?'''

EMT programmes offer a Master's degree, corresponding to a one- or two-year programme in translation (between 60 and 120 points in the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] (ECTS). At the core of each curriculum is a common set of basic skills in translation, regardless of the language combinations. The core of the EMT programmes is defined by the following six professional competences that graduates should acquire: 
* 	translation service provision competence (including customer relationship management)
* 	language and [[Intercultural competence|intercultural competences]] (proficiency in source and target languages, text summary skills and ability to understand information containing cultural allusions)
* 	[[Data mining|information mining]] competence (ability to search for information, by looking critically at various information sources)
* 	technological competence, especially in handling translation memories and terminology management
* 	domain-specific competence (knowledge in a specialist field for professional translation practice)


'''The EMT quality label'''

Only members of the EMT Network can use the EMT name and logo as a quality label when referring to their master’s programmes in translation. The logo is protected as a registered EU trademark. Members receive a membership certificate and sign the EMT charter, which sets out the obligations of EMT members.


'''Activities of the EMT network'''

EMT members meet twice a year to foster cooperation and exchange best practices in the training of future translators who should be competent in all aspects of translation service provision, including marketing, customer relations, time and budget management and invoicing, as well as training in new technologies and specialist fields. To this end the member programmes constantly adapt their programmes to the changing professional working environment. The meetings used to take place in Brussels, but it was recently decided to organise meetings in the home countries of EMT universities as well.

After each selection round, the EMT members elect the EMT Board, which decides on strategic issues and meets regularly, face-to-face or in videoconference. The next selection round will be launched in the autumn of 2018. How are the activities of the EMT supported by the European Commission? The Directorate-General for Translation supports the EMT by:
	
*       organising the EMT Network meetings 
* 	stimulating research cooperation between EMT universities
* 	promoting academia-business cooperation
* 	offering training placements for EMT students.

The ''European Master's in Conference Interpreting'' has a similar approach.

The '''European University Center for Peace Studies''' offered postgraduate political studies from 1990-2013 in [[Stadtschlaining]], [[Austria]].

The institution was founded  in 1988 by Gerald Mader in his capacity as president of the ASPR, with the support of European [[UNESCO]] commissions, and is affiliated to the Austrian Study Center for Peace and Conflict Resolution (ASPR), also located at [[Stadtschlaining]]. 

The original curriculum of EPU was designed along the lines of [[Johan Galtung]]’s ”Plan for a Master of Peace and Conflict Resolution” which he developed for the [[University of Hawaii]]. The EPU has been offering postgraduate programs in [[Peace and conflict studies|Peace Studies]] since 1990. In 1995, EPU was co-winner of the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education. The EPU’s UNESCO Chair on Peace, Human Rights and Democracy was established in 1996.

Between 2010 and 2013, the institute gained accredited private university status and was renamed to "European Peace University (EPU) - Private Universität". In July 2013, EPU's accreditation was withdrawn by Austria's accreditation body; students currently enrolled in the "Master of Arts in Peace and Conflict Studies" programme may finish their studies until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aq.ac.at/de/akkreditierte-hochschulen-studien/entscheidungen_pu.php AQ Austria: Widerruf der Akkreditierung]&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary goals of the EPU are: &lt;br /&gt;
* Spreading the idea of peace in the spirit of the UNESCO
* Giving scientific and educational support to global peace
* Promoting a "world domestic policy" based on sustainable development, cooperative responsibility and ecological security
* Contributing to the development of a global peace culture
* Training and improving individual capabilities in peace-making and [[conflict resolution]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20583">[[Image:Jämsän opisto.jpg|thumb|right|Christian Folk High School in [[Jämsä]], [[Finland]].]]

'''Folk high schools''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Folkehøjskole;'' [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Volkshogeschool;'' [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''kansanopisto'' and ''työväenopisto'' or ''kansalaisopisto;'' [[German language|German]]: ''Volkshochschule'' and (a few) ''Heimvolkshochschule;'' [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Folkehøgskole;'' [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Folkhögskola;'' [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''népfőiskola'') are institutions for [[adult education]] that generally do not grant [[academic degree]]s, though certain courses might exist leading to that goal. They are most commonly found in [[Nordic countries]] and in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. The concept originally came from the Danish writer, poet, philosopher, and pastor [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] (1783–1872). Grundtvig was inspired by the [[Marquis de Condorcet]]'s ''Report on the General Organization of Public Instruction'' which was written in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]]. The revolution had a direct influence on popular education in [[France]]. In the United States, a Danish folk school called Danebod was founded in [[Tyler, Minnesota]].

Despite similar names and somewhat similar goals, the institutions in Germany and Sweden are quite different from those in Denmark and Norway. Folk high schools in Germany and Sweden are in fact much closer to the institutions known as ''folkeuniversitet'' in Norway and Denmark, which provide adult education. However, unlike the ''folkuniversitet,'' folk high schools in Sweden are not connected with a regular [[university]]. The Finnish adult education centers called ''työväenopisto'' and ''kansalaisopisto'' (Swedish: ''arbetarinstitut'', literally ''workers' institute'') are also part of the adult education tradition.

Other countries have also been inspired by Grundtvig's concept of popular education. In [[Nigeria]], the [[United States]], and [[India]], a few schools have been built upon Grundtvig's principles for education.

== History ==
[[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]], regarded as the founder of the folk high school, received inspiration for the concept from the [[England|English]] [[boarding schools]], but Grundtvig's focus was not on formal education but on [[popular education]]. The idea was to give the peasantry and other people from the lower echelons of society a higher educational level through personal development; what Grundtvig called "the living word". The language and history of the fatherland, its constitution and main industries (farming) along with folk songs should be the guiding principles for an education based on a Christian framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danishfolkhighschools.com/about/history |title=A brief history of the folk high school}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first folk high school was established in 1844 in [[Rødding]], [[Denmark]]. The school in Rødding, however, was somewhat aristocratic as chiefly civil servants and rich farmers were enrolled.

Another pioneer for the folk high school was the teacher [[Christen Mikkelsen Kold|Christen Kold]]. His, for that time, highly unorthodox way of teaching gave the folk high schools a broader democratic basis in comparison to the initial religious focus. The teaching took place from November to March because students did farm work the rest of the year. Kold's goal was for students to return to the school regularly in the winter to continue their education. In the beginning only young men could attend the courses, but in 1861 young women also gained access to folk high schools when teaching began being offered from May to July. The men still only attended during winter.

The breakthrough for the idea was the [[Second War of Schleswig]] in 1864 when Denmark had to surrender a large part of its territory. This incident allowed the growth of a new Danish consciousness and nationalism based on enlightenment of the people. Denmark's loss of territory to [[Prussia]] hit the Danish national consciousness hard, but there was a group of young men determined to benefit from the disastrous war, which became a catalyst for a new Danish identity. They established folk high schools all around the country and by 1867 twenty-one folk high schools had opened. Almost everyone working at the folk high schools had been an apprentice of Grundtvig. In 1918 the number of folk high schools in Denmark had reached 68.

The modern folk high schools vary significantly. Some still have a religious focus but most of them are secular. The schools are still "Grundtvigian" folk high schools which means that their focus is on enlightenment, [[ethics]], [[morality]] and [[democracy]] although they are not taught explicitly. The Grundtvigian philosophy is embedded in the teaching of various subjects, e.g. the [[arts]], [[gymnastics]], and [[journalism]]. Most of the schools have an area of expertise, for example [[sports]], [[music]], art or [[writing]]. Since no degree or diploma is awarded the teaching is freer and more informal than at ordinary educational institutions. Most [[Scandinavia]]n folk high schools are boarding schools where the students live for 2–6 months.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hojskolerne.dk/the-folk-high-school/|title=The Danish Folk High School|access-date=2009-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621094849/http://hojskolerne.dk/the-folk-high-school|archive-date=2008-06-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some schools offer programs for an entire year.

== The school and lifelong learning ==
Grundtvig fought for a school with [[popular education]] as the primary focus. The folk high school movement was an act against a [[conservative]] ideal of both education and culture. An act against an ideal of literacy and book-learning, a use of language unknown to common people and a learning ideal where the primary relation was between the individual and the book alone.

The movement therefore started as a row with the old school. Grundtvig fought for a public education as an alternative to the [[university]] elite. The folk high schools should be for those wanting to ''learn'' in general and to help people form part of human relations and [[society]].

The folk high schools have changed naturally – some also radically – through time, but many of Grundtvig's core ideas about the folk high school are still to be found in the way they are run today. The folk high school of today is engaged in a complex modern reality and influenced both by national, international and global questions.

One of the main concepts still to be found at the folk high schools today is "[[lifelong learning]]". The schools should educate for life. They should shed light on basic questions surrounding life of people both as individuals and as members of society.

To Grundtvig the ideal was to give the students a sense of a common best and focusing on life as it really is. Therefore, Grundtvig never set down guidelines for the future schools or a detailed description of how they should be run. He declared that the folk high schools should be arranged and developed according to life as it is and the schools should not hold exams because the education and enlightenment was a sufficient reward.

The essential element was and is the life at the schools. A folk high school becomes what it is because of the individuals of which it is made. Learning happens across social positions and differences – the teacher learns from the student and vice versa in a living exchange and mutual teaching. For Grundtvig dialogue across differences was essential – the ideal was that people must learn to bear with the differences of each other before enlightenment can be realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danishfolkhighschools.com/about/history|title=A brief history of the folk high school - Danishfolkhighschools.com|first=|last=kfh@ffd.dk|website=danishfolkhighschools.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hojskolerne.dk/the-folk-high-school/daily-life-at-the-folk-high-schools/|title=Daily life at the folk high schools - Danishfolkhighschools.com|first=|last=kfh@ffd.dk|website=www.hojskolerne.dk|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
The character of folk high schools differ from country to country, but usually institutions have the following common features:

* Large variety of subjects
* No final exams
* A focus on self-development
* Pedagogical freedom
* Courses last between a few months and one year, with per-course fees
* No [[numerus clausus]] (entrance exams)

Especially in non-German speaking countries, the folk high schools may be [[boarding school]]s or may mainly offer courses for adults age 18–30.

== Europe ==
In addition to the Nordic countries and Germany there are also folk high schools in Switzerland, Austria, and France.

=== Denmark ===
[[File:The Grundtvig Folk High School (4815245143).jpg|thumb|The Grundtvig Folk High School]]
The first folk high school was founded in [[Rødding]], [[Denmark]], in 1844. It began on the initiative of [[Cristen Mikkelsen Kold|Christen Kold]], who was a follower of [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]]. The school was inspired by the need to educate those not fortunate enough to have an education and the poor, or [[peasantry]], who could not spare the time or the money to attend a university. Among the other old folk high schools in Denmark are [[Testrup Folk High School]] (founded 1866), [[Askov Højskole]] (founded 1865) and [[Ry Højskole]] (founded 1892) in [[Jutland]]; [[Vallekilde Folk High School]] in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] (founded 1865), and [[Rødkilde Højskole]] on [[Møn]] (founded 1866). The [[International People's College]] in Helsingør is unique among the Danish folk high schools in that it is the most international one in Denmark, with classes taught in English and teachers and students from countries all around the world attending.

There are around 70 folk high schools in Denmark. The principal subjects of instruction vary from the creative arts such as music, arts, design, writing, to intellectual courses such as religion, philosophy, literature and psychology. Some schools even have courses that specialize in sports. Tuition varies, but is typically around 1300 [[Danish kroner]] per week, including board and lodging.

In recent history, [[globalization]] has exercised an increasingly important influence on Danish schools. Many courses are open to foreigners as well as Danes, and many courses include travelling or voluntary stays in other countries as part of the curriculum.

===Finland===
In 1889, [[Sofia Hagman]] started the first folk high school in Finland in [[Kangasala]].&lt;ref&gt;kansallisbiografia Suomen kansallisbiografia (National Biography of Finland)&lt;/ref&gt; Public, private, secular and religious folk high schools are common in Finland, and there are also worker's high schools, which are governed by the labor movement. There are 184 folk high schools in Finland, with an annual course attendance of 650,000, in 2 million hours of lessons, which are substantial numbers for a country of 5.5 million people.&lt;ref name="kanspahk"&gt;http://kansalaisopistot.fi/kansalaisopistot-pahkinankuoressa/&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in Finnish public education, there are [[tuition fee]]s, per-course and per-lesson fees. The most common subjects are handicraft skills, music, languages, physical education, visual arts, theater and dance.&lt;ref name="kanspahk" /&gt;

===France===

{{main|Popular Education}}

In 1866, during the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]], [[Jean Macé]] founded the ''[[Ligue de l'enseignement]]'' ("Teaching League"), which was devoted to popular instruction. Following the split between the [[Anarchist]]s and the [[Marxist]]s at the 1872 [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], popular education remained an important part of the [[workers' movement]], especially in the [[Anarchism in France|anarcho-syndicalist movement]] which set up, with [[Fernand Pelloutier]], various ''Bourses du travail'' centres, where workers gathered and discussed politics and sciences.  The [[Jules Ferry laws]] that were passed in the 1880s established free, [[Laïcité|secular]], mandatory public education as one of the founding principles of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].  In addition, many teachers were strong supporters of [[Alfred Dreyfus]] during the [[Dreyfus Affair]] of the 1890s.  Afterward, some teachers set up free educational lectures on humanist topics in order to struggle against the spread of [[anti-semitism]] in France.

[[File:Pdc université populaire amlr.png|right|300px|thumb|List of lectures, Université populaire - town of [[Villeurbanne]] - 1936]]
In more recent times, following the 1981 [[French presidential election, 1981|presidential election]] Minister of Education [[Alain Savary]] supported [[Jean Lévi]]'s initiative to create a public high school that would deliver the [[baccalauréat]] but would be organized on the principles of ''[[workers' self-management]]'' (or "autogestion").  This high school took the name ''[[Lycée autogéré de Paris]]'' (LAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lyc-autogere.scola.ac-paris.fr/|title=Official website of the LAP|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314185502/http://lyc-autogere.scola.ac-paris.fr/|archive-date=2007-03-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LAP was explicitly inspired by the secondary school [[Vitruve]], which opened in 1962 in the [[20th arrondissement]] of Paris (and is still active), [[Oslo Experimental High School]], which opened in 1967 in Norway, and [[Saint-Nazaire]] Experimental High School, which opened six months before the LAP.  Theoretical influences include the works of [[Célestin Freinet]], [[Raymond Fonvieille]], [[Fernand Oury]], and other theoreticians of the [[institutional pedagogy]], [[institutional analysis]] ([[René Lourau]] in particular), and [[institutional psychotherapeutic]] movements.

=== Germany, Switzerland and Austria ===
[[File:Deutscher Volkshochschul-Verband, VHS-Logo - Logo of the German adult education centre association.png|thumb|[[Logo]] of the association of the German folk high schools]] 
[[File:Building of the Volkshochschule Düsseldorf and Stadtbibliothek Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|Volkshochschule [[Düsseldorf]] 2016]]
[[File:Krems-Volkshochschule 7783.JPG|thumb|Volkshochschule [[Krems an der Donau]]]]
Folk high schools in Germany, Switzerland and Austria are usually funded on a local level and provide non-credit courses for adults in:

* general education
* vocational education
* political education
* German as a second language (especially for [[Immigration|immigrants]])
* integration courses (especially for newly arrived [[refugees]])
* various foreign languages
* various forms of art
* information technology
* health education
* preparatory classes for school exams (especially for the [[Abitur]] or [[Matura]])

This type of folk high school is currently most widespread in Germany. Because they offer preparatory classes for school exams, in Germany these schools also function as the equivalent of [[adult high school]]s in other countries. Germany also has folk high schools that are boarding schools, called ''Heimvolkshochschulen''.

===Norway===
The first folk high school in [[Norway]], [[Sagatun folk high school|Sagatun]], was founded in 1864. As of 2012, there were 77 folk high schools spread across the country, thirty of which were [[Christian]] schools. Folk high schools provide opportunities in general education, primarily for young adults. These schools are different from lower secondary schools, upper secondary schools, and higher education. All students are eligible for normal financial aid. Some folk high schools are connected to some sort of organization, but a large number of them are owned by a foundation and some are owned by the county. Most courses last for one year, but a few schools give a second year course. Common course options include outdoor skills, land use skills, the arts such as photography or painting, music such as jazz or rock, Norwegian language &amp; culture, and travel skills.

=== Sweden ===
The first folk high schools in [[Sweden]] were established in 1868. The first school was open only to men, but already in 1870, the first folk high school for females was founded by [[Fredrique Paijkull]].&lt;ref&gt;Paykull, släkt, urn:sbl:8076, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av HG-m), hämtad 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, there are about 150 folk high schools throughout the country, most of which are situated in the [[countryside]], often in remote areas. [[Tuition]] is free, and the students are eligible for normal financial aid for expenses such as accommodation and other school costs. After graduating, the students are eligible to study at a university.

Some schools, for example [[Södra Vätterbygdens Folkhögskola]] near [[Jönköping]], cooperate with schools in other countries and have an exchange student program.

== Nigeria ==
In 1998, the Grundtvig Movement of Nigeria led by Dr. Kachi Ozumba Snr. established [[Grundtvig International Secondary School]], an independent co-educational secondary school built upon Grundtvig's principles for education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grundtvigsecondary.com/|title=Grundtvig International Secondary School -|website=grundtvigsecondary.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Americans [[John C. Campbell]] and Olive Dame helped create a folk high school in rural Appalachia based on observations of European folk high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://folkschool.org/index.php?section=articles&amp;article_cat_id=21&amp;article_id=5|title=John C. Campbell Folk School|website=folkschool.org|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[John C. Campbell Folk School]] opened in 1925 in [[Brasstown, North Carolina]], and it is still offering classes today. Students can learn American traditional arts and crafts, including blacksmithing, ceramics, cooking, jewelry, dance and music.

[[Myles Horton]], who co-founded the civil rights-focused [[Highlander Folk School]] in [[New Market, Tennessee]] in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;http://highlandercenter.org/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt; was also inspired by the Danish folk high school movement, as can be read in his autobiography ''[[The Long Haul (autobiography)|The Long Haul]]''.

The '''Foundation for Teaching Economics''' (FTE) is an organization founded in 1975 that promotes [[economics education]] by hosting free workshops for high school students and teachers, and by providing educational resources to teachers.

==History==
The organization was established in 1975 by [[Jaquelin H. Hume]], the co-founder of [[Basic American Foods]], the world's largest producer of dried onion and garlic as well as dried potato products (used primarily for [[instant mash potatoes]]).&lt;ref name="brucelambert"&gt;Bruce Lambert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/04/nyregion/jaquelin-hume-86-dried-food-producer-and-philanthropist.html Jaquelin Hume, 86, Dried Fruit Producer and Philanthropist], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 04, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicagotribune"&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-10-06/news/9103310403_1_mr-hume-dehydrated-potatoes-ronald-reagan-presidential-foundation Food Processing Pioneer Jack Hume], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 06, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="princetonalumni"&gt;[http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/70/4/index.xml Jaquelin Holliday Hume '28] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305190630/http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/70/4/index.xml |date=2016-03-05 }}, ''Princeton Alumni Weekly'', January 22, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes the teaching of economics in elementary and high schools in the United States.&lt;ref name="brucelambert"/&gt;

As of 2009, Jaquelin H. Hume's two sons [[William J. Hume]] and [[George H. Hume]] served on the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name="fte"&gt;[http://www.fte.org/about-the-fte/board-of-trustees/ Foundation for Teaching Economics: Board of Trustees]&lt;/ref&gt; The other trustees were [[Orley Ashenfelter]], a Professor of Economics at [[Princeton University]]; Arthur J.

Landry, an attorney; John Manfredi, an investor; [[Douglass North]], the 1993 winner of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]; [[Vernon L. Smith]], the 2002 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences; and Christopher A. Wright, an investor.&lt;ref name="fte"/&gt;

'''Friedrich Loos''' was an Austrian [[Biedermeier]] style [[Painting|painter]], [[etcher]] and [[lithographer]]. He was born in [[Graz]] on 29 October 1797. He studied at the [[Vienna]] Academy with [[Joseph Mössmer]] and also went on study tours through the Austrian Alpine regions. From 1835 to 1836 he lived in Vienna, and as of 1846 he sojourned in [[Rome]]. He then moved to [[Kiel]], where he worked as a drawing teacher at the university as of 1863 and where he also died on 9 May 1890. In his pictures he emphasized light and color in order to loosen up his [[painting]], as well as to harmonize and unite the details.

The '''Graduate Management Admission Test''' ('''GMAT''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|m|æ|t}} ({{respell|JEE|mat}}))) is a [[Computerized adaptive testing|computer adaptive test]] (CAT) intended to assess certain analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skills in written English for use in admission to a graduate management program, such as an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/the-gmat-advantage.aspx|title=The GMAT Advantage}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires knowledge of certain specific grammar and knowledge of certain specific algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. According to the test owning company, the [[Graduate Management Admission Council]] (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/learn-about-the-gmat-exam.aspx|title=Learn About the GMAT Exam|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be taken up to five times a year.  Attempts must be at least 16 days apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.mba.com/us/frequently-asked-questions/gmat-exam-policies.aspx| title =GMAT Exam Policies| website =MBA.com| publisher =GMAC| access-date =March 8, 2016| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMAT is a registered trademark of the Graduate Management Admission Council. More than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world accept the GMAT as part of the selection criteria for their programs. [[Business schools]] use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of graduate [[management]] programs, including [[MBA]], [[Master of Accountancy]], [[Master of Finance]] programs and others. The GMAT is administered in standardized test centers in 114 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; According to a survey conducted by Kaplan Test Prep, the GMAT is still the number one choice for MBA aspirants despite the increasing acceptability of [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]] scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-26/study-few-mba-applicants-consider-taking-the-gre |title=Study: Few MBA Applicants Consider Taking the GRE |author=Alison Damast |date=April 26, 2012 |publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, it has continually performed validity studies to statistically verify that the exam predicts success in business school programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/about-the-gmat-exam/validity-reliability-fairness.aspx|title=Validity, Reliability and Fairness|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1953, the organization now called the [[Graduate Management Admission Council]] (GMAC) began as an association of nine [[business schools]], whose goal was to develop a standardized test to help business schools select qualified applicants. In the first year it was offered, the assessment (now known as the Graduate Management Admission Test), was taken just over 2,000 times; in recent years, it has been taken more than 230,000 times annually.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/gmac-interactive-map/gmac-statistics-video.aspx|title=GMAC Statistics Video|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504061935/http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/gmac-interactive-map/gmac-statistics-video.aspx|archivedate=May 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially used in admissions by 54 schools, the test is now used by more than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; On June 5, 2012, GMAC introduced an integrated reasoning section to the exam that aims to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate information presented in multiple formats from multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/integrated-reasoning.aspx | title =Integrated Reasoning Section | website =MBA.com | publisher =GMAC | access-date =March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The intended purpose of the GMAT is to predict student success in graduate business programs.  According to GMAC, there is a .459 correlation (21% variance) between total GMAT scores and mid-program student grades based on data it collected between 1997 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmac.com/market-intelligence-and-research/research-library/validity-and-testing/research-reports-validity-related/gmat-validity-study-summary-report-for-1997-to-2004.aspx |title=GMAT Validity Study Summary Report for 1997 to 2004 |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent research has shown significantly different results.  Independent research has shown that the GMAT can explain only 4.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA (Grade Point Average) while undergraduate GPA can explain 17.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bedsole |first=Charles B. |url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/bedsole_charles_b_201312_edd.pdf |title=Apples to Apples?: Comparing the Predictive Validity of the GMAT and GRE for Business Schools and Building a Better Admissions Formula |publisher=University of Georgia. |date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, more recent independent research has shown that the GMAT does not add predictive validity after undergraduate GPA and work experience have been considered and that even undergraduate GPA alone can be used in lieu of considering the GMAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pratt |first=William R. |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08832323.2015.1027164 |title=Predicting MBA Student Success and Streamlining the Admissions Process |publisher=Journal of Education for Business |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and timing==
The GMAT exam consists of four sections: an analytical writing assessment, an integrated reasoning section, a quantitative section, and a verbal section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/us/gmat-adds-new-thinking-cap.html?_r=1&amp;ref=education |title=GMAT Adds New Thinking Cap|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total testing time is three hours and seven minutes. Test takers have 30 minutes for the analytical writing assessment and another 30 minutes to work through 12 questions, which often have multiple parts, on the integrated reasoning section and are given 62 minutes to work through 31 questions in the quantitative section and another 65 minutes to get through 36 questions in the verbal section.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Section !! Duration in minutes !! Number of questions
|-
| Analytical writing assessment || 30 || 1 essay
|-
| Integrated reasoning || 30 || 12
|-
| Quantitative || 62 || 31
|-
| Verbal || 65 || 36
|}

The quantitative and verbal sections of the GMAT exam are both multiple-choice and are administered in the computer-adaptive format, adjusting to a test taker’s level of ability. At the start of the quantitative and verbal sections, test takers are presented with a question of average difficulty. As questions are answered correctly, the computer presents the test taker with increasingly difficult questions and as questions are answered incorrectly the computer presents the test taker with questions of decreasing difficulty. This process continues until test takers complete each section, at which point the computer will have an accurate assessment of their ability level in that subject area and come up with a raw score for each section.

On July 11, 2017, the GMAC announced that from now on the order in which the different parts of the GMAT are taken can be chosen at the beginning of the exam.

Three options will be available at the test center:
* Analytical Writing Assessment, Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative, Verbal (original order)
* Verbal, Quantitative, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment
* Quantitative, Verbal, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing.aspx|title=GMAT changes order of sections.|last=|first=|date=|website=GMAT Exam Format and Timing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the GMAC officially shortened the test by half an hour, shortening the verbal and quant sections from 75 minutes each to 65 and 62 minutes, respectively, and shortening some of the instruction screens.

===Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA)===
The AWA consists of one 30-minute writing task—analysis of an argument. It is important to be able to analyze the reasoning behind a given argument and write a critique of that argument. The essay will be given two independent ratings and these ratings are averaged together to determine the test taker's AWA score. One rating is given by a computerized reading evaluation and another is given by a person at GMAC who will read and score the essay themselves without knowledge of what the computerized score was. The automated essay-scoring engine is an electronic system that evaluates more than 50 structural and linguistic features, including organization of ideas, syntactic variety, and topical analysis. If the two ratings differ by more than one point, another evaluation by an expert reader is required to resolve the discrepancy and determine the final score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gmac.com/gmat/understand-gmat-exam-scores/how-to-use-the-analytical-writing-assessment-score.aspx |title=How to use the Analytical Writing Assessment Score|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analytical writing assessment is graded on a scale of 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) in half-point intervals (a score of zero means the answer was gibberish or obviously not written on the assigned topic or the test taker failed to write anything at all on the AWA).

|-

===Integrated reasoning===
Integrated Reasoning (IR) is a section introduced in June 2012 and is designed to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate data presented in multiple formats from multiple sources. The skills being tested by the integrated reasoning section were identified in a survey of 740 management faculty worldwide as important for today’s incoming students.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-21/the-new-gmat-gets-put-to-the-test|title=The GMAT gets put to the Test|publisher=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The integrated reasoning section consists of 12 questions (which often consist of multiple parts themselves) in four different formats: graphics interpretation, two-part analysis, table analysis, and multi-source reasoning. Integrated reasoning scores range from 1 to 8. Like the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), this section is scored separately from the quantitative and verbal section. Performance on the IR and AWA sections do not contribute to the total GMAT score.

The integrated reasoning section includes four question types: table analysis, graphics interpretation, multi-source reasoning, and two-part analysis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In the table analysis section, test takers are presented with a sortable table of information, similar to a spreadsheet, which has to be analyzed. Each question will have several statements with opposite-answer options (e.g., true/false, yes/no), and test takers click on the correct option. Graphics interpretation questions ask test takers to interpret a graph or graphical image. Each question has fill-in-the-blank statements with pull-down menus; test takers must choose the options that make the statements accurate. Multi-source reasoning questions are accompanied by two to three sources of information presented on tabbed pages. Test takers click on the tabs and examine all the relevant information, which may be a combination of text, charts, and tables to answer either traditional multiple-choice or opposite-answer (e.g., yes/no, true/false) questions. Two-part analysis questions involve two components for a solution. Possible answers are given in a table format with a column for each component and rows with possible options. Test takers have to choose one response per column.

===Quantitative section===
The quantitative section of the GMAT seeks to measure the ability to reason quantitatively, solve quantitative problems, interpret graphic data, and analyze and use information given in a problem. Questions require knowledge of certain algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. There are two types of quantitative questions: problem solving and data sufficiency. The use of calculators is not allowed on the quantitative section of the GMAT. Test takers must do their math work out by hand using a wet erase pen and laminated graph paper which are given to them at the testing center.  Scores range from 0 to 60, although GMAC only reports scores between 6 and 51.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Rudner|title=Demystifying the GMAT: Scale Scores|url=http://www.gmac.com/~/media/Files/gmac/Research/validity-and-testing/demystifyingthegmat_scalescores.pdf|publisher=GMAC|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem solving questions are designed to test the ability to reason quantitatively and to solve quantitative problems. Data sufficiency is a question type unique to the GMAT designed to measure the ability to understand and analyze a quantitative problem, recognize what information is relevant or irrelevant and determine at what point there is enough information to solve a problem or recognize the fact that there is insufficient information given to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/understanding-your-score-report.aspx|title=Understanding Your Score Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal section===
The verbal section of the GMAT exam includes the following question types: reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and sentence correction. Each question type gives five answer options from which to select. Verbal scores range from 0 to 60; however, scores below 9 or above 44 are rare.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

According to GMAC, the reading comprehension question type tests ability to analyze information and draw a conclusion. Reading comprehension passages can be anywhere from one to several paragraphs long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-reading-comprehension-question.aspx | title =Sample Reading Comprehension Question | website =MBA.com | publisher =Graduate Management Admission Council | access-date =March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, the critical reasoning question type assesses reasoning skills.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-critical-reasoning-question.aspx | title =Sample Critical Reasoning Question | website =MBA.com | publisher =Graduate Management Admission Council | access-date =March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, the sentence correction question type tests grammar and effective communication skills. From the available answer options, the test taker should select the most effective construction that best expresses the intent of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-blog-hub/the-official-gmat-blog/2011/sep/idioms-sentence-correction-and-the-gmat-exam.aspx|title=Idioms, Sentence Correction, and the GMAT Exam|work=The Official GMAT Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-sentence-correction-question.aspx|title=Sample Sentence Correction Question|work=The Official GMAT Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
The total GMAT score ranges from 200 to 800 and measures performance on the quantitative and verbal sections together (performance on the AWA and IR sections do not count toward the total score, those sections are scored separately). Scores are given in increments of 10 (e.g. 540, 550, 560, 570, etc.).

The score distribution conforms to a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]] with a [[standard deviation]] of approximately 120 points, meaning that about 68% of examinees score between 430 and 670.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; More precisely, over the three-year period 2014--2017 the mean score was 556.04 with a standard deviation of 120.45 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/what-your-percentile-ranking-means.aspx|title=What Your Percentile Ranking Means. Retrieved October 5th, 2017.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final score is not based solely on the last question the examinee answers (i.e. the level of difficulty of questions reached through the computer adaptive presentation of questions). The algorithm used to build a score is more complicated than that. The examinee can make a mistake and answer incorrectly and the computer will recognize that item as an anomaly. If the examinee misses the first question his score will not necessarily fall in the bottom half of the range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talento-Miller|first1=Eileen|title=The CAT in the GMAT|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-blog-hub/the-official-gmat-blog/2010/jan/the-cat-in-the-gmat.aspx|website=MBA.com|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After previewing his/her unofficial GMAT score, a GMAT test taker has two minutes to decide whether to keep or cancel a GMAT score at the test center.  A test taker can also cancel a score online within the 72 hours after the scheduled exam start time.  A cancelled score can be reinstated for 4 years and 11 months after the date of the test for a fee of $50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/frequently-asked-questions/gmat-scores-and-score-reports.aspx|website=MBA.com|title=GMAT Scores and Score Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling and preparing for the exam==
Test takers may register for the GMAT either online at mba.com or by calling one of the test centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/schedule-a-gmat-appointment/scheduling-information.aspx|title=Scheduling Information|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; To schedule an exam, an appointment must be made at one of the designated test centers. The GMAT may not be taken more than once within 16 days but no more than five times in a rolling 12-month period and no more than eight times total, even if the scores are canceled. Official GMAT exam study materials are available on the mba.com online store and through third-party vendors. The cost of the exam is $250. All applicants are required to present valid ID when taking the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/prepare-for-the-gmat-exam/plan-for-test-day/presenting-proper-identification.aspx |title=Presenting proper Identification}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of the test, test takers have the option of canceling or reporting their scores.  As of July 2014, test takers were allowed to view their score before making this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-scoring/your-score-report/preview-your-gmat-score.aspx |title=Preview Your GMAT Score  |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are [[test preparation]] companies that offer GMAT courses. Other available test preparation resources include university text books, GMAT preparation books, sample tests, and free web resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/reach-and-recruit-students/prepare-candidates-for-the-exam-classroom.aspx| |title=Prepare Candidates for the GMAT® Exam &amp; the Classroom |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council |accessdate=November 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GMAT Waiver ==
In order to effectively evaluate all candidates, some graduate schools offer GMAT Waivers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/articles/2017-06-05/what-mba-applicants-should-know-about-test-waivers-test-optional-programs|title=What MBA Applicants Should Know|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GMAT waiver is designed for working professionals who have multiple years of experience and would like to forego taking the GMAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://onlinebusiness.syr.edu/mba/gmat-waiver-policy/|title=Why Our Online MBA Doesn't Require the GMAT I MBA@Syracuse GMAT Waiver Policy|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If requesting a GMAT waiver, you must include a letter with your professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/2205/4-easy-steps-to-get-a-gmat-waiver.html|title=4 Easy Steps to Get a GMAT Waiver - MastersPortal.com|website=www.mastersportal.com|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs evaluate GMAT waivers on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

Founded in 1996 by [[Strive Masiyiwa|Strive]] and Tsitsi Masiyiwa the foundation operates as a [[Capernaum Trust]], offering [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[University education|University]] [[scholarship]]s to orphaned and vulnerable  children.

In 2008 the foundation launched the [[Waterford Kamhlaba]] scholarship to take [[Joshua Nkomo]] Scholarship beneficiaries to  [[Waterford Kamhlaba]] College in Swaziland.&lt;ref name="Waterford"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Times|first1=Reporter|title=Meet Kayitare and Mucyo, the history makers|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2015-07-15/190636/|website=newtimes.co.rw|publisher=New Times|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the foundation ventured into health and  crisis relief through the National Health Care Trust&lt;ref name="NHTZ"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Health|first1=Ministry|title=National Health Care Trust Zimbabwe donates to Ministry of Health and Child Welfare|url=http://www.mohcc.gov.zw/publication/health-matters/finish/16-health/9-health-matters/0|website=mohcc.gov.zw/|publisher=Ministry of Health and Child Welfare Zimbabwe|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which participated in the fight against  the [[2008 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak]]&lt;ref name="National Health Care Trust"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jongwe|first1=Anthony|title=Econet ramps up corporate social responsibility|url=http://www.financialgazette.co.zw/econet-ramps-up-corporate-social-responsibility/|website=financialgazette.co.zw|publisher=Financial Gazzette|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tokwe Mukorsi Dam|Tokwe Mukosi]] disaster in [[Zimbabwe]] as well as the fight against [[Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone|Ebola]] in Africa.&lt;ref name="Ebola"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reports|first1=Staff|title=Strive orders Econet to help Ebola effort|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-18672-Strive+orders+Econet+to+help+Ebola+effort/news.aspx|website=newzimbabwe.com|publisher=New Zimbabwe|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UZ"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ventures|first1=Africa|title=POLICY HELPING AFRICAN YOUTHS FINANCE HIGHER EDUCATION – TSITSI MASIYIWA|url=http://venturesafrica.com/tsitsi-masiyiwa-helping-youth-anglophone-africa-finance-higher-education/|website=venturesafrica.com/|publisher=Venturesafrica|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Dhaka]] was established in 1921 as the first university in [[East Bengal]]. Following demands from [[Khwaja Salimullah|Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur]] and others, Viceroy [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]] proposed on 2 February 1912, that a new university should be established in this partition of [[Bengal]].

[[File:DSC03638.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Curzon Hall]], where the science faculty of [[University of Dhaka]] was established in 1921.]]

==Introduction==
The University was established as compensation for the annulment of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|1905 Partition of Bengal]]. The partition had established East Bengal and [[Assam]] as a separate province, with Dhaka as its capital. However, the partition was abolished in 1911. In 1913, public opinion was solicited before the university scheme was given its final shape, and the Secretary of State approved it in December 1913.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book

Jamal |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |year=2012 |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first vice-chancellor of the university was [[Philip Joseph Hartog]], who had been academic registrar of the University of London for 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 June 1947 |title=Sir Philip Hartog, a Great Educationist |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Times/1947/Obituary/Philip_Joseph_Hartog |publisher=[[The Times]] |location=London |page=6 |quote=[Hartog] was appointed Academic Registrar to the University of London, and held that office with great efficiency for 17 years ... Hartog was made [Dhaka University's] first vice-chancellor.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and early days==
Established in 1921, under the Dacca University Act 1920 of the [[Indian Legislative Council]], the university is modelled after British universities. Academic activities started on 1 July 1921, with three faculties: Arts, Science, and Law. Classes were taught in 12 Departments: Sanskrit and Bengali, English, Education, History, Arabic and Islamic Studies, Persian and Urdu, Philosophy, Economics and Politics, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Law. Initially there were  three dormitories for students: Salimullah Muslim Hall, Dacca Hall and [[Jagannath Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univdhaka.edu/DownLoads/DU-Prospectus-2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225093039/http://www.univdhaka.edu/DownLoads/DU-Prospectus-2008.pdf |archivedate=25 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Nazrul Tomb 2.A.M.R.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Tomb of [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] near the Dhaka University campus mosque]]

The university continued to grow under the direction of leaders including Harry Langley, A. F. Rahman, R. C. Majumdar, and [[Mahmud Hussain]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Under Vice-Chancellor Hussain, the University consolidated its fundamental focus on academics. It also made national headlines when he extended an invitation to then-[[President of Pakistan]], [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]], who declined citing 'security reasons'. This was the first of many subsequent refusals from high-ranking officials to visit [[East Pakistan]].

===Students from 1921 to 1948===
There were few students in the early years of the University of Dhaka. Enrollment  in the first few years is shown in the table below:&lt;ref&gt;Dhaka University &amp; the History of East Bengal: An interview of [[Abdur Razzaq (professor)|Professor Abdur Razzaq]], written by-[[Sardar Fazlul Karim]] সরদার ফজলুল করিম রচিত ''ঢাকা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় ও পুর্ব বঙ্গীয় সমাজ: অধ্যাপক আবদুর রাজ্জাকের আলাপচারিতা''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, the University of Dhaka invited [[Rabindranath Tagore]] to attend a conference called ''The Meaning of Art''. He came to Dhaka and visited [[Curzon Hall]] on 10 February 1926. Tagore is often accused of opposing  the establishment of the university at Dhaka even though no evidence of such opposition has ever been found. He was awarded D.Litt by Dhaka University in 1936.

===Teachers who were killed in 1971===
Students and teachers of the University of Dhaka played a vital role in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh]]. The Ordinance of 1961 was annulled and substituted by the Dacca University Order of 1973., The new Order restored autonomy, and provided a democratic atmosphere for the teachers and students where they could engage freely in academic and intellectual pursuits.

Teachers at the University of Dhaka who were killed during the liberation war include:&lt;ref name=Banglapedia/&gt;

'''Initial Flight Training''' (IFT) is a preliminary [[flight training]] course for [[U.S. Air Force]] officers, to include active-duty Regular Air Force, [[Air Force Reserve]], and [[Air National Guard]], who have been selected for [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|Pilot]] or [[Combat Systems Officer]] (CSO) training.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baseops.net/militarypilot/usaf_ift.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Attendance consists of both newly commissioned USAF officers (i.e., [[second lieutenant]]s) and more senior commissioned USAF officers (e.g., [[first lieutenant]]s or [[Captain (United States)|captains]] and, in very rare instances, [[Major (United States)|majors]]) who previously served in non-rated non-flying assignments.

IFT replaced three earlier programs at separate locations, known as:
* '''Pilot Indoctrination Program''' (PIP), '''Initial Flight Training''' (IFT) or '''Academy Flight Training''' (AFT) for [[USAF Academy]] cadets, said program being conducted by military and civilian instructors at the USAF Academy Airfield;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airnav.com/airport/KAFF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aopa.org/airports/KAFF&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Flight Indoctrination Program''' (FIP) for college/university [[Air Force ROTC]] cadets, said program being conducted by contracted civilian flight instructors at nearby civilian airports adjacent to those academic institutions, and;
* '''Flight Screening Program Officer Training''' (FSPOT) at [[South Texas Regional Airport at Hondo|Hondo Municipal Airport]], Texas for USAF [[Officer Training School]] graduates

All three programs were originally for pilot candidates only, versus the current pilots and navigators-''cum''-CSOs, and only applied to pilot candidates who did not already hold at least an [[FAA]] [[Private Pilot Certificate]].  These programs were consolidated into the single current program, a civilian contractor operation under direct USAF auspices and oversight of the [[12th Flying Training Wing]] (12 FTW) at [[Randolph AFB]], Texas, and its subordinate [[306th Flying Training Group]] (306 FTG) at the [[USAF Academy]], Colorado.  IFT is conducted at [[Pueblo Memorial Airport]], Colorado and has the greatest similarity to the former FSPOT employed for OTS graduates, since it is conducted at a single site and all students are already commissioned USAF officers.

IFT students must be undergraduate flying training (UFT) candidates and be medically qualified with a Federal Aviation Administration Class III airman medical certificate and a USAF Flying Class 1 or 1A flight physical, as appropriate.  The IFT curriculum is highly structured and very fast-paced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aetc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123026057 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607211424/http://www.aetc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123026057 |archivedate=2008-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IFT program is under the direct cognizance of U.S. Air Force's [[306th Flying Training Group]] (306 FTG) of the [[Air Education and Training Command]] (AETC), and began operations on 1 October 2006.  Doss Aviation, under contract with [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), conducts flight screening for 1,300 to 1,700 USAF officers annually. As the gateway to USAF aviation, IFT provides initial flying training allowing students to successfully transition to the [[Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program]] (ENJJPT), [[Air Education and Training Command|Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training]] (SUPT), [[Air Education and Training Command|Undergraduate Helicopter Pilot Training]] (UHT), and [[Air Education and Training Command|Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training]] (UCSOT) at one of several air force bases, naval air stations, and one army air field throughout the United States. The {{convert|45|acre|m2|adj=on}} IFT campus is located immediately adjacent to the [[Pueblo Memorial Airport]], Pueblo, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetc.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123028911 Air Education &amp; Training Command Article on IFS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121224137/http://www.aetc.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123028911 |date=2007-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are paired up into hotel-style rooms. They share a bathroom, and are provided a desk and dresser for their personal belongings. A single building encompasses all the facilities the students need; students never need to step outside the facility except to access their aircraft. The large building houses the gym, which includes a workout gym with volleyball and basketball courts, weightlifting equipment and treadmills, as well as a cafeteria and a small communal room known as the Tiger Den. A large auditorium is used during the first week of training to teach students the basics of aviation. A second floor houses all the classrooms where students study and meet with their instructor pilots before performing their graded flights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dossifs.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67&amp;Itemid=65 Doss IFS Facility Layout] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710145505/http://dossifs.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67&amp;Itemid=65 |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4115">The '''Jodeldiplom''' ("[[yodeling]] diploma") is a fictitious degree created for a sketch by German humorist [[Vicco von Bülow|Loriot]].&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaufmann |first=Matthias |date=19 January 2018 |title=Endlich gibt's das Jodeldiplom |trans-title=At last, the yodeling diploma exists |url=http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/uni/schweiz-an-der-hochschule-luzern-kann-man-jetzt-jodeln-studieren-a-1188809.html |language= |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |access-date=4 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch pokes fun at the numerous degrees awarded by universities and [[folk high school]]s, which grant their recipients social status without providing any meaningful qualifications for the labor market.&lt;ref name=faz&gt;{{cite news |last=Hollmann |first=Frank |date=8 May 2008 |title=Nicht mehr als ein Jodeldiplom |trans-title=Nothing more than a yodeling diploma |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/china-spezial/wirtschaft/fachkraeftemangel-in-china-nicht-mehr-als-ein-jodeldiplom-1548912.html |work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |language=de |access-date=4 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has since gained currency in German to refer to superfluous, useless, vanity-driven, or purchased academic qualifications (such as from a [[diploma mill]]), similar to the English terms [[underwater basket weaving]] or [[Mickey Mouse degree]].

==Loriot sketch==
The sketch "Yodeling School" was produced by [[Radio Bremen]] as part of the episode ''Loriot VI''&lt;ref name="loriot.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jboard.loriot.de/jboard/v3/werke/p5_1.htmlo |title=Die Offizielle Loriot-WebSite - Werke: Fernsehen |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=loriot.de |access-date=4 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and first broadcast on [[Das Erste]] on 7 December 1978. The sketch takes place in the ''Institute for Modern Yodeling'', where the adult students are practicing yodeling texts (for example: "Holleri du dödl di, diri diri dudl dö"). The yodeling instructor, Dr. Vogler is meticulously dictating the correct pronunciation to his students, who repeat his dictation in unison. In response to an incorrect answer ("Dö dudl dö") by Mrs. Hoppenstedt ([[Evelyn Hamann]]), Dr. Vogler corrects her and says that "Dö dudl dö is [[future perfect]] tense used at sunrise."

Mrs. Hoppenstedt is interviewed after the course by a reporter Viktor Schmoller (Loriot) for the "Women's Journal of Radio Bremen". In the interview, Mrs. Hoppenstedt explains her participation in the course that as a housewife and mother, when the children are out of the house, she wants to have the feeling that she is standing on her own feet, and wants to have "something of her own", a "''Jodeldiplom''."

==Jodlar-Prob==
A serious "yodeling diploma", the so-called "Jodlar-Prob" exists in the [[Allgäu Alps]]. In 1934, the ''Wertacher Jodlergruppe'' was founded as one of the first yodeling groups in the [[Allgäu]]. Every year in [[Wertach]], the "Wertacher Jodlar-Prob" takes place to preserve and continue the tradition. The shared knowledge of yodeling is offered in a seminar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressemeldung-bayern.de/wertach-jodlar-prob-in-den-allgaeuer-bergen-146/ |title=Pressemitteilung zur Wertacher Jodlar-Prob |access-date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yodeling degree==
The [[Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts]] in [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]] announced Yodeling as a course of study beginning in the winter semester 2018.&lt;ref name=spiegel /&gt;&lt;ref name=abendblatt&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 January 2018 |title="Du dödl di" - Jodeln an der Universität |trans-title="Du dödl di" - Yodeling at university |url=https://www.abendblatt.de/nachrichten/article213185617/Du-doedl-di-Jodeln-an-der-Universitaet.html |work=[[Hamburger Abendblatt]] |language=de |access-date=5 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the course of study, the students will be awarded a Bachelor of Arts in music.

Miller |publisher=Brown University |format=pdf |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's primary research focus is the structure and function of [[cell membrane]]s, especially [[chloroplast]] thylakoid membranes.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; Miller is a co-author of a major introductory college and high school biology textbook published by [[Prentice Hall]] since 1990.&lt;ref name="millerandlevine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millerandlevine.com/book/dragonfly-booklet.pdf |title=Biology by Miller and Levine |publisher= |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110081327/http://www.millerandlevine.com/book/dragonfly-booklet.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller, who is [[Roman Catholic]], is opposed to [[creationism]], including the [[intelligent design]] (ID) movement.  He has written two books on the subject: ''[[Finding Darwin's God]]'', which argues that acceptance of [[evolution]] is compatible with a belief in [[God]]; and ''[[Only a Theory]]'', which explores ID and the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' case as well as its implications in science across America.

==Biography==
Miller graduated from [[Rahway High School]] in [[Rahway, New Jersey]] before attending [[Brown University]]. At Brown, he received his [[Bachelor of Science|Sc.B.]] in biology in 1970. He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in biology from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="BrownFaculty"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://bms.brown.edu/faculty/m/kmiller/ | title=Ken Miller: Molecular, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry | publisher=[[Brown University]] | year=2008 | first= | last= | accessdate=2008-06-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610164830/http://bms.brown.edu/faculty/m/kmiller/ | archivedate=2008-06-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1974 to 1980, he taught at [[Harvard University]]. His research involves problems of structure and function in [[biological membrane]]s, often involving [[electron microscopy]]. In May 2014, Miller received the [[Laetare Medal]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]].

==Textbook==
Miller is the co-author (with [[Boston College]] neurobiologist and marine biologist Joseph Levine)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mypearsontraining.com/pdfs/TG_MLBio_AboutAuthors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of a major introductory college and high school biology textbook published by [[Prentice Hall]] since 1990.&lt;ref name="millerandlevine.com"/&gt; The current edition was published in 2010 by Pearson (which now owns Prentice Hall).&lt;ref name="pearsonschool.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZxAa |title=About the Authors |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Prentice Hall approached Joseph Levine to write the textbook after reading an article he wrote in [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] magazine; Levine, who is a former student of Miller's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5PJG_-XlwE |title=Kenneth Miller - Evolution vs. Intelligent Design FULL |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; then recruited Miller as a co-author.&lt;ref name="millerandlevine.com"/&gt; Miller and Levine have also co-written a college-level textbook published by the former [[D.C. Heath and Company]], first edition in 1991, entitled ''Biology: Discovering Life''.&lt;ref name="pearsonschool.com"/&gt;

==Science advocacy==
Miller has voiced his support for what he calls "pro-science" candidates in politics. He has campaigned for school board and education candidates who support the teaching of [[evolution]] in [[Kansas]] and [[Ohio]]. In the science community, he has sought to elevate the understanding of scientists of the roots of the creationist movement, and to encourage the popularization of scientific concepts.

Miller has appeared in court as a witness, and on panels debating the teaching of intelligent design in schools. In 2002, the [[Ohio State Board of Education]] held a public debate between two scientists, including Miller, and two proponents of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/debate.html |title=Goodbye, Columbus |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=Ken Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; He testified for the plaintiffs, but only as a fact witness (not as an expert), in ''[[Selman v. Cobb County]]'', testing the legality of stickers calling evolution a "theory, not a fact" that were placed on the biology textbook Miller authored. In 2005, the judge ruled that the stickers violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncse.com/resources/news/2005/GA/201_victory_in_cobb_county_1_13_2005.asp |title=Victory in Cobb County |accessdate=20 September 2007|date=13 January 2005|publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/01/13/evolution.textbooks.ruling/index.html |title=Judge: Evolution stickers unconstitutional |accessdate=20 September 2007|date=14 January 2005 |work= |publisher=CNN |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070804120121/http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/01/13/evolution.textbooks.ruling/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was vacated on appeal because of missing records of the previous trial. The case was remanded for additional evidentiary inquiry and new findings, and a list of factual issues that the court would probably want to address included as item 15 a reference to Miller's testimony regarding “the colloquial or popular understanding of the term [theory]” and the suggested question as to whether he has any qualifications to testify as an expert on the popular meaning of the word "theory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200510341.pdf ''Selman, et al. vs. Cobb County Board of Education''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701080143/http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200510341.pdf |date=2007-07-01 }}, 25 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was remanded back to the lower court and was eventually settled out of court. Miller was also the plaintiff's lead expert witness in the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', challenging the school board's mandate to incorporate intelligent design into the curriculum. The judge in that case also ruled decisively in favor of the plaintiffs.

In 2006 the [[American Society for Cell Biology]] gave him a Public Service Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascb.org/filetracker.cfm?fileid=514 Forrest, Miller to receive ASCB Public Service Awards]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''ASCB Newsletter'', July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) also recognized Miller for his contribution to the public education of evolution in the United States.  Miller also appeared at the 2006 [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship]] at [[Yale University]], delivering his lecture "Darwin, God, and Dover:  What the Collapse of 'Intelligent Design' Means for Science and for Faith in America."  He won the 2008 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;AAAS Programme Book Color Insert after p. 64. Award presented 14 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also speaks at conferences, notably the [[Skeptics Society]]'s Origins Conference in October 2008 with [[Nancey Murphy]], [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], [[Leonard Susskind]], [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]], [[Paul Davies]], [[Christof Koch]], [[Donald Prothero]], and [[Victor J. Stenger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://origins.skeptic.com/speakers_Ross.php | title=Origins Conference, October 3–4, 2008 | publisher=[[Skeptics Society]] |year=2008  | first= | last=  | accessdate =2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller has also spoken at the [[Veritas Forum]] on topics such as the [[relationship between science and religion]] and the [[existence of God]].&lt;ref&gt;http://veritas.org/speakers/ken-miller/&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller has appearaned on the Comedy Central television show ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2007/09/19/CampusNews/Prof-Ken.Miller.Life.As.Sciences.Media.Darling-2977311.shtml |title=Prof. Ken Miller: life as science's media darling |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=Firestone, Chaz |date=2007-09-20 |work=Brown Daily Herald |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611025110/http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2007/09/19/CampusNews/Prof-Ken.Miller.Life.As.Sciences.Media.Darling-2977311.shtml |archivedate=2008-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ncse.com/resources/news/2008/US/172_ken_miller_on_science_friday_6_13_2008.asp | title=Ken Miller on ''Science Friday'' and ''Colbert Report'' | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] | date= 13 June 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-10-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller has also made many appearances on [[C-SPAN]] debating proponents of creationism and intelligent design.  He has debated several supporters of intelligent design including biochemist [[Michael J. Behe]].

He gave a [[Faraday Institute]] lecture in April 2009 on "God, Darwin and Design"&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/2009.html Darwin Online listing]&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared on the ''[[Today Programme]]'' arguing, "The issue of God is an issue on which reasonable people may differ, but I certainly think that it's an over-statement of our scientific knowledge and understanding to argue that science in general, or evolutionary biology in particular, proves in any way that there is no God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8023000/8023996.stm News recap], ''[[Today Programme]]'', BBC, 29 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010 Miller was elected as a Fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/news/show/sixteen_notable_figures_in_science_and_skepticism_elected_csi_fellows/ |title=Sixteen Notable Figures in Science and Skepticism Elected CSI Fellows |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2016, Miller has been listed on the Board of Directors of the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ncse.com/about/board |title=Board of Directors |website=ncse.com |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903011654/https://ncse.com/about/board |archivedate=2016-09-03 |accessdate=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Becker''' is a member of the City Assembly of [[Juneau]], [[Alaska]]. She has also been Juneau's mayor and a member of Juneau's school board.

== Early years==
Mary Becker earned a bachelor's degree from [[Albertson College of Idaho]].&lt;ref name= threemore&gt;Fry, Eric (August 28, 1998). "Three more file for school board seats - Incumbents decline to run again; voters to see new names, faces". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to Juneau around 1966.&lt;ref name= researchgroup&gt;Fry, Eric (September 17, 2001). "School Board elections: Becker calls board 'research group' that works to figure out best policy". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Becker worked as a school teacher from 1967 to 1997.&lt;ref name= threemore/&gt;&lt;ref name= speakout&gt;Fry, Eric (September 20, 1998). "Board candidates speak out". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Becker ran for one of two open seats on the Juneau School Board in 1998.&lt;ref name= threemore/&gt; Board members Incumbents Sally Rue and Tom Wagner had decided not to run for reelection.&lt;ref name= 1998g/&gt; Robert Starbard, Edith McHenry, Jan Marie Ferrell, and Stan Ridgeway were also candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Stockton, Paysha (October 6, 1998). "Proposition 1 gets out the vote". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker said that Juneau needed a new high school, and she advocated for reducing class sizes.&lt;ref name= threemore/&gt; She was in favor of a ballot measure to approve sale of $55.5 million in bonds in order to build a high school at Dimond Park for 1,500 students.&lt;ref name= speakout/&gt; Becker supported high-school proficiency tests as a way to the academic progress of students.&lt;ref name= tackle&gt;Fry, Eric (September 23, 1998). "Candidates tackle school standards". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of the ''[[Juneau Empire]]'' endorsed her candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;"Our Endorsements" (editorial). ''Juneau Empire''. October 5, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker and Ridgeway won the election for three-year terms on the Juneau School Board.&lt;ref name= 1998g&gt;Fry, Eric (October 7, 1998). "Becker, Ridgeway on school board". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During Becker's first term in office, she voted against adding a program to teach life skills to students with disabilities, a program to teach infant care to teenage parents, and a program to help emotionally disturbed students in a new high school being built in Dimond Park.&lt;ref name= newschool&gt;Fry, Eric (March 29, 2000). "New school makes room for disabled, teen-age parents". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker said that having those programs in just one school was sufficient.&lt;ref name= newschool/&gt;

Becker voted in favor of a new school policy making it optional for students to stand for the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]].&lt;ref name= pledge&gt;Fry, Eric (September 20, 2000). "Standing for Pledge now optional". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker said that being seated for the Pledge of Allegiance is not respectful, although a policy requiring standing is not worth fighting in court.&lt;ref name= pledge/&gt; 

In 2001, Becker voted in favor of a teacher's contract that gave current teachers a 4.5 percent raise.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Eric (September 13, 2001). "Teachers' contract negotiations leave behind hard feelings". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Becker ran for reelection in 2001.&lt;ref name= Powelltorun&gt;Markell, Joanna (August 3, 2001). "Powell to run again: 2 announce race for city offices". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck said she wanted to stay on the school board in order to be involved in the remodeling of [[Juneau-Douglas High School]], the building of a new high school, and attaining academic standards.&lt;ref name= Powelltorun/&gt; Becker won the election.&lt;ref name= 2001g/&gt; 

In January 2002, a teenager held a banner reading "[[Bong Hits 4 Jesus]]" across the street from the [[2002 Winter Olympics torch relay]].&lt;ref name= upholds&gt;Krueger, Andrew (March 20, 2002). "School board upholds decision on student banner: Father plans to take fight over torch relay banner to court". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; The teenager was a student of [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] and was across the street from the school while holding the banner.&lt;ref name= upholds/&gt; The high school suspended the student for ten days because of the banner. The teenager wanted the suspension expunged from his record, but Becker and the rest of the school board voted to uphold the suspension.&lt;ref name= upholds/&gt; The teenager filed a civil-rights lawsuit against the school principal and the school board, claiming his federal and state constitutional rights to free speech had been violated.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Andrew (April 26, 2002). "Banner suit filed in court". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; The case, Morse v. Frederick, ended up going to the [[United States Supreme Court]], and the Court held, 5–4, that the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] does not prevent educators from suppressing, at or across the street from a school-supervised event, student speech that is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.&lt;ref&gt;''Morse v. Frederick'', No. 06-278, [{{SCOTUS URL Slip|06|06-278}} slip. op.] at 8 (U.S. June 25, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Becker voted against a proposal to buy $25,000 of new equipment for Juneau-Douglas High School's auto mechanics program and to provide $10,000 to the Juneau Community Charter School to help it cover its budget shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;O'Malley, Julia (September 4, 2002). "School Board OK's more charter school funds". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Becker voted for a new teachers' contract, giving a two-percent raise to teachers and eliminating 40 teachers' positions during the following two years.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Eric (December 19, 2003). "School Board ratifies raises". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Juneau residents voted against building a new high school for 1,080 students in Dimond Park in a special election, Becker supported building a school with a 840-student capacity instead.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Eric (September 30, 2004). "Incumbent has a classroom perspective". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of voters approved the alternative proposal in a subsequent election.&lt;ref&gt;Bluemink, Elizabeth (October 6, 2004). "Valley school wins go-ahead". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Becker supported a new dress code for students, saying it would improve race relations and improve parental involvement in education.&lt;ref name= fresh&gt;"Fresh perspectives are the best choice" (editorial). ''Juneau Empire''. October 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Becker ran for reelection to the school board in 2004.&lt;ref name= boardballot&gt;Fry, Eric (August 19, 2004). "Becker, Peters OK'd for School Board ballot". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker said she was running for reelection because she wanted to be involved in the building of a second high school in Juneau.&lt;ref name= boardballot/&gt; She was one of three candidates for two available seats on the school board.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Eric (August 27, 2004). "Three run for 2 spots on School Board". ''Juneau Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of the ''Juneau Empire'' endorsed the other candidates in the race.&lt;ref name= fresh/&gt; Becker won reelection to another term in office.&lt;ref name= 2004g/&gt;

The '''Ministry of Education''' was a central government department in the United Kingdom responsible for education policy in [[England and Wales]].

The Ministry of Education was created by the [[Education Act 1944]] and based on the '''Board of Education''', which had been created in 1899. It was replaced by the [[Department of Education and Science]] in 1964 when it was merged with the [[Ministry of Science]].

'''Nazareth College''' is a [[coeducational]], [[Private colleges|private]], religiously independent college in [[Pittsford, New York|Pittsford]], a suburb of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Founded by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] in 1924, the college offers more than 60 undergraduate majors &lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/academics]&lt;/ref&gt;and 24 graduate programs. Alumni and locals commonly refer to the school as "Naz" for short. 

==History==
[[File:Nazareth College.JPG|thumbnail|right|Golisano Academic Center, Nazareth College]]

===Founding===
At the request of [[Thomas Francis Hickey (bishop)|Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey]] of Rochester, five [http://www.ssjrochester.org/ Sisters of St. Joseph] founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in [[Rochester, New York]]. The original mansion that housed the college was known as "the Glass House." At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a [[liberal arts]] core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nazareth_college/12190480324/ 402 Augustine Street].

===Move to East Avenue===
In January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]]. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work.  Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church. 

Nazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, added in 2018, is women's ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/news/2017/June/331/chris-baudo-named-women-s-hockey-coach-at-nazareth-college].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
In the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres.  As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.

In 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from ''The Official Catholic Directory,'' having been declared no longer a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] institution by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester|Rochester Bishop]] Matthew H. Clark. It was the second time since [[Pope John Paul II]] issued [[Ex Corde Ecclesiae]], the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities in 1990, a bishop declared a historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = New York Archdiocese Says Marist College 'No Longer Catholic'|accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Nazareth added Peckham Hall, the Integrated Center for Math and Science. Named after lead donors Nancy and Larry Peckham, the $30 million facility supports majors in math and science fields, as well as education programs. It also provides important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs. 
[[File:Study Area in Peckham Hall, Nazareth College, Rochester, NY.jpg|thumb|Students work in a study area in Peckham Hall at Nazareth College in Rochester, NY]]

In 2015, the York Wellness and Rehabilitation Institute opened after an extensive renovation/expansion of Carroll Hall consolidated and doubled the size of the clinics associated with the college's School of Health and Human Services and added collaboration space.

==Academics==
Nazareth College is organized into four core schools:
*The College of Arts and Sciences
*The School of Education
*The School of Health and Human Services
*The School of Management

Nazareth offers more than 60 four-year [[undergraduate]] programs, 20 [[master's degree]] programs, a [[Doctorate]] of [[Physical Therapy]], and three post-baccalaureate certificate programs.

Tishler attended public schools and [[Harvard College]] where he majored in [[biochemistry]].  He wrote his senior thesis on [[carboxypeptidase]], in the lab of Dr. C.J. Fu at the [[Jimmy Fund]], graduating ''[[cum laude]]'' in 1959.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Tishler attended [[Yale School of Medicine]] and graduated in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=In Quest of Panacea |year=1987 |publisher= |page= |quote=Peter Tishler graduated medical school in 1962. ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Re1qAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Peter+Tishler&amp;dq=Peter+Tishler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a2AoVfOPHJG1sATmxILIBg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While at Yale, Tishler began working with the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory at [[Boston City Hospital]] from 1963 to 1977.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=The Harvard Medical Unit at Boston City Hospital |year= |publisher= |page=1188 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFxrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Peter+V.+Tishler%22&amp;dq=%22Peter+V.+Tishler%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0mgoVZHGB8LfsAS754DABQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCQ |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William B. Castle]], discoverer of [[intrinsic factor]], introduced him to [[Sidney H. Ingbar]] with whom Tishler began work on the metabolic actions of [[thyroid hormone]].   [[Maxwell Finland]] contributed to Tishler’s scientific and clinical work.&lt;ref&gt;Finland, Maxwell and Castle, William B., Eds. (1983) ''The Harvard Medical Unit at Boston City Hospital, Volume II''.  University of Virginia Press (for the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine).&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}   Tishler’s interest in genetics arose from his laboratory research in the study of thyroid function in patients with [[phenylketonuria]].

During the [[Vietnam War]], Tishler worked as a [[Public Health Service]] officer at the [[National Institutes of Health]]. In the following years, he continued his basic laboratory work, but also was concerned with genetics and medicine in the terms of population and [[epidemiology]]. He was also involved in familial studies of [[hypertension]] at one of the first community health centers in the U.S., [[East Boston Neighborhood Health Center]].

The '''Piet Zwart Institute''' is a post-graduate institute for study and research in art, media and design based in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands. Named in memory of the Dutch designer [[Piet Zwart]], it was inaugurated in 2001. The current postgraduate study program structure had been introduced earlier in 1999.

==Overview==

The '''Piet Zwart Institute''' is the center for postgraduate study and research of the [[Willem de Kooning Academy]], Rotterdam's art school. The de Kooning Academy is a part of [[Hogeschool Rotterdam]], a university of applied sciences. 

The Piet Zwart Institute currently includes five Master study programs and one research program: Masters in Fine Art, Retail Design, Interior Architecture, Media (with the specializations ''Networked Media'' and ''Lens-Based Media'') and Education in Art, and a research program ''Communication in a Digital Age''. The Fine Art and Networked Media programs are housed in a
building separate from the main Academy building on the Karel Doormanhof 45 in central Rotterdam. It is also the main location for in-house public lectures.
The main academy building houses the study programs in Interior Architecture, Retail Design, Education in Art and Lens-Based Digital Media, and the research programs.

==Study Programs==

All Master study programs are two year full-time courses. They are based on the premise that contemporary art, design and media only exist in a wider social and cultural context, and connect artistic production and research with the public realm of discourse and display.  With the exception of the Master of Education in Art which is jointly organized with the [[CodArts]] conservatory and whose degree is specific to the Dutch education system, all programs are held in English and have a highly international and multidisciplinary body of students and teachers. The programs are regarded as rigorous. The institute is highly selective with each of the programs only admitting up to 12 students annually. 

Since 2000, the study and research programs of the Piet Zwart Institute have published books on contemporary art, media and design in collaboration with publishing houses like [[Revolver Books]], [[The MIT Press]] and [[OpenMUTE]]. The institute also collaborates with local organizations such as TENT/Centrum voor Beeldende Kunst, [[Witte de With]], [[V2  Institute for the Unstable Media]], [[Boijmans van Beuningen]] Museum, WORM, Duende, Het Wilde Weten and [[Goethe-Institut]] Rotterdam. The academic degree of Masters is validated by the [[NVAO]], the joint accreditation organization of the Dutch and Flemish ministries of education.

==Research Programs==

Since 2002, the Piet Zwart Institute initiated three research programs, ''Media Design Research'' (2002-2006, led by Matthew Fuller) and ''Communication in a Digital Age'' (since 2008, led by Florian Cramer) and ''Cultural Diversity'' (since 2010, led by Hugo Bongers). Research fellows included [[Lev Manovich]], [[Bureau of Inverse Technology]], [[Jodi (art collective)|jodi]], [[Simon Yuill]] and [[Alessandro Ludovico]]. Among the publications were an early handbook on [[open content]] licenses written by Lawrence Liang and the anthology ''Software Studies'' (ed. by Matthew Fuller, The MIT Press, 2008).

==Location==

The Piet Zwart Institute is spread over two locations in the center of the port town of Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the Karel Doormanhof 45 and the main building of the [[Willem de Kooning Academy]], Blaak 10.

==International Talent==

The Institute is regarded as selective with rigorously intensive and highly international study programs. Students get the chance to develop, present and exhibit their work and research nationally and internationally during their time of study, and are exposed to meetings and opportunities with prominent international practitioners and theoreticians in their respective field of study. Students also get the opportunity to visit international events relevant to their study and work, such as art biennials, media and design festivals and cultural studies conferences. 

The Fine Art and Networked Media programs also hold annual graduation shows at major art venues in Rotterdam; in the past, they included the Boijmans van Beuningen museum, TENT, Centrum voor Beeldende Kunst Rotterdam and WORM.  Recent exhibition titles include: ''Never Odd or Even'' and ''Global/Positions/Systems'', 2009, ''My Travels with Barry'' and ''YOU ARE PWNED'', 2008.

==Staff==

All study and research programs are based on a small core staff and a great number of visiting tutors. Course directors have been Anke Bangma (1999-2007) and Vanessa Ohlraun (since 2007) for Fine Art, Raphael van Amerongen (2001-2007) and Margaret Wijnands (since 2008) for Retail Design, Alex Suarez (since 2010) for Interior Architecture, Matthew Fuller (2002-2006), Florian Cramer (2006-2010) and Renee Turner (since 2010) for Networked Media, Simon Pummell (since 2009) for Lens-Based Digital Media, Robin Punt (2006-2010), Mirjam van Tilburg (since 2010) and Jojanneke Gijsen for Education in Art. 

Some notable staffers and regular tutors include: 

* [[Rodney Fitch]] (Interior Architecture and Retail Design) 
* [[Ine Lamers]]

Some notable guest tutors and lecturers include: 
* [[Will Holder (designer)]]
* [[Georg Schöllhammer]]
* [[Jodi (art collective)|jodi]]
* [[ubermorgen.com]]
* [[Lev Manovich]]
* [[Inke Arns]]

'''''Pridgen v University of Calgary''''' was a freedom of speech case which took place in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], in 2010. The case deals with two university students, Keith and Steven Pridgen, who were found guilty and punished by the [[University of Calgary]] in 2008, on grounds of "non-academic misconduct".

The University of Calgary defines "non-academic misconduct" as:

(a) conduct which causes injury to a person and/or damage to University property and/or the property of any member of the University community;

(b) unauthorized removal and/or unauthorized possession of University property;

(c) conduct which seriously disrupts the lawful educational and related activities of other students and/or University staff.&lt;ref&gt;Full text for Pridgen v University of Calgary, 2010 ABQB 644 available at[(CanLII), &lt;http://canlii.ca/t/2cxd9&gt; retrieved on 2013-03-19 "Pridgen v. University of Calgary"] ''canlii.ca'' December 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta|Court of the Queen's Bench of Alberta]] found the University of Calgary to be wrong in prosecuting ten students, including the Pridgen brothers, in regards to comments made about a professor on Facebook. The key ruling in this case was that the universities are not exempt from, and that these students were in fact protected under, section 2(b) of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].  This case is notable as it highlights the jurisdiction of the Charter in terms of both new media technologies and university institutions in Canada.

==Background==
Keith and Steven Pridgen were undergraduate students at the University of Calgary in 2008. The twin brothers shared a Law and Society class being taught by Aruna Mitra. Professor Mitra was teaching this class for the first time in her career and many of the students were very critical of her knowledge of the course. A [[Facebook]] page entitled “I NO Longer Fear Hell, I Took a Course with Aruna Mitra” was created and many students began posting comments.

In particular Steven Pridgen's comment on November 13, 2007 read:

“Some how I think she just got lazy and gave everybody a 65....that's what I got.  Does anybody know how to apply to have it remarked?”

Many students had similar concerns to Pridgen's and after having their work re-marked, a number of them did in fact receive higher grades.&lt;ref&gt;Jaclyn Nardone, [http://j-source.ca/article/university-calgary-students-win-facebook-free-speech-battle "University of Calgary students win Facebook free speech battle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323212551/http://j-source.ca/article/university-calgary-students-win-facebook-free-speech-battle |date=2013-03-23 }} ''J-source.ca''December 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Pridgen also commented on August 26, 2008:

“Hey fellow LWSO. Homees.. So I am quite sure Mitra is NO LONGER TEACHING ANY COURSES WITH THE U OF C !!!!! Remember when she told us she was a long-term professor?  Well Actually she was only sessional and picked up our class at the last moment because another prof wasn't able to do it ...lucky us.  Well anyways I think we should all congratulate ourselves for leaving a Mitra-free legacy for future students!”&lt;ref&gt;Jaclyn Nardone, [http://j-source.ca/article/university-calgary-students-win-facebook-free-speech-battle "University of Calgary students win Facebook free speech battle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323212551/http://j-source.ca/article/university-calgary-students-win-facebook-free-speech-battle |date=2013-03-23 }} ''J-source.ca''December 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2008, Aruna Mitra complained about the Facebook page to the Interim Dean of the Faculty of Communication and Culture at the University of Calgary. Dean Tettey called a meeting for the ten students who posted material about Mitra on the Facebook page. The meeting took place on September 18, 2008 and included four professors from the department as well as the Dean. At this meeting all ten students, including the Pridgen brothers, were found guilty of non-academic misconduct.

On November 20, 2008, the Appellant's received a letter from Dean Tettey advising them that their comments “clearly caused unwarranted professional and personal injury to Prof. Mitra and clearly meets the criteria for non-academic misconduct as outlined in the University of Calgary Calendar”.

Keith Pridgen was put on probation for 24 months and both brothers were required to write a letter of apology to Prof. Mitra and refrain from posting or circulating defamatory material regarding any faculty members of the University of Calgary.

The Pridgen brothers appealed the decision to the University of Calgary Review Committee and later to the Board of Governors of the University of Calgary however neither of these attempts succeeded in having the decision overturned.

==Opinion of the Court==
Eight main issues to be determined were laid out by the Honourable Madam Justice J. Strekaf:

(a) Does the Charter apply to the disciplinary proceedings taken by the Respondent;

(b) If, so were the Applicants' Charter rights infringed;

(c) Were the actions taken by the University ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Province of Alberta;

(d) Did the Board of Governors err in refusing to hear the Applicants appeals;

(e) Were the Applicants' denied a fair hearing;

(f) Did the Review Committee provide adequate reasons for its decisions;

(g) Did the Review Committee err in concluding that the activities of the Applicants constituted non-academic misconduct; and

(h) What, if any, remedy should be granted to the Applicants.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Beyko, [http://www.law.ucalgary.ca/system/files/November+Issue.pdf "Pridgen v University of Calgary: Facebook and Freedom of Expression"] ''Moot Times''November 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court determined from previous cases that "a non-government entity may still be subject to the Charter of Rights and freedoms when implementing a specific government policy or program". Justice Strekaf distinguished that the University was acting as agent of the provincial government in providing accessible post-secondary education services to students in Alberta pursuant to the provisions of the PSL Act. Justice Strekaf felt there was sufficient evidence to show that [[universities in Alberta]] have some level of reliance on government funds and therefore they are not a "Charter free zone". Justice Strekaf concluded that comments made by Keith and Steven Pridgen, regarding Professor Mitra, on Facebook did not constitute academic misconduct and the Pridgen brothers' right to freedom of expression, under section 2(b) of the Charter, was infringed by the University of Calgary Review Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Full text for Pridgen v.

'''Ruth Manorama''' (born 30 May 1952) is a [[Dalit]] woman social activist from [[Bangalore]], [[India]] who has actively crusaded for Dalit women's rights, the rights of domestic workers and those in the unorganized labour sector, as well as urban slum dwellers. In 2006, she was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206173631/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/recip/2006/ruth-manorama.htm |archivedate=6 February 2007 |url=http://www.rightlivelihood.org/recip/2006/ruth-manorama.htm  |title=Right Livelihood Award Recipient Ruth Manorama |publisher=Right Livelihood Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education ==
Ruth Manorama was born on 30 May 1952 to Dorothy &amp; Paul Dhanraj, the eldest daughter of five girls and three boys. To escape the worst of caste oppression, her parents converted to Christianity. Ruth grew up seeing her parents consistently involved in social work. Her mother Dorothy fought for the right to be educated against her conservative family and eventually became a teacher and campaigned for women's education rights. Heavily influenced by [[Pandita Ramabai]], Dorothy named her daughter Manorama after Pandita Ramabai's second daughter, who was named Mano.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialworkfootprints.org/articles/navaratnas-of-professional-social-work-in-india-women-social-workers-who-changed-millions-of-lives-dr-ruth-manorama|title=Navaratnas of Professional Social Work in India :   Women Social Workers Who Changed Millions of Lives Dr. Ruth Manorama|website=SKH|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father Paul successfully mobilised economically disadvantaged people in neighbouring villages to fight for their rights to land that they'd been living on for generations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/jd-s-fields-right-livelihood-awardee-in-bangalore-south-6313|title=JD(S) fields Right Livelihood awardee in Bangalore South {{!}}|date=2014-04-04|work=Citizen Matters, Bengaluru|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wikipeacewomen.org/wpworg/en/?page_id=2440|title=Ruth Manorama (India) {{!}} WikiPeaceWomen – English|website=wikipeacewomen.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth's parents strongly encouraged her and her sisters to be educated and self-reliant.

In 1975 Manorama completed a master's degree in social work from the [[University of Madras]]. In 2001, Manorama was awarded an honorary doctorate degree “for the distinguished contribution made to church and society” by the Academy of Ecumenical Indian Theology and Church Administration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/laureates/ruth-manorama/|title=Ruth ManoramaThe Right Livelihood Award|website=www.rightlivelihoodaward.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-20|date=2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth is married to N. P. Samy, a trade unionist who is the General Secretary of the [[National Centre for Labour]]. They have two daughters together.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Career ==
Ruth Manorama has dedicated her life to battling a host of interconnected issues related to oppressions arising from caste, gender and class hierarchies. Among the issues she has fought for are the rights of domestic workers and the unorganised labour sector, slum dwellers, Dalits, and for the empowerment of marginalised women. She works at both the grassroots level as well as focuses on mass mobilisation and advocacy at the international level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ruth is an integral part of many organisations working for the rights of Dalits, women, slum dwellers, and the unorganised sector. Some of these are:
* General Secretary, Women’s Voice Karnataka – Founded in 1985, it works for the rights of women slum dwellers and the unorganised sector.
* President, National Alliance of Women – This was set up following the [[World Conference on Women, 1995|Fourth World Conference of Women in Beijing in 1995]] with the aim of monitoring government performance on its responsibilities to women.
* Joint Secretary, Christian Dalit Liberation Movement – Formed in the 1980s, this movement sought to mobilise Dalit Christians for reservations in public appointments and educational institutions.
* Secretary, Karnataka State Slum Dwellers Federation – This organisation educates &amp; mobilises slum dwellers to fight for their rights.

* President, [[National Federation of Dalit Women]] (NFDW) – In 1993, Ruth helped organise a public hearing on Violence Against Dalit Women, which led to the creation of NFDW in 1995. It is a special platform to address the unique violence and discrimination faced by Dalit women, especially in rural areas and slums &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.challengers.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=137|title=Women Empowerment:  Dr Ruth Manorama, President, National Alliance of Women|last=Administrator|website=www.challengers.in|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She is also a part of several international collectives and organisations such as:
* Core Group Member, Asian Women’s Human Rights Council – an Asian network of women involved in human rights work. 
* Member, Advisory Group Of The International Women’s Rights Action Watch (Asia Pacific) – this group supports and facilitates advocacy campaigns for women's rights
* Co-Convener, International Lobby &amp; Advocacy for Dalit Human Rights – In 1998, on the 50th anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], this campaign was founded to re-iterate that Dalit rights are human rights, and created a national signature campaign with 2.5 million signatures to root out casteism in India.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Within India, she is also a member of the Karnataka State Planning Board, the State Commission for Women, the Task Force on Women’s Empowerment of the Government of India and a number of other state and national bodies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, Manorama led processions of over 150,000 people to protest against ‘Operation Demolition’ by the State Government of Karnataka, which was a forced eviction campaign. She and other activists demanded protection for those to be evicted and the right to live legally and with dignity. On behalf of the slum dwellers, Ruth fought court cases at the High Court and the Supreme Court of India against this move by the Karnataka administration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/a-relentless-crusader/article2284501.ece|title=A relentless crusader|last=Umashanker|first=Sudha|date=2011-07-23|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth also established the first trade union in the country in 1987 for domestic workers in Bengaluru and strove for inclusion in the Minimum Wages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ruth has worked to mobilise the underprivileged from a grass-root levels since the 1980s. In more than 120 slums, she has been responsible for the mobilisation, training and empowerment of women to deal with the discrimination and violence that they face and to take leadership within their communities. Ruth is also committed to the cause of emancipation of Dalits. She has participated in several struggles against human rights violations, for land rights and for the cause of Dalit women and contributed immensely to the mainstreaming of Dalit issues.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''“Dalit women in India are the Dalits among Dalits and suffer from three-fold oppression — on account of gender as a result of patriarchy, caste ‘the untouchable', and class — as they hail from the poorest and most marginalised communities. Eighty per cent of Scheduled Castes live in rural areas, are dependent on wage employment and have to contend with high rates of under employment which results in greater incidence of poverty,”'' said Ruth forcefully in an interview with The Hindu.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She was named as the [[Janata Dal (Secular)]] candidate from [[Bangalore South (Lok Sabha constituency)]] for 2014 General Elections.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Bangalore/No-money-no-biryani-Only-audacity-of-hope/articleshow/33096145.cms No money, no biryani.

'''The Data Incubator''' is a [[data science]] education company.  It offers corporate data science training and placement services.  It is best known for an 8-week [[Coding Bootcamp|educational fellowship]] preparing students with [[Master's degree]]s and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhDs]] for careers in [[big data]] and [[data science]].&lt;ref name=SU/&gt;

== Founding ==

The Data Incubator was founded in 2014 in [[New York City]] by [[Tianhui Michael Li]], a former data scientist at local-mobile-social startup [[Foursquare]] and [[Andreessen Horowitz]].&lt;ref name=CW&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2488869/big-data/cornell-tech-funded-startup-launching-bootcamp-for-data-scientists.html| title=Cornell Tech funded startup launching bootcamp for data scientists |newspaper=[[Computer World]] |first=Jaikumar |last=Vijayan |date=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hertzfoundation.org/dx/fellows/fellow_profile.aspx?d=11154| title=Founder Michael Li's Hertz Foundation Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was incubated by [[Cornell Tech]].&lt;ref name=CW/&gt;

The company is best known for an 8-week educational fellowship preparing students with Masters and PhD degrees for careers in big data and data science.  The fellowship's expenses are paid for by hiring companies and it remains free for admitted fellows.&lt;ref name=TDI/&gt; The program has four campuses: [[New York City]], [[Washington DC]], [[San Francisco]], and Online.&lt;ref name=TDI/&gt; The program also offers corporate training to Fortune 500 clients.&lt;ref name=TDITraining&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedataincubator.com/training.html|title=The Data Incubator - Corporate Training}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Venture Beat]], the program had over 1000 applicants from over 80 universities in its first round and accepted just under 3% of all applicants.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite news |url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/15/ny-gets-new-bootcamp-for-data-scientists-its-free-but-harder-to-get-into-than-harvard/ |title=NY Gets New Bootcamp for Data Scientists: It's free but Harder to get into than Harvard |first=Eric |last=Blattberg |newspaper=[[Venture Beat]] |date=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was selected by [[Business Insider]] as one of 15 competitive programs in the world with more competitive admissions than [[Harvard]].&lt;ref name=BI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/15-things-that-are-harder-to-get-into-than-harvard-2015-11 |title=15 things that are harder to get into than Harvard |newspaper=[[Business Insider]] |first1=Christina |last1=Sterbenz |first2=Abby |last2=Jackson |date=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Mary Washington''' (UMW) is a public liberal arts and sciences university located in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. Founded in 1908 as the Fredericksburg Teachers College, the institution was named Mary Washington College in 1938 after [[Mary Ball Washington]], mother of the first president of the United States, [[George Washington]]. The General Assembly of Virginia changed the college's name to the University of Mary Washington in 2004 to reflect the addition of graduate and professional programs to the central undergraduate curriculum, as well as the establishment of more than one campus.

Each year, students pursue more than 60 majors and programs of graduate and undergraduate study through the university's three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education. One third of UMW's undergraduate students study abroad before graduation, taking advantage of 121 study abroad programs in 56 countries. UMW Athletics' 23 teams compete in the NCAA Division III Capital Athletic Conference. Known as the UMW Eagles, 308 of these student-athletes have been named to All-American teams.

UMW has been consistently ranked a top college in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and in the southern region of the U.S. by ''[[The Princeton Review]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', and ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. In 2018, UMW was named a top producer of [[Peace Corps]] volunteers for the tenth year in a row, placing fourth among small schools.

==History==
The earliest incarnation of the college operated from about 1899 in the former [[Norfolk College for Young Ladies]], a [[finishing school]] in [[Downtown Norfolk, Virginia]]. On March 14, 1908, Virginia Governor [[Claude A. Swanson]] signed into law legislation for the establishment of the new State [[Normal school|Normal]] and Industrial School for Women. It was called Fredericksburg Teachers College. The institution was renamed Mary Washington College in 1938 after [[Mary Ball Washington]], mother of the first president of the United States of America, [[George Washington]], and longtime resident of Fredericksburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 the college became associated with the [[University of Virginia]] as its [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]]. Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as undergraduates, except in its education and nursing programs, although its postgraduate programs were coeducational. Following UVA's transition to coeducational status in 1970, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] reorganized Mary Washington College in 1972 as a separate, coeducational institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The General Assembly of Virginia enacted legislation changing the college's name to University of Mary Washington on March 19, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp524.exe?041+ful+CHAP0176|title=Bill Tracking - 2004 session &gt; Legislation|website=leg1.state.va.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the addition of master's degree programs and the establishment of more than one campus.

The university's first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building, CGPS North Building, was built in 2007. The university houses stops along the route of the Fredericksburg Regional Transit System (FRED). The school signed an Energy Performance Contact with the [[energy service company]] NORESCO from 2005–2007, enabling the campus to install water saving devices which reduced campus water consumption by 50%. NORESCO also installed low energy light fixtures, occupant sensors, HVAC controls, and completed replacement of leaking condensate piping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Much of UMW's Fredericksburg campus is located on Marye's Heights, a steep hill which, like Sunken Road (the campus' northeastern boundary), played an important role in the 1862 [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. The campus is within walking distance to the historic downtown with shops, restaurants and the Rappahannock River.&lt;ref name="umw.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/files/2017/08/Undergrad-Catalog-2017-18_WEB-copy.pdf |title=Undergrad Catalog|website=publications.umw.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other campuses are Stafford Campus, seven miles north of Fredericksburg, and Dahlgren Campus, near the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division]].

UMW has five pre-professional programs: pre-dental, pre-law, pre-med, pre-pharmacy, and pre-veterinary. Bachelor's degrees include a Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in addition to two degree completion programs – a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and a Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS).&lt;ref name="umw.edu"/&gt; Master's degrees include a Master of Business Administration (MBA, Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Education for Professional Development or Added Endorsement (M.Ed.), Master of Science in Elementary Education (M.S.) and a Master of Geospatial Analysis (MSGA). UMW also offers a Geographic Information Science certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publications.umw.edu/graduatecatalog/files/2017/08/Grad-Catalog-2017-18_WEB-copy.pdf |title= Graduate Catalog|website=publications.umw.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-year seminar courses allow students to explore nontraditional topics in nontraditional ways. While topics vary, classes are all capped at 15 students, focus on the development of writing and speaking skills and use active, discussion-based formats. Previous first-year seminars have included "Beyond the Selfie: Exploring Digital Identities," "Cold Case: Theatre Mysteries," "The Art of Mathematics," "Race &amp; Revolution," and "Science and Technology – Because We Can, Should We?"

Many UMW students study abroad before graduation. The university offers 121 approved programs in 56 countries, five exchange programs, and more than 15 programs led by UMW faculty during spring breaks and summer sessions.

==Administration==
By statute of the [[Code of Virginia]], the University of Mary Washington is governed by a [[Board of Visitors]], one member of which is elected every two years to serve as [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]. The UMW Board of Visitors is composed of twelve members appointed by the [[Governor of Virginia]] and confirmed by the General Assembly. At least six members of the Board must be alumni of the university, and no more than three may be nonresidents of Virginia. Each member serves a term of four years and may be eligible for reappointment to one successive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Student life==
'''Honor Convocation''' is held at the start of each academic year. '''Eagle Gathering''' is a candlelit celebration on Ball Circle that marks the start of the year and officially welcomes the newest class to UMW. During '''Family Weekend''', typically held in the fall semester, families visit the campus to get a taste of student life through events, performances and tours. Spirit Week is a series of student events that lead up to Homecoming and the return of UMW alumni to the university for athletic contests and tailgating. '''Senior Countdown''' is an event that celebrates 100 days until graduation for the undergraduate class. '''Spring Formal''' gives students an element of surprise – students learn the location of the formal (unique each year) only once they're on the buses heading over. '''Mr. UMW''' is a one-of-a-kind talent show in which contestants perform to be named "Mr. UMW" by the end of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orientation.umw.edu/traditions/|title=Traditions  -  Undergraduate Orientation|website=orientation.umw.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Victorian Certificate of Education''' or '''VCE''' is one credential available to [[secondary education|secondary school]] students who successfully complete year 11 and 12 in the [[Australia|Australian]] state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The VCE is the predominant choice for students wishing to pursue tertiary education. An alternative to VCE is the [[Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning|Victorian Certificate of Applied Learnings (VCAL)]], a vocational based senior secondary school qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Pages/vcal/students/studentfaq.aspx|title=Frequently asked questions by students|website=www.vcaa.vic.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Study for the VCE is usually completed over two years but can be spread over a longer period of time in some cases. It is possible to pass Year 12 without without completing the end of year exams although the VCE is not awarded by doing so. The VCE was established as a pilot project in 1987. The earlier [[Higher School Certificate (Victoria)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) was abolished in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ajte.education.ecu.edu.au/ISSUES/PDF/252/Brew.pdf|title= Curriculum and Assessment: A Question of Politics?|accessdate= 10 November 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070719003707/http://ajte.education.ecu.edu.au/ISSUES/PDF/252/Brew.pdf|archivedate= 19 July 2007|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.access.prov.vic.gov.au/public/component/daPublicBaseContainer?component=daViewGroup&amp;entityId=24|title= Public Records Office Victoria|accessdate= 29 August 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090919050637/http://www.access.prov.vic.gov.au/public/component/daPublicBaseContainer?component=daViewGroup&amp;entityId=24|archivedate= 19 September 2009|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Victorian Certificate of Education is generally taught in years 11 and 12 of secondary education in Victoria, however some students are able to commence their VCE studies in year 10 or earlier if the school or institution allows it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior (Year 10)|url=http://www.hopcross.vic.edu.au/?page_id=278|website=Hoppers Crossing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All VCE studies are organised into units. VCE subjects typically consist of four units with each unit covering one semester of study. Each unit comprises a set number of outcomes (usually two or three); an outcome describes the knowledge and skills that a student should demonstrate by the time the student has completed the unit. Subject choice depends on each individual school. Units 3/4 of a subject must be studied in sequential order, whereas units 1/2 can be mixed and matched. Students are not required to complete all the units of a subject as part of the VCE course, meaning they are able to change subject choice between years 11 and 12.

On completing a unit, a student receives either a 'satisfactory' (S) or 'non-satisfactory' (N) result. If a student does not intend to proceed to tertiary education, a 'satisfactory' result is all that is required to graduate with the VCE. If a student does wish to study at a tertiary level then they will require an [[Australian Tertiary Admission Rank|ATAR]]. In order to gain an ATAR a student must satisfactorily complete three units of any subject in the English field (at least one English field subject is compulsory) and twelve units in any other subjects.

===Assessment===
VCE studies are assessed both internally (in school) and externally (through  the [[Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority]] (VCAA). During units 1/2 all assessment is internal, while in units 3/4 assessment is conducted both internally and externally.&lt;ref name="youthcentral"&gt;{{cite web|title=VCE - The Victorian Certificate of Education|url=http://www.youthcentral.vic.gov.au/studying-training/secondary-study/vce-the-victorian-certificate-of-education|website=Youth Central|publisher=[[State Government of Victoria]]|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internal assessment====
Internal assessment is conducted via "school assessed coursework" (SACs) and "school assessed tasks" (SATs).

"School assessed coursework" (SACs) are the primary avenue of internal assessment, with assessment in every VCE study consisting of at least one SAC.&lt;ref name="youthcentral" /&gt; SACs are tasks that are written by the school and must be done primarily in class time; they can include essays, reports, tests, and case studies. Some studies in the visual arts and technology areas are also assessed via "school assessed tasks" (SATs). SATs are generally practical tasks that are examined in school. Both SACs and SATs are scaled by VCAA against external assessment; this is to eliminate any cheating or variances in task difficulty.

====External assessment====
External assessment is conducted in the form of examinations set by the [[Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority]] for units 3/4 studies. As of 2013, only the General Achievement Test (GAT) will be examined in June, with all subjects now only having one external assessment with the exceptions of mathematics subjects, and LOTE studies, which consist of both a written and oral external test. All examinations excepting the GAT are held in late October and most of November.

Subjects in the LOTE field (languages other than English) are also assessed in the form of oral examinations. Subjects in the Music field are assessed by a performance for a VCAA panel of examiners as part of their external assessment. All performance based external assessment (Oral Examinations and Music Performances) are typically held in early October.

=====General Achievement Test (GAT)=====
{{main|General Achievement Test}}
The [[General Achievement Test|GAT]] is an essential part of VCE external assessment. It provides the basis of a quality assurance check on the marking of examinations. Any student who is enrolled in a VCE units 3/4 study is required to sit the GAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the General Achievement Test?|url=http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Pages/vce/exams/gat/aboutgat.aspx|website=www.vcaa.vic.edu.au|publisher=[[Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scoring===

====Study scores====
A student who satisfactorily completes units 3/4 of a VCE study is eligible for a study score of between 0 and 50. Study scores are calculated by VCAA, and indicate a student's performance in relation to all other students who undertook that study.

Study scores are calculated according to a normal distribution, where the mean is 30 and the standard deviation is 7, with most study scores falling in the range 23 to 37. For studies with many enrolments (1000 or more), a study score of 40 or more places a student in the top 9% of all students in that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/handbook/2014/AdminHandbook2014-book.pdf|title=VCE and VCAL Administrative Handbook 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Scaling=====
Scaling is the process that adjusts VCE study scores into ATAR subject scores.  The [[Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre|Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC)]] adjusts all VCE study scores to equalise results between studies with stronger cohorts, and those with weaker ones. Contrary to common perception, scaling is not based on the difficulty of the subject, as each study score is in fact a ranking. The score adjustment ensures that in those subjects where it is easier to overtake the cohort, the score is adjusted downwards, while in those subjects where it is difficult to rank highly, it is moved upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vtac.edu.au/files/pdf/publications/abcofscaling.pdf|title=ABC of Scaling|website=[[Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre]]|page=4|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies===
VCE studies refer to the various subjects available to students to contribute to their successful completion of the qualification. There are currently 128 VCE studies, ranging from diverse fields such as the [[humanities]], [[science]], [[technology]] and [[mathematics]]. Studies are also permitted to study one or more VCE VET programs, [[vocational education]]-based subjects which contribute to the completion of the VCE, whilst also resulting in a nationally-recognised VET qualification. 

Although a student may choose to study any VCE subject in theory, this is dependent on availability of the specified study at the student's school. Certain schools do not offer certain studies, and as a result, students may pick alternate ones, or choose to study a particular subject through an external institution such as [[Distance Education Centre, Victoria|Distance Education Victoria]]. 

To be awarded the VCE, a student must successfully complete at least:
* All 4 units of an English subject
* Three additional Unit 3/4 sequences 
* Pass with a satisfactory of at least 16 units out of the normal 20-24 units 

This therefore means that a student must study at least four subjects to be awarded the VCE. Selection of studies depends on other factors as well, such as prerequisites for university courses. 

The following is a list of all VCE studies available:

There are also University Extension studies available for high-achieving students. These subjects are carried out through multiple universities, including [[Monash University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monash.edu.au/study/extension/, Monash Extension], Monash University, retrieved 2011-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Melbourne]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au/info/school-students/extension-program, The University of Melbourne Extension Program], retrieved 2011-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swinburne University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future.swinburne.edu.au/information/higher-education-studies/, Higher Education Studies at Swinburne University of Technology], retrieved 2011-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deakin University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deakin.edu.au/study-at-deakin/study-options-and-pathways/vce-extension-studies-program/|title=Accelerate - Deakin|publisher=Deakin University}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Controversies ==
The 2011 English exam contained a column about tattoos attributed to "part-time journalist and blogger Helen Day", who wrote for the fictional "Street Beat" blog. ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper accused VCAA of plagiarism and breach of copyright as the column was very similar to an opinion piece featured in the newspaper's 23 September 2010 edition, written by Melbourne writer Helen Razer. The newspaper called the exam's column "clumsily edited".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/education/sloppy-copy-in-exam-raises-ire-20111109-1n7eo.html|title=Sloppy copy in exam raises ire|last=Topsfield|first=Jewel|date=10 November 2011|work=The Age|access-date=31 October 2018|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the ''History: Revolutions'' exam was meant to include a picture of Nikolai Kochergin's artwork ''Storming the Winter Palace on 25th October 1917'', depicting the events of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] in Russia. Instead, a doctored picture was used in the exam, in which a large robot had been edited in to the background of the scene. A VCAA spokesperson admitted that the image was "sourced and acknowledged by the VCAA as coming from the Internet", and new internal guidelines were issued for using internet-sourced content in exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/history-transformed-in-vce-exam-20121114-29ce7.html|title=History transformed in VCE exam|last=Arup|first=Tom|date=15 November 2012|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=31 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031125540/https://www.smh.com.au/education/history-transformed-in-vce-exam-20121114-29ce7.html|archive-date=31 October 2018|dead-url=no|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/vce-authorities-apologise-for-phantom-robot-20121119-29lbl.html|title=VCE authorities apologise for phantom robot|last=Topsfield|first=Jewel|date=19 November 2012|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=31 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031125702/https://www.smh.com.au/education/vce-authorities-apologise-for-phantom-robot-20121119-29lbl.html|archive-date=31 October 2018|dead-url=no|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 5,738 students that sat the exam, 2,379 chose the Russia section, of which 130 received an adjusted score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/exams/history/2012/HistoryRevs_assessrep_12.pdf|title=2012 History Revolutions assessment report|website=[[Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority]]|page=11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410213009/http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/exams/history/2012/HistoryRevs_assessrep_12.pdf|archive-date=10 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 English exam included an article in which fictional writer Jonty Jenkins scathingly attacks a cafe franchise named "Calmer Coffee" opening in his local town, criticising its unfriendly staff and unwelcoming ambience that he describes as "an assault on the senses". After the exam completed, students discovered that a Calmer Cafe existed in [[Aberfeldie, Victoria|Aberfeldie]], a suburb just north-west of Melbourne, managed by Elise Jenkins, sharing the same surname as the exam question's fictional writer. Within hours, the cafe received over 100 negative reviews on [[Google Maps]] from Year 12 students, bringing down its rating from nearly 5 stars to as low as 3.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/it-was-weird-vce-exam-sitters-asked-to-analyse-rant-about-hipster-cafe-20181031-p50d4h.html#comments|title=A Melbourne cafe's nightmare after being in the VCE English exam|last=Cook|first=Henrietta|date=31 October 2018|work=The Age|access-date=31 October 2018|publisher=Fairfax Media|last2=Webb|first2=Carolyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/cafe-of-english-exam-fame-to-sue-education-body-20181101-p50de6.html|title=Cafe of English exam fame to sue education body|last=Cook|first=Henrietta|date=1 November 2018|work=The Age|access-date=1 November 2018|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Maps temporarily removed the cafe from search results, and later reinstated it but kept reviews inaccessible. At the time, the cafe had 405 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101074624/https://www.google.com/maps/place/Calmer+Cafe/@-37.7549384,144.8942131,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ad65c408aff3b17:0xb6288e7facda1778!8m2!3d-37.7549384!4d144.8964018|date=1 November 2018|title=Calmer Cafe on Google Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Tara Conron, owner of the cafe, told ''The Age'' she had hired a lawyer and would be pursuing legal action against VCAA for "uncanny" similarities between the exam and the actual cafe. Conron noted the identical surnames of Jenkins, stated that she employs someone with a "[[Bun (hairstyle)|man bun]]", as does an employee in the exam article, and both the fictional and actual cafe "stand out" in their respective suburbs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Voluntary student unionism''' ('''VSU'''), as it is known in Australia, or '''voluntary student membership''' ('''VSM'''), as it is known in New Zealand, is a policy under which membership of – and payment of membership fees to – university [[Students' union|student organisations]] is voluntary.

Australia passed legislation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r2283|website=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; enacting VSU in 2005, which came into force on July 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce blasts colleagues over VSU vote|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-12-10/joyce-blasts-colleagues-over-vsu-vote/758564|website=ABC|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of VSU in Australia had been law in the state of [[Western Australia]] from 1994 until 2002, and in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] from 1994 to 2000.

==Arguments and issues==
Arguments for and against VSU typically fall into three broad categories: civil rights impacts, social impacts, and economic impacts.

===The civil rights argument===
Requiring membership of student organisations is seen by some as a form of forced unionisation, contrary to [[freedom of association]].&lt;ref name=collins&gt;[https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/explore/ResearchPublications/researchBulletins/rb0799kc.pdf Voluntary Student Unionism: Protecting the Rights of Australian Students?], Queensland Parliamentary Library, 1999, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively it may be seen as being required to belong to a professional organisation, in which case it would merely be a means of ensuring standards.&lt;ref name="Association1"&gt;Jeremy McBride, Foredoom of Association, The Essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, London, 2005, pg.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of VSU argue that it silences students' voices by removing universal membership of a student organisation. 

===The social argument===
A common thread in the argument against VSU is the notion of a campus culture, or the university experience. University has traditionally been a time of broadening horizons, socialising, and political activism. Opponents argue that VSU makes it more difficult for students to have high quality sports grounds, lively music and social venues, and the resources necessary to mount protests and political campaigns, leading to moribund campuses. This was a view expressed by Senator [[Barnaby Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2005/s1480569.htm |title=The World Today – Joyce warns Government on VSU |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents counter that the free-market system rewards venues and establishments which students enjoy and value, and that it lets students choose their own level of contribution to a political cause.

===The economic argument===
Student Unions charge anywhere between $0 and $300 per year for membership. Levying of fees is criticised by some on the grounds that it is financially onerous, particularly to students who may already be struggling with the associated costs of university study. Others cite that the associated financial benefits of robust representation provided by students' associations result in lower fees and higher quality of educational experience for students.

==The situation in Australia==

=== Australian student unionism before VSU ===
{{Main|Student unionism in Australia}}

Although universities and student unions each had their own rules, students generally were required to become a member of their campus student organisation automatically upon enrolment. A fee for student services or amenities was charged to students, typically once a [[semester]], once a year, or in a lump sum upon enrolment. This fee was typically collected by the university, which usually took a portion in collection fees and passed the rest to campus student organisation(s). These organisations then distributed the money according to their own rules.

===VSU legislation===
On 9 December 2005, the ''Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill'' 2005 was passed in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], and received the [[Royal Assent]] on 19 December 2005. Since 1 July 2006, [[List of universities in Australia|Australian universities]] have faced fines of [[Australian dollar|A$]]100 per student for compelling payment for any non-academic good or service.

===Positions on VSU===

====Student unions====
Many student organisations opposed VSU, expressing concern about their ability to provide social, academic, and political services under VSU as well as meet long-term financial commitments without guaranteed revenue streams.

====Universities====
Australian universities, as represented by the [[Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee]] (AVCC), were generally in support of membership and compulsory fees for student organisations for three broad reasons. First, they prefer to leave service provision in the hands of students; second, the activities associated with campus organisations help to market the universities to prospective students; and third, they view student unions as valid representative bodies.

The [[Australian National University]], the [[University of New South Wales]], the [[University of Sydney]], the [[University of Queensland]], the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] and the [[University of Adelaide]]{{ref|http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news27281.html}} have provided funding to their respective student unions, subject to various conditions.

===History in Australia===
Compulsory student organisation membership was initially accepted as uncontentious by all political persuasions. By the 1970s, the overtly political nature of the [[Australian Union of Students]], which ran a number of overtly progressive campaigns (for example, in support of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2535943|title=Australian Students and the Conflict|date=1 January 1974|publisher=|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=176–179|doi=10.2307/2535943}}&lt;/ref&gt;), led to a conservative minority within that organisation to call for voluntary student organisation membership.

Following its election in 1996, the [[John Howard|Howard Government]] signalled its intention to introduce VSU. It tried to pass legislation to this effect several times in the late 1990s. Student organisations responded with strong campaigns in opposition to VSU throughout that time. The legislation was persistently rejected in the [[Australian Senate]], where the Labor Party, the [[Australian Democrats]], and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] have voted against it. Following its [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 election victory]], aware that attempts to introduce VSU would not pass the Senate, the Government moved away from the VSU agenda. Advocates of VSU received a boost, however, when the Howard government gained control of the Senate at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 Federal election]]. Nationwide implementation of VSU had been listed among the government's legislative agenda to be placed before the Senate.

On 16 March 2005, [[Brendan Nelson]] introduced the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 before the [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]]. Initially expected to be passed due to the government's majority in the Senate from July, it was opposed in its original form by Senator [[Barnaby Joyce]], who threatened to cross the floor if sporting facilities and collegial spirit were not protected. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Despite such opposition, Education Minister Nelson insisted that the legislation would pass unamended and come into force as of 1 January 2006. By October 2005, however, it became apparent that it would not be possible to implement VSU in time for the new academic year.

On 9 December 2005, the legislation was reintroduced. Due to the decision of Joyce to cross the floor and vote against the legislation, Howard was forced to obtain the vote of Family First Senator [[Steve Fielding]], who had maintained for several months that he was opposed to the bill in its current form. However, after being courted by Howard, Fielding did an abrupt about-face and voted for the legislation, calling compulsory student unionism "crazy" and allowing the bill to pass; though both Fielding and Brendan Nelson insisted no behind-the-scenes deal had secured his vote. The legislation was essentially identical to the government's original proposal.

In September 2010 the Gillard Labor government introduced legislation to allow universities to charge students a compulsory service fee of up to $250 a year to fund amenities such as sporting facilities, childcare and counselling. The legislation passed after the Greens took the balance of power in the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/student-union-fees-to-return-20100929-15xgk.html |work=The Age |location=Melbourne, Australia | first=Dan | last=Harrison | title=Student union fees to return | date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Zealand situation==

===Referendum based opt-out provisions===
Under legislation passed in 1999, but subsequently superseded, VSM could be enacted at any [[List of universities in New Zealand|New Zealand university]] by a referendum of students. Only students at the [[University of Auckland]] voted to enact VSM, affecting membership of the [[Auckland University Students' Association]].&lt;ref name=Barton2010&gt;{{cite news |title=Students pay high price for freedom |first=Chris |last=Barton |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10695053 |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |date=18 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, students enrolled since that vote go without membership in the student association unless they become aware of it, find out how to join, and afford the fees without the option of having it included in their student loan. Students at the [[University of Waikato]] enacted VSM, but later returned to universal student membership, when a referendum was held during study week.

===Voluntary student membership===
In October 2009, [[Heather Roy]]'s [[Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment]] Bill was drawn from the ballot. The bill was greatly delayed due to a large number of public submissions (4837 in total, including 132 oral submissions), necessitating the Select Committee stage to be extended from the normal six months to a full year. It was later delayed due to [[filibuster]]ing by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]&lt;ref name=Marwick2011&gt;{{citation |title=Goff defends filibustering VSM debate |first=Felix |last=Marwick |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyid=201743}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of particular note, [[Trevor Mallard]],&lt;ref name=Bradford2011&gt;{{citation |title=Labour defends filibustering VSM bill |first=Katie |last=Bradford-Crozier |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyid=197998}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a bill ahead of it on the Order Paper - the aim was to push the debate out so the third reading could not occur before the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]], causing the bill to die as Roy was not seeking re-election. However, the bill eventually passed its third reading on 28 September 2011, 63 votes in favour to 58 opposed.&lt;ref name=VSMPass&gt;{{citation |title= Voluntary Student Union Bill Passes |url=http://parliamenttoday.co.nz/2011/09/voluntary-student-union-bill-passes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; All student associations in New Zealand are now voluntary.

==Terminology==
There are several terms being used to describe voluntary student unionism and its opposite, each with its own frequency, accuracy, impartiality, and favourability.

===Voluntary arrangements===
* Voluntary student unionism (VSU)
* Anti-student organisation legislation (ASOL)
* Voluntary student representation (VSR) – A "watered down" alternative to VSU, in which compulsory fees for student politics are banned, but may still be levied for non-political uses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cis.org.au/publications/issue-analysis/article/836-the-free-market-case-against-voluntary-student-unionism-but-for-voluntary-student-representation&lt;/ref&gt;
* Voluntary student membership (VSM) – New Zealand arrangement similar to VSU
* Optional membership of student organisations (OMSO)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acuma.org.au/resource_library/vsu/vsu_impact_study/abbreviations.htm&lt;/ref&gt; – positive euphemism for VSU.

===Universal arrangements===
* Universal student unionism
* Universal student representation
* Student organisation
* Opt-out student membership
* Compulsory student unionism

Year round facilities at Wintergreen are [[off-the-grid]], and use [[straw-bale construction]]&lt;ref&gt;http://registry.osbbc.ca/listing-wintergreen-studios-99.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cordwood construction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.frontenaccfdc.com/?p=22&lt;/ref&gt; Wintergreen hosts gardening and wilderness programs for youth,&lt;ref&gt;The Kingston Whig Standard.

Research partners include Queen's University, Concordia University, and The Royal Conservatory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcmusic.ca/Development/Admin/Assets/DisplayAsset.aspx?id=0d4e48c9-5628-4a94-a648-2f52618cadc0&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wintergreen Studios was founded in 2007 by five founding directors. Rena Upitis serves as President and CEO. Wintergreen Studios was granted charitable status in July 2008, and programming began late in 2008.

==Environmentally friendly practices==
The lodge is built from locally grown straw using [[straw-bale construction]]. A 3KW Solar Voltaic array and Solar hot water heater make use of southern light and the building features, including R-40 insulation, clerestory windows, and considerable thermal mass from the plastered walls and concrete foundation. One wing is sheltered with an earth-covered [[living roof]]. Recycled barn beams are featured in the design. Natural materials found on the Wintergreen site are used, such as stone, wood, and earth. "Other reclaimed and repurposed materials abound in the lodge and outbuildings: discarded copper roofing, fence posts, broken pottery, glass, cedar fence rails, stone and even plants from the surrounding meadow that adorn the living roofs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/dec09/reverberations.asp&lt;/ref&gt; A peat-based septic system is used for sewage treatment and management.
