The '''United Nations Climate Change Conference''', '''COP19''' or '''CMP9''' was held in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] from 11 to 23 November 2013. This is the 19th yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 19) to the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the 9th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP 9) to the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=19th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC|url=http://climate-l.iisd.org/events/conference-of-the-parties-to-the-unfccc/|publisher=[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference delegates continue the negotiations towards a global climate agreement. UNFCCC's Executive Secretary [[Christiana Figueres]] and [[Ministry of Environment (Poland)|Poland's Minister]] of the Environment [[Marcin Korolec]] led the negotiations.

The conference led to an agreement that all states would start cutting emissions as soon as possible, but preferably by the first quarter of 2015. The '''Warsaw Mechanism''' was also proposed.

==Background==
Several preliminary and actual agreements were at the forefront of the talks, including: unused credits from phase one of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], improvements to several UNFCCC action mechanisms, and a refinement of the measurement, reporting, and verification of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (GHGs).&lt;ref name=ICT&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridges Warsaw update: Financing key to unlocking progress at COP 19|url=http://ictsd.org/i/news/bioresreview/178642/|publisher=International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates are to focus on the potential conditions of a final global [[climate change]] agreement expected to be ratified in 2015 at the Paris Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cienski|first=Jan|title=Leaders Gather in Warsaw for Climate Change Negotiations|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/cc10f728-4abf-11e3-8c4c-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fcc10f728-4abf-11e3-8c4c-00144feabdc0.html%3Fsiteedition%3Dintl&amp;siteedition=intl&amp;_i_referer=|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=The Financial Times UK|date=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Location and participation==
[[File:Stadion Narodowy w Warszawie 20120422.jpg|thumb|The [[National Stadium, Warsaw|National Stadium]] in Warsaw, the main venue of the conference]]

The location of UNFCCC talks are rotated by regions throughout [[United Nations]] countries. In 2013 Warsaw, the capital and largest city in Poland, was chosen to represent the Eastern European Group in the COP 19 Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incoming Polish Presidency of the 19th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://www.cop19.gov.pl/incoming-polish-presidency-of-cop19-cmp9|publisher=United Nations Climate Change Forum|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The choice of Poland has been criticised by environmental organizations, including [[Greenpeace]], because of the country's lack of commitment to reduce its use of fossil fuels and increase use of [[renewable energy]]. As of 2013, 88% of [[Energy in Poland|Poland's electricity]] is sourced from coal, as compared to the global average of 68% electricity from fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key World Energy Statistics|year=2013|publisher=International Energy Agency|location=Paris|page=24|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2013_FINAL_WEB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its officials have been blocking EU proposals to more effectively act against global warming. Standing alone against the other [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], in 2011 Poland blocked the proposed emission targets for 2050, and its environment minister [[Marcin Korolec]] (president of the conference) declared himself sceptical about the EU's strategy of leading by example.&lt;ref&gt;Hakim, Danny and Mateusz Zurawik: [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/business/energy-environment/poland-wedded-to-coal-spurns-europe-on-clean-energy.html "Poland, Wedded to Coal, Spurns Europe on Clean Energy Targets"], in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 31 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over 10,000 participants from 189 countries registered to attend the conference, but only 134 ministers announced participation. Four countries that are among the most vulnerable to climate change were represented by their president or prime minister: [[Tuvalu]], [[Nauru]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;Yeo, Sophie: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/13/warsaw-climate-talks-countries-ministers "Warsaw climate talks: nearly 3 in 10 countries not sending ministers"], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cop19.gov.pl/latest-news/items/statement-of-president-of-cop19-minister-marcin-korolec-on-the-participation-of-ngos-in-the-climate-summit|title=Statement of President of COP19 Minister Marcin Korolec on the participation of NGOs in the Climate Summit - COP19 - CMP9, Conference of Parties and climate change conference|first=Agencja Interaktywna|last=Migomedia|website=www.cop19.gov.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]] dismissed Korolec in preference for a politician who would be better able to deliver a "radical acceleration of shale gas operations" in the country. However, he said that Korolec would remain the government's plenipotentiary for the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2013/nov/21/warsaw-climate-change-conference-global-warming|title=Warsaw's widening climate chasm could lead to 4C warming - Graham Readfearn|first=Graham|last=Readfearn|date=21 November 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations==
The overarching goal of the conference is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius above current levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule of Events |url=http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/warsaw_nov_2013/application/pdf/cop19cmp9_overview_schedule.pdf |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=12 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112055835/http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/warsaw_nov_2013/application/pdf/cop19cmp9_overview_schedule.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, Christiana Figueres,
:“Global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak this decade, and get to zero net emissions by the second half of this century... National governments need to act to minimize impacts to their populations and ensure sustainable development over generations. The private sector needs to act to minimize climate risk and capture opportunity. And the international process must push forward now to build the foundation for an ambitious universal climate change agreement in 2015,”&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNFCCC: Warsaw COP "pivotal moment to step up climate action"|url=http://cleantech.cleantechpoland.com/?page=news&amp;id=113&amp;link=unfccc-warsaw-cop-pivotal-moment-to-step-up-climate-action-|publisher=Clean Tech Poland|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Clean energy, and specifically the financing and technology transfer of renewables in developing countries, will be of main importance during the conference. The Indian Minister of the Environment stated before the talks that “the most important milestone would be climate finance and capitalisation of the [[Green Climate Fund]] (GCF), which has not happened at all... Developed countries that made a commitment earlier have now started talking of alternative sources of funding - whereas in our view these are commitments of the parties to the COP.”&lt;ref name=ICT/&gt;    Agreements in the Copenhagen round ostensibly formalized $US 100 billion to the Clean Energy Fund by 2020 to assist developing countries in energy development, whereas only $US 7.5 million had been committed as of June 2013.&lt;ref name=ICT/&gt;  Australia has support from Britain and others to head off demands for compensation payments to countries hit by damage they blame on climate change, sparking anger at a global summit meant to strike a deal this weekend. Acting on [[Tony Abbott]]’s edict to avoid any new financial commitments, Australian negotiators have held out against calls to support the “loss and damage” payments sought by poorer countries

Technology transfer and sharing of [[intellectual property]] between industrialised and developing countries will be a major concern in the Warsaw talks.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Historically, these discussions have been stalled due to disagreements over the price and sharing mechanisms surrounding intellectual property, and thus new approaches are expected in the Warsaw conference.&lt;ref name=ICT/&gt; 

A stalemate surrounding the talks has been the insistence of the United States delegates on China and India conforming to binding reduction commitments - whereas Chinese and Indian delegates argue that funding from industrialised countries is needed before such emissions cuts can be executed without impacting [[GDP]] growth rates.&lt;ref name=ICT/&gt; India and Saudi Arabia blocked an agreement which could prevent the release of up to 100 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2050. A key paragraph in a draft resolution that would have accelerated international cooperation under the [[Montreal Protocol]] was reportedly deleted at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/2170299/cop19_india_and_saudi_arabia_join_the_climate_saboteurs.html|title=COP19 - India and Saudi Arabia join the 'Climate Saboteurs'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths, injuries and destruction caused by [[Typhoon Haiyan]] were brought to attention during the opening day talks. In response to the typhoon and to climate change damage in general, [[Naderev Saño|Naderev "Yeb" Saño]], the lead negotiator of the Philippines delegation, received a standing ovation for announcing:
{{cquote|In solidarity with my countrymen who are struggling to find food back home, I will now commence a voluntary fasting for the climate, this means I will voluntarily refrain from eating food during this COP, until a meaningful outcome is in sight.|author=Naderev Saño|source=speaking at the 2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGrath|first=Matt|title=Typhoon prompts 'fast' by Philippines climate delegate|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24899647|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 21 November, the first Cities and Sub-national Dialogue took place. This consisted of selected ministers, mayors and sub-national leaders and  civil society representatives discussing mitigation and adaptation at a local scale.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cop19.gov.pl/latest-news/items/city-mayors-and-regional-leaders-discuss-at-cop19cmp9|title=City mayors and regional leaders discuss at COP19/CMP9 - COP19 - CMP9, Conference of Parties and climate change conference|first=Agencja Interaktywna|last=Migomedia|website=www.cop19.gov.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walkouts===

The G77 and China bloc led 132 poor countries in a walk out during talks about “loss and damage” compensation for the consequences of global warming. Poor countries have demanded that the developed world give them $100 billion annually by 2020.
Activists and poor countries accused Australian diplomats of not taking the talks seriously. The country did not send high-ranking officials to the UN summit, saying that they would be busy repealing the country’s contentious carbon tax. ''The carbon tax is bad for the economy and it doesn’t do any good for the environment,'' Prime Minister Tony Abbott told The Washington Post. ''Despite a carbon tax of $37 a ton by 2020, Australia’s domestic emissions were going up, not down. The carbon tax was basically socialism masquerading as environmentalism, and that’s why it’s going to get abolished.''

On the last day of the conference [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Oxfam]], [[ActionAid]], the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], [[Friends of the Earth]] and [[Greenpeace]] walked out of the conference. Greenpeace spokesman Gregor Kessler, however, said that they would not leave the city but would "follow the discussions from the outside. We will not be part of the internal discussions." Oxfam' Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said: "[Governments] must...come back in 2014 ready for meaningful discussions on how they will deliver their share of the emissions reductions which scientists say are needed and their share of the money needed to help the poorest and most vulnerable countries adapt." All six issued a statement that read: "Organisations and movements representing people from every corner of the Earth have decided that the best use of our time is to voluntarily withdraw from the Warsaw climate talks. The Warsaw climate conference, which should have been an important step in the just transition to a sustainable future, is on track to deliver virtually nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/11/green-groups-walk-out-un-climate-talks-2013112115105648189.html|title=Green groups walk out of UN climate talks|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===
The conference ran beyond the scheduled end date of 22 November by a day&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/11/climate-summit-overtime-due-deadlock-201311234643975109.html|title=Climate summit in overtime due to deadlock|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; before some consensus was reached. Member states agreed to work towards curbing emissions as soon as possible, with an idea date targeted at the first quarter of 2015.

Talk however continued on the aid that developed countries would pay to help emissions cuts by developing countries. Having previously promised US$100 billion a year after 2020 from the US$10 billion a year between 2010-2012, they resisted calls to set targets for the rest of the decade. The draft resolution of the conference, though, only mentioned setting "increasing levels" of aid. Further the '''Warsaw Mechanism''' was proposed, which would provide expertise, and possibly aid, to developing nations to cope with loss and damage from such natural extremities as heatwaves, droughts and floods and threats such as rising sea levels and desertification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/11/deadlock-broken-at-un-climate-talks-20131123163641928770.html|title=Deadlock broken at UN climate talks|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Organisers===
The organizers of COP19 were strongly criticised for posting comments in an online blog in the lead-up to the conference about the purported advantages of [[Climate change in the Arctic|ice melting in the Arctic]], stating that "we may build new drilling platforms and retrieve natural resources hidden below the sea bed", as well as "chasing the pirates, terrorists and ecologists that will come to hang around". The bloggers subsequently responded: "Our recent entry on north-west passage was widely discussed but unfortunately misunderstood. The readers considered the forthcoming, bitter, but unfortunately possible scenario as [an] option we like. We do not. But how to react to the featured situation? Should we be silent? We are glad, that the topic caused so much interest and discussion, because the matter is really very serious."&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Adam: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/10/malting-arctic-ice-pirate-chases-cop19-organisers "Arctic melt means more pirate chases, say Polish climate hosts"] in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Organizers from the Ministry of the Economy in Poland were also strongly criticised for co-hosting an event with the [[World Coal Association]] alongside the UNFCCC talks. This has been seen as a provocation against changing the energy source mix in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scislowska|first=Monika|title=Poland To Host Both UN Climate Change Conference And International Coal Summit|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/poland-un-climate-chage-coal-summit_n_4237742.html|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dismissal of the conference president Marcin Korolec from his cabinet position as minister of environmental during the negotiations has been seen by delegates as a further sign of Poland's lack of commitment to progress global action on global warming. Prime minister [[Donald Tusk]] stated that the dismissal had to do with the need for "radical acceleration of shale gas operations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/20/climate-talks-polish-environment-minister-sacked?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 "Climate talks: Polish environment minister sacked to accelerate shale gas operations"], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrialised countries===
The [[International Energy Agency]] has continually urged industrialised countries to reduce [[fossil fuel subsidies]]. It is expected that these subsidy actions will not be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Energy Outlook|year=2013|publisher=International Energy Agency|location=Paris|isbn=978-92-64-18084-0|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Several countries attending the COP 19 have been criticised for poor performance on stated environmental pollution targets. While the United States reduced its emissions of {{CO2}} in 2012 by 11.8 percent compared to 2005, the largest reduction of any country, others have not done so well.&lt;Ref&gt; White House Fact Sheet June 25, 2013 http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/25/fact-sheet-president-obama-s-climate-action-plan. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Dailey''' (born August 12, 1951) is an American artist noted for his careers in both art and international relations. His work in a variety of mediums—including photography, film, installations, and painting—engages with the social, political, and cultural issues of our times and is not easily categorized. Dailey's art reflects his unconventional evolution as an artist and multifaceted life experiences, which include national level involvement in arms control, space policy, intelligence systems, and international security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/oral-histories/dailey.pdf Johnson Space Center Oral History Project: Brian Dailey]&lt;/ref&gt; He is based in the Washington DC metropolitan area and maintains studios in the District and Woodstock, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://briandaileyart.com/ Brian Dailey Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Dailey was born in Pittsburg, California. His parents divorced when he was three, precipitating his mother's return to her native New Zealand with Dailey and his sister and the family's subsequent relocation to England. They returned to the United States in 1956 and resided in Santa Monica, California, where he spent his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Anderson, "And the Shenandoah County Award for Best Extra Goes to....," ''Mountain Courier'' (February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; He took up photography at the age of 12, beginning his formal photographic training after entering [[Pacific Palisades High School]].

Dailey attended Ventura College where he developed an interest in ceramic sculpture, shifting the direction of his art career.&lt;ref&gt;"College Art Guild Winner," ''The Ventura County Star-Free Press'' (December 29, 1971):B-7&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of his portfolio, he was accepted directly into the Masters program at [[Otis Art Institute]] in Los Angeles where he became interested in performance, conceptual art, and video technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://briandaileyart.com/ Brian Dailey Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 he married fellow artist Paula Ballo, who succumbed to cancer in 2016.

==Art Career in Los Angeles==

As a student at Otis Art Institute (MFA, 1975) and in his ensuing art career in Los Angeles, Dailey participated in the creative experimentation defining the artistic milieu in California in this era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/visual-arts/2013/11/13/brian-dailey-on-the-palette-of-american-politics/ Louis Jacobson, "Brian Dailey on the Palette of American Politics"]&lt;/ref&gt; In his installation works from this period, he explored the role of the artist in the causal process. His performance pieces placed an emphasis on active viewer engagement.&lt;ref&gt;*"Vice," ''High Performance'' 1, no. 1 (February 1978): 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation from Otis, Dailey began his art career exhibiting his performance and conceptual works in various institutions in Los Angeles and was represented by the Roger Wong Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Artists Files. Los Angeles Museum of Art / Roger Wong Gallery records. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/los-angeles-museum-art--roger-wong-gallery-records-6530]&lt;/ref&gt; His work from this period includes painting, sculpture, and performance art, reflecting the pluralistic forms of creative expression and the political and social engagement generated by the Los Angeles artistic community.

Travel and exposure to diverse cultures had a significant impact on Dailey. During his art education, he traveled to Europe, visiting museums to study paintings and sculptures that inspired him as a student and visiting countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]] to learn about the communist political system. In 1976, Dailey set out to Japan with the aim of working with the director [[Akira Kurosawa]], whose films were a source of inspiration. He traveled on the [[Trans Siberian Express]] to Japan, transiting through the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson Space Center Oral History Project: Brian Dailey,'' NASA, p. 8 [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/oral-histories/dailey.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting artists and writers in East Berlin and along the train stops in Siberia, he became increasingly interested in international relations and the issue of artistic freedom in totalitarian regimes.

Dailey's residence in Japan was brief. Discovering that Kurosawa's professional and private life was at a nadir and confronting the challenges of working in Japan, he returned to Los Angeles where he worked with [[Sam Francis]] in his Litho Shop and with a number of other leading artists in his capacity as an assistant at [[ACE Gallery]] in Venice, California. He also worked for the architect James De Long, a student of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=james-e-de-long&amp;pid=164580042 James De Long, Obituary, LA Times, May 2, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; His growing interest in film and video led to his working as a grip at the [[American Film Institute]] in Los Angeles, where he learned filmmaking. Having worked on AFI projects he began to work on his own films using a 16mm Beaulieu camera.

==Arms Control and International Security==

In 1981, Dailey's interest in international affairs and the [[Cold War]] led him to pursue a doctorate and a career in international relations. He studied arms control, Russian studies, and diplomatic history at the University of Southern California, receiving his degree in 1987 with a dissertation on the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian D. Dailey, "Deception and Self-Deception in Arms Control: The ABM and Outer Space Treaties Reconsidered." Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Southern California, August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dailey’s career in international affairs began in 1984 with an internship as assistant director for chemical warfare negotiations in [[the Pentagon]]. In January 1985, he became an Adjunct Professor of National Security Affairs at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], Monterey, California.&lt;ref&gt;Lockheed Martin Names Brian Dailey to New Consolidated Washington, D.C., Post [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lockheed-martin-names-brian-dailey-to-new-consolidated-washington-dc-post-73607692.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he managed a three-year Soviet deception project for the Pentagon's Director of Net Assessment and the U.S. Army as well as teaching courses on modern revolution and terrorism, nuclear targeting, strategic deception, and intelligence systems and products. In 1987, he co-edited and published the anthology ''Soviet Strategic Deception.''&lt;ref&gt;Brian D. Dailey and Patrick J. Parker, ed., ''Soviet Strategic Deception,'' Lexington Books, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1988, Dailey became a professional staff member of the [[Senate Armed Service Committee]], assigned to the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces and Nuclear Deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty Hearings Before the Committee on Armed Services [http://fas.org/nuke/control/cfe/congress/22j1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for matters on arms control, missile defense, special access programs, as well as space and intelligence systems.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Morrison, "Sam Nunn Inc.," ''National Journal'' (June 15, 1991): 1485&lt;/ref&gt; In that capacity, he was also the minority staff liaison to [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]. In 1992, he was appointed Executive Secretary of the [[National Space Council]] in the [[White House]], where he was responsible for coordinating U.S. space policy for civil, commercial, defense, and intelligence issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/oral-histories/dailey.pdf Johnson Space Center Oral History Project: Brian Dailey]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Cold War, Dailey transitioned to the private sector. He left the White House in 1993 to work for the [[Lockheed Corporation]], where he was responsible for commercial programs including their joint ventures in the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=1245769&amp;ticker=LMT&amp;previousCapId=370857&amp;previousTitle=BOEING%2520CO%252FTHE Executive Profile: Brian D. Dailey]&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to become a Senior Vice President and Corporate Officer of [[Lockheed Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lockheed Martin Names Brian Dailey to New Consolidated Washington, D.C., Post [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lockheed-martin-names-brian-dailey-to-new-consolidated-washington-dc-post-73607692.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of his work in art, government, and the private sector, he traveled to more than 80 countries on all continents more than 50 times to the Soviet Union and Russia.

==Return to Art==

Dailey returned to art full-time in 2008, leveraging his experiences in the intervening decades in his creative practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/26/AR2008102601832.html Lockheed's Top Lobbyist Calling It a Career]&lt;/ref&gt; His approach to art is both conceptual and performance based, inviting the viewer's participation. In his frequent use of the photographic ''[[tableau vivant]],'' Dailey explores topical existential questions and utilizes composite imagery as a vehicle for making critical commentary on contemporary social and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://briandaileyart.com/ Brian Dailey Art]&lt;/ref&gt; These staged "living pictures" have been featured in exhibitions in Europe and the United States (see selected exhibitions below).

Dailey's early interest in film resurfaces in his current practice. His video ''Jikai'' (2012) alludes to Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]],'' employing a moth fatally drawn to light. Dedicated to Kurosawa, the video is a meditation on political disintegration. ''Jikai'' was screened on multiple synchronized monitors in New York City in February 2014 as the featured video in the Times Square Midnight Moment series.&lt;ref&gt;February Midnight Moment to Showcase Brian Dailey's ''Moth to a Flame'' Video Showcasing the Power and Danger of Attraction (January 31, 2014):

[http://www.timessquarenyc.org/times-square-arts/projects/midnight-moment/jikai/index.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dailey has had solo exhibitions in Los Angeles, New York, and Bulgaria and participated in a number of group shows in the United States, Europe, and Russia. His mid-career retrospective, ''Declassified: Unraveling a Paradox'', took place at Bulgaria's [[National Art Gallery (Bulgaria)|National Art Gallery]] in Sofia in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Lilyana Karadzhova, "Declassified: American Artist Brian Dailey Unravels Paradoxes in Sofia"[http://www.europost.bg/article?id=11789]&lt;/ref&gt; Dailey was a featured speaker at FotoDC 2015, presenting his ''American in Color'' project as part of a series of talks on photobooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotodc.org/events/2015/9/23/fototalks-brian-dailey FotoTalks, FotoDC 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dailey's encrypted ''Riddle'' series was featured in the exhibition ''GEOMETRIX: Line, Form, Subversion'', organized by Curator's Office at three-venues in Washington, DC from January 14 to April 16, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curatorsoffice.com/20152016-geometrix/ Curator's Office GEOMETRIX: LINE, FORM, SUBVERSION]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lamentations'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://brian-dailey-6t9u.squarespace.com/lamentations/ Brian Dailey Art, "Lamentations"]&lt;/ref&gt; a meditation in two and three dimensions on nuclear theology and its implications in our atomic age, was featured in an interview with the artist in the Johns Hopkin's Journal of the Association for the Study of Arts of the Present.&lt;ref&gt;"To Look Is To Think: A Conversation with Brian Dailey," ''ASAP/Journal,'' Volume 2, Number 1 (January 2017): pp. 49-70.  [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/649708]&lt;/ref&gt; Three works from the ''Lamentations'' series were included in Absence and Presence: Arts in Foggy Bottom Outdoor Sculpture Biennial 2018, Washington DC &lt;ref&gt;[http://artsinfoggybottom.com/#!/current]&lt;/ref&gt; and the associated exhibition at the Watergate Gallery. Dailey's ''Words'' series,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.briandaileyart.com/words/ Brian Dailey Art, ''Words'']&lt;/ref&gt; an international exploration of the role of language in the construction of cultural identity in the global age, premiered in January 2018 at the Katzen Art Center at American University in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/02/23/brian-daileys-strange-odyssey-from-art-to-terror-and-back-again/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Her Britannic Majesty''', or '''His Britannic Majesty''' ('''HBM'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hbm|title=HBM definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the [[gender|sex]] of the [[monarch]], is a formal, or [[official]], term for the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[Political power|power]] of the [[United Kingdom]] in [[diplomacy]], the [[law of nation]]s, and [[international relations]].

For example, in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] of the [[League of Nations]], it was ''His Britannic Majesty'' who was designated as the [[League of Nations mandate|Mandatory]] for [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

Britannic Majesty is used in all [[British passport]]s, where the following sentence is used:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State Requests and requires in the Name of Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance, and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a reduced version of the wording on this British passport, issued in 1979:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Her Britannic Majesty's Principal [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] Requests and requires in the Name of Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance, and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''California State Relief Administration (SRA)''', created in 1935, was the successor to the '''State Emergency Relief Administration (SERA)''', created in 1933.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18759">'''Corruption in [[Navarre]]''' refers to a quick succession of corruption scandals which have come to light since 2012 referring to the [[Navarrese People's Union|UPN]]'s tenure in office (since 1996). However, amidst heated political confrontation since the late days of Franco's dictatorship, the first corruption cases erupted early on, going back to the first government cabinets formed after the establishment of Navarre's "Betterment" (the ''Amejoramiento'', a Navarre-specific administrative system, 1982).

In 1996, [[Miguel Sanz]]'s government started a 15-year period of distancing and breaking of virtually all historic institutional bonds and cultural cooperation with [[Southern Basque Country|fellow Basque provinces]], citing fears of a "Basque nationalist takeover", and billing themselves as the guarantee of Navarrese institutions and identity. However, two prime rallying points and historic flagship institutions of all the Navarrese, i.e.[[Caja Navarra]] and [[Osasuna]], collapsed during the UPN's tenure in office.

==Recent scandals and irregularities==
[[File:Rajoy con Yolanda Barcina.jpg|thumb|Yolanda Barcina, former president of Navarre (2011-2015), shaking hands with Spanish premier Mariano Rajoy]]
*[[Caja Navarra scandal]]: Erupted in 2012 under the presidency of [[Enrique Goñi]], resulting in the disappearance of the historic Navarrese savings bank.  	
*[[Cervera affair]]: A development of the Caja Navarra scandal, it jumped onto the spotlight in December 2012 when [[Santiago Cervera]], a Navarrese [[Popular Party (Spain)|Spanish Conservative]] leader, was found collecting an envelope containing 25,000 euros at the old rampart of Pamplona, and arrested on the spot. The money happened to be a bait planted by the Civil Guard, but Cervera was accused of attempting to blackmail former [[Caja Navarra]] CEO Jose Antonio Asiain in exchange for keeping silent on inconvenient Caja Navarra facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lanas|first=Pedro|date=2014-01-20|title=El misterio del chantaje trampa al diputado Cervera |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/01/20/actualidad/1390244904_522273.html |newspaper=El País|location=Pamplona |access-date=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right the opposite, besides claiming that he was duped, Cervera blamed the whole affair on his opposition to "the looting" taking place in Caja Navarra, aligning in that denouncement with the Navarrese Basque nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carrillo|first=Xabier|date= |title=Santiago Cervera sigue defendiendo su inocencia|url=http://www.eitb.eus/es/noticias/politica/videos/detalle/3252884/video-santiago-cervera--juicio-exdiputado-pp/ |newspaper=EITB|access-date=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Racing circuit of [[Los Arcos]]: A [[white elephant]] case operating at a loss with questioned allocation of works and UPN's government intervention. Designed under [[Miguel Sanz]] and Yolanda Barcina, the project was allocated to the building company ''Samaniego'' but it soon risked bankruptcy, in the face of which the regional government purchased 95% of its capital. The Government of Navarre had to request a credit to meet expenses incurred on the construction works, a figure rising to 62 million euros. Once the circuit opened in 2010, it operated at a loss from scratch (2,6 million euros on its first year). In December 2013, the regional government sold all of the facilities to ''Los Arcos Motorsport'', leading to a balance sheet of 45 millions in losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Orzaiz|first=Jon|date=2015-04-03|title=Absurdoari monumentuak |url=http://www.berria.eus/albisteak/109660/absurdoari_monumentuak.htm |newspaper=Berria|location=Pamplona|access-date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Public Health Service catering case: Recurrent complaints by patients over the catering service (contractor Mediterranea de Catering) due to poor standards in food, denied by the Government of Navarre. A tribunal imposed a fine on the catering service. The recently outsourced service was found to be operating at higher expenses than the regular public catering service in force up to that point, as disclosed by the Accountancy Chamber of Navarre (the Comptos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2015-02-09|title=La jueza confirma la multa por la comida de los hospitales navarros: 6.000 euros por sus errores "constantes" |url=http://www.eldiario.es/norte/navarra/ultima_hora/confirma-servicio-privatizado-hospitales-constantes_0_354865172.html |newspaper=El Diario|location= |access-date=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition parties, besides condemning the lack of transparency, labeled "a scandal" the conclusions of the Accountancy Chamber's report, one that pointed to financial losses coupled with a deterioration in food standards following outsourcing of the service. These parties demanded in turn the resignation of regional Health Secretary Marta Vera. Just the opposite, UPN's regional government, while "respecting" the conclusions, protested their not considering "the actual circumstances" of the moment the privatization decision was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2014-06-24|title=La oposición ve "escandaloso" el informe sobre la privatización de las cocinas de hospitales |url=http://www.eldiario.es/norte/navarra/ultima_hora/Solo-privatizacion-servicio-hospital-empresa_0_274373445.html |newspaper=El Diario|location= |access-date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Health Service crisis: In September 2014, Juan José Rubio, Chief Manager of the Navarre Health Service (''Osasunbidea''), stepped down on operative and managerial outlook discrepancies with Health Secretary of Navarre Marta Vera (UPN); Rubio had been asked to "remain shut in his office" and "out of touch with the board of directors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=EP|first=|date=2014-09-17|title=Vera me pidió que no saliera del despacho y que trabajara desde la distancia y sin comunicación con el equipo directivo |url=http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2014/09/17/sociedad/navarra/vera-me-pidio-que-no-saliera-del-despacho-y-que-trabajara-desde-la-distancia-y-sin-comunicacion-con-el-equipo-directivo |newspaper=Noticas de Navarra|location=Pamplona |access-date=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Rubio, who had been appointed to the highest position in Osasunbidea by the regional government, dwelt later on details, claiming the "organization is sick", involving serious dysfunctions and discontentment among professional and patients alike and pointing to privileges in the Health Service favouring "certain families and crusts" from Navarre. He called for the institution's urgent and necessary re-foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=EFE EPE|first=|date=2014-09-30|title=EL EXGERENTE EN COMISIÓN PARLAMENTARIA Juanjo Rubio, exgerente: 'La organización del SNS-O está enferma' |url=http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2014/09/30/sociedad/navarra/juanjo-rubio-exgerente-la-organizacion-del-sns-o-esta-enferma|location=Pamplona |access-date=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional party UPN, in office, put Mr. Rubio's resignation down to his "inability to accommodate." Opposition parties made Ms. Vera fully responsible for the current state of the public Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Montañes|first=Garikoitz|date=2014-09-30|title=Un sistema de salud público en el que importa tu apellido o condición social |url=http://www.eldiario.es/norte/navarra/ultima_hora/exgerente-servicio-Salud-necesita-refundarse_0_308669278.html%202014-09-30|location=Pamplona |access-date=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*City Police scandals: A series of abuses and arbitrary behaviour detected on the chief officials of the corps Simon Santamaria and Ignacio Polo. The Professional Union of City Police Officers of Spain pointed out that the "work atmosphere between officials and superiors is very tense", with the Pamplona City Police showing the highest work absenteeism rate in like environments across Spain, due to stress and depression. The union's serious allegations against the chief head Santamaria included bullying, harassment, false evidence, and reprisals against police officers, besides denouncing mayor [[Enrique Maya]]'s championing of the chief official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2013-08-16|title=Prevaricación, coacción, vejaciones. Un sindicato de la Policía Municipal de Pamplona presenta una denuncia contra su jefe y varios mandos que salpica al alcalde de la ciudad, Enrique Maya |url=http://www.elconfidencialautonomico.com/navarra/Prevaricacion-Policia-Municipal-Pamplona-Enrique_0_2108789110.html |newspaper=El Confidencial Autonómico|location= |access-date=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Navarrese People's Union|UPN]]-appointed Santamaria eventually resigned after political opposition build-up, with opposition parties considering the situation "untenable" and the corps "a paramilitary body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2013-08-16|title=La oposición de Pamplona censura la gestión de Simón Santamaría y espera una Policía Municipal "de cercanía" |url=http://www.europapress.es/navarra/noticia-oposicion-pamplona-censura-gestion-simon-santamaria-espera-policia-municipal-cercania-20150116110411 |newspaper=Europa Press|location= |access-date=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In stark contrast, Maya saluted Santamaria's job during his tenure as "very good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2015-01-16|title=Maya: 'Santamaría se va por razones personales; la ciudad no es nada fácil'|url=http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2015/01/16/vecinos/pamplona/maya-santamaria-se-va-por-razones-personales-esta-ciudad-no-es-nada-facil  |newspaper=Noticias de Navarra|location= |access-date=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In similar circumstances, Pamplona's Citizen Security deputy of Pamplona Ignacio Polo (UPN) was convicted of drink-driving, with his allegations against lower-rank police officers conducting the alcohol check being dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Montañes|first=Garikoitz|date=2015-02-16|title=El exedil de Seguridad Ciudadana de Pamplona Ignacio Polo, culpable por conducir ebrio |url=http://www.eldiario.es/norte/navarra/ultima_hora/Seguridad-Ciudadana-Pamplona-Ignacio-Polo_0_357314398.html |newspaper=El Diario|location= |access-date=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Osasuna]] scandal: This erupted in early 2015 related to the iconic Navarrese top-flight football club, with links to the Treasury of the Government of Navarre, involving tax evasion, turning a blind eye in governmental surveillance duties, match fixing practices, etc. A UPN-PP-PSN majority vote in the Parliament of Navarre passed a blind fiscal bailout on Osasuna without waiting to audit results while refusing to hand over Osasuna's accountancy information to opposition parties for their consideration ahead of the vote on the law. PSN's spokesperson claimed "they had not been told" of any irregular finances by the directive board of Osasuna, while on the opposite side, [[EH Bildu]] branded the whole affair "a disgrace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carrillo|first=Xabier|date= |title=Osasuna: UPN y PSN, 'preocupados'; Bildu lo tacha de 'escandaloso'|url=http://www.eitb.eus/es/noticias/politica/videos/detalle/2982984/video-osasuna-presunto-amano-partidos--24-millones-justificar/ |newspaper=EITB|access-date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The football club owed the Government of Navarre 52,8 million euros, but after handing over its patrimony to the government of Navarre, the club's debt rises to 20,6 million euros after the law passed by UPN, [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] and [[Socialist Party of Navarre|PSN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lanas|first=Pedro|date=2015-04-30|title=20,6 millones, la deuda fiscal |url=http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2015/04/30/osasuna/206-millones-la-deuda-fiscal |newspaper=Noticias de Navarra|location= |access-date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is under scrutiny by the European Commission in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=EFE|first=|date=2015-05-20|title=Bruselas mantiene abierta una investigación a Osasuna por ayudas de Estado |url=http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2015/05/20/osasuna/bruselas-mantiene-abierta-una-investigacion-a-osasuna-por-ayudas-de-estado|newspaper=Noticias de Navarra|location=Pamplona|access-date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Otano affair: [[Socialist Party of Navarre|Socialist]] president of Navarre Javier Otano (1995-1996) was leading a tripartite coalition with parties [[Eusko Alkartasuna]] and CDN when revelations broke out of the existence of a bank account under his name in Switzerland, with Otano announcing his resignation from office almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Muez|first=Mikel|date=1996-06-19|title=Dimisión fulminante del socialista Javier Otano al descubrirle la juez una cuenta en Suiza|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1996/06/19/espana/835135226_850215.html |newspaper=El País|location=Madrid|access-date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otano categorically denied any personal intent for his signature on the account, signing only "on request of Urralburu" in 1991 for the sake of the party. It was revealed as a case of illegal funding of the Spanish Socialists in Navarre and fraud to the Navarre Treasury driven by Gabriel Urralburu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lopez|first=B.|date=2005-06-22|title=La comisión del "caso Otano" concluye que el PSN se benefició del dinero de Suiza|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-22-06-2005/abc/Nacional/la-comision-del-caso-otano-concluye-que-el-psn-se-beneficio-del-dinero-de-suiza_203313352889.html|newspaper=ABC|location=Madrid|access-date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; with deep political implications. The coalition broke up right away, and [[Juan Cruz Alli]], the leading figure of [[Democrats' Convergence of Navarre|CDN]] (a splinter party of UPN), blamed the scandal directly on "[[Socialist Party of Navarre|Socialist]] disloyalty" for demolishing "the possibility of building an alternative Government of Navarre [other than UPN or PSN] integrating diverse political options and therefore betting on the support of the bulk of the Navarre society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=|date=2008-03-29|title=Alli deja la dirección de CDN culpando de su deriva a la "deslealtad" del PSN en 1996|url=http://gara.naiz.eus/paperezkoa/20080329/69891/es/Alli-deja-direccion-CDN-culpando-su-deriva-deslealtad-PSN-1996|newspaper=Gara|location=|access-date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Courage to Resist''' (CTR) formed as an organization in the [[San Francisco]], CA area during the early part of the [[Iraq War]] (often called the 2nd Iraq war), which began in 2003. It now has members spread around the U.S., but is still mainly concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area. The group’s overall mission is to support U.S military war resisters, including helping them with legal fees. They have defended and supported well-known resisters like [[Chelsea Manning]] and [[Reality Winner]], and in 2018 began encouraging soldiers to refuse to be involved with the immigrant detention camps and other immigrant operations of the U.S. military. Their principle slogans are “Supporting the troops who refuse to fight!” and "Towards a World Without War!" They support those “who face consequences for acting on conscience, in opposition to illegal wars, occupations, [and] the policies of empire”.

== Founding ==
The Iraq War started amid controversy with many questioning everything from its legality to the existence in Iraq of “weapons of mass destruction”. According to French academic [[Dominique Reynié]], between 3 January and 12 April 2003, {{Nowrap|36 million}} people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against war in Iraq, with [[15 February 2003 anti-war protests|demonstrations on 15 February 2003]] being the largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reynié |first1=Dominique |date=2005 |title=Globalized protest: Demonstrating in the age of globalization: the case of rallies against the Iraq war in 2003 |url=https://www.academia.edu/6081355/GLOBALIZED_PROTEST._DEMONSTRATING_IN_THE_AGE_OF_GLOBALIZATION_THE_CASE_OF_RALLIES_AGAINST_THE_IRAQ_WAR_IN_2003_1 |journal=www.academia.edu |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This questioning was also occurring in the U.S. military and on April 1, 2003 Stephen E. Funk, a U.S. Marine Corps Lance Corporal Reservist, became the first of numerous soldier resisters when he held a press conference outside the [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton Marine Base]] in Oceanside, CA publicly announcing his refusal to participate in the war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2003-04-01 |first=Laurie |last=Goodstein |title=A Nation at War: Dissent; Conscientious Objector Numbers Are Small but Growing|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Like minded civilians and veterans of earlier wars stepped forward to support Funk and then decided, as other soldiers refused orders and faced courts martial, that a broader organization was needed. It wouldn’t be enough, they thought, to form a committee in support of each individual objector – the result was Courage to Resist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Jeff Paterson |date=2012-02-04 |title=Jeff Paterson and the Founding of Courage to Resist |medium=Video |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxMUFTzNiXA |access-date=2018-11-19 |location=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jeff Paterson ==

[[File:Jeff Paterson Refusing to Board Aircraft to Persian Gulf 1990.jpg|thumb|left|Marine Corporal Jeff Paterson refused to board military aircraft in Hawaii enroute to Persian Gulf on August 7, 1990.]]

One of Funk’s early supporters was Jeff Paterson, a former Marine who, because he was the first soldier to publically refuse orders to the 1st Iraq War in 1990, felt a particular kinship with Funk. Paterson had been a Marine for five years and was on the verge of returning to civilian life when his discharge was cancelled in lieu of orders to the Persian Gulf. On August 7, 1990, as his unit boarded an aircraft in Hawaii, he sat down on the tarmac and refused to move. A week later he, like Funk, held a press conference where he stated, “I will not be a pawn in America’s power plays for profit and oil in the Middle East”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1990-09-13 |first=Robert |last=Stewart |title=Anti-War Sentiment is Seen Growing in the Armed Forces|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1990-09-23 |first=Colman |last=McCarthy |title=This Time, the Pacifists Are Starting Sooner |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2001-01-21 |title=Gulf War Resister Jeff Paterson: Up Against the War Machine |work=Revolutionary Worker |url=https://revcom.us/a/v22/1080-89/1087/jeff_paterson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson was a founding member of and has served for many years as the Project Director for CTR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2011-11-02 |first=Ashley |last=Fantz |title=Key People In WikiLeaks Saga Are Divided On Assange Extradition|work=St. Joseph News-Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Opposition to the Iraq War ==
CTR supported several early public resisters to the Iraq War, including Army Staff Sergeants Camilo Mejia and Kevin Benderman, Navy Petty Officer Pablo Paredes, Army medic Agustin Aguayo, Private First Class [[Robin Long]], and Army First Lieutenant Ehren Watada, and continued to support military resisters throughout the war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2008-08-23 |first=Dan |last=Frosch |title=Soldier Who Deserted to Canada Draws 15-Month Term |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2005-05-28 |first=Joe |last=Garofoli |title=Anti-war sailor lifts foes of Iraq policy |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2006-09-27 |first=Adrienne |last=Ziegler |title=I'm Not A Deserter or a Coward: Soldier Surrenders at Fort Irwin |work=McClatchy - Tribune Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peaceandjustice.org.uk/newsletter/p-j-news-february-16/unsung-heroes-courage-to-resist/ |title=Unsung Heroes: Courage to Resist |last=Ames |first=Izi |date=2016-02-02 |publisher=Edinburgh Peace and Justice Centre |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2006-06-27 |first=Alex |last=Fryer |title=Opponents of Iraq War Rally Around Lt.

They raised money to build public support and to help with legal defense. They staged rallies outside the military bases where resisters were being court martialed, demonstrated outside military recruiting stations, and participated in national days of actions to oppose the war and support war resisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2007-01-31 |title=Do you support the troops who oppose war in Iraq? |work=Redlands Daily Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2005-03-20 |first=Robert D. |last=McFadden |title=Two Years After Iraq Invasion, Protesters Hold Small Rallies |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the War in Afghanistan ==

CTR supported the earliest public resisters to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] including [[Victor Agosto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2009-08-05 |first=James C. |last=McKinley Jr. |title=Soldier Who Didn’t Obey Is Jailed |work=New York Times}}[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/us/06soldier.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and Travis Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wri-irg.org/en/node/8561/ |title=Conscientious objector Travis Bishop sentenced to one year in prison |date=2009-08-14 |publisher=War Resisters' International |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli War Resisters Support ==
CTR members traveled to Israel and Palestine, learning much about Israeli war resistance movements. They talked with former Israeli soldiers about their experiences “carrying out acts of brutality and occupation” and decided as an organization to support their resistance to the Israeli military. In 2008 they were instrumental in issuing a statement signed by 26 U.S. military soldiers and veterans who refused to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, which supported Israeli [[Refusal to serve in the IDF|Shministim]] (Hebrew for “12th graders”) who were also resisting military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.commondreams.org/views/2008/12/18/taking-stand-our-fellow-war-resisters |title=Taking a Stand With Our Fellow War-Resisters |date=2008-12-18 |publisher=Common Dreams |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 they supported Tamar Ze’evi, a 15-year-old who spent 115 days in jail for refusing to enlist in the Israeli army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2017-03-24 |first=Gili |last=Cohen |title=After 115 Days in Jail, Conscientious Objector Tamar Zeevi Released From Israeli Army |work=Haaretz |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-after-115-days-in-jail-conscientious-objector-released-from-israeli-army-1.5452760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chelsea Manning Support ==
[[File:Bradley-manning-pride001 (5877957820).jpg|thumb|Activists March for Bradley Manning at the 2011 San Francisco Pride Parade.]]In April 2010 a video showing a U.S. helicopter attack in [[Baghdad]] that killed eleven unarmed Iraqi civilians, including two [[Reuters]] employees, and seriously wounded two children was released by [[Wikileaks]] and quickly spread via the Internet and news media. On May 27, 2010, [[Chelsea Manning]], then known as Bradley Manning, was arrested and soon charged with espionage and “aiding the enemy”. Within days of Manning’s arrest, CTR joined with others to defend her and help raise money for her defense. On August 21, 2013 she was sentenced 35 years in prison, reduction in rank to private, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. This was the longest sentence ever given to a whistleblower and was widely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/21/bradley-manning-sentence-unjust Bradley Manning: a sentence both unjust and unfair], ''The Guardian'', August 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/opinion/bradley-mannings-sentence-is-excessive.html Bradley Manning’s Excessive Sentence] ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the trial and the 7 years Manning ended up serving in [[United States Disciplinary Barracks|Leavenworth prison]], CTR defended her and provided financial support through the Chelsea Manning Support Network. Manning's lead defense attorney, David Coombs, credited CTR directly for her early release: “If not for the efforts of Jeff Paterson and the Manning Support Network and Courage to Resist, there’s no way that a president would spend the political capital to grant a commutation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://couragetoresist.org/podcast-david-coombs-manning-attorney/ |title=PODCAST: DAVID COOMBS, CHELSEA MANNING’S TRIAL ATTORNEY |date=2017-05-14 |publisher=Courage To Resist |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Manning herself said on the [[NBC]] [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] show that she "would especially like to thank Courage to Resist and the Bradley Manning Support Network for their tireless efforts in raising awareness for my case and providing for my legal representation."[[File:Stop Recruiting Kids Image 1.jpg|thumb|left|Image used by the Stop Recruiting Kids Organization]]

== Counter-Recruiting ==
Throughout its existence, CTR has focused some of its efforts on U.S. military recruiting, including the efforts of the military to influence and recruit youth. They have organized demonstration and vigils outside military recruiting centers and have on at least one occasion forced a Marine recruiting center to close for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://couragetoresist.org/marinesshutdown/ |title=SUCCESSFUL SHUTDOWN OF MARINE RECRUITING CENTER! |date=2018-05-17 |publisher=Courage To Resist |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2008-01-21 |first=Mark |last=Brown |title=U.S. Military's Recruitment Tactics Faulted by Activists |work=The Register-Guard}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use materials like the photo on the right from the ''Stop Recruiting Kids''[http://www.srkcampaign.org/] campaign.

== Reality Winner Support ==
[[Reality Winner]], a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist and military contractor, was arrested on June 3, 2017 and charged under the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] with [[News leak|leaking]] a National Security Agency report about [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] to the news website ''[[The Intercept]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2018-06-26 |first=Charlie |last=Savage |first2=Alan |last2=Blinder |title=Reality Winner, N.S.A. Contractor Accused in Leak, Pleads Guilty |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very quickly after her arrest, CTR began a campaign demanding the charges against her be dropped. They led the efforts to form the ''Stand With Reality'' support committee which stated that “the charge against Winner is grossly disproportionate to her alleged offense, and is designed to create a chilling effect on investigative journalism by dissuading sources from sharing information that is critical to the public interest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://couragetoresist.org/press-release-new-stand-reality-support-group-formed/ |title=SUPPORT GATHERS FOR NSA CONTRACTOR REALITY WINNER |date=2017-07-10 |publisher=Courage To Resist |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://standwithreality.org |title=FRIENDS OF REALITY WINNER |date=2017-07-10 |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 23, 2018 Winner received a sentence of 5 Years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2018-08-23 |first=Dave |last=Philipps |title=Reality Winner, Former N.S.A. Translator, Gets More Than 5 Years in Leak of Russian Hacking Report |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since her conviction, CTR has joined with many other organizations to call for Winner’s pardon or the commuting of her sentence to time served.

== Immigrants ==
CTR’s most recent campaign opposes the use of U.S. military personnel in immigrant detention camps and along U.S. borders. They have produced materials encouraging soldiers to resist what they call “illegal” orders in relation to immigration and they have supported GIs who have publically resisted. For example, they support U.S. Army Captain Brittany DeBarros who has used social media and other public statements to voice her opposition to the military’s immigrant related deployments. She stated, “I didn’t take an oath to defend illegal war abroad and immigrant concentration camps at home. True leaders refuse illegal and immoral orders.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://couragetoresist.org/open-letter-border/ |title=OPEN LETTER TO ACTIVE DUTY SOLDIERS ON THE BORDER |date=2018-11-15 |last=Fanning |first=Former U.S. Army Ranger Rory

[[File:Basil D'Oliveira 1968.tiff|thumb|200px|[[Basil D'Oliveira]], the [[England cricket team|England]] player of South African [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] background around whom the controversy centred, pictured in 1968]]
The '''D'Oliveira affair''' was a prolonged political and sporting controversy relating to the scheduled 1968–69 tour of South Africa by the [[England cricket team]], who were officially representing the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).{{refn|group=note|name=MCC}} The point of contention was whether or not the England selectors would include [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a mixed-race South African player who had represented England in [[Test cricket]] since 1966, having moved there six years earlier. With South Africa under [[apartheid]], the potential inclusion by England of a non-white South African in their tour party became a political issue.

A [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa primarily because the era's [[apartheid legislation]] seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred him from the all-white Test team. He qualified for [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club]] through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister [[B.&amp;nbsp;J. Vorster]] sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did all he could to prevent it.

D'Oliveira was omitted from the England team for part of 1968 amid a slump in his batting form, but he marked his return in late August with a score of 158 runs in England's final Test match of the year, against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at [[The Oval]]. Days later, the MCC selectors omitted D'Oliveira from the team to tour South Africa; they insisted that this was based entirely on cricketing merit, but many in Britain voiced apprehension and there was a public outcry. After [[Tom Cartwright]]'s withdrawal because of injury on 16 September, the MCC chose D'Oliveira as a replacement, prompting accusations from Vorster and other South African politicians that the selection was politically motivated. Attempts to find a compromise followed, but these led nowhere. The MCC announced the tour's cancellation on 24 September.

[[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era|Sporting boycotts]] of South Africa were already under way by 1968, but the D'Oliveira controversy was the first to have a serious effect on South African cricket. The [[South African Cricket Board of Control]] announced its intention to remove racial barriers in South African cricket in 1969, and formally integrated the sport in 1976. Meanwhile, the boycott movement escalated sharply, leading to South Africa's near-complete isolation from international cricket from 1971, though the country continued to play international rugby into the 1980s, twice allowing mixed-race [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand rugby teams]] into the country during the 1970s. D'Oliveira played for England until 1972, and for Worcestershire until 1979. South Africa returned to international cricket in 1991, soon after apartheid began to be dismantled.

From the time that European settlers first arrived in South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Following its general election victory [[South African general election, 1948|in 1948]], the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], led by [[Daniel François Malan|Daniel Malan]], formalised this racism under a government policy called [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "You've got to be Carefully Taught", Location 741&lt;/ref&gt; Under apartheid, different races were kept apart in all aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "You've got to be Carefully Taught", Location 800.&lt;/ref&gt; This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and [[apartheid legislation|laws]], supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.&lt;ref name="O14-15"/&gt;

From a cricketing viewpoint, the apartheid policy made little difference.&lt;ref name="O14-15" /&gt; Although cricket was played widely among the different racial groups in South Africa, the [[South Africa national cricket team|Test team]], which represented the country in international matches, had always been all white.{{refn|group=note|Controversy exists regarding the ancestry of [[Charlie Llewellyn|C.

Different races were forbidden from competing against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 114–19.&lt;/ref&gt; South African cricket teams did not compete against [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] or the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], but teams from [[England cricket team|England]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] continued to visit the country. English cricketers particularly enjoyed tours to South Africa owing to the hospitality they received and the quality of living. The political writer and historian [[Peter Oborne]] commented: "Relations between the cricket establishments of the two countries were exceptionally warm. Only few visitors noticed, and even fewer cared, that there was something wrong."&lt;ref name="O14-15"&gt;Oborne, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain and the England cricket team===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-1-11.jpg|thumb|UK Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] ''(left)'' visits Nigeria in 1960. British attitudes towards race and apartheid were shifting greatly at this time.|alt=A white man in a business suit shakes hands with a black man in white robes.]]
From the mid-1950s, the [[United Nations]] began to express concern over apartheid, and there was a growing general awareness in Britain of its effects. In 1960 the [[UK Prime Minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]], criticised apartheid in his "[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]" speech to the South African parliament.{{refn|Macmillan stressed the rising black nationalist ambitions across Africa, made clear Britain's intent to grant independence to its remaining colonies and urged the South African government to work towards eventually creating a society "in which individual merit, and individual merit
alone, is the criterion for a man's advancement". The speech and its theme had been widely anticipated in South Africa, but the frank tone of Macmillan's delivery surprised many. The parliamentarians received the speech coldly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1960: Macmillan speaks of 'wind of change' in Africa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/3/newsid_2714000/2714525.stm|location=London|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"|name="woc"}} However, the British government was cautious; the large number of British passport holders and businesses based in South Africa made them reluctant to force the issue and provoke a confrontation. Additionally, there was support for the policy among some right-wing politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "Waiting for Godot", Location 3472.&lt;/ref&gt; When the MCC team [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1956–57|toured South Africa in 1956–57]], the players observed and were shocked by what they considered to be injustices against the black population. As many players and officials had family and friends in the country, they were disinclined to take a stand, but several condemned the situation in print at the time or later.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "The Tribe that Lost its Head", Location 4285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall attitudes in Britain towards South African cricket began to change in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="W54" /&gt; At the time, race was becoming a more emotive matter in Britain and [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since Irish independence|immigration from Asia and the Caribbean]] became an issue in general elections.&lt;ref name="Williams53" /&gt; Racial tensions had risen throughout the 1950s, and race riots had occurred. Tim Quelch, in his review of English cricket in the 1950s, suggests that "[England's] record on race relations had hardly been exemplary".&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "The Tribe that Lost its Head", Location 4342.&lt;/ref&gt; But Jack Williams, in his book ''Cricket and Race'', suggests that cricket was a force for racial harmony in England given the influx of African-Caribbean and Asian overseas players and the mingling of white and African-Caribbean supporters during several Test series between England and the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]].&lt;ref name="Williams53"&gt;Williams, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this background, when [[South African cricket team in England in 1960|the South African team toured England in 1960]], there were some protests against apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Duffus | first1 = Louis | last2=Owen-Smith | first2=Michael | last3=Odendaal |first3=Andre| editor1-last=Swanton | editor1-first=E.

===International sport===

Within South Africa, there was growing realisation among opponents of apartheid that sport could play a role in pressuring the government.&lt;ref name="W54" /&gt; During the 1950s, South Africa competed freely in international competition; the governing bodies of the major international sports recognised only the official, all-white South African institutions. By the end of the decade, this began to change. Several non-white sporting organisations within South Africa united and began to influence international opinion. The resulting pressure brought about the suspension of the all-white [[South African Football Association|Football Association of South Africa]] from [[FIFA]]—for two years from 1961, then after a brief reinstatement, again from 1964—which prevented [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] from participating in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]].&lt;ref name=O119/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of Race and International Sport: the Case of South Africa|last=Lapchick|first=Richard E.|date=April 1975|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-8371-7691-8|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa was also excluded from international fencing in 1964. However, because neither fencing nor football was closely followed in white South Africa, the impact was limited. [[Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics|Suspension from the Olympics]] had a greater effect;&lt;ref name=W64&gt;Williams, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; another campaign from within South Africa and the consequent change in international opinion resulted in South Africa being barred from the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] and those that followed.&lt;ref name=O119&gt;Oborne, pp. 119–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, before a tour by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand rugby team]], the South African government asked New Zealand to field an all-white team (thereby excluding [[Māori people|Māori]] players); the [[New Zealand Rugby Union|New Zealand Rugby Football Union]] refused and cancelled the tour.&lt;ref name=O134/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 5, Location 976.&lt;/ref&gt; As rugby was very popular among white South Africans, this caused concern in that community.&lt;ref name="W64"&gt;Williams, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The England cricket team was in New Zealand at the time, and Billy Griffith, by then the secretary of the MCC, when questioned said that the MCC would also cancel in similar circumstances.&lt;ref name=O134&gt;Oborne, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these events in other world sports, South Africa continued to play international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "The Tribe that Lost its Head", Location 4330.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to put pressure on the [[International Cricket Council|International Cricket Conference]] (ICC) failed, and even when South Africa withdrew from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961 (theoretically forfeiting the national team's Test status), their traditional opponents continued to play official Tests against them despite opposition from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basil D'Oliveira===

[[Basil D'Oliveira]] was born in [[Cape Town]] in 1931 and, coming from a mixed Indian-Portuguese background, formed part of the [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/sports/cricket/basil-doliveira-a-symbol-for-cricket-and-for-equality-dies-at-80.html?_r=0|title=Basil D'Oliveira, a Symbol for Cricket and for Equality, Dies at 80|first=Douglas|last=Martin|location=New York|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 November 2011|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated skill in cricket from an early age, but as the apartheid system classified him as non-white, he was barred from playing [[first-class cricket]] in South Africa or representing the national team.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/568146.html | title = Basil D'Oliveira (Obituary)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 2012 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate = 23 June 2013 | isbn=978-1-4081-5634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented and captained a "non-white" South African team which played unofficial international matches.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; He was left distraught by the cancellation in 1959, at the behest of South African anti-apartheid campaigners, of a proposed visit by a West Indies team which was to compete against non-white sides. Realising that he had achieved all he could as a non-white sportsman in South Africa, he wrote to John Arlott in England to ask for help finding employment as a cricketer.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=O5564/&gt;

Arlott enlisted the help of [[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]], a cricket journalist with expertise in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire leagues]], to find a job for D'Oliveira as a club professional. No teams were initially interested, but when [[Middleton Cricket Club|Middleton]]'s professional withdrew at the last minute, the club employed D'Oliveira for the 1960 season.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=O5564&gt;Oborne, pp. 55–64.&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor start, he prospered for Middleton. He established a wider reputation by playing televised matches for a team called the "Cavaliers", and took part in overseas tours with some leading cricketers. Several English [[county cricket club]]s expressed an interest in him, and he eventually joined [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. Qualifying for the county team through residency,{{refn|group=note|At the time, cricketers had to have lived in a county for a year to qualify to play for that team.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;}} he made his debut in 1964 and scored a [[century (cricket)|century]] on his first appearance. By the 1966 season, he had progressed to the point that he was picked for England Test team. D'Oliveira was immediately successful for England; by the following year he was well-established in the team.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

==Build-up==

===Anticipation===

From early in his England career, D'Oliveira and his supporters saw the MCC tour of South Africa in 1968–69 as potentially being a key moment in his career.&lt;ref name=O134/&gt; Guy Fraser-Sampson suggests: "Nobody could be in any doubt that the possibility of D'Oliveira being chosen as a member of the England touring party would raise massive political complications".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 5, Location 973.&lt;/ref&gt; When D'Oliveira visited South Africa to work as a  coach in 1966, the subject was raised continually. People speculated whether D'Oliveira would be selected and, if so, whether the South African government would allow him to play. Some of his supporters worried that his acceptance of a place on a tour to South Africa might be interpreted as approval of the political situation there, but D'Oliveira was determined to play, aware of what it would mean to the non-white people of South Africa.&lt;ref name="O126-28"&gt;Oborne, pp. 126–28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Griffith flew to South Africa to discuss the forthcoming tour and to seek a solution to any potential problems—the MCC wanted the tour to go ahead without any political trouble. Little came of the meetings; Oborne suggests that both sides simply "agreed to hope that the whole issue went away".&lt;ref name="O134–35"&gt;Oborne, pp. 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful season for England in 1967, D'Oliveira was chosen to tour the West Indies in 1967–68;&lt;ref name="O126-28"/&gt; this raised awareness in England and South Africa that he was a realistic contender to tour South Africa a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his opportunities to excel were few in the West Indies; circumstances were against him in several matches, and he had a statistically poor tour. Any mitigating circumstances were offset by problems off the field. D'Oliveira took full advantage of the social opportunities available on a tour of the West Indies and frequently disappeared to parties and other events, often not reappearing until after breakfast. Rumours to this effect reached the press and the MCC tour manager spoke to D'Oliveira about his responsibilities on tour. D'Oliveira said that his behaviour and poor form were partly a result of the pressure placed on him. He was frequently questioned about the South African tour and about race—some groups in the West Indies accused him of "selling out" by playing for England's "white" team.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 129–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa's position===

The position of the South African government towards mixed-race teams was well established by 1967. It was stated explicitly after the visit of Griffith when, in February 1967, the Interior Minister [[P.&amp;nbsp;K. Le Roux]] said in a speech: "We will not allow mixed teams to play against our white teams here. That is our policy. It is well known here and overseas."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; These comments caused a public row in Britain, and some commentators wanted the tour to be called off; the MCC informed the British government that players would be selected on ability alone and that any attempts from within South Africa to interfere would cause the tour to be cancelled. [[Denis Howell, Baron Howell|Denis Howell]], the [[Minister for Sport and the Olympics|Minister for Sport]], informed the House of Commons of the MCC position and stated that the government expected that the MCC would cancel the tour if any player were to be rejected. Privately, the MCC committee were unhappy to have been forced into so unequivocal a position.&lt;ref name="O135-38"&gt;Oborne, pp. 135–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. J. Vorster]], the [[Prime Minister of South Africa]], was embarrassed by Le Roux's public comments and forced him to deny having made them. However, the British government's intervention cemented in Vorster's mind the idea that it and the MCC were closely connected.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1298.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1967 he gave a speech in which he said that while sport between white and non-white teams could not take place in South Africa, the government would be prepared to send mixed teams to play abroad and to accommodate mixed teams from South Africa's "traditional" opponents. This change of direction was aimed at entering a team in the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], to avoid a repeat of the cancelled New Zealand rugby tour and with D'Oliveira's selection in mind.&lt;ref name="O135-38"/&gt; The MCC decided later in 1967 to clarify that Vorster's government would impose no limitations on the players chosen for the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1968, Griffith wrote on behalf of the MCC to the [[Cricket South Africa|South African Cricket Association]] (SACA) with the implication that the tour would be cancelled if a free selection was not guaranteed.&lt;ref name="O135-38"/&gt;

According to Oborne, Vorster was a pragmatic politician who wanted to maintain apartheid and to make it appear acceptable to the outside world. To this end, attempting to broaden South Africa's international connections, he accepted black foreign diplomats in the country and began to plan a policy to allow mixed-race sport to prevent South Africa's international isolation. However, such policies were unpopular with his domestic supporters and he was careful not to go too far.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 142–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne writes: "Vorster knew that there was a limit to how far he could go without imperilling his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oborne, Vorster never intended to allow D'Oliveira to play with the MCC team; his supporters would not have accepted a non-white South African benefiting from this change of policy and demonstrating his ability at a high level. Vorster therefore worked to give the impression overseas that D'Oliveira would be welcome, while at the same time doing his utmost to stop him from playing. He courted the British ambassador, Sir John Nicholls, and told him that a tour party including D'Oliveira would be acceptable. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Vorster meanwhile monitored D'Oliveira's progress closely; from his debut in 1966, South Africa kept a security file on him.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MCC manoeuvres===

[[File:Alec Douglas-Home (c1963).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] met Vorster in March 1968, and told the MCC afterwards that South Africa would probably let D'Oliveira play.|alt=A photograph of Sir Alec Douglas-Home]]
In March 1968, having received no response from the SACA to Griffith's letter, the MCC asked [[Alec Douglas-Home]] to intervene. Douglas-Home, a former British Prime Minister and then the [[Shadow Foreign Secretary|Opposition spokesman for foreign affairs]], had just finished his term as MCC president and was visiting [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa; he agreed to raise the question of D'Oliveira during a meeting with Vorster that was part of his itinerary.&lt;ref name=O138&gt;Oborne, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas-Home believed that the best way to deal with apartheid was through dialogue and that contact between the countries should be increased, not reduced&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;—as he described it, "precept and example must be better than ostracism".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Williams, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; When he met Vorster, Douglas-Home was reluctant to press him for an unequivocal answer, but discussed D'Oliveira. He also sounded out other figures in South Africa and returned to England to tell the MCC,&lt;ref name=O138/&gt; in the words of the cricket writer [[E.&amp;nbsp;W. Swanton]], that "if D'Oliveira were to be chosen the odds were 5/4 on his being allowed in".&lt;ref name=S289&gt;Swanton, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Fraser-Sampson: "While Douglas-Home's motives remain obscure, it is clear that he muddied the waters dreadfully. By allowing the MCC to believe they could continue happily fudging the issue, and by misleading them as to Vorster's true intentions, he delivered the worst of both worlds."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1346.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Douglas-Home's advice, the MCC let the matter drift throughout the 1968 season.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 138–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Conscious of D'Oliveira's poor form in the West Indies and continued lack of success during early 1968, the MCC committee kept in mind that it was far from certain that he would even make the team to tour South Africa.&lt;ref name=S289/&gt;

Meanwhile, with the knowledge of Vorster and the South African government, the SACA carefully devised its answer to the MCC letter. The reply, which avoided directly answering the MCC question, was hand-delivered to the MCC secretary [[Gubby Allen|George "Gubby" Allen]] in March 1968 by the former South African Test captain [[Jack Cheetham]], a close associate of several MCC officials. By this point, the MCC had accepted Douglas-Home's advice and no longer wanted a reply to their letter—Oborne records that when Cheetham "cheerily produced his laboriously produced document, a panic-stricken Gubby Allen waved it away."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was never presented to the full MCC Committee, and Cheetham returned to South Africa with news that a reply was not required—preparations for the tour could proceed as normal. This allowed Vorster to conceal his intentions regarding D'Oliveira for a further six months.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen later justified his actions by suggesting that he was concerned that the SACA letter would be leaked to the press if it went any further. Oborne believes that Allen wished to hide from the full committee the MCC hierarchy's change of mind over the approach to take with the South Africans; he suggests that Allen and Griffith were effectively acting as a secret MCC subcommittee from this point.&lt;ref name="O149-50"/&gt;

===South African plan===

Vorster and the SACA followed D'Oliveira's form closely throughout the tour of West Indies and into the 1968 season. D'Oliveira's lack of success prompted press speculation that he might lose his England place for entirely non-political reasons, but Vorster was convinced that the MCC were committed to selecting him under any circumstances.&lt;ref name="O149-50"&gt;Oborne, pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore conceived a two-pronged plan to prevent D'Oliveira's selection for the 1968–69 tour. He and the SACA would attempt to bribe D'Oliveira to make himself unavailable, while simultaneously persuading the English selectors—or more specifically the MCC, who Vorster believed would determine selection policy—not to choose him.&lt;ref name="O149-50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1306.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the plan depended on the MCC realising that picking D'Oliveira would mean no tour, but in making such attempts the South Africans risked public discovery, which would cause the tour to be cancelled anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bribery was planned from an early stage, but had to be postponed when D'Oliveira did not return to South Africa before the 1968 season.&lt;ref name="O151-3"/&gt; The second part of the plan was put into operation in March 1968. Vorster resolved to send a secret message to the MCC through [[Charles Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham|Lord Cobham]], a member and former president of the MCC with close links to D'Oliveira's county side Worcestershire.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="O151-3"/&gt; Cobham was visiting South Africa at Griffith's request to meet [[Arthur Coy]], an official of the SACA. Cobham told Coy that he wanted the tour to go ahead, but agreed with him that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be "disastrous". Cobham seems to have promised Coy that he would attempt to dissuade D'Oliveira from touring, but never actually did so. Cobham then met Vorster, who told him that if D'Oliveira were chosen, the tour would be cancelled.&lt;ref name=S289/&gt;&lt;ref name="O151-3"&gt;Oborne, pp. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to England, Cobham kept this information from the full MCC committee, knowing that they would be forced to cancel the tour if they became aware of it. Instead, he wrote a letter to a committee member, whose identity has never been made public. The letter's recipient passed it on to Griffith, who in turn showed it to Allen and [[Arthur Gilligan]], at that time the MCC president. These three men chose to hide the information from the full committee,&lt;ref name=S289/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt; and nobody informed Denis Howell.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; Allen later defended these actions, setting out his reasoning in his biography, which was written by his close friend Swanton&lt;ref name="O154-55"/&gt;—Allen argued that the advice given by Douglas-Home, an international diplomat, took precedence over Cobham's information and had already been accepted by the MCC. He further suggested that, as the four England selectors had to choose the team "without any other consideration", and two of them sat on the MCC committee, it would have been unfair to burden them with Cobham's information.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne dismisses Allen's reasoning as "disastrously muddled",&lt;ref name="O154-55"/&gt; pointing out that Cobham's advice was far more up-to-date than Douglas-Home's, and that there would have been no burden of conscience for the team selectors as the new information would have caused the tour to be cancelled.&lt;ref name="O154-55"&gt;Oborne, pp. 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.&lt;ref name="O154-55"/&gt;

===D'Oliveira in 1968===

D'Oliveira was aware of the political discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 [[not out]] and taking two wickets.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 139–41.&lt;/ref&gt; After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage.&lt;ref name=Lords&gt;{{cite web|title=England v Australia (First Test)| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150224.html| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1969 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.&lt;ref name=O15558&gt;Oborne, pp. 155–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the second Test, played at Lord's, a series of events took place that Fraser-Sampson later described as "so bizarre as to be totally unbelievable, and yet [they] happened".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1320.&lt;/ref&gt; The evening before play began, Griffith suggested to D'Oliveira that, to save the 1968–69 series, he should withdraw himself from consideration for the tour, and announce that he wished in future to play for South Africa rather than England. D'Oliveira angrily declined. The next day, E.&amp;nbsp;W. Swanton—a journalist technically unconnected with the MCC, but a close friend of Allen and a member of the "Establishment"—approached the player with a similar proposition, which D'Oliveira again dismissed.&lt;ref name=O15558/&gt; Both Griffith and Swanton were opposed to apartheid—Swanton had refused to report on the 1964–65 MCC tour of South Africa because of his objections to the system, and he supported D'Oliveira from a cricketing standpoint.&lt;ref name=O158/&gt; This plan probably originated from one of the several South Africans present at Lord's with an interest in the D'Oliveira question, including Coy and the private cricket tour organiser Wilfred Isaacs; according to Fraser-Sampson, there is evidence to suggest that it first came from the SACA.&lt;ref name=O158/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1328.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne writes that Griffith and Swanton were probably well-intentioned, and posits that they might have been caught up in a South African scheme in their search for a solution to the D'Oliveira problem.&lt;ref name=O158&gt;Oborne, pp. 158–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser-Sampson suggests that they and other MCC figures may have felt forced into this course of action by the vigour of the South Africans' protests that they would not tolerate a team including D'Oliveira.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1330.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of the second Test, D'Oliveira was told by [[Colin Cowdrey]], the England captain, that he had been left out of the team and was instead [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]].&lt;ref name=O160/&gt; In his place, England chose a fast bowler to strengthen their bowling attack.&lt;ref name="Wisden version"&gt;{{cite web|last=Melford|first=Michael|title=The D'Oliveira case| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152399.html| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1969 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the game was taking place, [[Doug Insole]], the chairman of the England selectors, introduced D'Oliveira to Isaacs, who offered him warm hospitality if he toured South Africa during the English winter. Deeply upset with his omission, D'Oliveira returned to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man duties ended. Oborne suggests that, from a cricketing viewpoint, the decision to drop D'Oliveira looks odd, and that it may have been connected to the South African presence at Lord's.&lt;ref name=O160&gt;Oborne, pp. 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement for D'Oliveira, [[Barry Knight (cricketer)|Barry Knight]], performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, by contrast, lost all batting form. From mid-June until August, bothered by the pressure over South Africa, he struggled to score, managing just 205 runs at an average of 12.81. He maintained his form as a bowler, but critics believed his chance had gone. In July, as part of a standard procedure, the MCC wrote to 30 leading players to ask if they were available to tour South Africa; D'Oliveira was not contacted.&lt;ref name="Wisden version"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fraser-Sampson, the idea that D'Oliveira was not then one of England's best 30 players was absurd; he writes that the selectors must therefore have been aware that Vorster would not accept his selection and they had consequently decided not to choose him.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1387.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his slump in form, D'Oliveira was contacted by Tienie Oosthuizen, a director at the tobacco company [[Carreras Tobacco Company|Carreras]], which was, alongside [[Rothmans International|Rothmans]], part of the South African [[Rembrandt Group|Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation]]. Rembrandt had set up a group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately at the end of the 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 162–65.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team,&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; then telling him that his presence in that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 172–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a later press investigation, Oosthuizen claimed to have acted independently. [[Anton Rupert]], the head of Rembrandt, endorsed this version, asserting that Oosthuizen had acted in his capacity as an employee of the SASF. Rupert said this was an autonomous organisation,&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 166–68.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to Oborne the SASF constitution made it totally dependent on Rembrandt. Oborne writes that Oosthuizen's offers were rooted in the plans made by Vorster and Coy to bribe D'Oliveira indirectly by offering him work that would prevent him from playing for the MCC.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 150–51, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne surmises that the position and salary offered to D'Oliveira did not come from the SASF, but were actually part of a scheme involving Vorster and Rupert to remove the controversial player from the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also concludes that the offer was effectively a bribe to stop D'Oliveira playing.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August, D'Oliveira returned to form with an innings of 89 against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the fifth and final England–Australia Test match, played between 22 and 27 August, Cowdrey batted at [[the Oval]], where the match was to be played, and deduced that medium-paced bowlers would be very effective given the condition of the cricket pitch. Consequently, when the England team was chosen, he asked for a medium-paced bowler to be placed in reserve in case conditions warranted their selection. The two first-choice selections, Knight and [[Tom Cartwright]], were unavailable, so D'Oliveira was called up by Cowdrey as a reserve on account of his bowling. On the day before the game, one of the England batsmen, [[Roger Prideaux]], withdrew from the team, saying he had an infection.{{refn|group=note|Prideaux later admitted that he could have played, but was concerned that if he had failed in that game, it might have cost him his place on the winter tour of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The team was duly re-arranged and the new version included D'Oliveira as a batsman. He heard no more from Oosthuizen, who was transferred from the London office soon after.&lt;ref name=O179&gt;Oborne, pp. 179–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention of Oosthuizen became public knowledge when it was reported in the press in April 1969.&lt;ref name="Williams 58"&gt;Williams, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height of controversy==

===Oval Test match===

[[File:The Oval test match - geograph.org.uk - 915211.jpg|thumb|[[The Oval]], pictured in 2008]]
Feeling much more confident, D'Oliveira expected to be successful in the Oval Test match. Before the game, an unnamed MCC official circulated a story that D'Oliveira had been offered thousands of pounds to keep himself available for the South Africa tour. This was a similar story to that which D'Oliveira had told Oosthuizen; it had probably travelled back to the MCC via South Africa, but was not true. When the game began, Australia held a 1–0 lead after four Tests; England needed a win to level the series. England made a reasonable start on the first day, but a late wicket brought D'Oliveira in to bat with the game delicately poised. Oborne observes that D'Oliveira was under huge pressure, both for simple cricketing reasons and because the world was watching to see if he would be successful.&lt;ref name="O180-83"&gt;Oborne, pp. 180–83.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' reported: "In the last hour D'Oliveira began his fine effort. He hooked the short ball superbly".&lt;ref name=Oval&gt;{{cite web|last=Preston|first=Norman|title=England v Australia (Fifth Test)| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150228.html| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1969 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the first day, he had scored 23 runs.&lt;ref name="O180-83"/&gt;

Early on the second day, D'Oliveira batted with less certainty. He was dropped by the opposition wicket-keeper with his score on 31, but he was encouraged by the umpire [[Charlie Elliott]] and his batting partner [[John Edrich]].&lt;ref name="O183-84"&gt;Oborne, pp. 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; As his score reached fifty, Elliott whispered, "Well played—my God you're going to cause some problems."&lt;ref name="O183-84"/&gt; D'Oliveira went on to score 158 runs before he was out, although he was dropped a few more times after passing three figures.&lt;ref name=Oval/&gt; He received a prolonged ovation from the crowd when he was out, and congratulations from [[John Gleeson (cricketer)|John Gleeson]], one of the opposing Australians.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 6, Location 1168.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne assesses the innings as one of the best ever: despite the relatively weak attack and easy batting conditions, Oborne believes that no other cricketer had faced so much pressure and so many outside forces conspiring against him.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 184–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the game, D'Oliveira also contributed with the ball. After rain had reduced the amount of playing time and caused further delays through the subsequent clean-up, England faced a race against time to win the match. D'Oliveira took a crucial wicket with his 12th ball to break a long partnership and open the way for [[Derek Underwood]] to bowl England to victory in the game and a share in the series.&lt;ref name=Oval/&gt;

Off the field, manoeuvres started immediately. Vorster followed the innings closely, with Oosthuizen in attendance. On the second day of the match, [[Geoffrey Howard (British Army officer)|Geoffrey Howard]], the secretary of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] (who played at the Oval), received a call from Oosthuizen, who informed Howard that he had been trying without success to contact Billy Griffith. He told Howard to pass along to Griffith the message that if "today's centurion is picked, the tour will be off".&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 185–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Insole asked D'Oliveira if he was available to tour South Africa, and Cowdrey questioned him about how he would handle the inevitably tense situations. Cowdrey also said that he wanted him in the team. D'Oliveira was left in little doubt that he would be selected to tour South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 186–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection meeting===

}}

The selectors, after a six-hour meeting, chose the team to tour South Africa on 27 August 1968.{{refn|group=note|The meeting began at 8&amp;nbsp;pm on that date, but did not finish until 2&amp;nbsp;am on 28 August.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The official records of the meeting are incomplete and of those present, no one left an account of what happened. Oborne believes that at least ten men were present—the four selectors, Insole, [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], [[Don Kenyon]] and [[Alec Bedser]]; the England captain Colin Cowdrey; Gubby Allen, Billy Griffith, Arthur Gilligan and [[Donald Carr]] for the MCC; and possibly [[Maurice Allom]], another MCC member. Oborne suggests that one of those present might have been acting for the South African government, as Vorster was well-informed about what happened at the meeting and followed events closely.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 189–95.&lt;/ref&gt; He also observes that, of those present, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan knew from the Cobham letter what would happen if D'Oliveira were selected; he argues that they may have passed the information on to other selectors. Coy, who had been at the Lord's Test, may also have made the South African position clear at the meeting. According to Oborne, "Everyone in the room, with the possible exception of the Worcestershire skipper Don Kenyon, would have been aware that the selection of D'Oliveira could at best cause difficulties and at worst cause the tour to be cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser-Sampson goes further, suggesting that Insole, and possibly also May, knew the whole story from an early stage.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1396.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a cricketing viewpoint, most critics agreed that D'Oliveira should probably have been selected based on his score at the Oval, his past record, and the usefulness of his bowling. The selectors left him out, however, deciding that his bowling was not strong enough to classify him as an all-rounder. Oborne points out that, judged in cricketing terms, this was "not an outrage".&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira had several rivals as a batsman, and of the places available, one went to [[Ken Barrington]], who had a good Test record, and the other to [[Keith Fletcher]], who was much younger than D'Oliveira. Oborne judges both of these decisions fair.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody at the selection meeting supported including D'Oliveira. Some of those present said later that, despite his prior assurances to D'Oliveira, Cowdrey opposed his selection at the meeting, which influenced others there.&lt;ref name=O200/&gt; Fraser-Sampson suggests that Cowdrey, who later tried to justify his role in events, may have inwardly supported D'Oliveira's inclusion, but spoken against it out of a lack of confidence and decisiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1414.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible, argues Fraser-Sampson, that if May had been aware of the true state of affairs, he may have confided in Cowdrey, a close friend; this would have left Cowdrey, who was very keen to lead a team to South Africa, in a difficult and conflicted position. Fraser-Sampson concludes: "Far from being the villain of the piece, Cowdrey may simply have been an honourable man pushed beyond the limits of his character and overwhelmed by events."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1437.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is customary at such selection meetings, there was no vote. Insole recalled that there was no hostility towards D'Oliveira at the meeting, and pointed out that although he was not chosen in the main team, he was made a reserve.&lt;ref name=O200&gt;Oborne, pp. 200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams, while acknowledging that there were several worthy batsmen as candidates for places in the team, asserts that even if those at the meeting had only discussed the players' respective cricketing abilities, "every selector must have known that by not selecting D'Oliveira they would improve the prospects of the tour going ahead."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The full MCC Committee met to formally approve the selected team on the afternoon of 28 August.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody voiced opposition.&lt;ref name=O212/&gt;

D'Oliveira, who learned of his omission over the radio in the Worcestershire dressing room having just scored 128 runs against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], was deeply upset and faced intense press attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Moment of Heartbreak |work=[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]] |location=Johannesburg |url=http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/memorials/WC/BasilDOliveira/Article.aspx?id=570449 |pages=1, 3 |date=29 August 1968 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206215115/http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/memorials/WC/BasilDOliveira/Article.aspx?id=570449 |archivedate=6 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=O204205&gt;Oborne, pp. 204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; Insole and Griffith defended the decision to omit D'Oliveira to the press, saying that there had been no pressure from South Africa and that the chosen team simply included better players than D'Oliveira.&lt;ref name=O212&gt;Oborne, pp. 212–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne writes that Insole considered the events surrounding the selection meeting as among the worst of his life, but that "he and the other selectors were victims of the decision, reached on the advice of Alec Douglas-Home early in 1968, not to press for an answer to the MCC demand there should be 'no preconditions' for the tour. Once that decision had been made, everything else followed: the bribery attempt, the secret pressure and the nobbling of the MCC. Had the matter been dealt with&amp;nbsp;... Insole would never have been subject to the innuendo and accusations of racism and betrayal that have haunted him ever since."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===

While the general public were baffled that a man who just scored a century against Australia could be left out of the team, the English cricketing press were divided on the decision.&lt;ref name="Williams 58"/&gt; Some journalists supported the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket correspondents of ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.{{refn|group=note|[[John Woodcock (cricket writer)|John Woodcock]], the ''Times'' correspondent, supported the selectors at the time, but later changed his mind, saying he had misjudged the situation surrounding D'Oliveira.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1505.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 217–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, prominently the former England captain [[Ted Dexter]], the former Test player [[Trevor Bailey]] and E.&amp;nbsp;W. Swanton, all of whom generally sided with the cricket establishment, contended that D'Oliveira deserved to be in the team on merit.&lt;ref name=O213/&gt; Swanton said he had received no letters which actually agreed with the omission.&lt;ref name=W59/&gt; Other commentators, such as the Worcestershire club secretary and the former West Indies Test player [[Learie Constantine]], openly stated that D'Oliveira was omitted either because of his race or because the MCC supported apartheid.&lt;ref name=O213&gt;Oborne, pp. 213–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politicians also expressed concern.&lt;ref name=O213/&gt; John Arlott, while asserting that D'Oliveira deserved to be included, suggested that to demonstrate opposition to apartheid, the MCC should perhaps have selected him even if this were not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 216–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The general press took a wider view, with several newspaper columns reporting that the decision appeared to have been made to avoid offending the South African government.&lt;ref name=W59&gt;Williams, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Williams, the public positions held by much of the MCC committee towards South Africa led to suspicions that D'Oliveira may have been left out simply to save the tour.&lt;ref name=W59/&gt;

More recent commentators suggest that the MCC members were not directly motivated by support of apartheid. Oborne argues that the MCC establishment, without favouring apartheid, wished to maintain traditional links with white South Africa.&lt;ref name=O212/&gt; Williams suggests that the committee were politically naive, and that they ignored the political dimensions of D'Oliveira's non-selection. Williams writes that the committee seemed unaware that its decision made it appear to support apartheid.&lt;ref name=W64/&gt; Fraser-Sampson believes that those involved "acted for what they thought were the best of motives, namely what they saw as the good of the game."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1572.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the right-wing links of some individuals—Gilligan had been a member of the [[British Fascists]] during the 1920s,&lt;ref name=O194&gt;Oborne, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bedser later became a member of [[the Freedom Association]], which Fraser-Sampson classifies as "far-right"&lt;ref name=racism/&gt;—neither Oborne nor Fraser-Sampson suggests that the two men were racist, or that any of the selectors' actions regarding D'Oliveira were tainted by prejudice or support for apartheid.&lt;ref name=O194/&gt;&lt;ref name=racism/&gt; Fraser-Sampson does comment, however, that some individuals were "apologists" for Vorster, and that many of them firmly believed in the separation of politics and sport.&lt;ref name=racism&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1574.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all MCC members supported the selectors. Around 70 members met, including the clergyman and former England captain David Sheppard, and called for the tour to be abandoned. Sheppard's intervention shook Cowdrey, a religious man.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks, several MCC members had resigned in protest at the decision, and the MCC had received nearly 1,000 letters about it, mainly complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Cowdrey defends South African tour| newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page =  1 | date = 9 September 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, whites received the news happily—one nationalist rally broke into cheers upon hearing the news&lt;ref name=O204205/&gt;—while the black community viewed the omission as a betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] sent telegrams to the Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], asking him to intervene, and to Gilligan, asking for the tour to be cancelled on the grounds that by playing in South Africa the England team would be "condoning apartheid".&lt;ref name=W59/&gt; D'Oliveira received many letters of support from the public. He also received sympathetic letters from Cowdrey, Insole, Griffith and Cobham. He responded with a burst of good form, and was not drawn into publicly criticising the MCC, even offering the team his support.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 219–20.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a contract to cover the tour for the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, which drew criticism from other newspapers and shook Vorster.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 221–22.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, non-whites were not allowed into South African press boxes other than "in a menial capacity"—Vorster suggested that D'Oliveira may not even be allowed on the tour as a journalist.&lt;ref name=W61/&gt;

===Cancellation===

One of the MCC team, Tom Cartwright, had been struggling with an injury. He had considered withdrawing from the tour on moral grounds, owing to his reservations about involvement with the apartheid government.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1534.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different versions of what actually happened. According to Cowdrey, Cartwright played without discomfort on 14 September, passed a fitness test the following day, and suddenly withdrew after an overnight reaction to his exertions, prompting the selectors to take only ten minutes to choose D'Oliveira as a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1545.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser-Sampson records that Cartwright actually had two fitness tests, owing to pre-existing concerns over his health; the selectors tried to persuade him not to pull out, with Cowdrey particularly insistent, but Cartwright was adamant.&lt;ref name=Cartwright&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1542.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September, he withdrew from the MCC team, citing his injury.&lt;ref name=O223/&gt; D'Oliveira was duly called up,&lt;ref name=Cartwright/&gt; a decision announced the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having been rejected as a bowler at the earlier meeting, he was now replacing a bowler in the team; the selectors stated that D'Oliveira's bowling might prove useful. Oborne's assessment of the decision is that "they had had enough and were bowing to public opinion."&lt;ref name=O223/&gt; Williams comments that the belated addition of D'Oliveira in the wake of outcry at his exclusion confirmed in the minds of many that politics had been involved in the team selection. Denis Howell felt the need to state publicly that the decision was the MCC's alone, and that there had been no pressure from the UK government.&lt;ref name=W61&gt;Williams, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira was pleased but suspected that the tour would no longer go ahead.&lt;ref name=O223&gt;Oborne, pp. 222–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, Vorster heard that D'Oliveira had been added to the team shortly before addressing the Orange Free State National Party congress at [[Bloemfontein]] on 17 September.&lt;ref name=O223/&gt;&lt;ref name=cricinfotimeline/&gt; He immediately announced that the English team would not be allowed into South Africa if it included D'Oliveira. He told the gathering that while "we are and always have been prepared to play host to the MCC&amp;nbsp;... [we] are not prepared to receive a team thrust upon us by people whose interests are not the game, but to gain certain political objectives which they do not even attempt to hide".&lt;ref name=murray89&gt;{{cite book|title=Caught Behind: Race And Politics In Springbok Cricket |last1=Murray|first1=Bruce |last2=Merrett|first2=Christopher |publisher=Wits University Press |location=Johannesburg |year=2004|isbn=978-1-86914-059-5 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; To loud applause, he went on to describe the revised MCC team as "not the team of the MCC but the team of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the team of SANROC [the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee] and the team of [[Ambrose Reeves|Bishop Reeves]] [a critic of apartheid]."&lt;ref name=murray89/&gt; Vorster expressed similar sentiments elsewhere, accusing the MCC of making a purely political decision.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted that he "had taken a decision for South Africa".&lt;ref name=cricinfotimeline&gt;{{cite web|title=The D'Oliveira Affair|last=Williamson |first=Martin |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/356092.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South African press was mostly critical of Vorster, warning that his stand might lead to the country's exclusion from international sport,&lt;ref name=cricinfotimeline/&gt; but Professor Bruce Murray comments that the MCC's initial exclusion of D'Oliveira, only to then include him instead of a bowler, had given Vorster some ammunition to claim that the MCC selection was politically charged. Including D'Oliveira from the start would, by contrast, have forced Vorster to reveal that his plan to allow mixed teams was false.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oborne, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Griffith responded that the tour would be cancelled were D'Oliveira not allowed to play, and that he was in the team on merit having missed selection first time around by "a bee's whisker".&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 225–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Cowdrey, meanwhile, proposed flying to South Africa himself to safeguard the tour but the South African minister [[Ben Schoeman]] said that D'Oliveira had been chosen because of politics and that South Africa would make no deal to let him play.&lt;ref name=O226&gt;Oborne, pp. 226–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Coy and Cheetham flew secretly to London to try to find a compromise.&lt;ref name=O226/&gt; They held a four-hour meeting with the MCC committee on 24 September, directly after which the committee announced that "the side selected to represent MCC in South Africa is not acceptable for reasons beyond the control of the SACA. The MCC committee therefore decided unanimously that the tour will not take place."&lt;ref name=W61/&gt; Williams argues that the delay in cancelling the tour suggests that some in the MCC might still have hoped to find common ground with the South Africans.&lt;ref name="W61-2"&gt;Williams, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira briefly considered withdrawing from the team to save the series, but decided not to.&lt;ref name="W61-2"/&gt;

Sheppard and other MCC rebels called a Special General Meeting of the MCC;&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; they wanted the MCC to state publicly that the team selection had been mishandled and that no further cricket should take place with South Africa until cricket there had been made non-racial. Before the meeting took place, the General Committee met the rebels and initially claimed that it would have been inappropriate to ask South Africa about D'Oliveira before the tour—although they had done so. The committee then admitted writing a letter but said that they had never received a reply. The Special General Meeting took place in December 1968, but the rebels were outvoted by the other members; Sheppard was criticised by members at the meeting, and his former friend Peter May refused to talk to him afterwards.&lt;ref name=O226/&gt; Those opposing Sheppard suggested that he opposed apartheid whereas the committee wanted to advance cricket. It was also suggested that the MCC should not act as the conscience of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=W62&gt;Williams, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams suggests that the vote indicated that a high proportion of the MCC favoured maintaining cricketing links with South Africa despite knowing that South African cricket operated racial segregation.&lt;ref name=W62/&gt;

==Aftermath==

Coming just after New Zealand abandoned their 1967 rugby tour over South Africa's refusal to accommodate a mixed team, the cancellation of the 1968–69 MCC series over D'Oliveira marked the second such incident in two years.&lt;ref name=W64/&gt; According to Oborne, the affair forced upon South African cricket a realisation that it had to change. In 1969, the [[South African Cricket Board of Control]] (SACBOC) announced that future teams would be racially integrated and selected purely on merit; efforts duly began to allow all races to compete against each other and share facilities. This led to some disagreement among non-white sports organisations between those who supported these incremental changes and those who wanted immediate disbanding of the old system. D'Oliveira, a member of the first group, was partly drawn into this conflict. He also faced criticism from those in South Africa and England who believed that, to oppose apartheid, he should have declared himself unavailable to tour in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 229–34.&lt;/ref&gt; With the tour to South Africa cancelled, the MCC hastily arranged for its team to play a Test series in Pakistan instead. D'Oliveira played and was very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 236–37.&lt;/ref&gt; He remained an England regular for four more years and played for Worcestershire until 1979.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1969, many of the events from the previous year became public knowledge, including the deceptions of Allen, Griffith and Gilligan. The MCC committee met and granted retrospective approval to the actions of the four men. Griffith's offer to resign was declined.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1591.&lt;/ref&gt; The press outcry of 1968 was not repeated; Fraser-Sampson speculates that the MCC may have applied pressure to journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1619.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith and Allen later received [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] from the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1631.&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy continued to flare in Britain and other countries regarding sporting links with South Africa. The [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa rugby team]]'s [[1969–70 South Africa rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland|1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland]] was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people tried to stop the South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying down in the middle of the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering bitter Springboks tour that paved a way for change |last=Inverdale |first=John |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/2346183/Remembering-bitter-Springboks-tour-that-paved-a-way-for-change.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=20 September 2006|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A last-gasp winner and a hijacked bus|last=Williamson|first=Martin|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/southafrica/rugby/story/165323.html|work=[[ESPNscrum]]|publisher=[[ESPN, Inc.]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, pp. 292–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's [[1971 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia|1971 tour]] led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a [[state of emergency]] in [[Queensland]], all of which prompted the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]] to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.{{refn|group=note|Both of these cancelled tours were replaced by pseudo-Test series pitting the host nation against "[[Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970|Rest of the World]]" teams featuring leading cricketers from around the world, including several South Africans.&lt;ref name=peoplepower/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The best of the best? |last=Ryder-Whish |first=Matthew |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/220595.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=July 2000 |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=peoplepower&gt;{{cite web |title=When people power sunk South Africa |last=Williamson |first=Martin |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/220550.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |date=1 October 2005 |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa was thereafter almost totally isolated from international cricket, but not from rugby. The [[Australian Rugby Union]] severed ties with South Africa after the turbulent 1971 series, but its counterparts in New Zealand, France and the [[Home Nations]] retained links into the 1980s. With Māori and [[Samoans|Samoan]] players officially designated "[[honorary white]]s" by the South African government, mixed-race New Zealand rugby teams toured South Africa in [[1970 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|1970]] and [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|1976]].&lt;ref name=nauright&gt;{{cite book |title=Sport, Cultures, and Identities in South Africa |last=Nauright|first=John |year=1997 |publisher=Leicester University Press |location=Leicester |isbn=978-0-7185-0072-6 |pages=143–147, 151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SACBOC formally integrated South African cricket in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of an African Game: Black Cricketers and the Unmasking of one of Cricket's Greatest Myths, South Africa, 1850–2003 |last=Odendaal |first=André |year=2003 |location=Cape Town |publisher=David Philip Publishers |isbn=978-0-86486-638-7 |pages=223–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; but enduring overseas opposition to South Africa's internal governance meant that the country did not play official international cricket again until 1991, after the start of the process to dismantle apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rewind to 1970: When politics killed a tour |last=Williamson |first=Martin

[[File:Danish and UK diplomatic uniform 1961.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Diplomatic reception, West Germany, 1961; the Danish ambassador wears a red diplomatic uniform, the British ambassador a dark one.]]
'''Diplomatic uniforms''' are ornate [[uniform]]s worn by [[diplomat]]s—[[ambassador]]ial and [[Consul (representative)|consular]] officers—at public occasions. Introduced by European states around 1800 and patterned on [[court dress]], they were abandoned by most countries in the twentieth century, but diplomats from some countries retain them for rare, formal occasions.

==History==
[[File:Hiroshi Saitō at the diplomatic reception at White House (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The Japanese diplomatic uniform in 1937, with its distinctive [[paulownia]] embroidery]]
Up until the [[18th century]], diplomats (who usually belonged to the [[high nobility]]) wore their own court clothing to solemn occasions. Diplomatic uniforms were first introduced by [[France]] in 1781 and widely adopted by other European states around 1800 in the course of administrative reforms undertaken as a response to the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In several countries, diplomatic uniforms were among the first civilian uniforms to be adopted. Apart from saving diplomats (who now increasingly were not independently wealthy) the expense of maintaining a full court wardrobe, diplomatic uniforms served to emphasize the importance of the office and to deemphasize the person of its holder.&lt;ref name="Hackspiel 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackspiel-Mikosch|first=Elisabeth |title=Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion|year=2005|volume=3|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|isbn=0-684-31394-4|pages=362–364|editor=Steele, Valerie|chapter=Uniforms, diplomatic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several non-European courts adopted European-style diplomatic uniforms during the 19th century. Notably, [[Japan]] during the [[Meiji Revolution]] introduced European uniforms instead of traditional clothing for all officials in 1872.&lt;ref name="Hackspiel 2005" /&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] court was another non-European court that adopted the uniforms, which were introduced during the [[Tanzimat]] period. The final period during which the majority of diplomatic services retained formal uniforms for the accredited members of their overseas missions was that prior to [[World War II]]. A detailed study of contemporary uniforms, both military and civil, published in 1929&lt;ref&gt;Fred Gilbert Blakeslee, "Uniforms of the World", published by E.P. Dutten &amp; Co. Ltd, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; gives descriptions of the diplomatic uniforms still being worn by representatives of the majority of states then in existence. These included most European nations and a number of Latin American and Asian countries. It is however noted that several states which had only been created following [[World War I]], had not adopted diplomatic uniforms and that others had discarded them. The uniforms described are nearly all of the traditional style of [[Bicorne|bicorne hat]] and [[tailcoat]] with braiding according to grade, from third secretaries to ambassadors. Consular staff were less likely to have authorised uniforms than their diplomatic colleagues and where consular uniforms existed they were generally of simpler style. As an example, the British Consular Service had silver braiding rather than the gold of diplomats.

While most countries abandoned diplomatic uniforms at some time during the [[20th century]], several long-established foreign services have retained them for wear by senior staff on ceremonial occasions such as the formal presentation of credentials by ambassadors. A photo of the 2001 New Year's reception at the [[Holy See|Vatican]] shows the ambassadors of [[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Thailand]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], France, and [[Belgium]] all clad in diplomatic uniform.&lt;ref name="Hackspiel 2005" /&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Baron Henri Beyens.jpg|thumb|upright|The Belgian diplomatic uniform in 2011]]
Diplomatic uniforms generally followed 19th century court fashion and usually included a [[tailcoat]] with standing collar, [[breeches]] or [[trousers|pantaloons]], a sword and a two-cornered plumed hat ("[[bicorne]]"). There were normally at least two versions, a [[dress uniform]] for ceremonial events and a simpler version for less formal occasions which nevertheless required the use of uniform dress.&lt;ref name="Hackspiel 2005" /&gt; Unlike their military and naval counterparts, diplomats did not wear uniforms for everyday purposes but substituted the appropriate civilian clothing.

Diplomatic uniforms were usually richly [[embroidered]] with gold similar to the uniforms of high court officials. [[Diplomatic rank]] was distinguished by the amount and quality of the embroidery. In contrast to [[military uniform]]s, which underwent rapid changes throughout the 19th and early 20th century, the diplomatic uniforms tended to keep their traditional design.&lt;ref name="Hackspiel 2005" /&gt; While the uniforms of the different foreign services generally shared the common features noted above, there were considerable national differences, though often of minor detail. 

Thus, as examples, French ambassadors were distinguished by pearl-handled court swords with gold and silk frogs (sword attachments), their Portuguese colleagues by oak leaves and acorns represented in gold embroidery on their dress coats, while Norwegian diplomats wore gold embroidery of pine cone design on their dark blue "swallow-tail" coats.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Gilbert Blakeslee, page 311, "Uniforms of the World", published by E.P. Dutten &amp; Co. Ltd, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian diplomats of all ranks had "royal blue" tail coats and retained the 18th century fashion of white breeches and stockings with low shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Gilbert Blakeslee, page 225, "Uniforms of the World", published by E.P. Dutten &amp; Co. Ltd, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Belgian diplomats wear blue and gold waist sashes, Spanish diplomats red cuffs on their dark blue tail-coats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The new Spanish ambassador in the Vatican presents his credentials to the Pope|url=http://www.abc.es/20120618/sociedad/abci-embajador-vaticano-credenciales-201206181301.html|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish diplomats distinctive red coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Danish Ambassador in Great Britain|url=http://storbritannien.um.dk/da/om-os/ambassadoeren|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic uniforms by country==
===Germany===
In 1817, [[Prussia]]n diplomats received as uniforms dark blue [[tail coat]]s with cuffs and a standing collar of black velvet, decorated with oak leaf scrolls embroidered in gold. In 1888, the [[German Empire]] introduced the ''Altbrandenburgischer [[Waffenrock]]'', a long military-style coat, as the general state uniform for high-ranking officials.&lt;ref name="Hackspiel 2005" /&gt; Military uniform was worn instead of court uniform by military officers and by those political figures who were reserve officers, which included most diplomats: it was practically impossible under the Empire for one to be a civil servant or a state secretary of ministerial rank without also being a reserve officer.

Diplomatic uniforms were abandoned under the [[Weimar Republic]], but the [[Nazi]] regime, which had a general fondness for uniforms, reintroduced them. The stage designer [[Benno von Arent]] designed the "startling" Nazi diplomatic uniform, consisting of a dark blue tailcoat whose modern lapels were embroidered with silver oak leaves, a silver [[sash]], a silver [[aiguillette]] and a small dagger.&lt;ref name="Hackspiel 2005" /&gt;

===Russia and the Soviet Union===
[[File:Soviet diplomatic uniform 1943.jpg|thumb|Image from the 1943 Soviet regulations concerning the diplomatic uniform]]
[[File:AVKonuzin.jpg|thumb|Russian ambassador Alexander Konuzin in uniform, presenting his letters of credence to the Serbian President [[Boris Tadić]], 2008]]
In 1834, the Russian Empire introduced diplomatic uniforms. As worn until 1917 these were of dark green (almost black) cloth with bicorn hats and braiding according to rank. Regulations introduced in 1904 specified six variations of the dark green uniform, depending on the nature of the occasion for which it was worn. These included plain uniforms without gold braid for office wear, plus white knee breeches and stocking for court functions when royalty were present. Peaked caps and epaulettes of military style were specified for street wear or informal occasions when the bicorn or braided tailcoat was considered unsuitable.

After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], a document entitled "Short Instruction on Adhering to the Accepted Bourgeois Society Etiquette Rules" by the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs]] (NKID) instructed the revolutionary diplomats to wear jackets on formal occasions. From 1923 to 1924, Moscow newspapers debated whether the wearing of civilian Western dress and thereby "bourgeois society symbols, which are totally alien to the spirit of the Workers' and Peasants' State" was appropriate, and there were calls for a Soviet diplomatic uniform to be introduced.&lt;ref name="Lyadov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lyadov |first=P.F. |title=Protocol and Etiquette |url=http://www.chile.mid.ru/0ld/mid200_pr_e.html |publisher=Russian Embassy in Chile (originally published in [[DIPLOMAT]]) |accessdate=5 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003142004/http://www.chile.mid.ru/0ld/mid200_pr_e.html |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But it was not until 1943 that a uniform was introduced for NKID staff, consisting of a three-piece uniform suit with gold-plated buttons and shoulder straps. The everyday uniform was grey and the dress uniform, which included a dagger, was black. Accoutrements included a coat, raincoat, hat and an ornate cap with the diplomatic insignia.&lt;ref name="Israelyan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Israėli︠a︡n|first=Viktor Levonovich|title=On the battlefields of the cold war: a Soviet ambassador's confession|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSDP-XiRMwUC&amp;pg=PA20|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-02297-0|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black dress uniform was similar to the Nazi [[Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel#SS black uniforms (1932–1934)|SS uniform]]; the Soviet diplomat [[Victor Israelyan]] recounted that during [[World War II]] he was once given the [[Hitler salute]] and a loud "Heil Hitler!" by a German prisoner of war who mistook him for an SS officer.&lt;ref name="Israelyan" /&gt;

The wearing of uniform by all Soviet diplomats on formal occasions was officially discontinued in 1954; thereafter only ambassadors continued to wear the dress uniform, without the dagger, on special occasions.&lt;ref name="Lyadov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Israelyan" /&gt; Senior officials of the Soviet Foreign Ministry still wore a double-breasted black uniform (or white for the ones assigned in a country with a tropical climate) with gold braided cuffs and collar patches when attending credential presentations by foreign ambassadors, as late as the 1980s. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union these uniforms ceased to be worn in 1991, though they were not formally abolished. In 2001 a black diplomatic uniform was re-introduced resembling the former Soviet model except for new insignia and blue-green collar patches. Russia now  maintains such uniforms for rare occasions.&lt;ref name=Lindia&gt;{{cite web|title=Sergey Lavrov, Igor Ivanov|url=http://newshopper.sulekha.com/sergey-lavrov-igor-ivanov_photo_1156661.htm|publisher=Sulekha|accessdate=23 October 2013|quote=Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, former Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, center, both wearing official Russian diplomatic uniform, and Head of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Yevgeny Primakov, former Prime Minister, share a laugh after a meeting marking the professional holiday in Moscow, Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2010.

====Historic====
[[File:Edward malet.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Edward Malet|Sir Edward Malet]] wearing the old-style Ambassador's uniform]]
British diplomats wore the official court uniform consisting of a dark blue button-down high-collar jacket with gold oak-leaf embroidery on the collar, chest, cuffs and long tails; white breeches were worn, or else dark blue trousers with gold stripes, and a [[cocked hat]] edged with white [[ostrich]] plumes. A white uniform, with similar but detachable panels of gold embroidery on the collar and cuffs, was worn in tropical postings.

Ambassadors wore '1st class' court uniform, with additional gold embroidery on the sleeve and back seams. More junior officers wore different classes of uniform with simplified braiding on cuffs and collars only, as specified for their rank or appointment, (the classes of uniform were differentiated by varying widths of gold embroidery). Members of the Consular Service wore court uniforms with silver braiding according to rank, in contrast to the gold of diplomatic officers. The King's or Queen's Foreign Service Messengers were entitled to 5th class court uniform, upgraded to 4th class in 1929. 

Until about 1965 Foreign Office Regulations and Consular Instructions had required even junior foreign service officers to acquire this formal dress, following completion of their probation period. However, by the end of the 20th century the use of this uniform had greatly diminished.

Today within [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service]] [[Head of Mission|Heads of Mission]] (Ambassadors, High Commissioners, etc.) and their deputies retain a simplified Diplomatic Uniform for wear on formal occasions such as the presentation of credentials (and then only when accredited to certain countries). As worn by Deputy Heads of Mission, the uniform consists of a dark blue single-breasted tail coat, lined with black silk, with gilt buttons; the stand collar and gauntlet cuffs are faced with black velvet and edged with gilt braiding; this is worn with dark trousers or skirt, a bicorn hat, white gloves and a gold-mounted sword. Heads of Mission have, in addition, gold embroidery on the collar and cuffs, gold stripes on the trousers and a white ostrich-feather edging to the hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/nigelbaker/2015/08/17/diplomatic-uniforms-at-the-holy-see/|website=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|title=Diplomatic Uniforms at the Holy See|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of uniform was introduced in the 1950s.

===United States===
[[File:Signing of Treaty of Ghent (1812).jpg|thumb|Uniformed American representatives (left) signing the Treaty of Ghent in 1814]]
American diplomats were first issued uniforms for the mission concluding the 1814 [[Treaty of Ghent]]; these consisted of a blue gold-embroidered coat, white breeches and stockings, a sword and a cocked hat with a black cockade. U.S. diplomats routinely designed and wore uniforms of their own choosing until 1817,  when the State Department formally prescribed a uniform for ministers based on the one issued for the Ghent mission.&lt;ref name="Diplomatic and Consular Uniforms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diplomatic and Consular Uniforms|url=http://www.usdiplomacy.org/exhibit/protecting.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uniform was recommended for use by all ministers abroad by then Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1823.&lt;ref name=Schuyler /&gt;

The Jackson administration simplified the uniform in 1829, which now consisted of a black coat with a gold star on each side of the collar, black or white breeches, a three-cornered [[chapeau de bras]] (i.e., a foldable [[Tricorne|tricorne hat]]), a black cockade and eagle, and a steel-mounted sword with white scabbard. This uniform was not mandatory, and some officials wore more brilliant uniforms according to their own taste.&lt;ref name=Schuyler /&gt;  In 1853, [[Secretary of State]] [[William L. Marcy]] issued a circular recommending that U.S. diplomats wear “the simple dress of an American citizen.”&lt;ref name="Diplomatic and Consular Uniforms"/&gt;

In response to what was perceived as the excessive ostentatiousness of some of these individualized uniforms, Congress banned diplomatic uniforms altogether in 1867, by passing a resolution forbidding diplomatic officials to wear "any uniform or official costume not previously authorized by Congress".&lt;ref name=Schuyler&gt;{{cite book|last=Schuyler|first=Eugene|title=American Diplomacy and the Furtherance of Commerce|year=1886|publisher=Scribner's|isbn=978-1-150-20435-7|pages=62–63 (2009 reprint)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N76ND2eaukoC&amp;pg=PA62|authorlink=Eugene Schuyler}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused some discomfort to American diplomats, who now had to appear "underdressed", in [[:wikt:evening dress|evening dress]], to official functions. In 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] attracted considerable attention when he was one of the few foreign representatives at the funeral of King [[Edward VII]] who was not in civil or military uniform.&lt;ref name="Hackspiel 2005" /&gt;

For a period of time, U.S. diplomats and consular officers wore modified [[Uniforms of the United States Navy|U.S. Navy uniforms]], much as the U.S. [[Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] and U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps]] continue to do so today.&lt;ref name="History of US Navy Uniforms"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of US Navy Uniforms|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/uniform_history.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued an [[executive order]] directing that no person in the diplomatic or consular service should wear a uniform or official costume not previously authorized by the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="Diplomatic and Consular Uniforms"/&gt;

While there has continued to be discussion on the idea of reintroducing uniforms for the [[U.S. Foreign Service]], such as a modified U.S. Navy [[mess dress]] for formal occasions and presentation of credentials, such a change would require a law passed by Congress, since it is specified in the Foreign Service Act of 1946, section 1001, that "no officer or employee" of the Foreign Service was to "wear any uniform except such as may be authorized by law."&lt;ref name =Plischke&gt;{{cite book|last=Plischke|first=Elmer|title=U.S. Department of State: A Reference History|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-29126-5|pages=148–150(1999 edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idBzGjwjVGIC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149|authorlink=Elmer Plischke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Maria''' (31 October 1636 – 26 May 1679) was a [[Wittelsbach]] ruler of [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and an elector (''[[prince-elector|Kurfürst]]'') of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1651 to 1679.

==Electoral Prince of Bavaria==
[[File:Anselmus-van-Hulle-Hommes-illustres MG 0441.tif|thumb|Engraving of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria]]
He was born in [[Munich]]. He was the eldest son of [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]] - whom he succeeded, and his second wife [[Maria Anna of Austria (1610-1665)|Maria Anna of Austria]], daughter of the emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Born during the reign of his father, he was known as the Electoral Prince from birth. Through his mother, he was a first cousin of [[Mariana of Austria|Queen Mariana of Spain]] as well as  [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]].

On 8 December 1650 he married [[Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy|Henriette Adelaide of Savoy]], daughter of [[Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy]] and [[Christine Marie of France]]. The couple had seven children, two of which would have progeny.

==Elector==

Still a minor he succeeded his father in 1651, his mother was his guardian and his uncle [[Albert VI of Bavaria]] served as Prince Administrator of Bavaria for three years.

Ferdinand Maria was crowned on 31 October 1654. His [[Political absolutism|absolutistic]] style of leadership became a benchmark for the rest of [[Germany]]. Though Ferdinand Maria allied with France he abstained the imperial crown in 1657 after the death of his uncle [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor]] to avoid a conflict with the House of [[Habsburg]]. Ferdinand Maria supported the wars of the Habsburg against the [[Ottoman Empire]] with Bavarian auxiliary forces (1662–1664). During the [[Franco-Dutch War]] since 1672 Bavaria was officially neutral. Plans for a Bavarian colony near [[New York (state)|New York]] were discussed but soon abandoned.

The marriage of his eldest daughter [[Duchess Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria|Maria Anna Victoria]] and her cousin ''[[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711)|le Grand Dauphin]]'' in 1680 was the outcome of the Bavarian alliance with France. Ferdinand Maria was the great grandfather of French monarch [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]].

Ferdinand Maria modernized the Bavarian army and introduced the first Bavarian local government code. The elector did much indeed to repair the wounds caused by the [[Thirty Years' War]], encouraging agriculture and industries, and building or restoring numerous churches and monasteries. In 1669, moreover, he again called a meeting of the [[Landstände|diet]], which had been suspended since 1612. The electorate he left with a very wealthy treasury.

He died at the [[Schleissheim Palace#Old Schleissheim Palace|Old Schleissheim Palace]] and was succeeded by his son [[Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria|Maximilian II Emanuel]]. He was buried in the crypt of the Theatiner Church in Munich.

==Cultural legacy==
[[Image:Wening Schloss Starnberg.png|thumb|left|320px|Copperplate engraving by [[Michael Wening]] ''Starnberg Castle with Ferdinand Maria's gondola Bucentaurus'' in Topographia Bavariae about 1700]] 
Ferdinand Maria married Princess [[Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy|Henriette Adelaide of Savoy]] in 1650; and with her, the [[Italian Baroque]] was introduced in Bavaria.

The [[Theatinerkirche (München)|Theatiner Church]] in Munich was built from 1663 onwards as a gesture of thanks for the birth of the long-awaited heir to the Bavarian crown, Prince Maximilian II Emanuel. After that in 1664, Ferdinand Maria and his wife commissioned the building of the [[Baroque style]] [[Nymphenburg Palace]] near Munich based on the designs of Italian architect [[Agostino Barelli]]. [[Lake Starnberg]] was purchased by Ferdinand Maria from the Horwarth family and it became the venue of numerous festivities of the court with the famous fleet of Venetian Gondolas. On the lake's shores, he ordered the construction of [[Berg Castle (Bavaria)|Berg Castle]] in 1676. The castle was used for festivities there and later reached its zenith when it became the scene of spectacular entertainments and hunts under the rule of his successors, Maximilian Emanuel and [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VII]]. For the [[Munich Residenz]], Ferdinand Maria ordered the creation of the Papal Rooms.

The '''German Socialist Labour Party of Poland''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Sozialistische Arbeitspartei Polens}}, abbreviated '''DSAP''', {{lang-pl|Niemiecka Socjalistyczna Partia Pracy w Polsce}}) was a [[political party]] organizing [[German people|German]] [[social democracy|Social Democrats]] in [[interbellum]] [[Poland]].

Nominally, the DSAP was founded at a conference in [[Chorzów]] on August 9, 1925, through the merger of the [[Silesia]]/[[West Prussia]]-based [[German Social Democratic Party of Poland]] (DSPP) and the [[Łódź]]-based [[German Labour Party of Poland]] (DAP). The merger wasn't fully effective though, and in practice the two parties continued separate existences until the merger was finalized until 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZspwAAAACAAJ Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918–1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49]''. [[Düsseldorf]]: Droste, 1997, p. 79, 291&lt;/ref&gt;

An 'Executive of the DSAP' was formed after the nominal founding of the party, consisting of [[Siegmund Glücksmann]], [[Johann Kowoll]], Buchwald, Kociolek, Ludwig Kuk, Klim, [[Arthur Pankrantz]] and Emil Zerbe. ''[[Kattowitzer Volkswille]]'' was assigned as the central party organ. One of the first actions of the party executive was the publication of the 'Manifesto of the united 'DSAP''.&lt;ref&gt;Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZspwAAAACAAJ Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918–1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49]''. [[Düsseldorf]]: Droste, 1997, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

DSAP became the second largest party in the 1927 Lodz city council election, trailing behind the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS). DSAP got 16,643 votes and seven seats in the council. In central Poland the municipal elections showed the strength of the party in the region; in total DSAP had 36 city councilors and 7 magistrate members in the area.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZspwAAAACAAJ Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918–1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49]''. [[Düsseldorf]]: Droste, 1997, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 the party claimed to have 8,406 members, out of whom 2,500 were women. The youth wing of the party had around 1,200 members, out of whom 480 were women. The party had an educational organization, ''[[Bund für Arbeiterbildung]]'' (6,000 members) and a children's organization, ''Kinderfreudegruppen'' (300 members).&lt;ref name="kon"&gt;[[Labour and Socialist International]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bqElQQAACAAJ Kongress-Protokolle der Sozialistischen Arbeiter-Internationale - B. 3.1 Brüssel 1928]''. Glashütten im Taunus: D. Auvermann, 1974. p. IV. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1928 the [[Bydgoszcz]] branch of the party had broken away, forming a separate [[German Socialist Party|German Social Democratic Party of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZspwAAAACAAJ Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918–1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49]''. [[Düsseldorf]]: Droste, 1997, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

In Silesia, the situation was somewhat different from in central Poland. In [[Upper Silesia]], the party did not fare too well in municipal polls. In the 1929 city council election in [[Katowice]], the party mustered to get two seats. In [[Bielsko]], the result was better for the party in local elections. In the 1929 city council election the party won eight seats (in alliance with the PPS).&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

On October 6–7, 1929, a conference was held in Lodz which completed the task of unification of the DSAP set up at Chorzów four years earlier. The conference finally decided to locate the DSAP headquarters to Lodz (an issue that had been a bone of contention for years). ''[[Lodzer Volkszeitung]]'' was declared as the central party organ.&lt;ref&gt;p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Several representatives of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] and socialist parties participated as guests to the Lodz conference, including the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] leader [[Johannes Stelling]], the PPS chairman [[Herman Diamand]], the leader of the [[Jew]]ish [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bund]] [[Henryk Ehrlich]].&lt;ref&gt;Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZspwAAAACAAJ Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918–1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49]''. [[Düsseldorf]]: Droste, 1997, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1930, DSAP suffered another split, as the leftist Heinrich Scheibler broke away and formed the [[German Socialist Labour Party in Poland – Left]] (DSAP-Linke). Scheibler was able to take parts of the party organization in the Łódź area with him.&lt;ref&gt;Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZspwAAAACAAJ Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918–1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49]''. [[Düsseldorf]]: Droste, 1997, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

DSAP was fiercely opposed to the pro-[[National Socialist]] [[Young German Party]] (JdP), which had its base in Bielsko.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Herbert A.. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SOFkWX8EC4cC Current Research on Anti-Semitism: Studies on Modern Antisemitism, 1870-1933/39]'', p. 986&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in popularity of National Socialism amongst the Germans in Poland would prove disastrous for the DSAP. In Upper Silesia, support for the party rapidly eroded after the 1933 Machtübernahme.&lt;ref&gt;Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZspwAAAACAAJ Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918–1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49]''. [[Düsseldorf]]: Droste, 1997, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September–October 1933 DSAP joined the call initiated by the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bund]] for boycott of goods from Germany, in protest of the Hitler regime.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt; The boycott call became controversial within DSAP, and some members (such as 
Arthur Kronig, Otto Heike, Ludwig Kuk and Gustav Ewald) left the party as a result.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;Lakeberg, Beata.
''[http://www.medaon.de/pdf/A_Lakeberg.pdf Das Judenbild in den Presseorganen der deutschen Sozialisten in der Zweiten Polnischen Republik]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1932 the DSAP had 5,429 members in Upper Silesia. By 1937 the number had declined to 560.&lt;ref&gt;p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 1936, the party had only three functioning branches in Upper Silesia, Katowice, Chorzów and [[Bielszowice]]. The Bielszowice branch went defunct before the end of the year, though. By March 1937, the remainder of the DSAP branch in Chorzów joined the PPS.&lt;ref&gt;Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZspwAAAACAAJ Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918–1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49]''. [[Düsseldorf]]: Droste, 1997, p. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 1939, DSAP signed the joint statement of socialist parties in Poland, calling for the people to fight against Hitlerism (other signatories included the Bund).&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Joseph.

The party was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1923 and 1940.&lt;ref name="kow"&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hardik Patel''' (born 20 July 1993) is an Indian social activist who participated and led the [[Patidar reservation agitation]].

==Early life ==
Hardik Patel was born on 20 July 1993 in a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Patel]] family to Bharat and Usha Patel. In 2004 his parents moved to [[Viramgam]], a town 11&amp;nbsp;km away, to give their children a better education. Hardik studied from Class VI to Class VIII at Divya Jyot School in Viramgam, before moving to K B Shah Vinay Mandir, where he studied until Class XII. He was a poor student and a [[cricket ]] enthusiast.&lt;ref name="hardik_toi_2015-08-27"&gt;{{cite news | title = A budding cricketer who changed his line | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/toi-cri/top-stories/A-budding-cricketer-who-changed-his-line/articleshow/48691604.cms | author = Roxy Gagdekar | work = Mumbai Mirror | publisher = Times of India | date = 27 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing Class XII, Hardik started helping his father, Bharat, to run a small business of fixing [[submersible pump]]s in underground water wells. Bharat, a former [[BJP]] worker, met then [[Chief Minister of Gujarat]] and herself a member of the Patidar caste, [[Anandiben Patel]], when she held the [[Mandal]] assembly seat, in which [[Viramgam]] falls.&lt;ref name="hardik_wm_toi_2015-08-27"&gt;{{cite news | title = Well-funded, organized and massive: Who’s behind Hardik Patel’s war machine? | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Well-funded-organized-and-massive-Whos-behind-Hardik-Patels-war-machine/articleshow/48688836.cms | publisher = Times of India | date = 27 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Patel joined Sahajanand College, [[Ahmedabad]] and earned a Bachelor of Commerce (B. Com.) degree. He ran for the post of general secretary of the college [[students' union]] and was elected unopposed.&lt;ref name="hardik_ie_2015-08-30"&gt;{{cite news | title = Sunday Story: The Angry Young Patel | url = http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/sunday-story-the-angry-young-patel/ | author = Parimal Dabhi | publisher = Indian Express | date = 30 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still in college, Patel opened a [[potable water]] stand at the [[Viramgam]] Bus Stand as an act of social service.&lt;ref name="hardik_ie_2015-08-30"/&gt; In 2013, "he graduated from college, after^ two ^attempts, with less than 50% marks"!.&lt;ref name="hardik_toi_2015-08-25"&gt;{{cite news | title = Who is Hardik Patel | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Who-is-Hardik-Patel/listshow/48663994.cms | publisher = Times of India | date = 25 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardik_nyt_2015-08-31"&gt;{{cite news | title = Caste Quotas in India Come Under Attack | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/world/asia/caste-quotas-in-india-come-under-attack.html | author = David Barstow and Suhasini Raj | publisher = New York Times | date = 27 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and political activism ==

===Sardar Patel Group===
On 31 October 2012 Hardik Patel joined the Sardar Patel Group (SPG), a Patidar youth body, and within less than a month, became president of its Viramgam unit.&lt;ref name="hardik_wm_toi_2015-08-27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hardik_ie_2015-09-02"&gt;{{cite news | title = Lalji Patel: ‘I let Hardik run social media, he made it seem he was the leader’ | url = http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/lalji-patel-i-let-hardik-run-social-media-he-made-it-seem-he-was-the-leader/ | author = Leena Misra, Parimal Dabhi | publisher = Indian Express | date = 2 September 2015 | accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interaction with its 50,000 strong membership revealed that Patidar youth faced challenges while securing private sector jobs because of a slow economy, while they were shut out of government jobs because of reservation quotas and the expectation of bribes.&lt;ref name="hardik_toi_2015-08-31"&gt;{{cite news | title = No political force but force of Patidar society behind stir: Hardik Patel | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/No-political-force-but-force-of-Patidar-society-behind-stir-Hardik-Patel/articleshow/48737340.cms | author = Rajeev Deshpande &amp; Vishwa Mohan | publisher = Times of India | date = 31 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that some Patidar farmers saw their agriculture land acquired for urbanization and industrialization, while Patidar businessmen faced failure of their traditional businesses due to competition from online retailers.{{dubious|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="hardik_fp_2015-08-31"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/kitne-haath-tode-maine-maloom-meet-hardik-patel-patidar-poster-boy-and-man-without-a-plan-2413230.html|title='Kitne haath tode maine, maloom?'

More than 20,000 small firms had shut down and thousands of unemployed Patel [[diamond cutting|diamond cutters]] and polishers had returned to their villages.&lt;ref name="hardik_et_2015-09-01"&gt;{{cite news | title = Indifferent to facts, but Hardik Patel knows how to play reservation-victim role like no other | url = http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indifferent-to-facts-but-hardik-patel-knows-how-to-play-reservation-victim-role-like-no-other/articleshow/48751456.cms | author = Rohini Mohan | publisher = Economic Times | date = 1 September 2015 | accessdate = 1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Hardik Patel was ousted from his post with the SPG after a conflict with its leader, Lalji Patel.&lt;ref name="hardik_wm_toi_2015-08-27"/&gt;

=== Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) ===
In July 2015 Patel's sister, "Monica, failed to qualify for a state government scholarship. Patel was upset when a friend of Monica's qualified for the same" scholarship through the [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) quota even though she had scored lower marks.&lt;ref name="hardik_nyt_2015-08-31"/&gt; Recognizing that affirmative policies were benefiting other castes but not Patidars, Patel formed the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) which claim itself as an apolitical organization&lt;ref name="hardik_ht_2015-08-31"&gt;{{cite news | title = Hardik Patel wants his protest to go India-wide | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hardik-patel-in-delhi-says-political-parties-not-welcome-in-quota-stir/article1-1385674.aspx | author = Saubhadra Chatterji &amp; Mallica Joshi | publisher = Hindustan Times | date = 31 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to get Patidars included in the OBC quota.&lt;ref name="hardik_ie_2015-08-31b"&gt;{{cite news | title = Patel quota protest: Rally in Madhya Pradesh today, Hardik Patel lays out pan-India agitation plan | url = http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/patel-quota-stir-rally-in-madhya-pradesh-today-hardik-lays-out-pan-india-agitation-plan/ | publisher = Indian Express | date = 31 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 2015, a large number of Patidars from all over Gujarat gathered at GMDC ground, Ahmedabad for a rally. Patel declared the day as ''Patidar Kranti Diwas'' (Patidar Revolution Day). That evening, he was briefly arrested by [[Ahmedabad City Police]] when he went on fast after a rally held earlier in the day had dispersed. He was charged under section 151 of [[Indian Penal Code]] for 'knowingly joining or continuing in assembly of five or more persons after it has been commanded to disperse'.&lt;ref name="hardik_bs_2015-08-25"&gt;{{cite news | title = Patidar rally youth leader Hardik Patel arrested in Ahmedabad | url = http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/patidar-rally-youth-leader-hardik-patel-arrested-in-ahmedabad-115082501394_1.html | publisher = Business Standard | date = 25 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent protests broke out in response, forcing the [[Government of Gujarat|Gujarat state government]] to impose a [[curfew]] and call in the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref name="hardik_time_2015-08-26"&gt;{{cite news | title = Riots Break Out in India Over a Dominant Caste’s Attempt to Gain ‘Backward’ Status | url = http://time.com/4011001/hardik-patel-protest-arrest-gujarat-obc/ | author = Rishi Iyengar | publisher = Time Magazine | date = 26 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2015, he addressed a gathering of [[Gujjar]] and [[Kurmi]] communities from [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref name="hardik_ie_2015-08-31"&gt;{{cite news | title = In Delhi, Hardik Patel rallies other Patel groups, tells them to draw swords | url = http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/hardik-patel-in-delhi-to-hold-talks-with-leaders-of-communities-demanding-reservation/ | author = Pritha Chatterjee | publisher = Indian Express | date = 31 August 2015 | accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2015, Patel surfaced after a brief disappearance, claiming that had been "abducted" by people with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hardik-patel-found-claims-he-was-abducted/article7681232.ece Hardik Patel surfaces after ‘mysterious disappearance’].

On 9 September 2015 Patel, launched Patel Navnirman Sena (PNS) and announced a major stir across India. PNS was established with the aim to bring Patels (Patidars) and affiliated communities such as Kurmis and Gujjars under one platform to press for their demand for reservation in government jobs and education under the OBC category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-hardik-patel-unveils-launches-patel-navnirman-sena-announces-major-stir-across-india-2123298|title = 'Patel Navnirman Sena (PNS)' remarks: Launches Patel Navnirman Sena (PNS)|date = 9 September 2015|work = [[Daily News and Analysis]](DNA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2015, Patel was booked for insulting the ''Tiranga'', the [[National Flag of India]], in a case registered in [[Rajkot]]. He was  briefly detained for trying to disrupt the one-day international (ODI) [[cricket]] match between India and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hardik-patel-detained-near-rajkot-cricket-stadium-ahead-of-protest-meet-1233541|title = 'Tricolour in a case' remarks: Hardik Patel booked for sedition|date = 18 October 2015|work = [[NDTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October 2015, Patel was booked in [[Surat]] under the charges of sedition over alleged remarks about  'killing cops'.

===Politics===
In February 2017, it was announced that Patel would lead the [[Shiv Sena]]'s campaign in Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[NDTV]]|title=Hardik Patel Is Shiv Sena's New Weapon Against Estranged Ally BJP|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hardik-patel-is-shiv-senas-new-weapon-against-estranged-ally-bjp-1656867|date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later chose not to align with the Sena and instead backed the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/politics/buzz-in-delhi-hardik-and-sena-share-common-goals&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Patel's close aid Chirag Patel and Ketan Patel have alleged him of misusing Patidar community's fund for living a luxurious life. It is also alleged that he secretly meet with [[Indian National Congress]] then Vice President [[Rahul Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/politics/national-gujarat-elections-2017-hardik-patel-secretly-meets-rahul-gandhi-at-ahmedabad-hotel-408004|title=Hardik Patel secretly meet Rahul Gandhi|author=IndiaTV|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Aides-turn-against-Hardik-Patel-accuse-him-of-misusing-communitys-money/articleshow/53821373.cms|title=Aides turn against Hardik Patel, accuse him of misusing community's money |newspaper=The Times of India|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mahapunjab.com/hardik-patel-misused-quota-stir-become-crorepati-aide/|title=Hardik Patel misused Quota Stir to become "Crorepati" – MahaPunjab|date=23 August 2016|newspaper=MahaPunjab|language=en-US|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/hardik-patel-became-crorepati-within-a-year-of-launching-patidar-quota-stir-former-associates-2971338.html|title=Hardik Patel became crorepati within a year of launching Patidar quota stir: Former associates – Firstpost|date=23 August 2016|newspaper=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hardik-patel-used-quota-stir-to-become-leader-amass-wealth-ex-aides/story-8PNogUYyg6GXZU9eDlbvcJ.html|title=Hardik Patel used quota stir to become leader, amass wealth: Ex-aides|date=23 August 2016|work=Hindustan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties denied that this meeting happened.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16198">In real estate and property studies, the hedonic regression (P = f1, f2, f3, ..., fn) is often used to study the impact of a number of factors that affect housing prices &lt;ref name="Housing price"&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322759961_Have_Housing_Prices_Gone_with_the_Smelly_Wind_Big_Data_Analysis_on_Landfill_in_Hong_Kong Li, Rita Yi Man &amp; Li, Herru Ching Yu (2018) Have Housing Prices Gone with the Smelly Wind?

In [[economics]], '''hedonic regression''' or '''hedonic demand theory''' is a [[revealed preference]] method of estimating [[demand]] or [[value (economics)|value]]. It breaks down the item being researched into its constituent characteristics, and obtains estimates of the contributory value of each characteristic. This requires that the composite good being valued can be reduced to its constituent parts and that the market values those constituent parts. Hedonic models are most commonly estimated using [[regression analysis]], although more generalized models, such as [[sales comparison approach|sales adjustment grid]]s, are special cases of hedonic models.

An attribute vector, which may be a dummy or panel variable, is assigned to each characteristic or group of characteristics. Hedonic models can accommodate non-linearity, variable interaction, or other complex valuation situations.

Hedonic models are commonly used in [[real estate appraisal]], [[real estate economics]], and [[consumer price index]] (CPI) calculations. In CPI calculations, hedonic regression is used to control the effect of changes in product quality. Price changes that are due to substitution effects are subject to hedonic quality adjustments.

==Hedonic pricing method==

Although product characteristics are neither produced nor consumed in isolation, hedonic price models assume that the price of a product reflects embodied characteristics valued by some implicit or shadow prices. In empirical studies, these implicit characteristic prices are coefficients that relate prices and attributes in a regression model. Hedonic price regression models are estimated using secondary data on prices and attributes of different product or service alternatives. In working with longitudinal data, one adds period-specific dummies and uses their regression coefficients to estimate quality-adjusted price indices.  In hedonic regression, independent variables typically include performance-related product and service attributes. Such product characteristics represent not only value to the user but also resource cost to the producer. It has been demonstrated however that prices in hedonic regression are not determined completely by technical factors and performance-related characteristics. Brand-name and market-segment effects can explain price distortions and premiums that are charged over and above any allowance made for differences in measurable product performance.&lt;ref&gt;Baltas, G. and Freeman, J. (2001). Hedonic Price Methods and the Structure of High-Technology Industrial Markets: An Empirical Analysis. ''Industrial Marketing Management'' '''30''': 599-607&lt;/ref&gt; 

Certain environmental services often influence the [[market price]]s. The Hedonic pricing method is often brought into play in order to assess the economic values of such services.

This method finds its application to reveal the effect of environmental attributes in changes in the local [[real estate]] pricing. It is frequently used for estimating costs related to:

* The overall quality of the environment in terms of [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]], and noise
* Environmental amenities which include aesthetic sights and closeness to recreational sites such as parks, beaches, etc.

It is important to note that the hedonic pricing method is based on the fact that prices of goods in a market are affected by their characteristics. For example, the price of a pair of pants will depend on the comfort, the cloth used, the brand, the fit, etc. So this method helps us estimate the value of a commodity based on people's [[willingness to pay]] for the commodity as and when its characteristics change.&lt;ref name="hedonic pricing"&gt;[http://www.ecosystemvaluation.org/hedonic_pricing.htm Ecosystem Valuation Methods - Hedonic Pricing]&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular example which is used most often is the real estate market, where the value of two different properties which are otherwise comparable will vary depending on the various environmental amenities present in the surrounding areas of these properties.
If there is a measurable price drop of properties located near a dump yard (as compared to other locations), the difference in the prices point towards the external cost of the dump yard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivm.vu.nl/en/Images/CBA3_tcm53-161539.pdf Hedonic pricing (HPM)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425063715/http://www.ivm.vu.nl/en/Images/CBA3_tcm53-161539.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}. VU University, Institute for Environmental Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the marginal willingness to pay (in higher housing prices) for the given difference in cleanliness and serenity of the locality. Hedonic Regression methods are used to estimate these price differentials.

The Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) as mentioned earlier is a form of revealed preference method of valuation and it uses surrogate markets to estimate the value of the environmental amenity.

Surrogate market is a concept that one uses when one cannot directly estimate the [[market prices]] for certain [[environmental good]]s. Therefore, a similar good sold in the market is chosen as a proxy.

For example, if we want to know the value of clean air estimated by an individual, he may reveal his preference in the form of establishing his house in a clean society and paying an extra premium for the same. Thus, with the help of Hedonic Pricing Method, the environmental component of the value and the market price can be separated. In turn, this market price is used as a surrogate for the environmental value.&lt;ref name="case study"&gt; {{cite paper|url=http://coe.mse.ac.in/dp/hedonic%20price.pdf |first=Dr.haripriya |last=Gundimeda |title=Hedonic Pricing Method-A Concept Note |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027084754/http://coe.mse.ac.in/dp/hedonic%20price.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hedonic models and real estate valuation==
In real estate economics, hedonic pricing is used to adjust for the problems associated with researching a good that is as [[heterogeneous]] as buildings. Because buildings are so different, it is difficult to estimate the demand for buildings generically. Instead, it is assumed that a house can be decomposed into characteristics such as number of bedrooms, size of lot, or distance to the city center. A hedonic regression equation treats these attributes (or bundles of attributes) separately, and estimates prices (in the case of an additive model) or elasticity (in the case of a log model) for each of them. This information can be used to construct a price index that can be used  to compare the price of housing in different cities, or to do time series analysis. As with CPI calculations, hedonic pricing can be used to correct for quality changes in constructing a housing price index. It can also be used to assess the value of a property, in the absence of specific market transaction data. It can also be used to analyze the demand for various housing characteristics, and housing demand in general. It has also been used to test assumptions in spatial economics.

The [[Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice]], or USPAP, provides for mass appraisal standards to govern the use of hedonic regressions and other automated valuation models when used for [[real estate appraisal]].  Appraisal methodology treats the hedonic regression as essentially a statistically robust form of the [[sales comparison approach]].&lt;ref&gt;John A. Kilpatrick, [http://www.greenfieldadvisors.com/publications/classcert.pdf Real Estate Issues in Class Certification] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010090625/http://www.greenfieldadvisors.com/publications/classcert.pdf |date=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hedonic models are commonly used in tax assessment, litigation, academic studies, and other mass appraisal projects.

==Application of the hedonic pricing method==
While studying the application of the Hedonic Pricing Method, the first assumption made is the value of a house is affected by a particular combination of characteristics that it possesses given that properties with better qualities demand higher prices as compared to properties with lower qualities. This is the Hedonic Pricing Function.

The price of a house will thus be affected by the structural characteristics
&lt;math&gt;\vec s = (s_1,s_2,s_2,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; of the house itself, characteristics of the locality/neighbourhood
&lt;math&gt;\vec n = (n_1,n_2,n_2,\dots)&lt;/math&gt;, and environmental characteristics
&lt;math&gt;\vec e = (e_1,e_2,e_2,\dots)&lt;/math&gt;.

Structural Characteristics could be anything from size of the house, to the number of rooms, type of flooring, etc. Neighbourhood attributes include variables like posh-ness of the locality, quality of roads, etc. And the environmental characteristics are variables such quality of air, proximity to parks, beaches, dumping yards, etc.

The analysis takes place in two stages.
The first stage involves employing regression techniques to estimate the Hedonic Price Function of the property. This function will relate the prices of many properties in the same housing area to the different characteristics.

So the Price Function is of the form

&lt;math&gt; P = f (\vec s, \vec n, \vec e).&lt;/math&gt;

This function could be [[linear]] or [[non-linear]]. The prices may change at an increasing or decreasing rate when the characteristics change.&lt;ref name="case study" /&gt;

When you now differentiate the price function with respect to any one of the above characteristics, the implicit price function for that particular characteristic is yielded. It is considered implicit because the price function is indirectly revealed to us by what the people are willing to pay in order to obtain better quality or quantities of the characteristic.

In the second stage, these implicit prices are regressed against the actual quantities/qualities chosen by the people in order to attain the marginal [[willingness to pay]] for the [[amenity]]. The results of this analysis will indicate the changes in property values for a unit change in each characteristic, given that all the other characteristics are constant. Some [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]] however may be [[correlated]]. This will result in similar changes in their values.&lt;ref name="hedonic pricing" /&gt;

==Advantages ==

* Versatility: The method can be comfortably adapted to take into consideration the several probable interactions between environmental quality and the marketed goods.
* This method is often used to approximate the values based on the actual choices of the people.
* The real estate market is a good indication of the values as it is relatively efficient in responding to information.
* It is comparatively easier to obtain data on property sales and characteristics and can be easily compared to secondary data sources in order to acquire the descriptive variables for the regression analysis.&lt;ref name="hedonic pricing" /&gt;

==Limitations ==

* The scope of applying this model is restricted and limited to measuring the environmental benefits related to housing prices only.
* The amount of data that needs to be collected and worked with is very large.
* An assumption of the model is that everyone should have prior knowledge of the potential positive and negative [[externalities]] that are associated with purchasing the real estate property. For example, it is important that they know before-hand about the level of pollution in a locality situated near an industrial site. This assumption, however, is generally seen as unrealistic. 
* The availability and accessibility of data directly affects the amount of time and the expense that will be undertaken to carry out an application of the model.
* This method estimates people's willingness to pay for the supposed variation in environmental qualities and their consequences. However, if the people are unaware of the relation between the environmental qualities and their benefits to them or the property, then the value will not be reflected in the price of the property.
* Market Limitations: This model makes an assumption that, given their income, people have the opportunity to choose the combination of attributes they prefer. What it fails to see is that the [[real estate]] market can also be affected by external factors such as [[interest rates]], [[taxation]], etc. For example, suppose a family wishes to purchase a property near a popular city center, having a garden and of a large area. In reality, it may be possible that a house near the city center is comparatively smaller in size or does not have a garden.
* [[Multicollinearity]]: Sometimes, there could be a case when larger properties are only available in cleaner non-polluted areas and smaller properties are found in more urban and polluted environments. In such cases, it would be difficult to separate [[pollution]] and the size of property exactly.
* Price Changes: Another assumption is that prices in the market will automatically adjust to any changes in the attributes. In reality, there is a lag especially in localities where purchase and sale of real estate is limited. 
* The model is relatively complex to interpret and requires a high level of statistical knowledge and expertise.&lt;ref name="Limitations"&gt; More Reading here.[http://www.cbabuilder.co.uk/Quant5.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Some{{who|date=April 2014}} commentators, including [[Austrian economists]], have criticized the US government's use of hedonic regression in computing its CPI, fearing it can be used to mask the true inflation rate and thus lower the interest it must pay on [[Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities]] (TIPS) and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] cost of living adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite paper |url=http://www.von-der-lippe.org/dokumente/hedon-vdl.pdf |first=Peter von der |last=Lippe |title=Some Conservative Comments on Hedonic Methods |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same use of hedonic models analyzing consumer prices in other countries has shown that non-hedonic methods may misstate inflation over time by failing to take quality changes into account.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite journal |last=Reis |first=Hugo J. |last2=Silva |first2=J.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|280px|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]] personifies the French motherland]]

A '''homeland''' ({{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason=Let's write this word in full - but what does it stand for? |text=rel. }} ''[[country of origin]]'' and '''native land''') is the concept of the place ([[cultural geography]]) with which an [[ethnic group]] holds a long history and a deep cultural association – the country in which a particular [[nationality|national identity]] began. As a common noun, homeland, it simply connotes the country of one's origin. When used as a [[proper noun]], the Homeland, as well as its equivalents in other languages, often have [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] connotations. A homeland may also be referred to as a ''fatherland'', a ''motherland'', or a ''mother country'', depending on the culture and language of the nationality in question.

== Motherland ==

 [[File:Bharat Mata bronze.jpg|thumb|[[Bharat Mata]] statue accompanied by a lion at [[Yanam]], [[India]]]]
 
Motherland refers to a ''mother country'', i.e. the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, the place of origin of an [[ethnic group]] or immigrant, or a [[Metropole]] in contrast to its colonies. People often refer to [[personifications of Russia|Mother Russia]] as a personification of the Russian nation. Within the [[British Empire]], many natives in the colonies came to think of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as the mother country of one, large nation. [[India]] is often personified as [[Bharat Mata]] (Mother India). The French commonly refer to France as "la mère patrie";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/ces-tirailleurs-senegalais-qui-ont-combattu-pour-la-france_906248.html|title=Ces tirailleurs sénégalais qui ont combattu pour la France|author=|date=14 July 2010|website=lexpress.fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103191858/http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/ces-tirailleurs-senegalais-qui-ont-combattu-pour-la-france_906248.html|archivedate=3 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hispanic America]]ns and 19th century-[[illustrados|upper-class]] [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], commonly referred to [[Spain]] as "''la Madre Patria''".

==Fatherland==
{{See also|Fatherland}}
Fatherland is the nation of one's "fathers" or "[[Ancestor|forefathers]]". It can be viewed as a nationalist concept, insofar as it relates to nations.

The term fatherland (''Vaterland'') is used throughout [[German-speaking Europe]], as well as in Dutch.
For example, "[[Wien Neêrlands Bloed]]", [[national anthem]] of the [[Netherlands]] between 1815 and 1932, makes extensive and conspicuous use of the parallel Dutch word.

Because of the use of ''Vaterland'' in Nazi-German war propaganda, the term "Fatherland" in English has become associated with domestic British and American anti-Nazi propaganda during [[World War II]]. This is not the case in Germany itself, where the word remains used in the usual patriotic contexts.

Terms equating "Fatherland" in other Germanic languages:
* Afrikaans ''Vaderland''
* Danish ''fædreland''
* Dutch ''vaderland''
* West Frisian ''heitelân''
* German ''Vaterland''
* Icelandic ''föðurland''
* Norwegian ''fedreland''
* Scots ''heauinlie'' (besides the more common ''faitherland'')
* Swedish ''fäderneslandet'' (besides the more common ''fosterlandet'')

A corresponding term is often used in Slavic languages, in:
* [[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''domovina'' (homeland)
* [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''otadžbina''(отаџбина)
* [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] татковина (''tatkovina'')
* Bulgarian татковина (''tatkovina'') as well as ''otechestvo''
* [[Czech language|Czech]] ''otčina'' (although the normal Czech term for "homeland" is ''vlast'')
* [[Polish language|Polish]] ''ojczyzna'' (besides rarer name ''macierz'' "motherland")
* Russian ''otechestvo'' (отечество) or ''otchizna'' (отчизна)
* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ''batʹkivshchyna'' (батьківщина) or ''vitchyzna'' (вітчизна).

In [[Romance languages]], a common way to refer to one's home country is ''Patria/Pátria/Patrie'' which has the same connotation as ''Fatherland'', that is, the nation of our parents/fathers (From the Latin, Pater, father). As ''patria'' has feminine gender, it is usually used in expressions related to one's mother, as in Italian ''la Madrepatria'', Spanish ''la Madre Patria'' or Portuguese ''a Pátria Mãe'' (Mother Fatherland).

==Various connotations==
* The [[Soviet Union]] created homelands for some minorities in the 1920s, including the [[Volga German ASSR]] and the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]. In the case of the Volga German ASSR, these homelands were later abolished and their inhabitants deported to either [[Siberia]] or the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]]. In the case of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast this was not necessary, since it had been created from the start at the far-Eastern end of Siberia, where no Jew had ever lived.
* In the United States, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] was created soon after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|11 September 2001, terrorist attacks]], as a means to centralize response to various [[imminent threat|threats]]. In a June 2002 column, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] consultant and speechwriter [[Peggy Noonan]] expressed the hope that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] would change the name of the department, writing that, "The name Homeland Security grates on a lot of people, understandably. ''Homeland'' isn't really an American word, it's not something we used to say or say now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noonan |first=Peggy |title=OpinionJournal – Peggy Noonan |accessdate=8 September 2007 |date=14 June 2002&lt;!-- 12:01 a.m. EDT --&gt; |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110001838 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202405/http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110001838 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid Era|apartheid]] era in [[South Africa]], the concept was given a different meaning. The white government had designated approximately 25% of its non-desert territory for black tribal settlement. Whites and other non-blacks were restricted from owning land or settling in those areas. After 1948 they were gradually granted an increasing level of "home-rule". From 1976 several of these regions were granted independence. Four of them were declared independent nations by South Africa, but were unrecognized as independent countries by any other nation besides each other and South Africa. The territories set aside for the African inhabitants were also known as [[bantustans]].
* In [[Australia]], the term refers to relatively small Aboriginal settlements (referred to also as 'Outstations') where people with close kinship ties share lands significant to them for cultural reasons. Many such homelands are found across Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. The 'homeland movement' gained momentum in the 1970s. It is estimated that homeland numbers range around 500 to 700, with not all homelands being permanently occupied owing to seasonal or cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Encyclopedia of Aboriginal Australia |year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the concept of "homeland", especially in the patriotic sense, is "''ana vatan''" (lit. mother homeland), while "''baba ocağı''" (lit. father's [[hearth]]) is used to refer to one's childhood home. (Note: The Turkish word "''ocak''" has the double meaning of ''january'' and ''fireplace'', like the Spanish "''hogar''".)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7432">[[Human rights]] is an issue in Guatemala. The establishment of the [[International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala]] has helped the Attorney General prosecute extrajudicial killings and corruption. There remains widespread [[impunity]] for abusers from the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], which ran from 1960 to 1996, and [[Human Rights Watch]] considers threats and violence against unionists, journalists and lawyers a major concern.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/americas/guatemala Guatemala profile [[Human Rights Watch]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial for eight former [[Armed Forces of Guatemala|Army]] members on charges related to the alleged disappearances of 130 people whose bodies were found among 550 at a base now run by the UN called CREOMPAZ has been stalled since it began in 2016 due to witness intimidation, among other factors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ijmonitor.org/2016/06/eight-military-officers-to-stand-trial-in-creompaz-grave-crimes-case/ "Eight Military Officers to Stand Trial in CREOMPAZ Grave Crimes Case", by Jo-Marie Burt, International Justice Monitor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/americas/guatemala/report-guatemala/ Guatemala 2017/2018 report, from Amnesty International]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
After an ongoing war for over 36 years in Guatemala, the country of Guatemala began transitioning into a more stable and established democratic country. However following the war, corruption began appearing all around the country eventually engulfing the whole country with common crimes and chaos. In 2013, the crime rate increased to where there was roughly 6,000 homicides per year in Guatemala. These violent killings included deaths of women and children. While Guatemala was fighting toward ending the corruption, there were many high-level government officials who were involved in organized crime. This resulted in only about 2% of the violent crimes going to trial.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cicig.org/cicig/antecedentes/|title=International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala|last=|first=|date=2018-03-05|work=CICIG (International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala)|access-date=2018-10-19|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2015, President Otto Pérez Molina, Vice President Roxana Baldetti, and other high officials lost their power and were prosecuted for participation in human rights violation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pallister|first=Kevin|date=2017|title=Guatemala: The Fight for Accountability and the Rule of Law|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/s0718-090x2017000200471|journal=Revista de ciencia política (Santiago)|volume=37|issue=2|pages=471–492|doi=10.4067/s0718-090x2017000200471|issn=0718-090X}}&lt;/ref&gt;Efraín Ríos Montt, was the President of Guatemala during 2003-2012.

==== Solutions ====
International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala organization was first established in December 12, 2005. After years of human rights violation in Guatemala, government officials began leading towards creating an established organization that would investigate the many variety of cases that were left unsolved. After getting the assistance from the United Nations, the government of Guatemala formulated an organization called Commission of Investigation of Illegal Bodies and Clandestine Security Apparatuses (CICIACS). The creation of this organization caused a controversy in Guatemala, which resulted in it being denied because the ruling deemed it to be a violation of the exclusive constitutional delegation of power to the Public Ministry.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cicig.org/cicig/antecedentes/|title=International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala|last=|first=|date=2018-03-05|work=CICIG (International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala)|access-date=2018-10-19|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;After being denied the government of Guatemala revised the document and the regulation of the CICIACS to eliminate all the unconstitutional issues that were brought to their attention from the constitutional court. When they were finished they re-introduced the proposition to the court and after the review the Constitutional court approved it. They renamed it International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). The government of Guatemala and the United Nations signed it into order on December 12, 2005.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/undpa/en/americas/cicig|title=CICIG (International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala) {{!}} Department of Political Affairs|website=www.un.org|publisher=United Nations|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal Issues ==
According to the International Human Rights Law Group, the Guatemalan criminal justice system is to blame for the poor human rights Guatemala faces. Cerezo announced it would now be their responsibility.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1990|title=Review of Maximizing Deniability: The Justice System and Human Rights in Guatemala|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/762176|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=12|issue=1|pages=180–181|doi=10.2307/762176}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Guatemalan criminal justice system is supposed to work with the court to punish those who violate human rights. With a system implemented to protect human rights in Guatemala the issue of these rights being violated remains (??). This is partly because the judges are not trained properly which can affect the investigation by causing them to be unreliable.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;The Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) was established in 2007 and itworks to break down corruption within the country.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/guatemala|title=World Report 2018: Rights Trends in Guatemala|date=2018-01-05|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;After a CICIG investigation the 2015 president, Cerezo collected bribes he was later arrested.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;Human rights violations continue to increase with the Guatemalan people as victims because of improper protections from the government.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

An '''international incident''' is a seemingly relatively small or limited action or clash that results in a wider dispute between two or more [[nation-states]]. International incidents can arise from unanticipated actions involving citizens, government officials, or armed units of one or more nation-states, or out of a deliberate but small provocative action by [[espionage]] agents of one nation-state, or by [[terrorists]], against another nation-state.

An international incident usually arises during a time of relative [[peace]] between nation-states, and in general is, on the surface, an unexpected event. Conflicts that grow out of a series of escalating [[skirmish]]es between nation-states generally are not considered international incidents; however, [[terrorist]] actions can and often do become international incidents. However, historical views of past international incidents often reveal the incident was the flashpoint of a simmering conflict between nation-states, or organizations opposing nation-states.

Wars have often been provoked by international incidents, and [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] efforts to prevent international incidents from growing into full-scale armed conflicts often have been unsuccessful. In the aftermath of the [[First World War]], the [[League of Nations]] was established to help nations who were parties to an international incident achieve a solution to the incident through diplomatic means. Initially, the League of Nations had some success in working to find diplomatic solutions, however the failure of the League of Nations to prevent [[World War II]] resulted in the disbandment of the League of Nations in favor of the [[United Nations]]. As with its predecessor, the United Nations provides a means by which nations involved in an international incident can work to resolve the matter diplomatically rather than through the use of force.

The term is also applied to various incidents that can disrupt international [[commerce]], and to [[celebrities]] or other well-known people who commit [[gaffe]]s or otherwise act inappropriately, causing the [[Mass media|press]] and sometimes governments to criticize their actions.

The [[International Court of Justice]] keeps a list of legal disputes between nation-states, many of which result from international incidents. The [[Royal Mail]] of the [[United Kingdom]] keeps a list on its website of current international incidents that might disrupt mail service.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmail.com/service-update/international Royal Mail – International Incident Bulletin].

'''Samuel Jared Taylor''' (born September 15, 1951) is a Japanese-born American [[white supremacist]]&lt;ref&gt;
*Elizabeth Bryant Morgenstern, "White Supremacist Groups" in ''Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Vol. 1 (ed. Kathleen R. Arnold: Greenwood/ABC-CLIO, 2011), p. 508: "Jared Taylor is the editor of the American Renaissance magazine, a publication that espouses the superiority of whites. ... Unlike many other white supremacists, Taylor is not anti-Semitic..."

He is a former member of the advisory board of ''[[The Occidental Quarterly]]'' and a former director of the [[National Policy Institute]], a Virginia-based white nationalist think tank.&lt;ref name="thelaw"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Law Into Their Own Hands: Immigration and the Politics of Exceptionalism | publisher=University of Arizona Press | author=Doty, Roxanne Lynn | year=2009 | page=61 | isbn=978-0816527717}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a board member and spokesperson of the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://time.com/3930993/dylann-roof-council-of-conservative-citizens-charleston/|title=Inside the White Supremacist Group that Influenced Charleston Shooting Suspect|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/23/us/white-supremacist-group-dylann-roof/|title=White supremacist group stands by racist ideology|last1=Devine|first1=Curt|last2=Griffin|first2=Drew|last3=Bronstein|first3=Scott|date=24 June 2015|publisher=CNN Investigations|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor, like many of the organizations he is associated with, is often described as promoting [[Racism|racist ideologies]] by, among others, civil rights groups, news media, and academics studying racism in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Roddy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=splc2&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/american-renaissance American Renaissance] Southern Poverty Law Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sussman2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkins2011pp59-60"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Taylor was born on September 15, 1951, to Christian [[missionary]] parents in [[Kobe]], Japan. He lived in Japan until he was 16 years old and attended Japanese public school up to the age of 12, becoming fluent in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in the process.&lt;ref name="Swain2003p87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Swain|Nieli|2003|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=Nothing in the source says "public school" or "up to the age of 12". Furthermore, if he was born and raised in Japan, surrounded by people speaking Japanese, then saying he "became fluent in Japanese in the process" (or even something closer to the source's "he learned to speak fluent Japanese") is problematic, as he is probably natively bilingual, having "acquired" Japanese naturally the same way he acquired the language of his parents and the same way most Japanese children acquire Japanese; you would not say Shinzo Abe "became fluent in Japanese in the process of living in Japan and attending school".|date=October 2018}}

He graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1973 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in philosophy.&lt;ref name="adl1"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/jared_taylor/background.html?LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=taylor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818042017/http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/jared_taylor/background.html?LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=taylor |archive-date=August 18, 2016 |title=Jared Taylor/American Renaissance|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in international economics at the [[Sciences Po|Paris Institute of Political Studies]] in 1978.

==Career==
Taylor worked as an international lending officer for the [[Manufacturers Hanover Corporation]] from 1978 to 1981, and as West Coast editor of ''[[PC Magazine]]'' from 1983 to 1988.&lt;ref name="Atkins2011pp59-60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Atkins|2011|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked in [[West Africa]], and has traveled the area extensively.&lt;ref name="Swain2003p87"/&gt; Taylor is fluent in French, Japanese and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Taki's Magazine]]|url=http://takimag.com/article/noble_lies_are_for_children_a_qa_with_jared_taylor/print#axzz3r2OkFjux|title=Noble Lies Are for Children: A Q&amp;A With Jared Taylor|authorlink=John Derbyshire|author=Debryshire, John|date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBxtu2jD2zU|title=TV Libertés Interviews Jared Taylor about Banned Budapest Conference|last=American Renaissance|date=21 October 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as a courtroom interpreter.&lt;ref name="adl1"/&gt;&lt;!-- The link doesn't redirect to the homepage as the URL appeared to stay put, but the page doesn't look like it includes this information at present.

User:Hijiri88, March 2017. --&gt;

In 1983 he authored the book ''Shadows of the Rising Sun: A Critical View of the Japanese Miracle'', in which he wrote that Japan was not an appropriate economic or social model for the United States, and criticized the Japanese for excessive preoccupation with their own uniqueness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jared-taylor-2/shadows-of-the-rising-sun-a-critical-view-of-th/|title=Shadows of the Rising Sun: A Critical View of the Japanese Miracle|publisher=[[Kirkus Reviews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor wrote ''Paved With Good Intentions'' ([[Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers]], 1993), a book on [[racism in the United States|race-relations in the United States]]. In 1994, he was called by the defense team in a [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]] black-on-black murder trial, to give expert testimony on the race-related aspects of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940415&amp;slug=1905623|title=Business - 'Urban Survival Syndrome' Gets Blame In Slayings -- Is Defense Realistic, Or Does It Reinforce A Racial Stereotype? - Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to testifying in the trial he called young black men "the most dangerous people in America" and added "This must be taken into consideration in judging whether or not it was realistic for [the defendant] to think this was a kill-or-be-killed situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/10/26/urban-survival-rules-at-issue-in-trial/d1a78564-773e-45a9-a406-a5aa3b0a0b9f/|title='URBAN SURVIVAL' RULES AT ISSUE IN TRIAL|first1=Lori|last1=Montgomery|first2=Lori|last2=Montgomery|date=26 October 1994|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Taylor has been described as a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]],&lt;ref&gt;
*[[Leonard Zeskind]], ''Blood and Politics: The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream'' (Farrar, Straud and Giroux, 2009), p. 370 &amp; 427: "Taylor began his public foray into the white nationalist arena with a newsletter he edited called ''American Renaissance''... Taylor, by eschewing conspiracy mongering and what they called 'paramilitary infantilism,' gave white nationalism greater potential access to the conservative mainstream."
*Roxanne Lynn Doty, ''The Law Into Their Own Hands: Immigration and the Politics of Exceptionalism'' (University of Arizona Press, 2009), p. 61: "One of the more prominent members of the new white nationalism is Jared Taylor, editor of ''American Renaissance''."

Taylor is a proponent of [[scientific racism]] and voluntary [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref name="Sussman2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wilson_2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Jason|title='The races are not equal': meet the alt-right leader in Clinton's campaign ad|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/jared-taylor-alt-right-clinton-trump|accessdate=12 August 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wnyc2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=What This White Separatist Expects From the Trump Administration|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/what-white-separatist-expects-trump-administration/|accessdate=13 August 2017|agency=On the Media|publisher=WNYC|date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adl_jt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jared Taylor: Academic Racist|url=https://www.adl.org/news/article/jared-taylor-academic-racist|website=adl.org|publisher=The Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor also asserts that there are [[race and intelligence controversy|racial differences in intelligence]] among the various ethno-racial groups across the world.&lt;ref name="Sussman"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/10/11/americas_virulent_racists_the_sick_ideas_and_perverted_science_of_the_american_renaissance_foundation/ |title=America's virulent racists: The sick ideas and perverted "science" of the American Renaissance Foundation  |last=Sussman |first=Robert |date=October 14, 2014 |website=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor argues that Blacks are generally less intelligent than Hispanics, while Hispanics are generally less intelligent than whites, and whites are generally less intelligent than East Asians: "I think Asians are objectively superior to Whites by just about any measure that you can come up with in terms of what are the ingredients for a successful society. This doesn't mean that I want America to become Asian. I think every people has a right to be itself, and this becomes clear whether we're talking about [[Irian Jaya]] or [[Tibet]], for that matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swain|Nieli|2003|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating-hate/jared-taylor-extremism-in-america.pdf |title=Jared Taylor - American Renaissance |date=2013 |website=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sussman"/&gt;

Taylor describes himself as an advocate for white interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swain|Nieli|2003|pp=87–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that his journal, ''American Renaissance'', was founded to provide such a voice for white interests, and argues that its work is analogous to other interest groups that advocate for ethnic or racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swain|Nieli|2003|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in that journal in 2005, he stated, "Blacks and whites are different. When blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western civilization — any kind of civilization — disappears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Taylor supports immigration policies that would favor white immigrants over other groups. Taylor is noted as saying, "Whites deserve a homeland," and when questioned about the US immigration laws passed in 1965, under the [[Hart-Celler Act]], said that "Whites are making a terrible mistake by setting in motion forces that will reduce them to a minority."&lt;ref&gt;Jared Taylor, in an interview with ABC News' Amna Nawaz, on 26 March 2017; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z90KJWk3dPY Jared Taylor, ABC Interview 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism and anti-Semitism===
Kathleen R. Arnold a professor from the  Political Science department at [[DePaul University]] states, "unlike many other white supremacists, Taylor is not [[anti-Semitic]], and in fact encourages Jews to join his fight...however many within the white supremacist/[[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigration movement]] disagree with Taylor..... and he has been under tremendous pressure to break ties with the Jewish community."&lt;ref name="Arnold2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen R.

But to many on the far right, taking the Jew-hatred out of white nationalism is like taking the Christ out of Christmas — a sacrilege."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tilove|first1=Jonathan|title=White Nationalist Conference Ponders Whether Jews and Nazis Can Get Along|url=http://forward.com/news/6615/white-nationalist-conference-ponders-whether-jews/|publisher=The Forward|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Trump===
Taylor supported [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]], and recorded [[robocall]]s to support Trump before the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2016|Iowa caucus]] and [[New Hampshire Republican primary, 2016|New Hampshire primary]].&lt;ref name="taylortrump"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/01/12/white-nationalists-continue-support-trump-through-robocalls|title=White Nationalists Continue to Support Trump Through Robocalls}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-nationalists-see-advancement-through-donald-trumps-candidacy-1463523858|title=White Nationalists See Advancement Through Donald Trump's Candidacy|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|first=Beth|last=Reinhard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor described Trump's inauguration as "a sign of rising white consciousness".&lt;ref name="Eliot Nelson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Eliot|title=The KKK And Their Friends Are Overjoyed With President Trump's First 10 Days|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-kkk-white-nationalists-happy_us_5890edb7e4b0c90eff00a2a8|accessdate=1 February 2017|publisher=Huffington Post|date=31 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2017 [[CNN]] interview with [[Sara Sidner]], Taylor said that he supported Trump's election as president "because the effects of his policy would be to reduce the dispossession of whites, that is, to slow the process whereby whites become the minority in the United-States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol6GA4dMZw4&amp;t=861s|title=CNN Interviews Jared Taylor on White Identity|last=American Renaissance|date=15 May 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White genocide===
Taylor supports the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The creeping spectre of “white genocide” |url=https://theoutline.com/post/4486/the-creeping-spectre-of-white-genocide |publisher=[[The Outline (website)]]|date=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has hosted the [[Suidlanders]] on his AmRen podcast to discuss the topic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White genocide: How the big lie spread to the US and beyond |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-03-23-00-radical-right-plugs-swart-gevaar |publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]''|date=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst encouraging donations to the South African organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Far-right activists are teaming up with white supremacists to exploit South African politics |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/03/06/far-right-activists-are-teaming-white-supremacists-exploit-south-african-politics/219562 |publisher=''[[Media Matters]]''|date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been known to recommend [[Jean Raspail]]'s ''[[The Camp of the Saints]]'' to his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Notorious Book that Ties the Right to the Far Right |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/146925/notorious-book-ties-right-far-right |publisher=''[[The New Republic]]''|date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] describes Taylor as "a courtly presenter of ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacist—a kind of modern-day version of the refined but racist colonialist of old."&lt;ref name="splc"/&gt;

Mark Potok and Heidi Beirich, writers in the ''[[Intelligence Report]]'' (a publication of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]), have written that "Jared Taylor is the cultivated, cosmopolitan face of white supremacy. He is the guy who is providing the intellectual heft, in effect, to modern-day Klansmen." They have also stated that "''American Renaissance'' has become increasingly important over the years, bringing a measure of intellectualism and seriousness to the typically thug-dominated world of white supremacy".&lt;ref name=differences&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=644&amp;printable=1|title=Schism Threatens White Nationalist Group|publisher=''[[Intelligence Report]]''|date=Summer 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2010|author=Mark Potok|author2=Heidi Beirich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 feature in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' described Taylor as "a racist in the guise of expert".&lt;ref name="Roddy"&gt;"[http://www.post-gazette.com/life/dennis-roddy/2005/01/23/Jared-Taylor-a-racist-in-the-guise-of-expert/stories/200501230176 Jared Taylor, a Racist in the Guise of 'Expert']". Dennis Roddy. ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''. January 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

His online magazine, ''American Renaissance'', has been described as a white supremacist publication and a "forum for writers disparaging the abilities of minorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atkins|2011|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2017, his account (as well as the account for ''American Renaissance'') was suspended by [[Twitter]], as part of Twitter's new rules prohibiting accounts affiliated with the promotion of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/18/twitter-purge-suspends-account-of-far-right-leader-who-was-retweeted-by-trump/ |title='Twitter purge' suspends account of far-right leader who was retweeted by Trump |first=Craig |last=Timberg |first2=Hayley |last2=Tsukayama |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Taylor filed a lawsuit against Twitter on free speech grounds. Taylor and American Renaissance are represented by [[Marc Randazza]], who has previously represented Andrew Anglin, publisher of the [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[The Daily Stormer|Daily Stormer]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/au/news/white-nationalist-jared-taylor-american-renaissance-sues-twitter-for-account-suspension/|title=White nationalist Jared Taylor sues Twitter over account suspension|date=2018-02-23|work=CNET|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/white-supremacist-jared-taylor-sues-twitter-free-speech-twitter-lockout-a8224056.html|title=A white supremacist is suing Twitter for allegedly violating his right to free speech|date=2018-02-22|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4202">The '''Judeo-Christian Council for Constitutional Restoration''' is a conservative, religious organization formed in early 2005 that ran the website [http://www.StopActivistJudges.org StopActivistJudges.org]. By February 28, 2013, the domain had expired and been acquired by a domain parking company.

The council is descended from the [[Dallas Group]]. It is currently chaired by [[Rick Scarborough]]. The council's executive director is [[Philip Jauregui]], former counsel to Chief Justice [[Roy Moore]]. In April 2005, Scarborough was quoted as saying that his group was needed because of, "[[judicial activism|Activist judges]]...(whose) distortions of the Constitution have brought us [[abortion|abortion-on-demand]], purged [[religious symbol]]s from public places, made our schools faith-free zones, created a so-called right to homosexual [[sodomy]] and threatened '[[one nation under God]]' in the [[pledge of allegiance]]. Now, judges seem intent on imposing [[same-sex marriage]] by fiat."[http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=45424] According to the group's website, "Each progressive step down the road to the secularization of America has come not through a referendum of the people, or an act of their elected representatives, but rather at the stroke of a judge’s pen."&lt;ref name=stopactjud&gt;[http://www.stopactivistjudges.org StopActivistJudges.org web site] URL accessed 05/11/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Confronting The Judicial War On Faith''==
The group's April 2005 conference, ''Confronting The Judicial War On Faith'', attracted many prominent conservatives. According to the [[Washington Post]], "The two-day program listed two House members; aides to two senators; representatives from the [[Family Research Council]] and [[Concerned Women for America]]; conservative activists [[Alan Keyes]] and [[Morton C. Blackwell]]; the lawyer for [[Terri Schiavo]]'s parents; [[Alabama]]'s "[[Ten Commandments]]" judge, [[Roy Moore]]; and [[Tom DeLay|[Rep. Tom] DeLay]], who canceled to attend the pope's funeral."&lt;ref name=washpostconf&gt;Milbank, Dana [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38308-2005Apr8.html "And the Verdict on Justice Kennedy Is: Guilty"] ''Washington Post'' April 9, 2005; Page A03 URL accessed 05/12/2006&lt;/ref&gt; The event brought together lawmakers and [[Capitol Hill]] staffers with theocrats, adherents of [[Christian Reconstructionism]], a [[Calvinist]] doctrine that calls for the biblical law to rule American law.&lt;ref name=salontrust&gt;{{cite news|first=Michelle|last=Goldberg |title=In theocracy they trust|date=April 11, 2005|publisher=Salon Media Group, Inc.|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/04/11/judicial_conference/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a session titled "Remedies to Judicial Tyranny," a constitutional lawyer named [[Edwin Vieira]] discussed [[United States Supreme Court]] justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas, which struck down that state's anti-sodomy law. Kennedy was accused of relying on "Marxist, Leninist, Satanic principals drawn from foreign law" in his jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=salontrust/&gt;

According to the group's website, "April 7–8 proved to be a divine appointment. There was no way of knowing, humanly speaking, how significant that time would be in the life of our Republic"; Schiavo had died and "the federal judiciary, up to and including the United States Supreme Court, also turned a deaf ear to repeated pleas to save Terri." The group claims that the conference was responsible for creating "a movement... to restore the Constitution to its true meaning and original glory."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4481">'''Kátia Tapety''' (born 24 April 1949) is a [[Brazil]]ian politician. She was the first transgender politician to be elected in Brazil.&lt;ref name=TAPETY&gt;{{citar web || url=http://g1.globo.com/pi/piaui/noticia/2013/03/filme-sobre-o-primeiro-politico-travesti-do-brasil-e-lancado-em-teresina.html || titulo= ''Filme sobre o primeiro político travesti do Brasil é lançado em THE (g1.globo.com)'' || acessodata=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Tapety is the child of a family of politicians and until the sixteen years lived practically hidden in the house. She went to school only until third grade of elementary school and after that, her parents kept her a recluse.

==Career==
A resident of the municipality of [[Colônia do Piauí]], 388 km south of [[Teresina]], the Piauiense capital, Tapety joined the [[Liberal Front Party (Brazil)|Liberal Front Party]] in which the [[councilman]] was elected in 1992, 1996 and 2000 (always first and foremost&lt;ref name="sistemas.aids.gov.br"&gt;[http://www.sistemas.aids.gov.br/imprensa/Noticias.asp?NOTCod=59843 Piauí pode eleger o primeiro travesti vice-prefeito do País]&lt;/ref&gt;), then she next joined the [[Popular Socialist Party (Brazil)|Popular Socialist Party]], then the party of [[Ciro Gomes]], who was her political idol.

Tapety was also president of the Colônia do Piauí City Council from 2001 to 2002.&lt;ref name="sistemas.aids.gov.br"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mixbrasil.uol.com.br/cultura/especiais/tapety/tapety.asp "Política está no sangue": Conheça Kátia Tapety, a primeira travesti vice-prefeita do Brasil]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Colônia do Piauí, Kátia is officially a public health official, but since she lives in a town of only 7,000 inhabitants, which is embedded in the backlands of the state of Piauí, she is a kind of "do everything." She works as a councilor, midwife, community leader and health agent. Sometimes she also works as a social worker, psychologist, lawyer, driver and even a cowgirl. Its political line, however, is more focused on welfare than on the defense of [[transgender|trans]] or [[homosexuality|homosexuals]]. In 12 years as a councilwoman, she did not want to present any project related to the subject because she believes that she lives in a city of the interior with other problems much more priority, where nobody would be interested in subjects directed to the [[transsexual]]ity and where there are very few transgenders.

The fact that Tapety has entered politics is considered extraordinary, since it opens space for new and future social achievements and citizenship of the transgender. It shows that it is possible for a transgender to exercise her right to citizenship and to live a dignified life, away from stereotypes. Contrary to popular belief, her election also showed that it is a myth that in the large and cosmopolitan Brazilian cities there is less prejudice than in the so-called "country grottoes." The four municipal elections already held in Colônia do Piauí were disputed by Katia, who managed to win all of them. In addition to [[deputy mayor]], she was already councilor for three terms, and one of them assumed the presidency of the [[city hall]]. Her political group has support from various groups in the city, including members of evangelical churches.

In the election of 2008, Tapety applied, obtaining only the substitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tse.gov.br/internet/eleicoes/estatistica2008/est_result/resultadoEleicao.htm TSE - Eleições 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
The dream of politics is to have Tapety's marital union legalized, since she lives with her partner and two children, one adoptive and the other from a previous relationship.

The documentary "De Zé a Kátia", by Karla Holanda, will show the life of Kátia Tapety, the first transgender person elected to public and political office in Brazil. The information about the feature film came to light through the column of the journalist [[Mônica Bergamo]], published in [[Folha]] of October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/819665-documentario-sobre-primeiro-travesti-eleito-para-cargos-publicos-comeca-a-ser-rodado.shtml Folha de S.Paulo  Ilustrada]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1743">In the 1950s, after the [[Nationalist Government (China)|Nationalist government]] fled to [[Taiwan]], [[land reform]] and community development was carried out by the [[Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]]. 

This course of action was made attractive, in part, by the fact that many of the large landowners were [[Japan]]ese who had fled, and the other large landowners were compensated with Japanese commercial and industrial properties seized after Taiwan [[Retrocession Day|reverted]] from [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] in 1945. 

The land program succeeded also because the [[Kuomintang]] were mostly from [[mainland China]] and had few ties to the remaining indigenous landowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landreform.org.tw/html/01.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725231354/http://www.landreform.org.tw/html/01.htm |archivedate=2011-07-25 |trans-title=Land Reform Museum |script-title=zh:土地改革紀念館 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article provides a summary of results for the '''[[general election]]s''' to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of '''[[Newfoundland and Labrador]]''''s [[unicameral]] [[Legislature|legislative body]], the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly]]. The number of seats has varied over time, from a low of twenty-seven for the first election in 1949, to a high of fifty-two during the 1980s and early 1990s. There are currently 40 seats in the house.

The chart on the right shows the information graphically, with the most recent elections on the right. It shows that politics in Newfoundland and Labrador have been dominated by two parties: the [[Newfoundland and Labrador Liberal Party|Liberal party]] (red) and the [[Newfoundland and Labrador Progressive Conservative Party|Conservative party]] (blue).  The Liberal party have won ten out of the seventeen elections held.

This article only covers elections since the province became part of the [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1949. It was then named ''Newfoundland'', and its official name changed to ''Newfoundland and Labrador'' in 2001. Prior to becoming part of Canada, Newfoundland was a [[British dominion]], and the Newfoundland House of Assembly (as it was known before 2001) was first formed in 1832. For elections prior to 1949, see [[General elections in Newfoundland (pre-Confederation)]].

==Summary==
The table below shows the total number of seats won by the major political parties at each election. It also shows the percentage of the vote obtained by the major political parties at each election, if greater than 0.1%. The winning party's totals are shown in bold. To date, there has only been one election (in 1989) where the party that formed the government did not have the largest share of the vote. Full details on any election are linked via the number of the election at the start of the row.

'''M. Thomas Inge''' is an American academic. He is the Robert Emory Blackwell Professor of Humanities at [[Randolph–Macon College]] in [[Ashland, Virginia]], where he teaches, edits, and writes about [[Southern United States literature|Southern literature]] and culture, [[American humor]] and [[Comics|comic art]], film and animation, [[Asian literature]], and [[William Faulkner]].

==Early life==
A native of [[Newport News, Virginia]], he received his B.A. degree in English and Spanish from Randolph-Macon in 1959 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1960 and 1964 respectively.

==Career==
Inge taught at [[Michigan State University]] and then chaired the English departments at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] and [[Clemson University]].

As a senior [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Lecturer]], Inge has taught at the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain (1967–68), at three institutions in [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires, Argentina]] (1971), at [[Moscow State University]] in the former Soviet Union (1979), and at [[Charles University]] in [[Prague|Prague, Czech Republic]] (1994).  As Resident Scholar in American Studies with the [[United States Information Agency|US Information Agency]], a part of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], he lectured and did diplomatic work in eighteen countries from 1982 to 1984 and earned a commendation for distinguished work in the [[Soviet Union]].

Inge has authored or edited over sixty books and has been a pioneer in the development of [[popular culture]] as a legitimate field of academic study.  He was one of the founders of the Popular Culture Association. His three-volume ''Handbook of American Popular Culture'' was cited by the [[American Library Association]] as an outstanding reference work in 1979 and has been issued in revised and expanded editions in 1989 and 2002.  Recent publications include ''William Faulkner: Overlook Illustrated Lives'' (2006), ''The Incredible Mr. Poe: Comic Book Adaptations of the Works of Edgar Allan Poe'' (2008), ''New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, Volume 9: Literature'' (2008), ''My Life with Charlie Brown by Charles M. Schulz'' (2010), and ''The Dixie Limited: Writers on Faulkner and His Influence'' (Spring 2016). The Society for the Study of Southern Literature gave him the Richard Beale Davis Award for Lifetime Contributions to Southern Letters in 2008.  He founded the journal, ''Resources for American Literary Study'', in 1971 and the Southern Studies Forum of the European Association for American Studies in 1995.

Inge was also one of the founders of the American Humor Studies Association and served for four years as Editor of its journal, ''Studies in American Humor''.  His work on humor includes editions of ''Sut Lovingood’s Yarns'' by Tennessee humorist [[George Washington Harris]] (1966, 1967, 1987), the Oxford World Classics edition of [[Mark Twain|Mark Twain’s]] ''A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court'' (1997), and with Ed Piacentino, ''Southern Frontier Humor: An Anthology'' (2010).  Some of his numerous essays on American humor have been collected in his books ''Comics as Culture'' (1990), ''The Frontier Humorists: Critical Views'' (1975), and ''Perspectives on American Culture: Essays on Humor, Literature, and the Popular Arts'' (1994).

==The M. Thomas Inge Papers==
The M. Thomas Inge Papers (in the Comic Arts Collection at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]) includes magazines, catalogs, fanzines, programs and humor publications. This collection is composed of materials collected by Dr. Inge relating to his academic studies of the comic arts, popular culture, and [[American literature]]. The bulk of the collection is dated from the 1950s onward and is made up of many items collected by Inge covering the history of the comic arts. It includes a large collection of published and unpublished materials and ephemera items relating to the comic arts. Manuscripts by Inge and other writers are also included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Virginia Heritage|title=A Guide to the Thomas Inge papers, 1879-2001, collection # M 82|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=vcu-cab/vircu00103.xml|publisher=Special Collections and Archives, James Branch Cabell Library, Virginia Commonwealth University.|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection contains correspondence with a number of noted artists and writers, including [[Art Spiegelman|Art Spieglman]], [[Mort Walker]], Bruce Duncan, and Harold Foster, and comic arts scholars. The collection includes advertisements, fan club materials, posters, art prints, animation cells, comic strip and comic book samples, comic and animation character drinking glasses, numerous buttons, records, and various other collectable items.

The collection is highlighted by a very large collection of reference journals including fanzines, newsletters, journals, and numerous other periodicals related to the comic arts. These periodical titles focus on the history and art of comic books and comic strips, cartoonists, comic book and comic strip characters, animation, and other aspects of the comic arts and popular culture. These materials, and the hundreds of comic books and reference books donated by Dr. Inge, have been incorporated into their own individual collections.

The '''Malaysian Indian Congress''' ('''MIC'''; {{lang-ta|மலேசிய இந்திய காங்கிரஸ்}}; formerly known as '''Malayan Indian Congress''') is a [[Malaysia]]n political party and is one of the founding members of [[Barisan Nasional]], previously known as the Alliance, that was in power from when the country achieved independence in 1957 until the recent 2018 elections. The party was among the first to fight for Malayan Independence and one of the oldest parties in Malaysia.

The MIC was established in August 1946, and has ceased to exist at the end of [[World War II]], to fight for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] from [[British Raj|British colonial rule]]. After [[India]] gained its independence, MIC involved itself in the struggle for the independence of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] (now [[Malaysia]]) which was achieved in 1957. It positioned itself for representation on behalf of the [[India]]n community in the post-war development of the country. The MIC joined the National Alliance comprising the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) and the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA) in 1954 which became the [[Barisan Nasional]] in 1973 with further expansion in the number of component parties.

The party was once the largest party representing the [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] community, but has performed poorly in elections since 2008, with the Indian community mostly voting for the opposition.

== History ==
[[File:Headquarters of MIC.JPG|thumb|MIC Headquarter]]
The Malaysian Indian Congress is one of the oldest political party established in Malaysia. The party founded in year 1946 by [[John Thivy|John A.Thivy]].
At first the party was established to fight for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]].
After India gained independence, the party change its ideology in the course of the continuing struggle of the inter-war tears, to end British Colonial rule, as well as in the need for representation on behalf of Indian community in the post war development of the country.

=== John Thivy era:Indian Nationalist ===
John Thivy met [[Mahatma Gandhi]] at [[London]] while studying for law. He was inspired by Gandhi's ideology and determined for fight for Indian independence. He was actively involved in the Indian nationalist movement when he returned to Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=1j_qCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=MIC+under+John+Thivy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TinaJhXIkG&amp;sig=jG9yPOxM2ZxxOFWgpK7QrvVhPbY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=MIC%20under%20John%20Thivy&amp;f=false |title=From People’s War to People’s Rule: Insurgency, Intervention, and the Lessons of Vietnam|editor=  Timothy J. Lomperis |page=217 |publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press |year= 2000 |isbn=9789971693916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the Malaya Indian Congress (MIC only officially became known as Malaysian Indian Congress, after the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963) in August 1946. The word 'Congress' in the name of Malaysian Indian Congress is taken from the [[Indian National Congress]], the party that Mahatma Gandhi led to fight for Indian independence.

After India gained independence in 1947, Malaysian Indian Congress changed its ideology and started to fight for Malaysian Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com.my/books?id=HphXHA4_sYQC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=MIC+under+John+Thivy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qu8FGMNo-V&amp;sig=6b0U_D3nInoNAq6v9qELZCLK8r4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=MIC%20under%20John%20Thivy&amp;f=false |title=Cage of Freedom: Tamil Identity and the Ethnic Fetish in Malaysia|editor= Andrew C. Willford |page=26 |publisher=NUS Paper |year= 2007 |isbn=9789971693916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Thivy remained as party president for 1946 to 1947.

=== Baba Budh Singh Ji and Ramanathan Era: Fight against Malayan Union and the Federation of Malaya ===
Baba Budh Singh Ji became the 2nd president of MIC. During this time, the sentimental of the party take the path of anti-colonialism. Although majority of Indian support Malayan Union, MIC take the principle not to support Malayan Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mic.org.my/about-us/history&lt;/ref&gt; The Malayan union were withdraw on 1948 and replaced with Federation of Malaya. The MIC later joined the All Malaya Council for Joint Action (AMCJA) under [[Malay titles|Tun]] [[Tan Cheng Lock]] in opposition to the less liberal Federation of Malaya Agreement of 1948.

Third President Mr. K.Ramanathan, realising the ineffectiveness and futility of non-co-operation with the Government when the other major communities represented by UMNO and MCA cooperated, the MIC contested in 1952 Kuala Lumpur Municipal Elections in alliance with the IMP under Dato' Onn bin Jaafar and other non-communal organisations. However the 1952 elections proved the MIC's attempt to preach and practise non-communalism would not prevail in Malayan politics when communalism was the winning factor.

=== K.L. Devaser Era : Joining Alliance Party and focusing on Malayan Independence ===
In 1954 the MIC under its fourth President Mr. K. L. Devaser (1951-1955) became the third partner in the Alliance with UMNO and MCA.And It was during his period that MIC started focusing on the fight for Malayan independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://malaysianindian1.blogspot.my/2008/02/mic-hidden-history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, MIC under K.L Devaser contested in the 1952 Kuala Lumpur Municipal Elections in partnership with the [[Independence of Malaya Party]] under Dato’ Onn bin Jaafar.The election ended with a failure for MIC as their coalition was thrashed by the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance Party]]. The defeat showed MIC that it stood a better chance by joining the ‘Alliance’ as it was the most workable and effective form of political technique in the Malayan context. Thus, in 1954, MIC became the third member of the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance Party]].

According to Rajeswary Ampalavanar, author of ''The Indian Minority and Political Change in Malaya 1954-1957'', the MIC leadership was quite eager to join the Alliance but there was some resistance within the party’s broader membership. They were willing to support the move if the party could secure some concessions from the Alliance on inter-communal issues, particularly on education. From its inception up to this period, the Indian community has been divided.

While K.L. Devaser was quite outspoken, his influence was largely among the urban-based Indian elite, and he lacked wider grassroots support. For the first eight years, the MIC leaders were either of North Indian or Malayalee origin, representing a minority among the Malayan Indians. The majority of Indians (90%) in Malaya at that time were Tamils, mainly the labourers in plantations. Indian plantation workers, the main group of wageworkers in Malaya at the time, experienced enforced segregation because of plantation compound housing. The plantation labour system also worked against the integration of Indian workers into society at large and perpetuated racial and occupational differentiation. For one thing, they were unable to acquire skills that would facilitate their move to betterpaying jobs elsewhere. Migrant plantation workers were therefore marginalised and polarised in Malaya. Their wages in the post World War II era, which were around 50 cents a day, were tied to rubber prices, falling when the rubber price fell, but never rising when prices rose. K.L. Devaser came under heavy criticism from the Tamil media for not addressing the pressing issues facing the community. Some in the party felt that there was a need for a leader with a stronger relationship with the party’s grassroots. In March 1955, reports in the local daily ''Tamil Murasu'' urged Tamils to boycott the MIC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2F2007%2F7%2F16%2Ffocus%2F18293824&amp;sec=focus&lt;/ref&gt; Even in 1955, the Indians clamoured for a change in MIC’s leadership and a change did take place because the president recognised that he had overstayed his welcome and gave way for change.The MIC's main challenge then, was to reconcile the political aspirations of the middle class with the needs of the labour class, who then comprised 84% of the plantation workforce.

=== Sambanthan Era: Becoming Tamil Party ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VTSambanthan.jpg|thumb|Tun V.T. Sambanthan was one of the signatories of the MERDEKA Agreement. He can be rightly called one of the founding fathers of the nation.]] --&gt;
At the Ninth Annual MIC Conference that was held in Teluk Anson (Teluk Intan), Perak in May 1955, Tun V.T. Sambanthan was elected as the fifth President of the Malayan Indian Congress. The MIC's main challenge was to reconcile the political aspirations of the middle class with the poverty and needs of the labouring class, who in 1938 comprised 84% of the plantation labour force. Sambanthan started a recruitment campaign among plantation workers, relying on patronage of Hinduism in its popular South Indian form, increased use and fostering of the Tamil language, and Tamil cultural activities.

But the MIC under Sambanthan failed to reconcile the needs of labour with the political aspirations of the middle class. The traditionalists and the lower middle class strengthened their hold within the party, while the upper-class professionals and the intelligentsia moved away from it. Subsequently, two paths to leadership emerged among the Indians – political and trade union – with very little interaction between them.

Under Sambanthan's leadership, the MIC effectively became a Tamil party. Sambanthan served as president of the MIC from 1955–71 and was largely responsible for the transformation of the party from an active, political organisation to a conservative, traditional one, emphasising Indian culture, religion and language.

It was also the weakest of the three main political parties. It had the smallest electorate – 7.4% in 1959; and it had little support from the Indian community at large.

Since the Indian community was geographically dispersed and divided, it comprised less than 25% in any constituency. Therefore, the MIC's over-riding concern was to remain a partner in the Alliance (the UMNO-MCA-MIC Alliance that had won the first elections in 1955, and that was subsequently renamed Barisan Nasional) and obtain whatever concessions it could from the dominant UMNO. In the process, political and economic rights of workers were sacrificed.

Sambanthan, while as MIC president, helped strengthen the party economically by selling about half of his father's 2.4&amp;nbsp;km² rubber estate to help the Indian community as well as to provide financial strength to the party coffers.

Sambanthan took over the mantle of the MIC during a period of turmoil in the party in 1955, barely months before the first federal elections, and over time strengthened the party and consolidated its position in the coalition. He did not always please his members but was able to gradually unite a party that had considerable internal splits.

=== Manickavasagam Era: Infusing new blood and Blue Book ===
Manickavasagam became president of MIC as a result of increased resistance of the grassroot members to Tun V.T. Sambanthan's style of leadership. As president of the party for 18 years, some felt Sambanthan had overstayed his welcome and wanted change.

Under Manickavasagam's leadership, the MIC was put on a strong footing with buildings, offices and staff in various parts of the country and the party system organised and its capacity to deal with issues enhanced.

It was during this period that the MIC, as member of the Alliance, became part of the [[Barisan Nasional]]. The party sponsored the Nesa Multipurpose Cooperative and the MIC Unit Trust as part of its programme for economic ventures, and also set up the MIC Education Fund for members' children and the Malaysian Indian Scholarship Fund for higher education as well as acquiring an Institute for training Indians in technical and trade skills. Manickavasagam had a vision for the Malaysian Indian community. He organised the First Indian Economic Seminar and as a result the Blue Book came about. It was a development plan for the economic growth of the Indian community.The Blue Book was an orchestrated effort of a think-tank of top Indian business, political and education leaders collaborating to augment the future of the Malaysian Indian community. Maika Holdings and Maju Institute of Education and Development (MIED) and others are a direct result of the Blue Book.

When Manickavasagam became president of the Malaysian Indian Congress, he decided to introduce new faces to the party in leadership positions. This was the time when Datuk S. Subramaniam, Datuk K. Pathmanaban, a Harvard MBA holder, and several others entered the political arena to infuse new blood into MIC, and Manickavasagam gave them preference. They were young, well-educated and ambitious but lacked grassroots experience.

This made Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu, who was then MIC vice-president, bitter as he felt he was being sidelined. Samy Vellu was one of the five leaders who dared defy former president Tun V.T. Sambanthan and propel Manickavasagam to the presidency of the party. Subramaniam, then the secretary general of MIC, was hand-picked by Manickavasagam to become deputy president and succeed him. However, Samy Vellu fought back, literally, and in the 1977 party elections he managed to beat Subramaniam by a mere 26 votes to become the Deputy President of MIC.

== Party achievement ==
=== Education welfare ===
More than 10,000 students have obtained loans and scholarships totalling about RM60mil in the past 20 years from the Maju Institute of Education Development (MIED) fund, the education arm the MIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mied.com.my/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716224251/http://www.mied.com.my/index.php |archivedate=16 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medicare Part D''', also called the '''Medicare prescription drug benefit''', is an optional [[United States]] federal-government program to help [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] beneficiaries pay for self-administered [[prescription drug]]s through prescription drug insurance premiums (the cost of almost all professionally administered prescriptions is covered under optional Part B of United States Medicare).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirchhoff |first1=Suzanne M. |title=Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefit |date=August 13, 2018 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |location=Washington, DC |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40611.pdf |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part D was originally proposed by President Clinton in 2000 and enacted as part of the [[Medicare Modernization Act]] of 2003 (which also made changes to the public Part C Medicare health plan program) and went into effect on January 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/|title=Overview|date=9 February 2018|website=www.cms.hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program specifics ==

=== Eligibility and enrollment ===
Individuals on Medicare are eligible for prescription drug coverage under a Part D plan if they are signed up for benefits under Medicare Part A and/or Part B. Beneficiaries obtain the Part D drug benefit through two types of plans administered by private insurance companies: the beneficiaries can join a standalone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) for drug coverage only or they can join a public Part C health plan that jointly covers all hospital and medical services covered by Medicare Part A and Part B at a minimum, and typically covers additional healthcare costs not covered by Medicare Parts A and B including prescription drugs (MA-PD).&lt;ref name="KFF Medicare Primer"&gt;[http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7615-03.pdf "Medicare: A Primer,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612231557/http://kff.org/medicare/upload/7615-03.pdf |date=2010-06-12 }} [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; (NOTE: Medicare beneficiaries need to be signed up for both Parts A and B to select Part C whereas they need only A or B to select Part D.) 

About two-thirds of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled directly in Part D or get Part-D-like benefits through a public Part C Medicare health plan.&lt;ref name="KFF spotlight 2009"&gt;Jack Hoadley, Juliette Cubanski, Elizabeth Hargrave, Laura Summer, and Tricia Neuman, [http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7986.pdf "Medicare Part D Spotlight: Part D Plan Availability in 2010 and Key Changes Since 2006,"] [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Another large group of Medicare beneficiaries get prescription drug coverage under plans offered by former employers or through the Veterans Administration. It is also possible that a former employer or union might sponsor a Part D plan for former employees/members (such plans are called Employer Group Waiver Plans).

Medicare beneficiaries can enroll directly through the plan's administrator, or indirectly via an insurance broker or the exchange -- called Medicare Plan Finder -- run by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) for this purpose; the beneficiary's benefits and any additional assistance payments and rights are the same regardless of enrollment channel. Beneficiaries already on a plan can choose a different plan or drop Part C/D during the annual enrollment period or during other times during the year. For some time, the annual enrollment period has lasted from October 15 to December 7 of each year but that is changing for Part C in 2019.&lt;ref name="KFF Medicare Primer" /&gt; Low-income seniors on Social Security Extra Help/LIS and many middle-income seniors on state pharmaceutical assistance programs can choose a different plan or drop Part C/D (or join Part C/D plan for that matter) as often as once a month. Other special enrollment circumstances apply.

Medicare beneficiaries who were eligible for but did not enroll in a Part D when they were first eligible and later want to enroll, pay a late-enrollment penalty, basically a premium surtax, if they did not have acceptable coverage through another source such as an employer or the [[U.S. Veterans Administration]]. This penalty is equal to 1% of the national premium index times the number of full calendar months that they were eligible for but not enrolled in Part D and did not have creditable coverage through another source. The penalty raises the premium of Part D for beneficiaries, when and if they elect coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://questions.medicare.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/2255/~/late-enrollment-penalty-%28lep%29 "Medicare Support Center: Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP),"] Oct. 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://refillreport.com/articles/avoiding-the-part-d-penalty/ "Refill Report: Understanding &amp; Avoiding Late Enrollment Penalty"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012183511/https://refillreport.com/articles/avoiding-the-part-d-penalty/ |date=2016-10-12 }} Dec. 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, enrollment exceeded 44 million, including both those on standalone Part D and those enrolled in Part C plan (which includes Part-D-like coverage). About 20% of those beneficiaries are on a EGWP drug plan where a former employer receives a Part D subsidy on his or her behalf. The latter two groups lack the same freedom of choice that the standalone Part D group has because they must use the Part D plan chosen by the Part C plan's administrator or their former employer.

As of May 2018, over 700 drug plan contracts had been signed between CMS and administrators, which in turn means multiple thousand plans because administrators can vary plans by county. Individual counties might have as few as three to as many 30 plans from which beneficiaries can choose. This allows participants to choose a plan that best meets their individual needs. Although the number of plans available has been trending down since the inception of the program, almost all counties offer many choices.

Plan administrators are required to offer  a plan with at least the "standard" minimum benefit or one that is actuarially equivalent to the standard, and they may also offer plans with more generous benefits (e.g., no deductible during the initial spend phase). The terms "standard," "actuarially equivalent," and "more generous" relate to the plan's deductible/co-pay/formulary/"donut-hole" (see Note)/pharmacy-preference aspects and has no direct relevance to the beneficiary other than increasing or decreasing personal choice. Each plan is approved by the CMS before being marketed. 

(NOTE: It is often said the donut hole will be eliminated; that is not technically true. The "donut hole" is also called the gap phase of spending; at one time the co-pay in the gap was 100%. As of 2019, the "standard" co-pay in the gap will be 25%, the same as in the initial spend phase. It is also important to note that relatively few people as a percent of the total number of people on Medicare are ever financially affected by either the donut hole or catastrophic phases of spending.) 

Medicare offers an interactive online tool called the Medicare Plan Finder&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx|title=Medicare Plan Finder for Health, Prescription Drug and Medigap plans|website=www.medicare.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows for comparison of coverage and costs for all plans in a geographic area. The tool lets users enter a list of medications along with pharmacy preferences and Social-Security-Extra-Help/LIS and related status. The Finder can show the beneficiary's total annual costs for each plan along with a detailed breakdown of the plans' monthly premiums, deductibles and prices for each drug during each phase of spending (initial, gap, catastrophic). Plans are required to update this site with current prices and formulary information every other week throughout the year.

=== Costs to beneficiaries ===

==== Beneficiary cost sharing (deductibles, coinsurance, etc.) ====
The [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Modernization Act]] (MMA) established a standard drug benefit that all Part D plans must offer. The standard benefit is defined in terms of the benefit structure and without mandating the drugs that must be covered. For example, in 2013, the standard benefit required payment by the beneficiary of a $325 deductible, then required 25% coinsurance payment by the beneficiary of drug costs up to an initial coverage limit of $2,970 (the full retail cost of prescriptions). Once this initial coverage limit is reached, the beneficiary had to pay the full cost of his/her prescription drugs up until the total [[out-of-pocket expenses]] reached $4,750 (excluding premiums and any expense paid by the insurance company) minus a 52.5% discount in this gap, referred to as the "[[Donut Hole (Medicare)|Donut Hole]]". Once the beneficiary reaches the Out-of-Pocket Threshold, he/she becomes eligible for catastrophic coverage. During catastrophic coverage, he or she pays the greater of 5% coinsurance, or $2.65 for generic drugs and $6.60 for brand-name drugs. The catastrophic coverage amount is calculated on a yearly basis and a beneficiary who reaches catastrophic coverage by the end of the benefit year will start his or her deductible anew at the beginning of the next benefit year. Although uncommon, not all benefit years coincide with the calendar year.&lt;ref name="KFF Medicare Primer" /&gt; The donut-hole and catastrophic-coverage thresholds dropped slightly in 2014.

The standard benefit is not the most common benefit mix offered by Part D plans. Only 11% of plans in 2010 offered the defined standard benefit described above. Plans vary widely in formularies and cost-sharing. Most eliminate the deductible and use tiered drug co-payments rather than coinsurance.&lt;ref name="KFF Medicare Primer" /&gt; The only out-of-pocket costs that count toward getting out of the coverage gap and into catastrophic coverage are True Out-Of-Pocket (TrOOP) expenditures. TrOOP expenditures accrue only when drugs on plan's formulary are purchased in accordance with the restrictions on those drugs. Monthly premium payments do not count towards TrOOP.

Under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010, the effect of the "Donut Hole" coverage gap was to be gradually reduced through a combination of measures including brand-name prescription drug discounts, generic drug discounts and a gradual increase in the percentage of out-of-pocket costs covered while in the donut hole. The "Donut Hole" will continue to exist after 2020 but its effect will be changed in some way yet to be determined, because plan  administrators must treat out of pocket costs below the catastrophic level the same whether or not the insured is in the donut hole or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myhealthcafe.com/healthcare-reform-the-doughnut-hole-and-me-part-ii Healthcare Reform: The Doughnut Hole and Me (Part II)], MyHealthCafe.com.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, under the "standard benefit" design all prescriptions in all tiers could be subject to a 25% co-pay whereas as of 2014 hundreds of drugs in Tier 1 are available with no co-pay.

Most plans use specialty drug tiers, and some have a separate benefit tier for injectable drugs.  Beneficiary cost sharing can be higher for drugs in these tiers.&lt;ref name="kff_2008"&gt;{{citation |author1=Elizabeth Hargrave |author2=Jack Hoadley |author3=Katie Merrelli |author4= Juliette Cubansk |url=http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7711.pdf |format=PDF |title=Medicare Part D 2008 Data Spotlight: Specialty tiers |work=The Kaiser Family Foundation |date=December 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Beneficiary premiums ====
The average (weighted) monthly premium paid by the beneficiary for PDPs was $35.09 in 2009, which is an increase from $29.89 in 2008. Premiums were projected to increase to $38.94 for 2010 as well.&lt;ref name="KFF spotlight 2009" /&gt; In 2014, the average is around $30 a month. The average premium is a misleading statistic because it averages the premiums offered, not the premiums paid. Most insurers offer a very low-cost plan (e.g., $15 a month) that few choose. This lowers the average, but does not reflect what is happening in the market.

In 2007, 8% of beneficiaries enrolled in a PDP chose one with some gap coverage. Among beneficiaries in MA-PD plans, enrollment in plans offering gap coverage was 33% (up from 27% in 2006).&lt;ref name="The Coverage Gap - 2008"&gt;Jack Hoadley, Jennifer Thompson, Elizabeth Hargrave, Katie Merrell, Juliette Cubanski and Tricia Neuman [http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7707.pdf "MEDICARE PART D 2008 DATA SPOTLIGHT: The Coverage Gap,"] [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Premiums are significantly higher for plans with gap coverage. These plans are becoming less common as the gap closes. The fact that beneficiaries on Social Security Extra Help/LIS were never affected by the gap and the fact that many state pharmaceutical assistance programs protected middle income seniors in the gap are the reasons this gap benefit was never especially popular.

Major Part D plan sponsors are dropping their more expensive options, and developing lower-cost ones.&lt;ref name="kff_2007"&gt;{{citation |author2=Elizabeth Hargrave |author1=Jack Hoadley |author3=Katie Merrelli |author4= Juliette Cubansk |author5= Tricia Neumani |url=http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7706.pdf |format=PDF |title=Medicare Part D 2008 Data Spotlight: Premiums |work=The Kaiser Family Foundation |date=November 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Low-income subsidies and middle-income help ===
One option for those struggling with drug costs is the low-income subsidy. Beneficiaries with income below 150% of the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] are eligible for the low-income subsidy, which helps pay for all or part of the monthly premium, annual deductible and co-pays. CMS estimated that 12.5 million Part D beneficiaries were eligible for low-income subsidies in 2009.&lt;ref name="KFF Medicare Primer" /&gt;

The subsidy award is given a level with the following effects for the 2013 benefit year:{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Probably the most important benefits of Social Security Extra Help/LIS other than "free" is the fact that the beneficiary has no exposure to "donut hole" costs and can change plans monthly. In addition, in many states, state pharmaceutical assistance programs provide similar protection in the gap to middle-income seniors and allow beneficiaries to change plans one other time during the year in addition to the annual enrollment/re-enrollment period.

=== Excluded drugs ===
While CMS does not have an established formulary, Part D drug coverage excludes drugs not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], those prescribed for [[off-label use]], drugs not available by prescription for purchase in the United States, and drugs for which payments would be available under Part B.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/Downloads/PartBandPartDdoc_07.27.05.pdf Relationship between Part B and Part D Coverage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203004747/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/Downloads/PartBandPartDdoc_07.27.05.pdf |date=2007-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part D coverage excludes drugs or classes of drugs that may be excluded from [[Medicaid]] coverage. These may include:
* Drugs used for [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[weight loss]], or [[weight gain]]
* Drugs used to promote [[fertility]]
* Drugs used for [[erectile dysfunction]]
* Drugs used for cosmetic purposes (hair growth, etc.)
* Drugs used for the symptomatic relief of cough and colds
* Prescription vitamin and mineral products, except [[prenatal vitamins]] and fluoride preparations
* Drugs where the manufacturer requires as a condition of sale any associated tests or monitoring services to be purchased exclusively from that manufacturer or its designee

While these drugs are excluded from basic Part D coverage, drug plans can include them as a supplemental benefit, provided they otherwise meet the definition of a Part D drug. However plans that cover excluded drugs are not allowed to pass on those costs to Medicare, and plans are required to repay CMS if they are found to have billed Medicare in these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region6/60600022.pdf|title=Report on the Medicare Drug Discount Card Program Sponsor McKesson Health Solutions, A-06-06-00022&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part D plans may cover all [[benzodiazepine]]s and those [[barbiturate]]s used in the treatment of [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]] or a chronic health disorder. These two drug classes were originally excluded, until their reassignment in 2008 by the [[Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008|Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act]].

=== Plan formularies ===
Part D plans are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicareadvocacy.org/medicare-info/medicare-part-d/#covered%20drugs Medicare Part D / Prescription Drug Benefits: PART D COVERED DRUGS], medicareadvocacy.org&lt;/ref&gt; They establish their own formularies, or list of covered drugs for which they will make payment, as long as the formulary and benefit structure are not found by CMS to discourage enrollment by certain Medicare beneficiaries. Part D plans that follow the formulary classes and categories established by the United States [[Pharmacopoeia]] will pass the first discrimination test. Plans can change the drugs on their formulary during the course of the year with 60 days' notice to affected parties.

The Plan's tiered co-pay amounts for each drug only generally apply during the initial period before the coverage gap.

The primary differences between the formularies of different Part D plans relate to the coverage of brand-name drugs. 

Typically, each Plan's formulary is organized into tiers, and each tier is associated with a set co-pay amount. Most formularies have between 3 and 5 tiers. The lower the tier, the lower the co-pay. For example, Tier 1 might include all of the Plan's preferred generic drugs, and each drug within this tier might have a co-pay of $5 to $10 per prescription. Tier 2 might include the Plan's preferred brand drugs with a co-pay of $40 to $50, while Tier 3 may be reserved for non-preferred brand drugs which are covered by the plan at a higher co-pay, perhaps $70 to $100. Tiers 4 and higher typically contain [[Specialty drugs in the United States|specialty drugs]], which have the highest co-pays because they are generally more expensive. By 2011 in the United States a growing number of Medicare Part D health insurance plans had added the [[specialty drugs|specialty tier]].&lt;ref name="uthsc_2011"&gt;{{cite thesis | url=http://etd.uthsc.edu/WORLD-ACCESS/Elias/2011-030-Elias.pdf | title=Analysis of out-of-pocket expenditures of oral oncologics for Tennessee recipients of Medicare Part D | date=May 2011 | accessdate=17 October 2015 | author=Elias,  Eve Carolyn | pages=54 | work=The University of Tennessee | series=Master of Science | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131002221/http://etd.uthsc.edu/WORLD-ACCESS/Elias/2011-030-Elias.pdf | archivedate=31 January 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

=== Beneficiary support ===
CMS funds a national program of counselors to assist all Medicare beneficiaries, including duals, with their plan choices. The program is called State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/contacts/staticpages/ships.aspx|title=State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Programs (SHIPs)|work=Medicare.gov|publisher=[[Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007210145/http://www.medicare.gov/Contacts/staticpages/ships.aspx|archive-date=7 October 2010|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Medicare Part D was originally proposed by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000. It was based on earlier proposals developed by Congresswoman [[Nancy Pelosi]] and Senator [[Tom Daschle]]. These late-1990s/2000 proposals -- with the exception of the spend phase structure but including the fact that Medicare itself would not do the negotiating -- are substantially the same as the current Part D.

At the start of the program in January 2006, it was expected that eleven million people would be covered by Medicare Part D; of those, six million would be dual eligible. About two million people who were covered by employers would likely lose their employee benefits.

As of January 30, 2007, nearly 24 million individuals were receiving prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D (PDPs and MA-PDs combined), according to CMS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=2079&amp;intNumPerPage=10&amp;checkDate=&amp;checkKey=&amp;srchType=&amp;numDays=3500&amp;srchOpt=0&amp;srchData=&amp;keywordType=All&amp;chkNewsType=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5&amp;intPage=&amp;showAll=&amp;pYear=&amp;year=&amp;desc=&amp;cboOrder=date "MEDICARE DRUG PLANS STRONG AND GROWING,"] [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) Press Release, Tuesday, January 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare offers other methods of receiving drug coverage, including the [[Retiree Drug Subsidy]]. Federal retiree programs such as [[TRICARE]] and [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program]] (FEHBP) or alternative sources, such as the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]. Including people in these categories, more than 39 million Americans are covered for prescriptions by the federal government.

A survey released by [[AARP]] in November 2007 found that 85% of enrollees reported satisfaction with their drug plan, and 78% said that they had made a good choice in selecting their plan.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa A. Keenan, [http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/health/rx_medicared.pdf "Prescription Drugs and Medicare Part D: A Report on Access, Satisfaction, and Cost,"] [[AARP]], November 2007 ([http://www.aarp.org/research/press-center/presscurrentnews/aarp_survey_finds_medicare_drug_plans_are_prescrip.html News Release: AARP Survey Finds Medicare Drug Plans are Prescription for Healthy Drug Behaviors])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program costs ==
As of the end of 2008, the average annual per beneficiary cost spending for Part D was $1,517,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2009.pdf 2009 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARDS OF TRUSTEES OF THE FEDERAL HOSPITAL INSURANCE AND FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTARY MEDICAL INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS], Table II.B1.—Medicare Data for Calendar Year 2008, Page 5 (Page 11 in pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; making the total expenditures of the program for 2008 $49.3 billion.

From a budget perspective, Part D is effectively three different programs. Based on 2012 budget numbers:
* About $26 billion is spent for the about 10 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries (20% of those on Medicare) mentioned above and the drug costs of  some of the people on Part C. This expense was previously (before Part D) mostly covered by Medicaid, the Veteran's Health Administration and state pharmaceutical assistance programs.
* About $20 billion is premium support that allows about 10 million middle-income Medicare beneficiaries and the rest of the people on Part C (about half of those on Medicare altogether) get drug coverage. After the first five years of Part D, government-accountability-office research shows that this expense in the Part D budget appeared to be holding down other Medicare costs related to provider services. The middle-income portion of the Part D program may actually pay for itself in the long term.
* About $13 billion of the Part D budget covers re-insurance for catastrophic drug costs as described above. Part D pays 95% of costs over about $6,000 out of pocket a year at retail. This part of the budget helps about 1% of the people on Medicare who are very ill.

==Cost utilization==
''Medicare Part D Cost Utilization Measures'' refer to limitations placed on medications covered in a specific insurer's formulary for a plan. Cost utilization consists of techniques that attempt to reduce insurer costs. The three main cost utilization measures are quantity limits, prior authorization and step therapy.

Quantity limits refer to the maximum amount of a medication that may be dispensed during a given calendar period. For example, a plan may dictate that it will cover 90 pills of a given drug within a 30-day period.

A prior authorization requirement requires a health care worker to receive formal approval from a plan before it agrees to cover a specific prescription. It may be used by insurers for drugs that are often misused. Prior authorization helps ensure that patients receive correct medications.

[[Step therapy]] is a process in which a plan requires an individual to try, and prove ineffective, one or more specified lower-cost drugs before a higher-cost drug in the same therapeutic class is approved.

== Implementation issues ==
* Plan and Health Care Provider goal alignment: PDP's and MA's are rewarded for focusing on low-cost drugs to all beneficiaries, while providers are rewarded for quality of care – sometimes involving expensive technologies.
* Conflicting goals: Plans are required to have a tiered exemptions process for beneficiaries to get a higher-tier drug at a lower cost, but plans must grant medically-necessary exceptions. However, the rule denies beneficiaries the right to request a tiering exception for certain high-cost drugs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
* Lack of standardization: Because each plan can design their formulary and tier levels, drugs appearing on Tier 2 in one plan may be on Tier 3 in another plan. Co-pays may vary across plans. Some plans have no deductibles and the coinsurance for the most expensive drugs varies widely. Some plans may insist on step therapy, which means that the patient must use generics first before the company will pay for higher-priced drugs. Patients can appeal and insurors are required to respond within a short timeframe, so as to not further the burden on the patient.
* Standards for [[electronic prescribing]] for Medicare Part D conflict with regulations in many U.S. states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = Preventing Medication Errors | last = The Institute of Medicine | journal = The National Academies Press | url = http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309101476/html/298.html | accessdate = 2006-07-21 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--additional clarification required--&gt;

== Impact on beneficiaries ==
A 2008 study found that the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries who reported forgoing medications due to cost dropped with Part D, from 15.2% in 2004 and 14.1% in 2005 to 11.5% in 2006.  The percentage who reported skipping other basic necessities to pay for drugs also dropped, from 10.6% in 2004 and 11.1% in 2005 to 7.6% in 2006.  The very sickest beneficiaries reported no reduction, but fewer reported forgoing other necessities to pay for medicine.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;Amanda Gardner, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/22/AR2008042201959.html "Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Shows Mixed Results,"] [[The Washington Post]], April 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne M. Madden et al., [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/299/16/1922 "Cost-Related Medication Nonadherence and Spending on Basic Needs Following Implementation of Medicare Part D,"] [[Journal of the American Medical Association]], 2008;299(16):1922–1928&lt;/ref&gt;

A parallel study found that Part D beneficiaries skip doses or switch to cheaper drugs and that many do not understand the program.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Another study found that Part D resulted in modest increases in average drug utilization and decreases in average out-of-pocket expenditures. &lt;ref&gt;Yin W, Basu A, Zhang J, Rabbani A, Meltzer DO, Alexander GC, "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2533371 The Effect of the Medicare Part D Prescription Benefit on Drug Utilization and Expenditures]"&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies by the same group of researchers found that the net impact among beneficiaries was a decrease in the use of generic drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang J, Yin W, Sun S, Alexander GC.

Journal of General Internal Medicine. 2008;23:1673-1678.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further study concludes that although a substantial reduction in out-of-pocket costs and a moderate increase in utilization among Medicare beneficiaries during the first year after Part D, there was no evidence of improvement in emergency department use, hospitalizations, or preference-based health utility for those eligible for Part D during its first year of implementation.&lt;ref name=liu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=FX|author2=Alexander GC |author3=Crawford SY |author4=Pickard AS |author5=Hedeker D |author6=Walton SM |title=The impact of Medicare Part D on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, medication utilization, health resource utilization, and preference-based health utility|journal=Health Services Research|date=August 2011|volume=46|issue=4|pages=1104–1123|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2011.01273.x|pmid=21609328|pmc=3165180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that there were no significant changes in trends in the dual eligibles' out-of-pocket expenditures, total monthly expenditures, pill-days, or total number of prescriptions due to Part D.&lt;ref name=basu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basu|first=A|author2=Yin W |author3=Alexander GC |title=Impact of Medicare Part D on Medicare-Medicaid dual-eligible beneficiaries' prescription utilization and expenditures.|journal=Health Services Research|date=February 2010|volume=45|series=1|pages=133–151|pmid=20002765|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.01065.x|issue=1|pmc=2813441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimating how much money could be saved if Medicare had been allowed to negotiate drug prices, economist [[Dean Baker]] gives a "most conservative high-cost scenario" of $332 billion between 2006 and 2013 (approximately $50 billion a year). Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] in his book entitled ''[[The Price of Inequality]]'' estimated a "middle-cost scenario" of $563 billion in savings "for the same budget window".&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stiglitz, Joseph E. |title=The Price of Inequality |isbn= 978-0393345063 |publisher=W.W.

Former Congressman [[Billy Tauzin]], R–La., who steered the bill through the House, retired soon after and took a $2 million a year job as president of [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA), the main industry [[lobbying]] group.

In response, free-market [[think tank]] [[Manhattan Institute]] issued a report by professor Frank Lichtenberg that said the VA National Formulary excludes many new drugs. Only 38% of drugs approved in the 1990s and 19% of the drugs approved since 2000 were on the formulary.{{Cn|date=March 2018}}

In 2012, the plan required Medicare beneficiaries whose total drug costs reach $2,930 to pay 100% of prescription costs until $4,700 is spent out of pocket.  (The actual threshold amounts change year-to-year and plan-by-plan, and many plans offered limited coverage during this phase.) While this coverage gap does not affect the majority of program participants, about 25% of beneficiaries enrolled in standard plans find themselves in this gap.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Y, Donohue JM, Newhouse JP, Lave JR. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2859617/ The effects of the coverage gap on drug spending: a closer look at Medicare Part D]. Health Affairs.  2009 Mar-Apr;28(2):w317-25.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a candidate, [[Barack Obama]] proposed "closing the 'doughnut hole'" and subsequently proposed a plan to reduce costs for recipients from 100% to 50% of these expenses.&lt;ref name="aarpA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.aarp.org/yourhealth/medicare/articles/obama_reveals_plans.html|title=Obama Unveils 'Doughnut Hole' Solution: People who fall in the Part D coverage gap would only pay half the cost of brand-name medications|publisher=AARP Bulletin Today|date=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the plan would be borne by drug manufacturers for name-brand drugs and by the government for generics.&lt;ref name="aarpA" /&gt;

{{Politics of South Korea}}
South Korea's '''Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism''' (MCST) is a central government agency responsible for the areas of tourism, culture, art, religion, and sports. It has two vice ministers, three assistant ministers, one commission, and over 60 divisions.  The first Minister of Culture was novelist [[Lee O-young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lee O Young |work=Korean Literature Now |publisher=Literature Translation Institute of Korea |url=http://koreanliteraturenow.com/%EC%9E%91%EA%B0%80/lee-o-young }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsidiary entities such as the National Museum, the National Theater, and the National Library are under the Ministry.  

The headquarters are located in the Sejong Government Complex in [[Sejong City]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mcst.go.kr/english/ministry/location/location.jsp Location]."

==Goals==
The main goals of the MCST are:
*To educate [[Korean people|Korean]] people to be cultured and creative citizens
*To create a society in which leisure and work are in harmony
*To create a dynamic nation in which various local cultures are represented
*To enhance public awareness of the national agenda (e.g. green growth) through public relations activities
*To improve quality of life for citizens by supporting cultural events and activities, sports, tourism, and religious activities

==History==
The Ministry of Culture and Tourism was originally a suborganization of [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|the Ministry of Education]] created in 1948. Later, the Ministry of Transportation set up a tourism department. The Ministry of Information was set up in 1961 for administration of art and cultural affairs. The Ministry of Culture and Information became the Ministry of Culture in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;The ministry was established on 3 January 1990 by Presidential Decree Number 12895. {{Cite web|title=About MCST: History |publisher=Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism |url=http://mcst.go.kr/english/ministry/history/history4.jsp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804035634/http://mcst.go.kr/english/ministry/history/history4.jsp |archive-date=4 August 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the Ministry of Culture was integrated with the Ministry of Youth and Sports to become the Ministry of Culture and Sports. In 1998, as part of government reorganization efforts, the Ministry of Culture and Sports was replaced by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. It was created to invest in and support the entertainment industry, as Korea needed new areas of growth in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

President Kim Dae Jung put forth industrial policies supporting entertainment with the same regard as traditional industrial sectors such as manufacturing. Investments were made in both infrastructure and technology to support K-Pop, including concert halls and visual effects technology. In addition, government regulation of karaoke bars favored K-Pop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title=How the South Korean Government Made K-Pop a Thing |publisher=National Public Radio (NPR) |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/04/13/399414351/how-the-south-korean-government-made-k-pop-a-thing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, there has been a focus on developing soft power; the Ministry believes that by promoting Korean culture abroad, exports of other goods and services will also increase. As part of those efforts to move beyond developing a domestic industry and toward international success, the Ministry established an advisory committee and announced an international training school. Direct financial support of artists increased. In 2013, the Ministry allocated 319 billion won (280 million USD) for direct support of Hallyu (Korean Wave). Cultural exports increased at a annual rate of 10 percent as a result of these efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-11-30/how-korean-bureaucrats-turned-k-pop-national-symbol |year=2013 |title=How Korean Bureaucrats Turned K-Pop into a National Symbol |publisher=PRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean Culture and Information Service==
{{main|Korean Culture and Information Service}}
The [[Korean Culture and Information Service]] is a department of the MCST that aims to bring Korean culture closer to the rest of the world while improving the national image of Korea. It is also responsible for setting up more than 20 Korean Cultural Centers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greetings from the Director|url=http://www.kocis.go.kr/eng/main.do#|publisher=Korean Culture and Information Service|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Despite the large amounts of money the government provides for Hallyu, the K-Pop industry, the most internationally well-known part of Hallyu has criticized the Ministry's efforts. Many industries such as fashion and food have lobbied the government for inclusion in the Hallyu budget, and politicians and the bureaucracy also have varying interests in how the budget is distributed. Despite popular internet speculation on the Korean government’s financial support for the promotion of K-Pop, there are no figures to substantiate the speculation.  In 2013 of the $230 million allocated for Hallyu there are itemized contributions to the promotion of the Korean language, culture and food but no known figures for allocations directly to K-Pop.  Independent of financial support in recent years the Ministry has been successful in reversing decades-long governmental policy of suppressing and jailing pop and gayo artists in favor of supporting K-Pop as a driver of Hallyu overseas.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cross-currents.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/e-journal/articles/oh_lee_0.pdf |year=2013 |title=K-Pop in Korea: How the Pop Music Industry is Changing a Post-Developmental Society |publisher=Cross Currents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10571">The '''National Union Government''' was a form of [[Central government|national government]] that governed the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] between 1945 and 13 February 1947, in the direct aftermath of the [[Second World War]].  During the war, Luxembourg was invaded, occupied, and annexed by [[Nazi Germany]].  Just one of the Luxembourgish casualties of the conflict was the pre-war political system; most of the established parties and alliances disappeared, and some of the leading politicians had lost their lives.

==Background==
After the liberation of the Grand Duchy in 1944, a temporary government comprising the [[Christian Social People's Party|CSV]] and the [[Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party|LSAP]], dubbed the '' '[[Liberation Government (Luxembourg)|Liberation Government]]' '', took office.  No election had been held and no Chamber of Deputies was in place, so there was no need for this government to seek a broad-based legislative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Thewes (2003), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after the war was concluded, Luxembourg returned to political chicanery.  [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1945|Legislative elections]] were held on 21 October 1945, and all four parties won over 5 seats and 10% of the vote each: the CSV, LSAP, [[Group for Patriotism and Democracy|GD]], and [[Communist Party of Luxembourg|KPL]].  However, the CSV came just short of an absolute majority, winning 25 seats out of 51.&lt;ref name="Thewes 2003, p. 123"&gt;Thewes (2003), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forming the government==
Atypically, [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte]] decided to intervene in the political sphere, and asked CSV leader [[Pierre Dupong]] (who had been Prime Minister since 1937) to form a broader based coalition than Dupong had organised behind his Liberation Government.  On 14 November, Dupong invited all four parties in the Chamber of Deputies to unite in his National Union Government.  Dupong also included the only independent candidate in the cabinet.&lt;ref name="Thewes 2003, p. 123"/&gt;  As a result, all 51 Deputies were taking the government [[whip (politics)|whip]].

The new government had much work to do, and, with no opposition in the legislature, was capable of instituting any plan, provided that the parties could agree policy between themselves.  The departmental briefs were handed to cabinet members based upon personal preference.  The composition of the first cabinet was:

==Governing the country==
With each member virtually free to decide departmental policy by himself, each took it upon himself to push forward his own pet projects.  The CSV pushed for the annexation of those Luxembourgish territories lost to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name="Thewes 2003, p. 124"&gt;Thewes (2003), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  The LSAP ordered the [[nationalisation]] of the railways.  The KPL sought to create a [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name="Thewes 2003, p. 124"/&gt;  This system of reign by ministerial diktat was not without its draw-backs.

The arrangement distanced the government from the population, which was forced to accept the patchwork of policies, even though over 40% of Luxembourgers had cast their vote for the CSV.  Dupong had been revered as the leader of Luxembourg's [[government in exile]], but his government was fomenting resentment.  On 2 August 1946, four officers were arrested for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government.  Although they were released without charge, it sent a clear message to the government.&lt;ref name="Thewes 2003, p. 126"&gt;Thewes (2003), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, ideological differences were forcing the government partners apart.  The cabinet divided along ideological lines in exactly the manner that the National Union Government was supposed to prevent.  Dupong took exception to the LSAP's plans for the railways, whilst the KPL and LSAP attempted to distance themselves from the CSV's [[irredentism]].&lt;ref name="Thewes 2003, p. 126"/&gt;

Charles Marx died on 13 June 1946 and was replaced by fellow Communist Party member [[Dominique Urbany]] eight days later.  In addition, on 29 August, the cabinet was reshuffled, with the independent [[Guillaume Konsbruck]] replaced by [[Lambert Schaus]], a CSV member.&lt;ref name="Thewes 2003, p. 123"/&gt;  From that date, the cabinet was:

=== Gomand trial ===
The Resistance-affiliated newspaper ''L'Indépendant'', edited by Norbert Gomand, had been one of the sharpest critics of the government-in-exile. Finally, the government took the newspaper to court for defamation, in a trial starting in early 1946.

==Collapse==
The reshuffle, in favour of the CSV, appeased the [[right-wing]] dissidents and the two-fifths of the population that had voted the CSV.  However, it could not even paper over the cracks of the coalition, and the relationship deteriorated over the winter of 1946-7.  On 20 January 1947, [[Pierre Krier]], the leader of the LSAP, died.  Unable to hold together the coalition without one of its leading lights, the government handed in its resignation on 13 February.&lt;ref name="Thewes 2003, p. 126"/&gt;  Its replacement was another Dupong-led coalition, but including only the CSV and GD.  The LSAP would have to wait until 1951 to have another chance at governing. As of 2014, the Communists are still waiting.

The {{nihongo|'''''No.1'' class auxiliary patrol boat'''|第一号型哨戒特務艇,|''Dai Ichi Gō''-gata Shōkai-Tokumutei}} was a class of patrol boat (picket boat) of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), serving during [[World War II]]. 280 vessels were planned under the [[Wartime Naval Armaments Supplement Programme (Japan, 1944)|Maru Sen Programme]] (Ship # 2121–2400), however, only 27 vessels were completed before the end of the war.

==Background==
* During the war, Japan commandeered a large number of fishing boats for picket boat duty, with the primary duty of observing the sea to the east of the mainland. Their primary duty was to provide early warning of any U.S. Task Force attempting to close the Japan mainland. Some of the picket trawlers accomplished their duties, unfortunately, it was typically by means of failing to respond to hails after encountering the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;example: [[Doolittle Raid]] in 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; the IJN decided to build a specialized picket boat to replace the large number of vessels lost in the course of duty.
* The IJN intended to build 280 picket boats, however, the IJN was not able to procure sufficient wood to build the full number. The IJN built only 27 vessels before the end of the war. Those that survived war played an active part in the post-war minesweeping effort (primarily of magnetic mines) in company with the [[No.1 class auxiliary submarine chaser|''No.1''-class auxiliary submarine chaser]]s.

'''''Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy''''' is a book written by [[Telford Taylor]], the Chief Counsel Prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].

==Introduction==
The book ''Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy'', published in 1970, is an examination of the United States' conduct of the [[Vietnam War]] in comparison to the actions taken by [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].  Its author, Telford Taylor, was once the Chief Counsel [[Prosecutor]] at the war crimes trials of Nazi leaders in [[Nuremberg]], Germany from 1946–1949.  In that capacity, Taylor helped to establish the laws by which Nazi [[war criminal]]s would be tried for their crimes.

==Synopsis==
The book begins with a lengthy history of [[war crime]]s beginning with the "[[Knightly Virtues|knightly chivalry]]" of the [[medieval warfare|medieval period]].  These rules were put into place in order to minimize unnecessary cruelties during the course of warfare.  The rules protected civilian populations from massacre and the needless spread of disease.  Thus, the blanket of [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity]] that protects soldiers from being held criminally responsible for murder committed during the course of warfare had to be carefully balanced so as to discourage wartime atrocities.

The laws of war remained largely unwritten until U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] approved the "[[Lieber Code|Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field]]", in 1863.  Concerning spies, [[prisoners of war]], and the punishment of war crimes, this document comprising 159 articles facilitated the formation of [[military tribunals]] and later led to a demand for the formalization of international laws of warfare.  Thus, international laws of warfare were codified by means of a series of treaties known as the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague]] and [[Geneva conventions]].  The most important consequence of these treaties is that all nations, whether signatory or otherwise, were bound by international laws of war.

[[Image:Telford Taylor at Nuremberg.jpg|left|thumb|233px|Telford Taylor addressing the court at a session of the Nuremberg Trials.]] The Nuremberg Trials, for which Taylor served as a leading figure, gave rise to several developments in regard to international law as applied to warfare.  First, it gave international jurisdiction to the prosecution of war crimes; and second, it obligated individuals engaged in warfare to adhere to international laws of conduct over and above those of their respective armies.  Of greatest importance with respect to this book however is that the United States as a result of its participation emerged as legally, morally, and politically bound to the principles that resulted from the Nuremberg trials.  Thus, Taylor is concerned by how the principles of the Nuremberg trials would apply to the United States' conduct of the Vietnam War.

When ''Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy'' was published, those in favor and opposition to the United States involvement in Vietnam frequently cited the Nuremberg trials in support of their positions.  Those in favor of United States involvement argued that North Vietnam attacked South Vietnam in violation of Article 2 of the [[United Nations Charter]]; South Vietnam was justified in using force to repel such an attack; and this in turn allowed the United States to join with South Vietnam as provided by Article 51.

However some would claim that the US and South Vietnamese actions in the Vietnam War would constitute "[[aggressive warfare]]" by the standards of Nuremberg. Taylor points out that the definition of "aggressive warfare" is ambiguous, thus severely hindering any attempt to determine which of the [[belligerent|belligerent powers]] involved in the Vietnam War could be deemed the "aggressor."  What's more, such ambiguities lead to several related questions, such as the legality of refusing to serve in Vietnam.  At the time, many [[conscientious objectors]] refused to serve in Vietnam on the grounds that their complicity in an illegal war made them, by implication, guilty of [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]].

[[Image:My Lai massacre.jpg|thumb|180px|Civilians lie dead after the [[My Lai Massacre]] of 1968.]]
Taylor cites possible war crimes in regard to the Son My incident, which is more commonly known as the My Lai Massacre of 1968 {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|l|aɪ}}.  It is in this portion of the book that Taylor makes the most convincing comparison of Nuremberg to the Vietnam War.  In this section, Taylor quotes two [[Witness|eyewitness]] accounts, each from a different war.  One account, written by a [[German peoples|German]] [[construction engineering|construction engineer]], describes the killing of [[Jew]]s during the [[Holocaust]] by [[Schutzstaffel|German SS]] officers in 1942.  This account is [[Juxtaposition (literary)|juxtaposed]] on the adjacent page by an eyewitness account of the My Lai Massacre.  The accounts are eerily similar, yet Taylor explains all of the differences, and in characteristically unbiased fashion shows the difficulty in determining whether or not crimes were committed by the United States.

Taylor also raises domestic problems with regard to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War.  According to Taylor, it remains to be seen whether the [[United States Congress]] or the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] branch of government held responsibility for officially declaring  military action in Vietnam.  It is the opinion of Taylor that both the President and the Congress bear responsibility, and that the Vietnam War could only be ended by an act of national will, rather than by judicial means.

==Conclusion==
''Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy'', is an account of the Vietnam War in regard to international law, written by an expert on the subject.  It stands not as an accusation, but as an exposition of possible problems faced by the United States as a result of its involvement in the Vietnam War.  The Nuremberg Trials are used more or less as a counterpoint, though this in itself shows that Taylor likely opposed the Vietnam War.

'''''Ordinary Magic''''' is a 1993 Canadian film about a boy who is raised in [[India]] by his father. The story is based on the novel Ganesh by [[Malcolm Bosse]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/malcolm-j-bosse/ganesh/|title=GANESH by Malcolm J. Bosse {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Canada substituting in the film for the book's Midwestern USA location. This marks the debut of [[Ryan Reynolds]].

==Plot==
Jeffrey/Ganesh ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) has been raised with the ideals of social activism as part of his everyday life. His father spends the better part of their lives fighting for social justice in India. After his father dies, being only fifteen years old, Jeffrey is sent to a small town in Ontario to live with his aunt Charlotte ([[Glenne Headly]]). Through several comedic situations and with considerable effort, he manages to make friends and fit into his new, much smaller world of his. However, when his aunt receives an unfair eviction notice from her sleazy landlord ([[Paul Anka]]), every bit of his background and training comes into play, as he works with her to put on a well-publicized hunger strike, or [[Satyagraha]], which wins the admiration of the local citizens.

The '''Party of Reason''' ({{lang-de|Partei der Vernunft}}, '''PDV''') is a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[list of political parties in Germany|political party in Germany]] founded in 2009 by the journalist and author [[Oliver Janich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/36/36679/1.html ''Erben der FDP?''] {{de icon}}, [[Telepolis]], March 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presseanzeiger.de/meldungen/politik/283668.php 30. Mai im Hambacher Schloß: Partei der Vernunft wird gegründet] {{de icon}}, May 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's policies are based on the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of economics]]. It campaigns for a minimal state, free markets, [[free banking]] and currency competition, [[decentralization]] of political power, [[subsidiarity]] and [[direct democracy]]. It rejects nationalism, racism and any kind of anti-democratic politics, whether from left or right, and [[internet censorship|censorship of the internet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt.parteidervernunft.de/sites/default/files/manifesto.pdf Manifesto - Partei der Vernunft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621165120/http://alt.parteidervernunft.de/sites/default/files/manifesto.pdf |date=2015-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=September 2015}}

In September 2013, the PDV, together with libertarian parties from Spain ([[Libertarian Party (Spain)|Party of Individual Freedom]]), France ([[Liberal Democratic Party (France)|Liberal Democratic Party]]) and the Netherlands ([[Libertarian Party (Netherlands)|Libertarian Party]]) signed the Utrecht Declaration and Covenant of European Classical Liberal and Libertarian Parties, establishing the [[European Party for Individual Liberty]] (EPIL).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/notes/european-party-for-individual-liberty-epil/the-utrecht-declaration-and-covenant-of-european-classical-liberal-and-libertari/1421256691422684/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parteidervernunft.de/epil/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104210628/http://www.parteidervernunft.de/epil |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8884">In 1969, the [[United States]] [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Stanley v. Georgia]]'' that people could view whatever they wished in the privacy of their own homes. In response, the [[United States Congress]] funded the '''President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography''', set up by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to study [[pornography]]. 

==Aims==
The Commission was established to study and report on:&lt;ref name=Rainwater&gt;Lee Rainwater, ''Social problems and public policy: deviance and liberty'', Aldine Transaction, 1974, p.143 {{ISBN|0-202-30263-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Constitution of the United States|Constitutional]] and definitional problems related to [[obscenity]] controls."
* "Traffic in and distribution of obscene and pornographic materials."
* "The effects of such material, particularly on youth, and their relationship to crime and other antisocial conduct."

==Composition==
Initially, the Commission consisted of Edward E. Elson, Thomas D. Gill, Edward D. Greenwood, Reverend [[Morton A. Hill]], S.J., G. William Jones, Joseph T. Klapper, Otto N. Larsen, Rabbi Irving Lehrman, Freeman Lewis, Reverend Winfrey C. Link, Morris A. Lipton, William B. Lockhart (chair), [[Thomas C. Lynch]], Barbara Scott, Cathryn A. Speits, [[Frederick H. Wagman|Frederick Herbert Wagman]], [[Kenneth Keating]] and [[Marvin Wolfgang]]. 

Subsequently, K. Keating was replaced with [[Charles Keating]], Jr, by President [[Richard Nixon]].

==Studies undertaken==
The Commission commissioned [[Berl Kutchinsky]] to perform a scientific study on the subject. His report, titled ''Studies on Pornography and Sex Crimes in Denmark'' (1970), found that legalizing pornography in [[Denmark]] had not (as had been expected) resulted in an increase of sex crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abebooks.com/Studies-Pornography-Sex-Crimes-Denmark-Report/1677568127/bd ''Studies on Pornography and Sex Crimes in Denmark'' (1970)] by Berl Kutchinsky.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/proceedings/14/kutchinsky.pdf ''Pornography, Sex Crime, and Public Policy''] by Berl Kutchinsky.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
The Commission's report, called ''Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography'',&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography'' by Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. (Bantam Books, 1970) {{ISBN|9780394469942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 1970, recommended [[sex education]], funding of research into the effects of pornography and restriction of children's access to pornography, and recommended against any restrictions for adults. On balance the report found that obscenity and pornography were not important social problems, that there was no evidence that exposure to such material was harmful to individuals, and that current legal and policy initiatives were more likely to create problems than solve them.&lt;ref name=Rainwater/&gt; 

The report was widely criticized and rejected by Congress.&lt;ref name=Rainwater/&gt; The [[United States Senate|Senate]] rejected the Commission's findings and recommendations by a 60–5 vote, with 34 abstentions.&lt;ref name=Tatalovich&gt;Raymond Tatalovich, Byron W. Daynes, ''Moral controversies in American politics: cases in social regulatory policy. 2nd edition'', M.E. Sharpe, 1998 {{ISBN|1-56324-994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate rejected the following findings and recommendations in particular:&lt;ref name=Tatalovich/&gt;

* That there was "no evidence to date that exposure to explicit sexual materials plays a significant role in the causation of delinquent or criminal behavior among youths or adults."
* That "a majority of American adults believe that adults should be allowed to read or see any sexual materials they wish."
* That "there is no reason to suppose that elimination of governmental prohibitions upon the sexual materials which may be made available to adults would adversely affect the availability to the public of other books, magazines, or films."
* That there was no "evidence that exposure to explicit sexual materials adversely affects character or moral attitudes regarding sex and sexual conduct."
* That "Federal, State, and Local legislation prohibiting the sale, exhibition, or distribution of sexual materials to consenting adults should be repealed."

President Nixon, who had succeeded Johnson in 1969, also emphatically rejected the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=2759 Statement About the Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography], October 24, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 1970, [[Earl Kemp]] published an illustrated edition of the ''Presidential Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography'' through a publishing company owned by [[William Hamling (publisher)|William Hamling]] called Greenleaf Classics.

The 1969 President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography issued its un-illustrated 656-page report on September 30, 1970. One month later, the report went on sale at the [[Government Printing Office]]. On November 11, 1970, copies of publisher [[William Hamling (publisher)|William Hamling]]'s Greenleaf Classics’ 352-page ''The Illustrated Presidential Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography'' were printed, and two weeks later, on Monday, December 13, 1970, went on sale throughout the U.S. for $12.50.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated Presidential Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography'', Greenleaf Classics, 1970, "Introduction" by [[Earl Kemp]], pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'']] by [[Bob Guccione]], June 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemp and Hamling were eventually sentenced to prison for "conspiracy to mail obscene material," but both served only the federal minimum.&lt;ref&gt;"An Interview with [[Earl Kemp]] of Greenleaf Classics" by [[Michael Hemmingson]], ''Sin-A-Rama: Sleaze Sex Paperbacks of the Sixties'' edited by Brittany A. Daley, [[Hedi El Kholti]], [[Earl Kemp]], Miriam Linna, and [[Adam Parfrey]]. [[Feral House]], 2004. page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom of the Press: A Bibliocyclopedia : Ten-year Supplement (1967–1977)'' by Ralph Edward McCoy, Southern Illinois University Press, 1979, page 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamling received a four-year regular adult sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Motion in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of California at San Diego, as prepared by the law offices of Stanley Fleishman, May 17, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earl Kemp]] received a sentence of three years and one day.&lt;ref&gt;Motion in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of California at San Diego, as prepared by the law offices of Stanley Fleishman, May 17, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The report as published by Greenleaf was not found to be obscene.&lt;ref&gt;Brief in Support of Motion for Judgment of Acquital made pursuant to Rule 29(c), No. 11971, issued by the law offices of Stanley Fleishman, January 7,1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, on the other hand the brochure was found to be clearly obscene by the jury. Of some note, [[Earl Kemp]] was in Europe at the time Hamling created and mailed the ad brochure.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated Presidential Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography'', Greenleaf Classics, 1970, "Introduction" by [[Earl Kemp]], pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of South Africa}}
The '''1961 South African general election''', held on 18 October of that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stultz |first=Newell M. |last2=Butler |first2=Jeffrey |date=March 1963 |title=The South African General Election of 1961 |jstor=2146669 |journal=Political Science Quarterly |publisher=Academy of Political Science |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=86–110 |doi=10.2307/2146669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first [[general election]] after [[South Africa]] became a [[republic]] following the [[South African referendum, 1960|1960 South African referendum]]. The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] under [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd]] won a majority in the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]].

The National Union Party - led by J.D. du P. Basson and ex-Chief Justice Fagan in alliance with the United Party - had been formed as a "bridge" to the United Party for moderate nationalists who were unhappy with Verwoerd's leadership, but the party failed and later merged with the United Party.

This election also saw the first general election appearance of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]], which had broken away from the United Party in 1959. The new party retained one MP, in the form of [[Helen Suzman]]. She was to remain its sole parliamentary representative until 1974.

==Changes in franchise==

===End of black representation===
During the previous Parliament the seats of the three MPs and four Senators representing black South Africans had been abolished. The 1961 election produced the first Parliament with no representation at all for black South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;''In No Uncertain Terms'', page 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coloured Representative Members===
The second election for the four coloured representative members took place on 4 October 1961, before the (white voters only) general election on 18 October 1961. Under the Separate Representation of Voters Act 1951, the members were to serve until the dissolution of the new Parliament.

The four seats were won by Independents, with United Party support. The recently formed Progressive Party did not contest the four vacancies.&lt;ref&gt;''Keesing’s Contemporary Archives, 1961-1962'', page 18449&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduction in voting age===
This was the first election after the passage of the Electoral Law Amendment Act, No. 30 of 1958, which reduced the voting age for white voters from 21 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Muriel |last=Horrell |title=A Survey of Race Relations in South Africa, 1957–1958 |publisher=South African Institute of Race Relations |page=10 |url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201957-58.pdf |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delimitation of electoral divisions==
The [[South Africa Act 1909]] had provided for a delimitation commission to define the boundaries for each electoral division,  for general roll voters in the four provinces. The representation by province, under the eleventh delimitation report of 1958, is set out in the table below. The figures in brackets are the number of electoral divisions in the previous (1953) delimitation. If there is no figure in brackets then the number was unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;''South Africa 1982'', page 129 (table setting out delimitations of seats by province, the relevant one being that of 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

This was only the second general election, in South African history, where the boundaries were unchanged from the previous election.

|}

==Composition at the dissolution==
At the end of the 12th Parliament elected since the Union of 1910, when it was dissolved in 1961, the House of Assembly consisted of two groups of members. White voters were represented by 156 general roll members and coloured voters in Cape Province by four white MPs known at the time as Coloured Representative Members (CRM).

The general election only affected the representatives of white voters. The other members were elected on a different date (see above).

The representation by party and province, at the dissolution was:- &lt;ref&gt;''Keesing's Contemporary Archives, 1960-1961'', page 18449&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The vote totals in the table below may not give a complete picture of the balance of political opinion, because of unopposed elections (where no votes were cast) and because contested seats may not have been fought by a candidate from all major parties.

The total registered electorate was 1,800,426. The votes cast were 802,079 (including 4,518 spoilt votes).&lt;ref&gt;''South Africa 1982'', page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''Sovereign''' is borrowed from [[Old French]] ''soverain'', which is ultimately derived from the [[Latin]] word ''superānus'', meaning "above". It is a title which can be given to people in various categories.

The roles of a sovereign vary from [[Monarch]] or [[Head of state]] to head of municipal government or head of a chivalric order. As a result, the word sovereign has more recently also come to mean independence or autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sovereign|title=Definition of sovereign in English:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Head of State==
The word ''Sovereign'' is frequently used synonymously with [[Monarch]]. There are [[Royal and noble ranks#Sovereign|numerous titles]] in a monarchical rule which can belong to the sovereign. The sovereign is the autonomous head of the state. Examples of the various titles in modern sovereign leaders are:

==Chivalric Orders==
The term ''Sovereign'' is generally used in place of "Grand Master" for the supreme head of various orders [[Europe]]an nations. In the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], the Grand Master is styled "Sovereign", e.g. Sovereign Grand Master, due to its status as an internationally independent sovereign entity. Examples of the Sovereign of a chivalric order are: 
* [[Philip the Good]], founder of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]
* [[Karl von Habsburg]], current Sovereign of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]
* [[Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia]], current Sovereign of the [[Order of Louise]]
* [[Caroline of Baden]], Sovereign of the [[Order of Saint Elizabeth]]
* [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza]], Sovereign of the [[Order of Saint Isabel]]

==Municipal Government==
As chief officer of municipal government, ''the Sovereign'' had duties and responsibilities deriving from the charter which established the local town borough or council. This was commonly used throughout [[Ireland]]. This usage was less common in the [[United Kingdom]] and occasionally meant a [[Marcher Lord]].

===Characteristics===
The candidate for this position was elected by the freemen and burgesses of the town, borough and city councils and had to be a [[Burgess (title)|Burgess]] himself. And in later years he also had to be approved by the patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extracts from the Old Corporation Books of New Ross|jstor=25507115|publisher=The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland|date= 31 March 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="First report"&gt;{{cite book|title=FIRST REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED TO INQUIRE INTO THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS IN IRELAND|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9VbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA917|year=1835|pages=917–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of responsibility ranged from enacting by-laws about tolls up to the death penalty. Some charters established the sovereign as the local [[magistrate]] or [[Justice of the peace]]. The office generally had no salary though some patrons provided a stipend to the Sovereign in their borough.&lt;ref name="First report"/&gt; In some localities the sovereign was appointed directly by the patron of the borough which allowed him to influence the election of the local MP. Once the parliamentary franchise was lost with the [[Acts of Union 1800]], the role became largely ceremonial or forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland: Adapted to the New Poor-law, Franchise, Municipal and Ecclesiastical Arrangements, and Compiled with a Special Reference to the Lines of Railroad and Canal Communication, as Existing in 1814-45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9rblf03SdkYC&amp;pg=PA299|year=1846|publisher=A.

The title of the chief officer of a city council has become known as a [[Mayor]]. In some municipal boroughs the titles Borough Master or [[Burgomaster]], [[Bailiff]], [[Portreeve]], [[wikt:warden|Warden]] and [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] were used interchangeably with mayor and sovereign.&lt;ref name="Britain1840"/&gt;

===History===
Ireland had established self-governing municipal boroughs which gave a city-state status to the locality in existence since the Norman conquest. These were most typically in the denser populated provinces of [[Munster]] and [[Leinster]]. The provision of the borough and the corporation was established through a charter, the granting of which was known as incorporation. Freemen and burgesses were the usual governing members of the council and elected their chief officer, the Sovereign. In earlier incarnations the council also managed the law court known as the "hundred court" and dealt with local administrative and legal business. Boroughs also elected the local MP. Positions on the council were predominantly from among the wealthy and related families in the area.&lt;ref name="borough"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/volume-21/irish-municipal-boroughs/|title=Irish Municipal boroughs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the Sovereign in [[Kilkenny]] dates from 1231. The ''Liber Primus Kilkenniensis'' is a contemporaneously written account of the proceedings of Kilkenny municipality beginning in 1230 and running to 1538.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25513427|title = Notes on the Liber Primus Kilkenniensis|journal = The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 21–38|last1 = McNeill|first1 = Charles|year = 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to identify the names of Kilkenny's sovereigns and currently there is a list of the names of 244 sovereigns from 1282 to 1608. At that point a new charter was established for the town and in 1609 the first Mayor of the City of Kilkenny is elected.&lt;ref name="Kilkenny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kilkennycity.ie/eng/Your_Council/The_Sovereigns_and_Mayors_of_Kilkenny_1282-2003/|title=The sovereigns and Mayors of Kilkenny}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weakening power===
Early Irish borough had a city-state status however with the unification of Ireland under the crown in 1603 they were transformed into more ordinary municipal towns on the English model. Part of this was to reduce the autonomy of the Irish borough and partly to establish the new rules by which the planted towns of Ireland were to operate. Since the MPs to the Irish parliament were elected by the borough council, and to prevent a Catholic majority there, additional boroughs were created in areas with a strong Protestant base. A direct result of this was the Protestant majority of 232 to 100 in the 1613 House of Commons. The new charters placed the government of the borough with the Sovereign and twelve chief burgesses, who are to elect all the rest and stipulated that all had to conform to the established church by taking the Oath of Supremacy.&lt;ref name="gerrymander"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/the-greatest-gerrymander-in-irish-history-james-is-40-boroughs-of-1612-13/|title=New Boroughs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Lewis|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland: Comprising the Several Counties, Cities, Boroughs, Corporate, Market, and Post Towns, Parishes, and Villages, with Historical and Statistical Descriptions ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh_xz5nqbyQC&amp;pg=PA461|year=1995|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=978-0-8063-1063-3|pages=461–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MerewetherStephens1835"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Alworth Merewether|author2=Archibald John Stephens|title=The history of the Boroughs and municipal Corporations of the United Kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae89AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1620|year=1835|publisher=Stevens, Yard|pages=1620–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir John Davies]], [[Attorney General for Ireland]] wrote "the newly erected boroughs . . . will be perpetual seminaries of Protestant burgesses".&lt;ref name="gerrymander"/&gt;

Historically the number of boroughs varied considerably. There were 117 boroughs in Ireland from 1685 to 1800. Prior to the passing of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], there were sixty-eight borough corporations in Ireland.&lt;ref name="gerrymander"/&gt; As each of the changes and new charters were brought in and with the loss of the parliamentary franchise, sovereigns became less powerful and more ceremonial.

===Legacy===
There is a sailing race held in [[Kinsale]] which references back to the chief officer of the town council. When looking to name a new trophy the local yacht club discovered that the ‘Sovereign of Kinsale’ used to put up a trophy for a sailing race in the late 1700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/ireland/irish-examiner-supplement/20170610|title= Sovereign's cup 2017|newspaper=Irish Examiner Supplement|date= 10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that the race and trophy today is known as The Sovereign's cup.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sovereignscup.com/sovereigns-cup-kinsale/Event-Info&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsale had been given its charter to set up a borough led by a Sovereign around 1319.&lt;ref name="Lewis1995"/&gt;

A '''stateless nation''' is a political term for an [[ethnic group]] or nation that does not possess its own [[Sovereign state|state]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Dictionary Of Public Administration'', U.C. Mandal, Sarup &amp; Sons 2007, 505 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and is not the majority population in any [[nation state]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{citation |author1= Frank L.

Stateless nations are usually not represented in international sports or in international organisations such as the [[United Nations]]. Nations without state are classified as [[Fourth World|fourth world nations]].&lt;ref&gt;David Newman, ''Boundaries, Territory and Postmodernity''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic Minority Media: An International Perspective'', Stephen Harold Riggins, 217p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Language in Geographic Context'', Colin H. Williams, 39p.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the stateless nations have a history of [[Sovereignty|statehood]], some were always a stateless nation, dominated by another nation.

The term was coined in 1983 by political scientist [[Jacques Leruez]] in his book "L'Ecosse, une nation sans Etat" about the peculiar position of [[Scotland]] within the [[British state]]. It was later adopted and popularized by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] scholars such as [[David McCrone]], [[Michael Keating (political scientist)|Michael Keating]] and [[T.M. Devine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=qAcoDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA85|page=85|title=National Identity: Theory and Research|first1=Richard R.|last1=Verdugo|first2=Andrew|last2=Milne|date=1 June 2016|publisher=IAP|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stateless nations either are dispersed across a number of states (for example, the [[Yoruba people]] are found in the [[Africa|African states]] of [[Nigeria]], [[Benin]] and [[Togo]]) or form the [[Indigenous peoples|native population]] of a [[province]] within a larger state (such as the [[Uyghur people]] in the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] within the [[People's Republic of China]]). Some stateless nations historically had a state, which was absorbed by another; for example, [[Tibet (1912–51)|Tibet's declaration of independence]] in 1913 was not recognized, and it was invaded in 1951 by the [[People's Republic of China]] which claims that [[Tibet]] is an integral part of China, while the [[Tibetan government-in-exile]] maintains that Tibet is an independent state under an unlawful occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Gregory, ''In fear of China'', 1969, saying: "Tibet, although enjoying independence at certain periods of its history, had never been recognised by any single foreign power as an independent state. The closest it has ever come to such recognition was the British formula of 1943: suzerainty, combined with autonomy and the right to enter into diplomatic relations."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/ourpublications/csq/article/the-legal-status-tibet |title=The Legal Status of Tibet |publisher=Cultural Survival}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ethnic groups were once a stateless nation that later became a nation state (for example, the nations of the [[Balkans]] such as the [[Croats]], [[Serbs]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Slovenes]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] were once part of a multinational state of [[Yugoslavia]]; since the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] many nation states were formed).

Stateless nations can have large populations ; for example the [[Kurds]] have an estimated population of over 30 million people, which make them one of the largest stateless nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/who-are-the-kurds--17915 |title=Who are the Kurds? |publisher=TRT World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple stateless nations can reside in the same geographical region or country; for example, [[Catalans]], [[Basques]], [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]], [[Galicians]], [[Asturians]], [[Valencians]] and [[Andalusians]] within [[Spain|Spanish State]], or the [[Brahui people|Brahui]], [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]], [[Assamese people|Assamese]], [[Santhal people|Santhals]], [[Maithils]] and [[Balochs]] in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups around the World, 2nd Edition: Ethnic and National Groups around the World'', pp. 59–60, 79–80, 366–367&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all peoples within multi-cultural states have the same awareness of being a stateless nation. In Spain, only Basques and Catalans have claimed their right of self-determination, which in the Basque country gave rise to the militant movement [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], and in the case of [[Catalonia]], has led to multiple attempts to secede from Spain during the past four centuries, as an independent [[Catalan Republic]].

As not all states are nation states, there are ethnic groups who live in [[multinational state]]s without being considered "stateless nations".

== Nation-states and nations without states ==
The symbiotic relationship between nations and states arose in early modern Western Europe (18th century) and it was exported to the rest of the world through colonial rule. Whereas the Western European nation-states are at present relinquishing some of their powers to the European Union, many of the former colonies are now the zealous defenders of the concept of national-statehood.&lt;ref name=Nimni/&gt;

Only a small fraction of the world's national groups have associated nation-states. The proportion was estimated to be 3 percent by Minahan. The rest are distributed in one or more states. Of the 192 member states of the [[United Nations]] in 2006, fewer than 20 are nation-states. Thus nation-states are not as common as often assumed, and stateless nations are the overwhelming majority of nations in the world.&lt;ref name=Nimni/&gt;

== Consequences of colonialism and imperialism ==

During the [[imperial era|imperial]] and [[colonial era]], powerful nations extended their influence outside their homeland and this resulted in many colonized nations ceasing to be [[self-determination|self-governing]] and have since been described as stateless nations.&lt;ref&gt;Redie Bereketeab, ''Self-Determination and Secession in Africa: The Post-Colonial State''&lt;/ref&gt; Some nations have been victims of "carve out" and their homeland was divided among several countries. Even today the colonial boundaries form modern national boundaries. These often differ from cultural boundaries. This results in situations where people of the same language or culture are divided by national borders, for example [[New Guinea]] splits as [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] (former [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colony]]) and [[Papua New Guinea]] (former [[British Empire|British colony]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Devetak, Christopher W. Hughes, Routledge, 2007-12-18, ''The Globalization of Political Violence: Globalization's Shadow''&lt;/ref&gt; During [[decolonization]], the colonial powers imposed a unified state structure irrespective of the ethnic differences and granted independence to their [[colony|colonies]] as a [[multinational state]]. This led to [[Succession of states|successor states]] with many minority ethnic groups in them, which increased the potential for [[ethnic conflict]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Cultural Analysis: Towards Cross-cultural Understanding (2006)'', Hans Gullestrup, 130p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnicity and Christian leadership in west African sub-region: proceedings of the conference of the fifteenth CIWA Theology Week held at the Catholic Institute of West Africa (2004)'', Port Harcourt, p.272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mussolini Warlord: Failed Dreams of Empire, 1940–1943 (2013)'', H. James Burgwyn, Chapter V&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic Groups in Conflict (2009)'', Karl Cordell, Stefan Wolff&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these minoritiy groups campaigned for [[self-determination]]. Stateless nations were not protected in all countries and become victims of atrocities such as [[discrimination]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[genocide]], [[forced assimilation]], [[Exploitation of labour]] and [[Exploitation of natural resources|natural resources]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Horowitz, ''Ethnic Groups in Conflict''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Johansen, ''Resource Exploitation in Native North America: A Plague upon the Peoples''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationalism and stateless nations ==
People with a common origin, history, language, culture, customs or religion can turn into a [[nation]] by awakening of [[national consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;George W. White, ''Nationalism and Territory: Constructing Group Identity in Southeastern Europe''&lt;/ref&gt; A nation can exist without a state, as is exemplified by the stateless nations. Citizenship is not always the nationality of a person.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding National Identity'' by David McCrone, Frank Bechhofer, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; In a multinational state different national identities can coexist or compete: for example, in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] both [[English nationalism]] and [[Scottish nationalism]] exist and are held together by [[British nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Unionist-Nationalism: Governing Urban Scotland, 1830–1860'' by Graeme Morton, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalism is often connected to [[separatism]], because a nation achieves completeness through its independence.&lt;ref&gt;James Minahan, ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: A-C''&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, numerous nations [[Declaration of Independence|declared their independence]], but not all succeeded in establishing a state. Even today, there are active autonomy and independence movements around the world. The claim of the stateless nations to [[self-determination]] is often denied due to [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] interests and increasing [[globalization]] of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Nationalism and Globalisation (2015)'', Stephen Tierney&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Tamil Genocide by Sri Lanka: The Global Failure to Protect Tamil Rights Under International Law, Francis Boyle, chapter self determination.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turmoil in the Middle East: Imperialism, War, and Political Instability (1999), Berch Berberoglu, 69p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saisjournal.org/posts/europe's-stateless-nations-in-the-era-of-globalization|title=Europe's Stateless Nations in the Era of Globalization, The Case for Catalonia's Secession by Josep Desquens|work=saisjournal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stateless nations sometimes show solidarity with other stateless nations and maintain diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;The delegates were linked with the Scottish group ‘SNP Friends of Catalonia’, which itself had members recently visit the Catalan parliament in Barcelona in a show of solidarity to the country’s hopes of self-determination. {{cite web|url=https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/9639/catalan-delegates-send-solidarity-scotland-independence-movement|title=Catalan delegates in solidarity visit to Scotland's independence movement|work=commonspace.scot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Catalan President and the Head of the Corsican government meet in Barcelona. The meeting lasted more than two hours and focused on enhancing the cooperation between the two nations in a regional and European level. {{cite web|url=http://www.e-f-a.org/services/news-single-view/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=974&amp;cHash=d2ced5618fb98e7ba22c944adfd93f75|title=EFA brings stateless nations even closer|work=European Free Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all peoples claim that they are nations or aspire to be states. Some see themselves as part of the multinational state and they believe that their interests are well represented in it. This is also associated with [[Pan-nationalism]] ([[Indian nationalism]] or [[Chinese nationalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams, ''Political Ideology Today'' p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Strengthening Education through Research Act''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4366}}) or "SETRA" is a bill that would amend and [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] the [[Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002]] and would authorize the [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation]] of $615 million for fiscal year 2015 and $3.8 billion over the 2015-2019 period to support federal educational research, statistical analysis, and other activities.&lt;ref name="cbo4366"/&gt;

The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Provisions of the bill==
The bill would [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] the [[Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002]].&lt;ref name=dataquality1&gt;{{cite web|last=Yochum|first=Kristin|title=Strengthening Education through Research Act plans to modernize SLDS program|url=http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/blog/2014/04/strengthening-education-through-research-act/|publisher=Data Quality Campaign|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=3 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317211530/http://dataqualitycampaign.org/blog/2014/04/strengthening-education-through-research-act/|archivedate=17 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would authorize the [[State Longitudinal Data System]] grant program.&lt;ref name="dataquality1"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on April 8, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo4366&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4366|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45300|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

H.R. 4366 would amend and [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] the [[Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002]] through fiscal year 2020. (This authorization would automatically be extended one year through 2021 under the [[General Education Provisions Act]].) The bill would authorize the appropriation of $615 million for fiscal year 2015 and $3.8 billion over the 2015-2019 period to support federal educational research, statistical analysis, and other activities.&lt;ref name="cbo4366"/&gt;

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would cost $2.0 billion over the 2015-2019 period, assuming the [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation]] of the authorized amounts. Enacting the bill would have no impact on direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo4366"/&gt;

H.R. 4366 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]].&lt;ref name="cbo4366"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Strengthening Education through Research Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 2, 2014 by [[Todd Rokita|Rep. Todd Rokita (R, IN-4)]].&lt;ref name=4366allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4366 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4366/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce]]. The bill was reported (amended) on April 29, 2014 alongside [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt424/CRPT-113hrpt424.pdf House Report 113-424].&lt;ref name="4366allactions"/&gt; The bill was scheduled to be voted on under [[suspension of the rules]] on May 7, 2014.&lt;ref name=HouseExIRS&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
The [[Council for Exceptional Children]], the [[National Center for Learning Disabilities]], and the [[Higher Education Consortium for Special Education]] praised the bill because it "values the critical role of research in developing effective practices to support positive outcomes for children and youth with disabilities."&lt;ref name=ncldap2&gt;{{cite web|title=Bi-Partisan Legislation Prioritizes Research to Improve Outcomes for Children and Youth with Disabilities|url=http://www.ncld.org/images/content/files/research/CECzNCLDzHECSEStatementonSETRA.pdf|publisher=National Center for Learning Disabilities|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the organizations, "actual funding amounts listed in the legislation remain inadequate to sufficiently address the nation’s special education research needs. This limited investment, coming as the result of rules adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives intended to rein in spending, is not enough to restore funding and increase the impact of future NCSER and special education research."&lt;ref name="ncldap2"/&gt;

The [[Data Quality Campaign]] (DQC) was in favor of the bill, because it would "permit states to use federal funds to turn their attention to the important task of transforming the data they now collect into useful information and ensuring that key stakeholders have access to this tailored, timely, contextual information."&lt;ref name="dataquality1"/&gt; DQC says that it "sees immense value in the ability to link data across early childhood education, K-12, postsecondary, and workforce systems," because it allows researchers to answer more complex questions that require data from multiple sources.&lt;ref name="dataquality1"/&gt;

The '''Sykes–Picot Agreement''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|k|s|_|p|i|ˈ|k|oʊ}}, officially known as the '''Asia Minor Agreement''', was a secret 1916 agreement between the United Kingdom and France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David |authorlink=David Fromkin |title=A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East |publisher=Owl |year=1989 |location=New York |pages=286, 288 |isbn=0-8050-6884-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which the [[Russian Empire]] assented. The agreement defined their mutually agreed [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] and control in [[Southwestern Asia]]. The agreement was based on the premise that the [[Triple Entente]] would succeed in defeating the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]]. The negotiations leading to the agreement occurred between November 1915 and March 1916 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHfw0Mv_uFUC |title= The Middle East in the Twentieth Century |author=Martin Sicker |isbn=0275968936 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2001 |page=26 |via=Google Books |accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was signed 16 May 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS094.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327062139/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS094.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df=}} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The deal, exposed to the public in ''[[Izvestia]]'' and ''[[Pravda]]'' on 23 November 1917 and in the British ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' on November 26, 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1035998/full_content|title=Syria and Lebanon are often in the news|publisher=|access-date=2016-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302195724/http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1035998/full_content#|archive-date=2016-03-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HcJMUx3HCU4C&amp;pg=PT245&amp;lpg=PT245&amp;dq=sykes-picot+published+manchester+guardian+november+26+1917+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OBGGVoI7ve&amp;sig=5PYXRFDLG0KsumSSD5gBqpF82yI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sykes-picot%20published%20manchester%20guardian%20november%2026%201917%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false Castles Made of Sand: A Century of Anglo-American Espionage and Intervention] Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; is still mentioned when considering the region and its present-day conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/dec/30/middle-east-still-rocking-from-first-world-war-pacts-made-100-years-ago Middle East still rocking from first world war pacts made 100 years ago] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126115128/https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/dec/30/middle-east-still-rocking-from-first-world-war-pacts-made-100-years-ago# |date=2017-01-26 }} Published in [[The Guardian]], December 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21698652-europe-and-america-made-mistakes-misery-arab-world-caused-mainly-its-own|title=The war within|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915114105/https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21698652-europe-and-america-made-mistakes-misery-arab-world-caused-mainly-its-own#|archive-date=2017-09-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement allocated to Britain control of areas roughly comprising the coastal strip between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[River Jordan]], [[Jordan]], southern [[Iraq]], and an additional small area that included the ports of [[Haifa]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], to allow access to the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Original"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Sykes-Picot_Agreement|title=Sykes-Picot Agreement - World War I Document Archive|website=wwi.lib.byu.edu|access-date=2009-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426081632/http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Sykes-Picot_Agreement#|archive-date=2009-04-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; France got control of southeastern [[Turkey]], northern Iraq, [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Original" /&gt; Russia was to get [[Istanbul]], the [[Turkish Straits]] and [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="Original" /&gt; The controlling powers were left free to determine state boundaries within their areas.&lt;ref name="Original" /&gt; Further negotiation was expected to determine international administration in the "brown area" (an area including [[Jerusalem]], similar to and smaller than Mandate Palestine), the form of which was to be decided upon after consultation with Russia, and subsequently in consultation with the other Allies, and the representatives of [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca]].&lt;ref name="Original" /&gt;

The agreement effectively divided the Ottoman Arab provinces outside the [[Arabian peninsula]] into areas of British and French control and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mansfield, ''British Empire'' magazine, Time-Life Books, no 75, p. 2078&lt;/ref&gt; In the Levant, it was initially used directly as the basis for the [[1918 Anglo–French Modus Vivendi]] which agreed a framework for the [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]]. More broadly it was to lead, indirectly, to the subsequent [[Partition of the Ottoman Empire|partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] following Ottoman defeat in 1918.  

The [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]-[[Haifa]] zone was intended to be a British [[enclave]] in the North to enable access to the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, p.286&lt;/ref&gt; The British later gained control of the brown zone and other territory in 1920 and ruled it as [[Mandatory Palestine]] from 1923 until 1948. They also ruled [[Mandatory Iraq]] from 1920 until 1932, while the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] lasted from 1923 to 1946. The terms were negotiated by British diplomat [[Mark Sykes]] and a French counterpart, [[François Georges-Picot]]. The Tsarist government was a minor party to the Sykes–Picot agreement, and when, following the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks]] published the agreement on 23 November 1917, "the British were embarrassed, the Arabs dismayed and the Turks delighted".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Mansfield (historian)|Peter Mansfield]], ''The British Empire '' magazine, no. 75, Time-Life Books, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement is seen by many as a turning point in [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] and [[Arab world|Arab]] relations. It negated the UK's promises to Arabs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite film|first=Director James|last=Hawes|title=Lawrence of Arabia: The Battle for the Arab World|publisher=PBS Home Video|date=21 October 2003}} Interview with Kemal Abu Jaber, former Foreign Minister of Jordan.&lt;/ref&gt; made for a national Arab homeland in the area of [[Greater Syria]], in exchange for supporting the British against the Ottoman Empire.

==Motivation and negotiations==
In the [[Constantinople Agreement]] earlier in 1915, following the start of [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|naval operations]] in the run up to the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] the Russian Foreign Minister, [[Sergey Sazonov]], wrote to the French and UK ambassadors and staked a claim to  Constantinople and the Straits of [[Dardanelles]]. In a series of diplomatic exchanges over five weeks, the UK and France both agreed, while putting forward their own claims, to an increased sphere of influence in Iran in the case of the UK and to an annex of Syria (including Palestine) and [[Cilicia]] for France. The UK and French claims were both agreed, all sides also agreeing that the exact governance of the Holy Places was to be left for later settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. C. Hurewitz|title=The Middle East and North Africa in World Politics: A Documentary Record. British-French supremacy, 1914-1945. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9TsVxeUkQMC&amp;pg=PA19|year=1979|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-02203-2|pages=16–21|ref =harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this agreement was ultimately never implemented because of the Russian revolution, it was in force as well as a direct motivation for it at the time the Sykes–Picot Agreement was being negotiated.

The report of the [[De Bunsen Committee]], prepared to determine British wartime policy toward the Ottoman Empire, and submitted in June 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sY27UmuT6-4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=moses+gaster+mark+sykes+1916&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cw7IZRYQ5p&amp;sig=R6gUJbQVhMw9EtOHVfwUIjrf7Wg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-6JkT8CxDsnR8QOz5O2fCA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=moses+gaster+mark+sykes+1916&amp;f=false|title=A Broken Trust: Sir Herbert Samuel, Zionism and the Palestinians|first1=Sahar|last1=Huneidi|first2=Sarah|last2=Huneidi|date=7 April 2001|publisher=I.B.Tauris|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that, in case of the partition or zones of influence options, there should be a British sphere of influence that included Palestine while accepting that there were relevant French and Russian as well as Islamic interests in Jerusalem and the Holy Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=N.A.|last=Rose|title=The Gentile Zionists: A Study in Anglo-Zionist Diplomacy 1929-1939|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fTf_AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=De+Bunsen+international+administration+Palestine#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20Bunsen%20international%20administration%20Palestine&amp;f=false|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135158651 |pages=264|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurewitz|first=J.C.|title=The Middle East and North Africa in World Politics:A Documentary Record.

On 21 October 1915, Grey met Cambon and suggested France appoint a representative to discuss the future borders of Syria as Britain wished to back the creation of an independent Arab state. At this point Grey was faced with competing claims from the French and from Hussein and the day before had  sent a telegram to Cairo telling the High Commissioner to be as vague as possible in his next letter to the Sharif when discussing the northwestern, Syrian, corner of the territory Husein claimed and left McMahon with "discretion in the matter as it is urgent and there is not time to discuss an exact formula", adding, "If something more precise than this is required you can give it."&lt;ref&gt;A Line in the Sand, James Barr,Simon and Schuster,2011 Ch.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Sykes had been dispatched on instructions of the War Office at the beginning of June to discuss the Committee's findings with the British authorities in the Near and Middle East and at the same time to study the situation on the spot. He went to Athens, Gallipoli, Sofia, Cairo, Aden, Cairo a second time and then to India coming back to Basra in September and a third time to Cairo in November (where he was appraised of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence) before returning home on 8 December and finally delivering his report to the War Committee on 16 December.

The first meeting of the British interdepartmental committee headed by Sir Arthur Nicolson with François Georges-Picot had already taken place on 23 November 1915. Picot informed the Nicolson committee that France claimed the possession of land starting from where the Taurus Mts approach the sea in Cilicia, following the Taurus Mountains and the mountains further East, so as to include Diabekr, Mosul and Kerbela, and then returning to Deir Zor on the Euphrates and from there southwards along the desert border, finishing eventually at the Egyptian frontier.  Picot, however, added that he was prepared "to propose to the French government to throw Mosul into the Arab pool, if we did so in the case of Bagdad".

A second meeting of the Nicolson committee with Picot took place on 21 December 1915 wherein Picot said that he had obtained permission to agree to the towns of Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus being included in the Arab dominions to be administered by the Arabs. Although the French had scaled back their demands to some extent, the British also claimed to want to include Lebanon in the future Arab State and this meeting also ended at an impasse.

On 28 December, Mark Sykes informed Clayton that he had "been given the Picot negotiations". On 3 January 1916, an initialled memorandum was forwarded to the Foreign Office and after having been circulated for comments,{{efn|group=lower-alpha|In 12 January 1916, a memorandum commenting on a draft of the agreement, [[William Reginald Hall]], British [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Director of Naval Intelligence]] criticised the proposed agreement on the basis that "the Jews have a strong material, and a very strong political, interest in the future of the country" and that "in the Brown area the question of [[Zionism]], and also of British control of all Palestine railways, in the interest of Egypt, have to be considered".{{sfn|Friedman|1992|p=111}}}} An interdepartmental conference was convened by Nicolson on 21 January. On 16 January, Sykes told the Foreign office that he had spoken to Picot and that he thought Paris would be able to agree. Following the meeting, a final draft agreement was circulated to the cabinet on 2 February, the War Committee considered it on the 3rd and finally at a meeting on the 4th between Bonar Law, Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Kitchener and others where it was decided that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;M. Picot may inform his government that the acceptance of the whole project would entail the abdication of considerable British interests, but provided that the cooperation of the Arabs is secured, and that the Arabs fulfil the conditions and obtain the towns of Homs, Hama, Damascus and Aleppo, the British Government would not object to the arrangement. But, as the Blue Area extends so far Eastwards, and affects Russian interests, it would be absolutely essential that, before anything was concluded, the consent of Russia was obtained.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Picot was informed and 5 days later Cambon told Nicolson that "the French government were in accord with the proposals concerning the Arab question".&lt;ref name="Lieshout"&gt;Britain and the Arab Middle East: World War I and its Aftermath, Robert H. Lieshout, I.B.Tauris, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|100–102}}

Later, in February and March, Sykes and Picot acted as advisors to Sir George Buchanan and the French ambassador respectively, during negotiations with Sazonov. Eventually, Russia having agreed (for a price, as it obtained large portions of Ottoman territory in the bargain, including Constantinople and the Straits) on 26 April 1916, the final terms were sent by Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Edward Grey, on 9 May 1916, and ratified in Grey's reply on 16 May 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/dividing-bears-skin-bear-still-alive-1916-sykes-picot-agreement/|title=Dividing the bear’s skin while the bear is still alive|last=Desplatt|first=Juliette|date=May 16, 2016|website=The national Archives|access-date=June 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806223712/http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/dividing-bears-skin-bear-still-alive-1916-sykes-picot-agreement/#|archive-date=2017-08-06|dead-url=no|df=}} [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|30px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/ Open Government Licence v3.0] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628175632/https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/# |date=2017-06-28 }}. © Crown copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/sykes.asp|title=The Sykes-Picot Agreement : 1916|publisher=Yale Law School The Avalon Project|access-date=6 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414042512/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/sykes.asp#|archive-date=2016-04-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria, Palestine and the Arabs===
====Asquith Government (1916)====
While Sykes and Picot were in negotiations, discussions were proceeding in parallel between Cairo and Hussein (the [[McMahon-Hussein Correspondence]]); Hussein's reply of 1 January to McMahon's 14 December 1915 was received at the Foreign Office, McMahon’s cover stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Satisfactory as it may be to note his general acceptance for the time being of the proposed relations of France with Arabia, his reference to the future of those relations adumbrates a source of trouble which it will be wise not to ignore. I have on more than one occasion brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government the deep antipathy with which the Arabs regard the prospect of French Administration of any portion of Arab territory. In this lies considerable danger to our future relations with France, because difficult and even impossible though it may be to convince France of her mistake, if we do not endeavour to do so by warning her of the real state of Arab feeling, we may hereafter be accused of instigating or encouraging the opposition to the French, which the Arabs now threaten and will assuredly give.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After discussions, Grey instructed that the French be informed of the situation although Cambon did not take the matter that seriously.&lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|103–104}}

Hussein's letter of 18  February 1916 appealed to McMahon for £50,000 in gold plus weapons, ammunition and food claiming that Feisal was awaiting the arrival of "not less than 100,000 people" for the planned revolt and McMahon's reply of 10 March 1916 confirmed the British agreement to the requests and concluded the ten letters of the correspondence. In April and May, there were discussions initiated by Sykes as to the merits of a meeting to include Picot and the Arabs to mesh the desiderata of both sides. At the same time, logistics in relation to the promised revolt were being dealt with and there was a rising level of impatience for action to be taken by Hussein. Finally, at the end of April, McMahon was advised of the terms of Sykes-Picot and he and Grey agreed that these would not be disclosed to the Arabs.&lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|108–112}}&lt;ref name="Twice" /&gt;{{rp|57–60}}

The Arab revolt was officially initiated by Hussein at Mecca on 10 June 1916 although his sons ‘Ali and Faisal had already initiated operations at Medina starting on 5 June.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arab Movements in World War I'', Eliezer Tauber, Routledge, 2014 {{ISBN|9781135199784}} pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; The timing had been brought forward by Hussein and, according to Cairo,&lt;ref&gt;Arab Bulletin No 52, 31 May 1917, Hejaz, A Year of Revolt, p.249&lt;/ref&gt; "Neither he nor we were at all ready in early June, 1916, and it was only with the greatest of difficulty that a minimum of sufficient assistance in material could be scraped together to ensure initial success."

Colonel Edouard Brémond was dispatched to Arabia in September 1916 as head of the French military mission to the Arabs. According to Cairo, Brémond was  intent on containing the revolt so that the Arabs might not in any way threaten French interests in Syria. These concerns were not taken up in London, British-French cooperation was thought paramount and Cairo made aware of that. (Wingate was informed in late November that "it would seem desirable to impress upon your subordinates the need for the most loyal cooperation with the French whom His Majesty’s Government do not suspect of ulterior designs in the Hijaz".)&lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|234–5}}

As 1916 drew to a close, the Asquith government which had been under increasing pressure and criticism mainly due to its conduct of the war, gave way on 6 December to David Lloyd George who had been critical of the war effort and had succeeded Kitchener as Secretary of State for War after his untimely death in June. Lloyd George had wanted to make the destruction of the [[Ottoman Empire]] a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of [[Jerusalem]], to impress British public opinion.&lt;ref name="Woodfin"&gt;{{cite book| last=Woodfin | first=E. | title=Camp and Combat on the Sinai and Palestine Front: The Experience of the British Empire Soldier, 1916-18 | publisher=Springer | year=2012 |isbn=1137264802}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119–120}} The EEF were, at the time, in defensive mode at a line on the Eastern edge of the Sinai at El Arish and 15 miles from the borders of Ottoman Palestine. Lloyd George "at once" consulted his War Cabinet about a "further campaign into Palestine when El Arish had been secured". Pressure from Lloyd George (over the reservations of [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]]) resulted in the capture of Rafa and the arrival of British forces at the borders of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Woodfin" /&gt;{{rp|47–49}}

====Lloyd George Government (1917 onwards)====
Lloyd George set up a new small War Cabinet initially comprising Lords Curzon and Milner, Bonar Law, Arthur Henderson and himself; Hankey became the Secretary with Sykes, Ormsby-Gore and Amery as assistants. Although Balfour replaced Grey as Foreign Secretary, his exclusion from the War Cabinet and the activist stance of its members weakened his influence over foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;'"The erosion of Foreign Office influence in the making of foreign policy, 1916–1918", Roberta M.Warman, ''The Historical Journal'', CUP, Vol. 15, No. 1, Mar. 1972, pp. 133–159&lt;/ref&gt;

The French chose Picot as French High Commissioner for the soon to be occupied territory of Syria and Palestine. The British appointed Sykes as Chief Political Officer to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. On 3 April 1917, Sykes met with Lloyd George, Curzon and Hankey to receive his instructions in this regard, namely to keep the French onside while pressing for a British Palestine. First Sykes in early May and then Picot and Sykes together visited the [[Hejaz]] later in May to discuss the agreement with Faisal and Hussein.&lt;ref name="Twice"&gt;Isaiah Friedman, ''Palestine, a Twice-promised Land?: The British, the Arabs &amp; Zionism, 1915–1920'' (Transaction Publishers 2000), {{ISBN|1-56000-391-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|166}} Hussein was persuaded to agree to a formula to the effect that the French would pursue the same policy in Syria as the British in Baghdad; since Hussein believed that Baghdad would be part of the Arab State, that had eventually satisfied him. Later reports from participants expressed doubts about the precise nature of the discussions and the degree to which Hussein had really been informed as to the terms of Sykes–Picot.&lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|165}}

Italy's participation in the war, governed by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], eventually led to the [[Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] in April 1917; at this conference, Lloyd George had raised the question of a British protectorate of Palestine and the idea "had been very coldly received" by the French and the Italians. The War Cabinet, reviewing this conference on 25 April, "inclined to the view that sooner or later the Sykes–Picot Agreement might have to be reconsidered ... No action should be taken at present in this matter".&lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|281}}

In between the meetings with Hussein, Sykes had informed London that "the sooner French Military Mission is removed from Hedjaz the better" and then [[Francis Bertie, 1st Viscount Bertie of Thame|Lord Bertie]] was instructed to request the same from the French on the grounds that the mission was hostile to the Arab cause and which "cannot but prejudice Allied relations and policy in the Hedjaz and may even affect whole future of French relations with the Arabs". After the French response to this, on 31 May 1917, [[William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech|William Ormsby-Gore]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The British Government, in authorising the letters despatched to King Hussein [Sharif of Mecca] before the outbreak of the revolt by Sir Henry McMahon, would seem to raise a doubt as to whether our pledges to King Hussein as head of the Arab nation are consistent with French intentions to make not only Syria but Upper Mesopotamia another Tunis. If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguished origin and prestige means anything it means that we are prepared to recognize the full sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria. It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our detailed pledges to King Hussein, and to make it clear to the latter whether he or someone else is to be the ruler of Damascus, which is the one possible capital for an Arab State, which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.&lt;ref&gt;UK National Archives CAB/24/143, Eastern Report, No. XVIII, May 31, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a further sign of British discontent with Sykes-Picot, in August, Sykes penned a "Memorandum on the Asia Minor Agreement" that was tantamount to advocating its renegotiation else that it be made clear to the French that they "make good – that is to say that if they cannot make a military effort compatible with their policy they should modify their policy". After many discussions, Sykes was directed to conclude with Picot an agreement or supplement to Sykes-Picot ("Projet d'Arrangement") covering the "future status of the Hejaz and Arabia" and this was achieved by the end of September. However, by the end of the year, the agreement had yet to be ratified by the French Government.&lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|422}}

The [[Balfour Declaration]] along with its potential claim in Palestine was in the meantime issued on 2 November and the British entered Jerusalem on December 9, with Allenby on foot 2 days later accompanied by representatives of the French and Italian detachments.

====After public disclosure (1917–18)====
[[File:Skyes Picot, The Manchester Guardian, Monday, November 26, 1917, p5.jpg|thumb|right|Excerpt from the [[Manchester Guardian]], Monday, November 26, 1917, This was the first English-language reference to what became known as the Sykes Picot Agreement.]]
Russian claims in the Ottoman Empire were denied following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Bolshevik Revolution]] and the [[Bolshevik]]s released a copy of the Sykes–Picot Agreement (as well as other treaties). They revealed full texts in ''[[Izvestia]]'' and ''[[Pravda]]'' on 23 November 1917; subsequently, the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' printed the texts on November 26, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS094.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327062139/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS094.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df=}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused great embarrassment between the allies and growing distrust between them and the Arabs. The [[Zionist]]s had previously confirmed the details of the Agreement with the British government, earlier in April.&lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|207}}
[[President Wilson|Wilson]] had rejected all secret agreements made between the Allies and promoted open diplomacy as well as ideas about self-determination. On 22 November 1917, Leon Trotsky, addressed a note to the ambassadors at Petrograd "containing proposals for a truce and a democratic peace without annexation and without indemnities, based on the principle of the independence of nations, and of their right to determine the nature of their own development themselves". Peace negotiations with the Quadruple Alliance – Germany, Austria–Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey – started at Brest–Litovsk one month later. On behalf of the Quadruple Alliance, [[Ottokar Czernin|Count Czernin]], replied on 25 December that the "question of State allegiance of national groups which possess no State independence" should be solved by "every State with its peoples independently in a constitutional manner", and that "the right of minorities forms an essential component part of the constitutional right of peoples to self- determination".

In his turn, Lloyd George delivered a speech on war aims on 5 January, including references to the right of self-determination and "consent of the governed" as well as to secret treaties and the changed circumstances regarding them. Three days later, Wilson weighed in with his [[Fourteen Points]], the twelfth being that "the Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development".

On December 23, 1917, Sykes (who had been sent to France in mid-December to see what was happening with the Projet d'Arrangement) and a representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs had delivered public addresses to the Central Syrian Congress in Paris on the non-Turkish elements of the Ottoman Empire, including liberated Jerusalem. Sykes had stated that the accomplished fact of the independence of the Hejaz rendered it almost impossible that an effective and real autonomy should be refused to Syria. However, the minutes also record that the Syrian Arabs in Egypt were not happy with developments and absent a clearer, less ambiguous statement in regard to the future of Syria and Mesopotamia then the Allies as well as the King of the Hedjaz would lose much Arab support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1918Supp01v01&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=243 ''Foreign Relations of the United States, 1918''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007170639/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1918Supp01v01&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=243# |date=2017-10-07 }}. Supplement 1, The World War Volume I, Part I: The continuation and conclusion of the war—participation of the United States, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

Sykes was the author of the [[Hogarth Message]] a secret January 1918 message to Hussein following his request for an explanation of the Balfour Declaration and the [[Bassett Letter]] was a letter (also secret) dated 8 February 1918 from the British Government to Hussein following his request for an explanation of the Sykes–Picot Agreement.

The failure of the Projet d'Arrangement reflected poorly on Sykes and following on from the doubts about his explanations of Sykes-Picot to Hussein the previous year, weakened his credibility on Middle Eastern affairs throughout 1918. Still (at his own request, now Acting Adviser on Arabian and Palestine Affairs at the Foreign Office) he continued his criticism of Sykes-Picot, minuting on 16 February that "the Anglo–French Agreement of 1916 in regard to Asia Minor should come up for reconsideration"  and then on 3 March, writing to Clayton, "the stipulations in regard to the red and blue areas can only be regarded as quite contrary to the spirit of every ministerial speech that has been made for the last three months".

On 28 March 1918 the first meeting of the newly formed [[Eastern Committee]] was held, chaired by Curzon.{{efn|group=lower-alpha|Formed from the merger in March of the Middle East Committee (previously the Mesopotamia Administration Committee) with the Foreign Office Committee on Russia and the interdepartmental Persia Committee.}}

In May, Clayton told Balfour that Picot had, in response to a suggestion that the agreement was moot, "allowed that considerable revision was required in view of changes that had taken place in the situation since agreement was drawn up", but nevertheless considered that "agreement holds, at any rate principle".

The British issued the [[Declaration to the Seven]] on June 16 the first British pronouncement to the Arabs advancing the principle of national self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paris |first=Timothy J. |title=Britain, the Hashemites, and Arab Rule, 1920-1925: the Sherifian solution |publisher=Frank Cass |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=0-7146-5451-5 |pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 1918, supporters of the [[Arab Revolt]] in Damascus declared a government loyal to the Sharif of Mecca. He had been declared King of the Arabs by a handful of religious leaders and other notables in Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhSge_Tq09sC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=Zw1GSY3JBpXyNty-kCw&amp;client=#PPA6,M1 Jordan: Living in the Crossfire, Alan George, Zed Books, 2005], {{ISBN|1-84277-471-9}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglo-French Declaration]] of November 1918 pledged that Great Britain and France would "assist in the establishment of indigenous Governments and administrations in Syria and Mesopotamia" by "setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations". The French had reluctantly agreed to issue the declaration at the insistence of the British. Minutes of a British War Cabinet meeting reveal that the British had cited the laws of conquest and military occupation to avoid sharing the administration with the French under a civilian regime. The British stressed that the terms of the Anglo–French declaration had superseded the Sykes–Picot Agreement in order to justify fresh negotiations over the allocation of the territories of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Allenby and General Strategy in the Middle East, 1917–1919'', By Matthew Hughes, Taylor and Francis, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7146-4473-0}}, 113–118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Curzon]] said the Great Powers were still committed to the [[Règlement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|Règlement Organique]] agreement, which concerned governance and non-intervention in the affairs of the [[Maronite]], [[Orthodox Christian]], [[Druze]], and [[Muslim]] communities, regarding the [[Beirut Vilayet]] of June 1861 and September 1864, and added that the rights granted to France in what is today modern Syria and parts of Turkey under Sykes–Picot were incompatible with that agreement.&lt;ref&gt;CAB 27/24, E.C. 41 War Cabinet Eastern Committee Minutes, December 5, 1918&lt;/ref&gt;

At the French embassy in London on Sunday December 1, David Lloyd George and Clemenceau had a private meeting where the latter surrendered French rights to Mosul and to Palestine that had been given by the Sykes–Picot Agreement. There are conflicting views as to whether or not France received anything in exchange. Although Lloyd George and others have suggested that nothing was given in return, according to Rutledge and others, Lloyd George promised at least one or even all of, support for French claims on the Ruhr, that when oil production in Mosul began, France would receive a share and that Sykes–Picot obligation would be maintained as regards Syria.

At the Peace Conference, which officially opened on 18 January, [[The Big Four (World War I)|The Big Four]] (initially, a "Council of Ten" comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan) agreed, on 30 January, the outlines of a [[League of Nations mandate|Mandate]] system (including three levels of Mandate) later to become Article 22 of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations|League Covenant]]. The Big Four would later decide which communities, under what conditions and which Mandatory.

Minutes taken during a meeting of The Big Four held in Paris on March 20, 1919 and attended by [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Georges Clemenceau]], [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] as well as Lloyd George and Lord Balfour,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05.p0011&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M ''The Council of Four: minutes of meetings March 20 to May 24, 1919''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004160426/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05.p0011&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M# |date=2009-10-04 }}, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; explained the British and French points of view concerning the agreement.

In the subsequent discussions, France staked its claim to Syria (and its mandate) while the British sought to carve out the Arab areas of zones A and B arguing that France had implicitly accepted such an arrangement even though it was the British that had entered into the arrangement with the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=7|title=FRUS: Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, The Paris Peace Conference, 1919: The Council of Four: minutes of meetings March 20 to May 24, 1919|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|access-date=2009-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604162736/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=7#|archive-date=2011-06-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson intervened and stressed the principle of [[consent of the governed]] whether it be Syria or Mesopotamia, that he thought the issues involved the peace of the world and were not necessarily just a matter between France and Britain. He suggested that an Inter-Allied Commission be formed and sent out to find out the wishes of local inhabitants in the region. The discussion concluded with Wilson agreeing to draft a Terms of Reference to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=9|title=FRUS: Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, The Paris Peace Conference, 1919: The Council of Four: minutes of meetings March 20 to May 24, 1919|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807153225/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=9#|archive-date=2017-08-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April, Faisal left for the East. Before he left, on 17 April Clemenceau sent a draft letter, in which the French government declared that they recognized "the right of Syria to independence in the form of a federation of autonomous governments in agreement with the traditions and wishes of the populations", and claimed that Faisal had recognized "that France is the Power qualified to render Syria the assistance of various advisors necessary to introduce order and realise the progress demanded by the Syrian populations" and on 20 April, Faisal assured Clemenceau that he had been "Deeply impressed by the disinterested friendliness of your statements to me while I was in Paris, and must thank you for having been the first to suggest the dispatch of the inter-allied Commission, which is to leave shortly for the East to ascertain the wishes of the local peoples as to the future organisation of their country. I am sure that the people of Syria will know how to show you their gratitude."&lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|353}}

Meanwhile, as of late May, the standoff between the French and the British as to disposition of forces continued, the French continued to press for a replacement of British by French troops in Syria amid arguments about precise geographical limits of same and in general the relationship suffered; after the meeting on the 21st, Lloyd George had written to Clemenceau and cancelled the [[Long–Bérenger Oil Agreement]] (a revised version of which had been agreed at the end of April) claiming to have known nothing about it and not wanting it to become an issue while Clemenceau claimed that had not been the subject of any argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=760|title=FRUS: Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, The Paris Peace Conference, 1919: The Council of Four: minutes of meetings March 20 to May 24, 1919|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808235341/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=760#|archive-date=2017-08-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=807|title=FRUS: Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, The Paris Peace Conference, 1919: The Council of Four: minutes of meetings March 20 to May 24, 1919|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808235401/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv05&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=807#|archive-date=2017-08-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1919, the American [[King–Crane Commission]] arrived in Syria to inquire into local public opinion about the future of the country. After many vicissitudes, "mired in confusion and intrigue",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Allawi|first=Ali A.|title=Faisal I of Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_t_AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA309|date=11 March 2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12732-4|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;"Lloyd George had second thoughts...",&lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|352}} the French and British had declined to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv06.p0144&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv06&amp;isize=M|title=FRUS: Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, The Paris Peace Conference, 1919: The Council of Four: minutes of meetings May 24 to June 28, 1919|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808154636/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv06.p0144&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv06&amp;isize=M#|archive-date=2017-08-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syrian National Congress]] had been convened in May 1919 to consider the future of [[Greater Syria]] and to present Arab views contained in a July 2 resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bcc-cuny.digication.com/MWHreader/Resolutions_of_the_General_Syrian_Congress_1919 |title=Resolutions of the General Syrian Congress |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=July 2, 1919 |website=Documenting Modern World History |access-date=August 8, 2017 |quote=... resolved to submit the following as defining the aspirations of the people who have chosen us to place them before the American section of the Inter-Allied Commission. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808155226/https://bcc-cuny.digication.com/MWHreader/Resolutions_of_the_General_Syrian_Congress_1919# |archive-date=2017-08-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the King-Crane Commission.

The [[Treaty of Versailles|Peace treaty with Germany]] was signed on 28 June and with the departure of Wilson and Lloyd George from Paris, the result was that the Turkey/Syria question was effectively placed on hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv07&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=193|title=FRUS: Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, The Paris Peace Conference, 1919: The Council of Heads of Delegations: minutes of meetings July 1 to August 28, 1919|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808235337/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv07&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=193#|archive-date=2017-08-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September, the British handed out an Aide Memoire (which had been discussed privately two days before between Lloyd George and Clemenceau &lt;ref name="Lieshout" /&gt;{{rp|374 }}) whereby the British would withdraw their troops to Palestine and Mesopotamia and hand over Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo to Faisal's forces. While accepting the withdrawal, Clemenceau continued to insist on the Sykes–Picot agreement as being the basis for all discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1919Parisv08/d12|title=Notes of a Meeting of the Heads of Delegations of the Five Great Powers, Paris, 15 September, 1919|access-date=August 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809172056/https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1919Parisv08/d12#|archive-date=2017-08-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September, Faisal arrived in London and the next day and on the 23rd had lengthy meetings with Lloyd George who explained the Aide Memoire and British position. Lloyd George explained that he was "in the position of a man who had inherited two sets of engagements, those to King Hussein and those to the French", Faisal noting that the arrangement "seemed to be based on the 1916 agreement between the British and the French". Clemenceau, replying in respect of the Aide Memoire, refused to move on Syria and said that the matter should be left for the French to handle directly with Faisal.

Faisal arrived Paris on 20 October and eventually on 6 January 1920 Faisal accepted a French mandate "for the whole of Syria", while France in return consented "to the formation of an Arab state that included Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, and was to be administered by the Emir with the assistance of French advisers" (acknowledged "the right of Syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation".&lt;ref&gt;''Britain, the Hashemites and Arab Rule, 1920–1925'', by Timothy J. Paris, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7146-5451-5}}, page 69&lt;/ref&gt;). In the meantime, British forces withdrew from Damascus on 26 November.

Fiasal returned to Damascus on 16 January and [[Alexandre Millerand|Millerand]] took over from Clemenceau on the 20th. A Syrian National Congress meeting in Damascus declared an independent state of Syria on the 8th of March 1920. The new state intended to include portions of Syria, Palestine, and northern Mesopotamia. Faisal was declared the head of State. At the same time Prince Zeid, Faisal's brother, was declared Regent of Mesopotamia.

In April 1920, the [[San Remo conference]] handed out Class A mandates over Syria to France, and Iraq and Palestine to Britain. The same conference ratified [[San Remo Oil Agreement|an oil agreement]] reached at a London conference on 12 February, based on a slightly different version of the Long Berenger agreement previously initialled in London on 21 December.

France had decided to govern Syria directly, and took action to enforce the [[French Mandate of Syria]] before the terms had been accepted by the Council of the League of Nations. The French issued an ultimatum and intervened militarily at the [[Battle of Maysalun]] in June 1920. They deposed the indigenous Arab government, and removed King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920. Great Britain also appointed a [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|High Commissioner]] and established their own mandatory regime in Palestine, without first obtaining approval from the Council of the League of Nations, or obtaining the formal cession of the territory from the former sovereign, Turkey.

===Iraq and the Persian Gulf===
In November 1914, the British had occupied [[Basra]]. According to the report of the [[de Bunsen Committee]], British interests in Mesopotamia were defined by the need to protect the western flank of India and protect commercial interests including oil. The British also became concerned about the [[Baghdad Railway|Berlin-Baghdad Railway]]. Although never ratified, the British had also initialled the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]].

As part of the [[Mesopotamian Campaign]], on 11 March 1917, the British entered Baghdad, the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October 1918 although the British continued their advance, entering Mosul on the 14 November.

Following the award of  the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] at San Remo, the British were faced with an [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] from July through February 1921 as well as [[Mahmud Barzanji revolts|a Kurdish revolt]] in Northern Iraq. Following the [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo conference]] it was decided that Faisal should be installed as ruler in [[Mandatory Iraq]].

===The Kurds and Assyrians===
[[File:Ethnographic Eastern Turkey.jpg|thumb|An ethnographic map of Eastern Turkey after WW1&lt;ref name="zgOzp"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink = Isaiah Bowman| last = Bowman| first =Isaiah| title = The New World: Problems in Political Geography| date = 1921| publisher = World Book Company| location = New York|p = 445}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As originally cast, Sykes-Picot allocated part of Northern Kurdistan and a substantial part of the Mosul vilayet including the city of Mosul to France in area B, Russia obtained Bitlis and Van in Northern Kurdistan (the contemplated Arab State included Kurds in its Eastern limit split between A and B areas). Bowman says there were around 2.5 million Kurds in Turkey, mainly in the mountain region called [[Kurdistan]].&lt;ref name="zgOzp" /&gt;

[[File:TreatyOfSevres (corrected).PNG|thumb|Partitioning of Ottoman Turkey according to the aborted Treaty of Sèvres|left]]

Sharif Pasha presented a "Memorandum on the Claims of the Kurd People" to the Paris peace Conference in 1919  and the suppressed report of the [[King–Crane Commission]] also recommended a form of autonomy in "the natural geographical area which lies between the proposed Armenia on the north and Mesopotamia on the south, with the divide between the Euphrates and the Tigris as the western boundary, and the Persian frontier as the eastern boundary".

The Russians gave up territorial claims following the Bolshevik revolution and at the [[San Remo conference]], the French were awarded the [[French Mandate of Syria]] and the English the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. The subsequent [[Treaty of Sèvres]] potentially provided for a Kurdish territory subject to a referendum and League of Nations sanction within a year of the treaty. However the [[Turkish War of Independence]] led to the treaty being superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in which there was no provision for a Kurdish State.

The end result was that the Kurds, along with their Assyrian neighbors, were included in the territories of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran.

==Conflicting promises and consequences==
{{main article|McMahon–Hussein Correspondence}}

Many sources contend that Sykes-Picot conflicted with the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence of 1915–1916 and that the publication of the agreement in November 1917 caused the resignation of Sir [[Henry McMahon]].&lt;ref&gt;See CAB 24/271, Cabinet Paper 203(37)&lt;/ref&gt; There were several points of difference, the most obvious being Iraq placed in the British red area and less obviously, the idea that British and French advisors would be in control of the area designated as being for an Arab State. Lastly, while the correspondence made no mention of Palestine, Haifa and Acre were to be British and the brown area (a reduced Palestine) internationalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink = Malcolm Yapp| last = Yapp| first = Malcolm| title = The Making of the Modern Near East 1792–1923| date = 1987| publisher = Longman| location = Harlow, England| isbn = 978-0-582-49380-3|p = 281–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Captive''''', formerly '''''Queen of the Night''''' and '''''Captives''''', is a 2014 Canadian [[thriller film]] directed by [[Atom Egoyan]] with a script he co-wrote with David Fraser. The film stars [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Scott Speedman]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Mireille Enos]], [[Kevin Durand]], and [[Alexia Fast]]. It was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] in the main competition section at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Cannes2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/60533.html |title=2014 Official Selection |accessdate=17 April 2014 |website=Cannes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Howell, Peter|title=We Shoot, We Score at Cannes festival|work=Toronto Star|date= 18 April 2014|page= E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was  released in select theaters and on demand on December 12, 2014.

The film has a nonlinear presentation, and only context differentiates the current scenes from the flashbacks. Additionally, although the film takes place over eight years, all of the scenes take place during winter for dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/atom-egoyans-the-captive-review-cannes/|title=Atom Egoyan's THE CAPTIVE fails to captivate Cannes|first=Talia|last=Soghomonian|date=2014-05-18|website=Collider|accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
At a police station in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], homicide detective Jeffrey Cornwall is sitting down for a job interview with Nicole Dunlop, who works in the Internet Child Exploitation Unit. He recoils in disgust after seeing the images related to an open case, but Nicole advises him these are the types of images he will have to see every day and not look away from.

Meanwhile, local contractor Matthew Lane picks up his 9-year-old daughter, Cassandra, after her figure skating practice. On the way home, Matthew stops to pick up pie, leaving Cassandra in his truck. Minutes later, he returns to find her missing. He reports the abduction to the police station, where Jeffrey and Nicole are assigned to the case. They are skeptical of his story, which infuriates him. Cassandra's mother, Tina Lane, arrives and breaks down in a fit of fury directed at Matthew.

Eight years later, Matthew and Tina are estranged, while Nicole and Jeffrey are romantically involved. Tina still provides details to the police but Matthew, initially a target of suspicion himself, has become a vigilante in the search for Cassandra.

Meanwhile, the whole time, Cassandra has been held captive in the home of a [[child pornographer]] named Mika, who has installed remote cameras in the rooms where Tina works as a chambermaid. Although he leaves his house to work and is no longer sexually interested in the now-teenaged Cassandra, the fear that he will harm her parents constrains her from escaping or seeking help.

A break in the case comes when Jeffrey finds recent photos of Cassandra online. More begin to appear as Mika has her tell stories on camera, hoping they will help lure in younger children.

Nicole poses as a child, which allows her and Jeffrey to trick a child molester named Willy to reveal himself. The arrests of Willy and others in his group catapult Nicole into the public eye.

Mika visits Willy in prison and urges him not to take any deals for cooperation. Willy says he will only comply if someone kidnaps Nicole and forces her to reveal whatever details of her past may have inspired her to pursue child protection. Mika initially dismisses the request as unfeasible, but ultimately complies.

Mika decides to watch an encounter between Cassandra and her father. When Matthew is transporting trees in his truck, Mika goes to the motel where he is sleeping and sets up the trees so that they lead to a clearing in the road. Matthew follows the trail in the morning which leads him to Cassandra. Shocked to see her, he begins a rushed discussion with her. Cassandra resists the opportunity to get in the truck, and Matthew cannot figure out why until Mika appears and [[tranquilizer gun|tranquilizes]] him.

Cassandra begins [[Online chat|chatting online]] with a young girl, trying to entice her to meet. When Nicole arrives home, she is horrified to see Jeffrey is so desperate to find Cassandra that he is using his own niece as bait to infiltrate the child porn community. Mika [[camfecting|turns the webcam back on]] to watch their fight and reconsiders Willy's offer.

At a dinner where Nicole is being honored, a disguised woman doing Mika's bidding pours a sedative into Nicole's drink. As Nicole is collapsing, the woman offers her a ride home. After getting in the car with Nicole, she removes a wig revealing herself to be an accomplice of Mika's named Vicky.

Mika locks Nicole in a van and tells her to tell her story into a microphone. Meanwhile, Vicky travels to the ice skating arena, where she questions Cassandra's former skating partner, Albert, questions about their tradition of wearing mismatched skates, their trophy, and the impact on Albert of his partner's disappearance.

Matthew overhears them and becomes suspicious. He follows Vicky to a restaurant, where she replays her and Albert's recorded conversation for Mika. Matthew calls Jeffrey with the location and says that he'll plant his [[mobile phone tracking|phone's GPS]] on the suspects' vehicle.

Once inside, Matthew acts disruptive, goading the diner staff to summon the police. He confronts the abductors to buy more time and steals Vicky's cell phone, causing her and Mika to chase him after he leaves. In the ensuing chase, Vicky shoots at Matthew's truck.

After the chase concludes, Jeffrey is able to get a fix on Mika's house through the GPS tracking on Matthew's phone. A team arrives to rescue Cassandra, resulting in Vicky and Mika's deaths, and leaving Nicole's whereabouts unknown.

The Lane family is finally reunited. Later, a search team arrives at the van where Nicole is trapped and rescues her. The movie ends with Cassandra ice skating and smiling.

== Reception ==
Before its release, the film had been received negatively.  Justin Chang from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as "a ludicrous abduction thriller that finds a once-great filmmaker slipping into previously un-entered realms of self-parody".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-atom-egoyans-the-captive-1201183274/|title=Cannes Film Review: ‘The Captive’|first=Justin|last=Chang|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Bradshaw from ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented, "it looks worryingly as if Egoyan has taken a serious issue and burdened it to breaking point and beyond with his own indulgent, naïve and exploitative fantasies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/16/the-captive-cannes-2014-review-ryan-reynolds|title=Cannes 2014: The Captive review - Ryan Reynolds stars in Atom Egoyan's worrying crass paedophile thriller|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Zeitchik of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' compliments moments when the film "hints at emotions and mysteries with a delightful subtlety for a while", but remarks that it includes "some wild plots and conspiracies that wouldn't be out of place in the most fantastical spy novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-et-mn-cannes-atom-egoyans-ryan-reynolds-the-captive-20140516-story.html|title=Cannes 2014: Atom Egoyan's 'The Captive' performs a self-abduction|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Steven|last=Zeitchik|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] rating of 31% based on 49 reviews, with its consensus stating: "Wan and lugubrious, ''The Captive'' represents another atmospheric, beautifully filmed misfire from director Atom Egoyan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_captive_2014/ |title=The Captive |date=2014 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's [[Metacritic]] score is 36 out of 100 based on 19 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-captive-2014 |title=The Captive |date=2014|publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Republican War on Science''''' is a 2005 book by [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris C. Mooney]], an American [[journalist]] who focuses on the politics of [[science policy]]. In the book, Mooney discusses the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] leadership's stance on science, and in particular that of the [[George W. Bush administration]], with regard to issues such as [[global warming]], the [[creation–evolution controversy]], [[bioethics]], [[alternative medicine]], [[pollution]], [[separation of church and state]], and the government funding of education, research, and [[environmental protection]].  The book argues that the administration regularly distorted and/or suppressed scientific research to further its own political aims.

The book was reviewed in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' as well as the popular press. It was featured on the cover of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and selected as an "Editors' Choice" by ''[[The New York Times]]'' which described it as, "A frankly polemical survey of scientific findings and procedures in collision with political operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Editors' Choice |department= Browsing Books |date= 25 December 2005 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/books/review/1225bb-hardcover.html |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= 2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[Morgan Spurlock]] (of ''[[Super Size Me]]'' fame) optioned the rights for the book to create a documentary film,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/16/AR2005121601711.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |title='Science' Scooped Up |date=December 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2008 announced that he had released the option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2008/04/see_morgan_thats_why_you_shoul.php |title=See Morgan?

== Reviews ==
===In scientific journals===
A review in ''Science'' by [[Naomi Oreskes]] states the author recounts the 20-year campaign by "influential Republicans—initially in Congress and now also in the White House—in concert with determined allies in private industry and fundamentalist Christian organizations" to systematically deny, disparage and misrepresent scientific information related to public policy. She gave the following list of topics, "acid rain, global warming, the efficacy of condoms in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, the health impacts of excess dietary sugar and fat, the alleged link between abortion and breast cancer, the status of endangered species, the efficacy of abstinence-only sex education programs, the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells, and more." Oreskes goes on to detail the tactics used in the attempt to mislead both the public and politicians, "misrepresenting real debates, exaggerating uncertainty, interfering with the activities of expert agencies, trumpeting the views of outlier scientists whose interpretations are rarely to be found in the refereed literature, and attacking the integrity of genuine experts." She states that Mooney points out that multiple misinformation campaigns have involved the same individuals and groups. Oreskes concludes, "Mooney's book makes it clear that when sensible people stand on the sidelines, a great deal of nonsense can be spread."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Oreskes |first= Naomi |authorlink= Naomi Oreskes |date= 7 October 2005 |title= Anti-realism in government |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume= 310 |issue= 5745 |doi=  10.1126/science.1115765 |page= 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Stebbins]] wrote in ''Nature Medicine'' that "This book should serve as a harsh wake-up call to the scientific community and the American public." He stated that Mooney "painstakingly documents the roots of the efforts to undercut the influence of science on national policy and the relentless politicization of US science policy by conservatives working on behalf of the Republican Party." He notes that the author clearly documents the "Bush administrations' attacks on the integrity of science information" listing examples that include some of those mentioned by Oreskes and "undercutting the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act, and stacking agencies and advisory committees with unqualified ideologues." Stebbins credits the book with providing context by detailing the tactics employed by "conservative Republicans" and establishing the roots of these undercutting techniques with examples from the last 40 years. He goes on to state, "Mooney's documentation of the willful manipulation of science on the part of conservatives to suit an agenda is well supported and nauseating." Stebbins addresses two criticisms of the book, the first, that it doesn't explain the science involved, which he explains is not the purpose of the book, and the second, that it doesn't detail the misuse of science by democrats and liberals, which he dismisses as untrue. He finds issue with the last chapter, which proposes solutions, stating, "His suggestions are sound and well thought out, but seem more of an afterthought than a real goal of the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stebbins |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Stebbins |date= April 2006 |title= The wake-up call |journal= [[Nature Medicine]] |volume= 12 |issue= 4 |page= 381 |doi=10.1038/nm0406-381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Sarewitz panned the book in a review in ''[[Issues in Science and Technology]]'' describing it as a, "tiresome polemic masquerading as a defense of scientific purity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Daniel |last= Sarewitz |title= Scientizing politics |journal= [[Issues in Science and Technology]] |volume= 22 |issue= 2 |year= 2006 |pages= 91–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the popular press===
In a positive review in ''[[Scientific American]]'' Boyce Rensenberger described the book as, "a well-researched, closely argued and amply referenced indictment of the right wing's assault on science and scientists."&lt;ref name= "SciAm"&gt;{{cite news |last= Rensenberger |first= Boyce |date= 24 September 2005 |title= Science abuse |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-abuse/ |magazine= [[Scientific American]] |accessdate= 2014-04-24 |type= book review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lisa Margonelli of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' wrote that Mooney, "juggled extensive research and sharp arguments [...] with precision and a showman’s wink that made his unpromising subject fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/review/Margonelli-t.html |title= Wild is the wind |last= Margonelli |first= Lisa |date= 1 July 2007 |newspaper= [[The New York Times Book Review]] |accessdate= 2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keay Davidson wrote in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that "Mooney's political heart is in the right place" but says "Mooney is like a judge who interprets a law one way to convict his enemies and another way to acquit his friends."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/15/AR2005091501881.html "Research and the Right", The republican war on science reviewed] by Keay Davidson, [[The Washington Post]] September 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''The New York Times'', [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] said of the book that the [[prose]] was "often clunky and clichéd", but explains that Mooney "addresses a vitally important topic and gets it basically right." Horgan defends the book against another reviewer's criticism, saying "the journalist Keay Davidson faults Mooney for not acknowledging how hard it can be to distinguish good science from bad... But in many of the cases that [Mooney] examines, demarcation is easy, because one side has an a priori commitment to something other than the truth — God or money, to put it bluntly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/books/review/18horgan.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Political Science | first=John | last=Horgan |authorlink= John Horgan (American journalist) | date=18 December 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Derbyshire, a [[senior lecturer]] at the [[University of Birmingham]] School of Psychology, praises Mooney and notes that he explained how [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] had manipulated the [[uncertainty]] in science "to ensure that Congress rarely hears any consensus opinion that may damage a Bush policy." Derbyshire agrees with Mooney's claim that there is Republican "flagrant twisting" of research findings and that it "violates the integrity of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CAE94.htm |title=Bush isn't the only one who's anti-science |date=28 November 2005 |work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valencian Left''' (in [[Valencian]]: ''Esquerra Valenciana'') is a nationalist Valencian [[left (politics)|leftist]] party founded in the [[Valencian Community]], founded in April, 1998 a group of ex-members of [[Unitat del Poble Valencià]] (Valencian People's Union) formed left this party and went to form a new political group using the vacant name of the historical ''[[Valencian Left (1934)|Esquerra Valenciana]]''.

EV's current president is [[Robert Mora i Sancho|Robert Mora]].

The dissidentgroup of members of [[Unitat del Poble Valencià]] who disagreed with UPV refounding itself as the [[Bloc Nacionalista Valencià]] (Valencian Nationalist Group) (BNV) and went to form their own political party under the EV acronym.

It defined itself as a party "of the National, Republican Left of the [[Valencian Community]]; that fights for political sovereignty and defends the free confederation of this territory with [[Catalonia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]". In 2001 unsuccessful attempts were made towards a merger or alliance with Republican Left of the Valencian Country (ERPV). The agreement granted to the members of Valencian Esquerra (EV) a chair in the executive committee of ERPV for each 12 members who joined her. Later the new alliance would have stood under the designation EV-ERPV. EV took part in the 2003 Valencian Community elections as part of l'Entesa electoral coalition, together with [[United Left (Spain)|Esquerra Unida]] and the [[Confederation of The Greens|Green Party]] of the Land of Valencia.  Although l'Entesa obtained 6 deputies not one of them was a member of EV. In the European elections of 2004 they were part of the [[Europa dels Pobles]] (Europe of the People) list together with [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]], [[Aralar Party|Aralar]] and [[Chunta Aragonesista]] (other regional parties of the Spanish state).

:''See also [[Feminism in Sweden]]''
The status and rights of '''Women in Sweden''' has been affected by culture, religion and social discourses such as by the strong [[Feminism in Sweden|feminist movement]] as well as laws, and changed several times through the [[history of Sweden]].

==History of women in Sweden==
[[File:Blenda uppmanar - August Malmström 1860.jpg|right|300px|thumb|''[[Blenda]]''  by [[August Malmström]] (1829–1901)]]
;'''Viking age'''
During the [[Viking Age]], women had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Grágás]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.&lt;ref name="Borgström"&gt;Borgström Eva {{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.). Libris 8707902.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as ''odalkvinna'', all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man.&lt;ref name="Borgström" /&gt; In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could further more inherit the position as head of the family from a deceased father or brother: a woman with such status was referred to as ''[[ringkvinna]]'', and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, such as the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member, until she married, by which her rights were transferred to her husband.&lt;ref name="Borgström" /&gt; After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as ''maer'' and ''mey'', reached legal majority and had the right to decide of her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law.&lt;ref name="Borgström" /&gt; An exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, as marriages was normally arranged by the clan.&lt;ref name="Borgström" /&gt; Widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women.

Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (''gydja'') and oracles (''sejdkvinna''); they were active within art as poets (''skalder'') and [[rune master]]s, and as merchants and medicine women.&lt;ref&gt;Ingelman-Sundberg, Catharina, ''Forntida kvinnor: jägare, vikingahustru, prästinna'' [Ancient women: hunters, viking wife, priestess], Prisma, Stockholm, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  They may also have been active within military office: the stories about [[shieldmaiden]]s is unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the [[Birka female Viking warrior]] may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed.  
A married woman could divorce and remarry. It was also socially acceptable for a free woman to cohabit with a man and have children with him without marrying him, even if that man was married: a woman in such a position was called ''frilla''.&lt;ref name=Ohlander&gt;Ohlander, Ann-Sofie &amp; Strömberg, Ulla-Britt, Tusen svenska kvinnoår: svensk kvinnohistoria från vikingatid till nutid, 3. (A Thousand Swedish Women's Years: Swedish Women's History from the Viking Age until now), [omarb. och utök.] uppl., Norstedts akademiska förlag, Stockholm, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; There was no distinction made between children born inside or outside of marriage: both had the right to inherit property after their parents, and there was no "legitimate" or "illegitimate" children.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; These rights gradually disappeared from the local county laws after [[Christianization]] in the 11th century.

===Middle ages and early modern age===
During the [[Middle Ages]], the status and rights of women varied between different parts of the country, as the local county laws applied different laws in different counties. The first attempt of a national law was ''[[Magnus Erikssons landslag]]'' from 1350, which established one law for the country side, and one ''[[Stadslagen]]'' (City Law) for the city,&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; a system which was kept by the ''[[Kristofers landslag]]'' from 1442.&lt;ref&gt;Nationalencyklopedin (NE)&lt;/ref&gt; From 1350 onward, the civil status of women were generally the same in both the county law and the city law: an unmarried woman was under the [[coverture]] of her closest male relative, and a wife under the coverture of her husband, while a widow was of legal majority.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt;

In 1608, the law texts of the [[Old Testament]] from the bible were introduced in the law by amendments,&lt;ref&gt;Granström, Görel, Kvinnorna och rätten: från stormaktstid till rösträttsstrid, Hallgren &amp; Fallgren, Uppsala, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; which at least formally significantly worsened women's status. There was, however, a gap between law and practice: despite the fact that unmarried women were legal minors and only widows had the right to represent themselves in court, unmarried women were still in practice allowed to give testimony, sue and represent themselves in court matters, to such a degree that a law reform granted them this right in 1686 to legalize what was already common procedure.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt;

[[File:Christina Gyllenstierna relief 2009 West Aros (crop).jpg|thumb|The national heroine [[Christina Gyllenstierna]] (1494–1559), 16th century sculpture by the altar of [[Västerås Cathedral]].]]
;'''County Law'''
From the ''[[Magnus Erikssons landslag]]'' of 1350 onward, daughters in the country side inherited half as much as sons.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; From 1686, the [[Swedish Church Law 1686]] obliged every parish in the country side to provide elementary education to all children regardless of gender, usually provided by the vicar or a teacher employed by the vicarage.&lt;ref&gt;Du Rietz, Anita, Kvinnors entreprenörskap: under 400 år, 1. uppl., Dialogos, Stockholm, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the country side, professions were regulated by custom rather than laws. When unmarried, a woman from the peasantry would be expected by social custom to serve in the household of another peasant family as a ''piga'' (maid), which was regarded as a way to learn household experience before marriage and was not seen as servitude: when married, the wives of farmers, fishermen and miners all traditionally participated alongside their husbands in their professions, handled them alone in their absence and, if their husbands died without an adult son, in their own name as widows.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; 
At least since the 17th century and until the 19th century, women were known to labor as miners and [[blacksmith]]s, referred to as ''gruvpiga'' (Maid of the Mine).&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt;
 
The custom of a wife acting as the proxy of her husband afforded considerable independence to women especially during the 17th century, when the men were called to serve in numerous wars and their wives were left behind to manage the family affairs in their absence, which was the case both with the wives of common farmer-soldiers as well as with the wives of noblemen, who were left with the responsibility of wast estates and parishes and the task to act as channels to the crown for the estate dependents.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; In the local community, the wives of the parish vicars had a strong position as a sort of caretaker of the parish social welfare, a position maintained by the system of [[Widow Conservation]] until the 19th century.

;'''City Law'''
From the ''[[Magnus Erikssons landslag]]'' of 1350, the city law granted daughters and sons equal inheritance rights.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; In the [[Swedish Church Ordinance 1571]], the city law encouraged parents to provide primary education to their children regardless of sex,&lt;ref&gt;Du Rietz, Anita, Kvinnors entreprenörskap: under 400 år, 1. uppl., Dialogos, Stockholm, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and from the late 16th century onward, the city schools are confirmed to have accepted girls, though normally only in the first classes.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Österberg, red (1997). Jämmerdal &amp; Fröjdesal. Kvinnor i stormaktstidens Sverige. Stockholm: Atlantis AB. {{ISBN|91-7486-355-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ursula Agricola from [[Strasbourg]] and [[Maria Jonae Palmgren]] from Grenna, however, were both accepted at Visingsö [[Gymnasium (school)]] in the 1640s.

From the 14th century until the ''[[Fabriks och Handtwerksordning]]'' and ''[[Handelsordningen]]'' of 1846, many professions in the cities were monopolized by the [[guild]]s. Women were, however, not excluded from guild membership. Widows became members with the license to practice the profession of their late spouse until remarriage: they could also be given a permit to practice some other trade.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; Formally, many guilds excluded married and unmarried women, however in practice there are numerous examples of married and unmarried female guild members.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; There were also exclusively female guilds, such as that of the [[midwife|midwives]] and that of the [[Rower woman]]. In 1460, 180 female guild members were listed for the city of Stockholm: the profession is not stated for the majority of them, but when it is, the most common professions for city women were brewer, baker, seamstress and washer woman, professions which continued to be common for city women in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt;
 
There were also professions outside of the guilds, such as the profession of ''[[Mursmäcka]]''. A woman regardless of personal status could purchase a permit, to be active within trade of export and import without guild membership and be a ''Kontingentborgare''.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; The city also issued the permit of ''månglare''.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt; This was a permit to manufacture and, or, sell goods which was not included in the guild monopolies from stands in the square or in the street, often old clothes, ornaments, jam and cakes, and from 1623, such permits was issued only to those who could prove that they had no other way to support themselves. Such persons were normally women: either widows, or married women whose husbands was unable to support them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historisktidskrift.se/fulltext/2014-1/pdf/HT_2014_1_003-030_lindberg_ling.pdf Historisk Tidskrift 134:1, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Enlightenment===
[[File:Ulrica pasch.jpg|thumb|[[Ulrica Pasch]].]]
The first law to apply the same rights to all women in the entire country by national law (including [[Finland]], then a Swedish province), was the [[Civil Code of 1734]], which, in the question of women's status, was in place more or less unaltered until the second half of the 19th century. In the Civil Code of 1734, all unmarried women were defined as legal minors regardless of age, and placed under the guardianship of their closest male relative (or mother, if the mother was widowed).&lt;ref name=SwerigesRikesLag&gt;Sweriges Rikes Lag. Gillad och Antagen på Riksdagen Åhr 1734&lt;/ref&gt; She was given the right to contest her guardian in court and have another appointed by the court, and when adult, she had the right to make a will.&lt;ref name=SwerigesRikesLag /&gt; Finally, an unmarried woman could be liberated from guardianship by a petition to the monarch. Upon the day of her marriage, she was placed under the [[coverture]] of her husband. However, men was banned from selling the property of their wife without her consent, wives were given the right to sell property and handle affairs in the absence of her husband, and both spouses regardless of gender were secured the right to divorce upon adultery, upon which the innocent party was secured custody of the children.&lt;ref name=SwerigesRikesLag /&gt; When widowed (or divorced), a woman regardless of age reached legal majority.&lt;ref name=SwerigesRikesLag /&gt;

The [[1720 års skråordning|Guild Regulation of 1720]] explicitly granted women permission to be active within the Guilds, and there were several amendments added to it which favored women's professional rights, most of them issued by local city authorities to make it possible for destitute women to support themselves, notably the reform of 1741 dropping guild membership requirement for innkeepers,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mot halva makten – elva historiska essäer om kvinnors strategier och mäns motstånd Redaktör: Ingrid Hagman.

In 1741, a reform abolished the [[Public humiliation]] punishment of ''[[Uppenbar kyrkoplikt]]'' for unmarried mothers to prevent infanticide,&lt;ref&gt;Ohlander, Ann-Sofie, Kärlek, död och frihet: historiska uppsatser om människovärde och livsvillkor i Sverige, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1778, the [[Infanticide Act (Sweden)]] was introduced: in order to spare unmarried mothers from the social stigma which was the common motive for them to kill their infants, mothers were allowed to travel to a place where they were unknown by the community and give birth anonymously, midwives were forbidden to expose their identity, and should they decide to keep their child, their unmarried status was to be hidden by the authorities to spare them social embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;Lindstedt Cronberg, Marie, 'Barnamordsplakatet: en straffrättsreform med oanade konsekvenser', Brottsförebyggande rådets tidskrift Apropå., 1994:1, s. 24-29, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in many ways offered a more public role for women in Sweden, especially within the artistic professions, and women were officially recognized: [[Eva Ekeblad]] was inducted in the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], [[Ulrika Pasch]] in the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]], and [[Elisabeth Olin]] in the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]].

Numerous schools for girls were founded in the 18th century: in 1786, ''[[Societetsskolan]]'', the first serious educational institution for females, was founded. An achievement to arouse attention was that of [[Aurora Liljenroth]], who graduated from the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] of Visingsö in 1788.&lt;ref name="Enqvinlig"&gt;En qvinlig svensk gymnasist för hundra år sedan.

===19th century===
[[File:Sophie von Knorring 1842 001.jpg|thumb|left|The popular writer [[Sophie von Knorring]] by [[Maria Röhl]] in 1842]]

In the first half of the 19th century, a population growth, in combination with changes in society caused by the economic crisis of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[industrialization]], resulted in a growing number of unmarried women, for which the traditional role to support themselves by marriage was not available. Schools open to females normally offered a shallow education of accomplishments, focused on making their students ideal wives and mothers, and virtually the only profession open for an educated woman was that of a [[governess]] or a teacher in a private girls school.&lt;ref name=Kyle&gt;Gunhild Kyle (1972). Svensk flickskola under 1800-talet. [Swedish Girl School in the 19th-century] Göteborg: Kvinnohistoriskt arkiv. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1840s, there was an ongoing debate as to how to provide women with an opportunity to support themselves as useful productive members of society should they fail to marry, without having to rely on the [[charity (practice)|charity]] of relatives or resort to crime.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt; The customary shallow education was harshly criticized, and in 1842, girls were included in the compulsory primary education school system.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt; In parallel, under the pressure of the public debate, the old shallow private girl schools were gradually replaced by a new type of private [[secondary education]] schools for females, with the task to provide them with education useful for a professional life: in 1842, there were only five such schools in Sweden, but a rapid expansion from that point on resulted in the existence of such schools in most Swedish cities already in the 1870s.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt;
 
[[File:Anna Sandström.jpg|thumb|[[Anna Sandström]], reform educator within women's education.]]

The argument of the reformists in parliament, that more professions should be open for women to make it possible for unmarried women to support themselves, caused a row of reforms in women's rights: equal inheritance rights in 1845;&lt;ref&gt;Lilla Focus Uppslagsbok (Little Focus Encyclopedia) Focus Uppslagsböcker AB (1979) (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; equal rights within trade and commerce (1846) and the professions of teacher in the public school system (1853),&lt;ref name="Inger Hultgren 1982"&gt;Inger Hultgren (Swedish): Kvinnors organisation och samhällets beslutsprocess (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Feldsher, organist and dentist&lt;ref name="Carin 1990"&gt;Österberg, Carin et al., Svenska kvinnor: föregångare, nyskapare (Swedish women: predecessors, successors) Lund: Signum 1990. ({{ISBN|91-87896-03-6}}) (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; (1861) and positions at the telegraph- and postal offices (1863).&lt;ref&gt;Lilla Focus Uppslagsbok (Little Focus Encyclopedia) Focus Uppslagsböcker AB (1979) (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Each of these reforms gave the reformists in parliament arguments for further reforms, arguing that it was the responsibility of the state, who had granted women these new rights, to provide them with the education and the juridical status necessary to handle them.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt; As a consequence, in 1858-63, unmarried women were granted legal majority, and after the recommendations made by the radical [[Girl School Committee of 1866]], the profession of a doctor and the right for women to attend university was finally introduced.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt;

The 19th century signified the organization of women to participate in public life and social reform: initially, from the foundation of the ''[[Välgörande fruntimmerssällskapet]]'' in 1819 onward, women organized in civil charitable organizations, which became an acceptable way for a woman to play a public role and achieve social reform, and women became known public role models as social reformers, such as [[Emilie Petersen]], [[Sophia Wilkens]] and [[Maria Cederschiöld (deaconess)]], which lay the foundation for women's participation in public life.

Women's organization, initially charitable, took a more radical form when the feminist movement was established. In 1848, [[Sophie Sager]] aroused controversy when reporting a rape attempt and winning the case in court, after which she became the first woman in Sweden to tour and make public speeches in favor of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Gunhild; Krusenstjerna, Eva von (1993). Kvinnoprofiler. Panorama ([[Natur &amp; Kultur]]), 99-0913791-7. Stockholm: Natur och kultur.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, women arguably organized for the first time to deal with an issue within women's rights, when [[Josefina Deland]] founded the ''Svenska lärarinnors pensionsförening'' (The Society for Retired Female Teachers) to provide for retired female teachers and [[governess]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Chief editor: Nils Bohman, Svenska män och kvinnor. 2, C-F (Swedish Men and Women. 2, C-F) dictionary (1944) (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1856, the ''[[Tidskrift för hemmet]]'' became the first regular feminist spokes organ.  During the second half of the century, the women's movement organized with the [[Married Woman's Property Rights Association]] (1873) and the [[Fredrika-Bremer-Förbundet]] (1884), and started to make demands of their own.
From the 1880s, women such as [[Emilie Rathou]], [[Elma Danielsson]], [[Alina Jägerstedt]] and [[Kata Dahlström]] engaged in the [[temperance movement]], the working class movement, the [[trade union]]s and the political press and media.

===20th century===
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}

In 1902, the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]] was formed to achieve the final reform in women's civil rights: women suffrage.  
Another important goal at this point was to make it possible for women to access the same professions as men on higher levels, which was denied them even when they had the necessary education.  Women were for example able to be a university professor or a doctor in a hospital, but only in private institutions, as positions at such levels in state institutions had civil servant status, which was a fact which prevented women from using their education in equal competition with men.&lt;ref&gt;"Göteborgs universitetsbibliotek: Akademikeryrken". Ub.gu.se. 2010-11-17. Retrieved 2013-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1909, an important step was made when the phrase "Swedish ''man''" was removed from the application forms to public offices and [[civil servant]] occupations, which lifted a number of professional bars and gave women access to many professional opportunities which had until then been denied them even when they had the necessary education.&lt;ref&gt;"Göteborgs universitetsbibliotek: Akademikeryrken". Ub.gu.se. 2010-11-17. Retrieved 2013-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919-21, [[women suffrage]] was finally introduced, which also necessitated a reform in which also married women were finally liberated from the guardianship of their spouses and granted legal majority in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Lilla Focus Uppslagsbok (Little Focus Encyclopedia) Focus Uppslagsböcker AB (1979) (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The women suffrage reform was followed by the ''Behörighetslagen'' (Act of Eligibility) of 1923, in which males and females were formally guaranteed equal access to all professions and positions in society, the only exceptions being military and priesthood positions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Lilla Focus Uppslagsbok (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The last two restrictions were removed in 1958, when women were allowed to become priests, and in a series of reforms between 1980 and 1989, when all military professions were opened to women.&lt;ref&gt;Sundevall, Fia (2011).

==Feminism and women's movement in Sweden==
{{main|Feminism in Sweden}}
[[File:Gudrun Schyman, Fi, 2014, i Stockholm.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Gudrun Schyman speaks for [[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)]] (Fi), in Stockholm]]
Feminism in Sweden dates back to the 17th century and has been discussed in intellectual circles throughout the 18th century. Since [[Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht]]'s famous poem ''Fruntimrens försvar'' (To the Defense of Women, 1761) debate on gender roles and gender equality has become a mainstream topic. Since then, Sweden has remained a forerunner of [[gender equality]] driven by a both intellectual and practical feminist movement.

Today, with its increasing [[multiculturalism]], Swedish society has embraced [[third-wave feminism]]. Sweden's [[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)|Feminist Initiative]] became the second feminist political party (after Miljöpartiet) to win a parliamentary mandate in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Sweden)|2014 European elections]], rediscussing feminism from a decisively [[antiracist]] perspective that includes the perspectives of [[people of color]].

==Specific issues within gender equality==

===Women's suffrage===
[[File:C1910 Signe Bergman Swedish suffragist.jpg|thumb|upright|Swedish suffragist [[Signe Bergman]], around 1910]]
[[File:Demonstrationståg för kvinnorösträtten, Göteborg - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0032617.jpg|thumb|Women's suffrage demonstration in Gothenburg, June 1918.]]

During the [[Age of Liberty]] (1718–1772), Sweden had conditional women suffrage.&lt;ref name = Karlsson&gt;Karlsson Sjögren, Åsa, ''Männen, kvinnorna och rösträtten: medborgarskap och representation 1723-1866'' [Men, women and suffrage: citizenship and representation 1723-1866], Carlsson, Stockholm, 2006 (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the reform of 1865, the local elections consisted of mayoral elections in the cities, and elections of parish vicars in the countryside parishes. The ''Sockenstämma'' was the local parish council who handled local affairs, in which the parish vicar presided and the local peasantry assembled and voted, an informally regulated process in which women are reported to have participated already in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Du Rietz, Anita, Kvinnors entreprenörskap: under 400 år, 1. uppl., Dialogos, Stockholm, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The national elections consisted of the election of the representations to the [[Riksdag of the Estates]].

Suffrage was gender neutral and therefore applied to women as well as men if they filled the qualifications of a voting citizen.{{r|Karlsson}} These qualifications were changed during the course of the 18th century, as well as the local interpretation of the credentials, affecting the number of qualified voters: the qualifications also differed between cities and countryside, as well as local or national elections.{{r|Karlsson}} 
  
Initially, the right to vote in local city elections (mayoral elections) was granted to every ''burgher'', which was defined as a taxpaying citizen with a [[guild]] membership.{{r|Karlsson}} Women as well as men were members of guilds, which resulted in women suffrage for a limited number of women.{{r|Karlsson}} 
In 1734, suffrage in both national and local elections, in cities as well as countryside, was granted to every property owning taxpaying citizen of [[legal majority]].{{r|Karlsson}} This extended suffrage to all taxpaying property owning women whether guild members or not, but excluded married women and the majority of  unmarried women, as married women were defined as legal minors, and unmarried women were minors unless they applied for legal majority by royal dispensation, while widowed and [[divorce]]d women were of legal majority.{{r|Karlsson}} The 1734 reform increased the participation of women in elections from 55 to 71 percent.{{r|Karlsson}}

Between 1726 and 1742, women voted in 17 of 31 examined mayoral elections.{{r|Karlsson}} Reportedly, some women voters in mayoral elections preferred to appoint a male to vote for them by [[Proxy voting|proxy]] in the city hall because they found it embarrassing to do so in person, which was cited as a reason to abolish women suffrage by its opponents.{{r|Karlsson}} The custom to appoint to vote by proxy was however used also by males, and it was in fact common for men, who were absent or ill during elections, to appoint their wives to vote for them.{{r|Karlsson}}
In 1758, women were excluded from mayoral elections by a new regulation by which they could no longer be defined as burghers, but women suffrage was kept in the national elections as well as the country side parish elections.{{r|Karlsson}} Women participated in all of the eleven national elections held up until 1757.{{r|Karlsson}} In 1772, women suffrage in national elections was abolished by demand from the burgher estate. Women suffrage was first abolished for taxpaying unmarried women of legal majority, and then for widows.{{r|Karlsson}}
However, the local interpretation of the prohibition of women suffrage varied, and some cities continued to allow women to vote: in [[Kalmar]], [[Växjö]], [[Västervik]], [[Simrishamn]], [[Ystad]], [[Åmål]], [[Karlstad]], [[Bergslagen]], [[Dalarna]] and [[Norrland]], women was allowed to continue to vote despite the 1772 ban, while in [[Lund]], [[Uppsala]], [[Skara]], [[Åbo]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Marstrand]], women were strictly barred from the vote after 1772.{{r|Karlsson}}

While women suffrage was banned in the mayoral elections in 1758 and in the national elections in 1772, no such bar was ever introduced in the local elections in the country side, were women therefore continued to vote in the local parish elections of vicars.{{r|Karlsson}} In a series of reforms in 1813-1817, unmarried women of legal majority, "Unmarried maiden, who has been declared of legal majority", were given the right to vote in the ''sockestämma'' (local parish council, the predecessor of the communal and city councils), and the ''kyrkoråd'' (local church councils).&lt;ref&gt;Ann Margret Holmgren: Kvinnorösträttens historia i de nordiska länderna (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, a suggestion was raised by the mayor of Strängnäs to reintroduce women suffrage for taxpaying women of legal majority (unmarried, divorced and widowed women) in the mayoral elections, and this right was reintroduced in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Du Rietz, Anita, Kvinnors entreprenörskap: under 400 år, 1. uppl., Dialogos, Stockholm, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, tax-paying women of legal majority (unmarried, divorced and widowed women) were again allowed to vote in municipal elections, making Sweden the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This was after the introduction of a new political system, were a new local authority was introduced: the communal municipal council. The right to vote in municipal elections applied only to people of legal majority, which excluded married women, as they were juridically under the guardianship of their husbands. In 1884 the suggestion to grant women the right to vote in national elections was initially voted down in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Christer Palmquist &amp; Hans Kristian Widberg| title = Millenium. Samhällskunska| publisher = Bonniers| isbn = 91-622-599-54| year = 2004| page = 317| language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1880s, the [[Married Woman's Property Rights Association]] had a campaign to encourage the female voters, qualified to vote in accordance with the 1862 law, to use their vote and increase the participation of women voters in the elections, but there was yet no public demand to women suffrage among women. In 1888, the [[temperance movement|temperance]] activist [[Emilie Rathou]] became the first woman in Sweden to demand the right for [[women suffrage]] in a public speech.&lt;ref&gt;Emilie Rathou, urn:sbl:7563, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Hjördis Levin), hämtad 2015-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, a delegation from the [[Fredrika-Bremer-Förbundet]] presented a suggestion of woman suffrage to prime minister [[Erik Gustaf Boström]]. The delegation was headed by [[Agda Montelius]], accompanied by [[Gertrud Adelborg]], who had written the demand. This was the first time the Swedish women's movement themselves had officially presented a demand for suffrage.

In 1902 the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]] was founded. In 1906 the suggestion of women's suffrage was voted down in parliament again.&lt;ref name="runeberg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nfbo/0225.html |title=Runeberg.org |publisher=Runeberg.org |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, the right to vote in municipal elections were extended to include also married women.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 15. Kromat - Ledvätska&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, women were granted eligibility to municipal councils,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and in the following 1910–11 municipal elections, forty women were elected to different municipal councils,&lt;ref name="runeberg.org"/&gt; [[Gertrud Månsson]] being the first. In 1914 [[Emilia Broomé]] became the first woman in the legislative assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.gu.se/kvinn/portaler/fred/biografier/broome.xml Article] about [[Emilia Broomé]] on the webpage of [[Gothenburg University Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to vote in national elections was not returned to women until 1919, and was practised again in the election of 1921, for the first time in 150 years.&lt;ref name="Karlsson-Sjögren 1866"&gt;Åsa Karlsson-Sjögren: ''Männen, kvinnorna och rösträtten : medborgarskap och representation 1723–1866'' ("Men, women and the vote: citizenship and representation 1723–1866") (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1921 election, the first women were elected to Swedish Parliament after the suffrage: [[Kerstin Hesselgren]] in the Upper chamber and [[Nelly Thüring]] (Social Democrat), [[Agda Östlund]] (Social Democrat) [[Elisabeth Tamm]] (liberal) and [[Bertha Wellin]] (Conservative) in the Lower chamber. [[Karin Kock-Lindberg]] became the first female government minister, and in 1958, [[Ulla Lindström]] became the first acting Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Mikael Sjögren 1966"&gt;(Swedish) Mikael Sjögren, Statsrådet och genusordningen – Ulla Lindström 1954–1966 (Minister and Gender – Ulla Lindström 1954–1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary appointments and elections===
After the 1921 election, the first women were elected to Swedish Parliament after the suffrage: [[Kerstin Hesselgren]] in the Upper chamber and [[Nelly Thüring]] (Social Democrat), [[Agda Östlund]] (Social Democrat) [[Elisabeth Tamm]] (liberal) and [[Bertha Wellin]] (Conservative) in the Lower chamber. It was not be until 1961, however, that women held more than 10% seats in parliament.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt;

In 1947, [[Karin Kock-Lindberg]] became the first female government minister, and in 1958, [[Ulla Lindström]] became the first acting Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Mikael Sjögren 1966"/&gt; It was not be until 1966, however, that there were more than one woman in the cabinet in the same time.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt;

The election of 1994 signified a breakthrough in this aspect: for the first time on history, women had more than 40% of the seats of parliament, and half of the cabinet positions in government. This made Sweden unique in the world at the time.&lt;ref name=Ohlander /&gt;

===Family life===
As in many other Western countries, the connection between fertility and [[marriage]] has been significantly weakened in the past decades. Sweden was one of the first European countries to change its [[social norms]] towards unmarried [[cohabitation]] and childbearing, at a time where this was still seen as unacceptable in many other parts of the continent.

===Reproductive rights and sexuality===
{{Further|Abortion in Sweden}}

Sweden provides for [[sex education]] in schools. The [[Ages of consent in Europe#Sweden|age of consent in Sweden]] is 15. [[Contraception]] was legalized in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Palmquist, Christer; Widberg, Hans Kristian (2004). Millenium Samhällskunskap A (in Swedish). Bonniers. p. 317. {{ISBN|9789162259952}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abortion]] was allowed on certain conditions by the Abortion Act of 1938. Free abortion was permitted through the Abortion Act of 1974.

===Rape law===
In 2018, Sweden passed a law defining sex without consent in clear body language or words as rape, even if no force or threats are used; previously a rape conviction had required proof that the offender used force or that the victim was in a vulnerable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Deutsche Welle Published 7:39 a.m. ET May 25, 2018 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/25/sweden-scraps-rape-law-said-threats-force-must-used/643783002/ |title=Sweden scraps an outdated rape law that said threats or force must be used |publisher=Usatoday.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
