      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20377">The '''APG system''' ('''Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system''') of plant classification is the first version of a modern, mostly [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]]-based, [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|system of plant taxonomy]]. Published in 1998 by the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]], it was replaced by the improved [[APG II system|APG II]] in 2003, [[APG III system]] in 2009 and [[APG IV system]] in 2016.

==History==
The original APG system is unusual in being based, not on total evidence, but on the [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis of the DNA sequences of three genes, two chloroplast genes and one gene coding for ribosomes.  Although based on [[molecular biology|molecular evidence]] only, its constituent groups prove to be supported by other evidence as well, for example [[pollen]] [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] supports the split between the [[eudicots]] and the rest of the former [[dicotyledons]].

The system is rather controversial in its decisions at the family level, splitting a number of long-established families and submerging some other families.  It also is unusual in not using [[botanical name]]s above the level of order, that is, an order is the highest [[rank (botany)|rank]] that will have a formal [[botanical name]] in this system.  Higher groups are defined only as [[clades]], with names such as [[monocots]], [[eudicots]], [[rosids]], [[asterids]].

The APG system was superseded in 2003 by a revision, the [[APG II system]], in 2009 by a next revision, the [[APG III system]], and then in 2016 by a further revision, the [[APG IV system]].

==Groups==

The main groups in the system (all [[rank (botany)|unrank]]ed [[clade]]s) are:

*'''angiosperms :'''
*:'''[[monocots]]'''
*::'''[[commelinoids]]'''
*:'''[[eudicots]]'''
*::'''[[core eudicots]]'''
*:::'''[[rosids]]'''
*::::'''[[eurosids I]]'''
*::::'''[[eurosids II]]'''
*:::'''[[asterids]]'''
*::::'''[[euasterids I]]'''
*::::'''[[euasterids II]]'''

The '''adsorption/bio-oxidation process''' is a two-stage modification of the [[activated sludge]] process used for [[wastewater treatment]]. It consists of a high-loaded A-stage and low-loaded B-stage. The process is operated without a primary [[clarifier]], with the A-stage being an open dynamic biological system. Both stages have separate settling tanks and sludge recycling lines, thus maintaining unique microbial communities in both reactors.

==History==
[[Adsorption]]/bio-oxidation process was invented in the mid-1970s by the professor of the [[RWTH Aachen University]] Botho Böhnke. It was based on the finding, made by the German engineer [[Karl Imhoff]] in the 50th.{{Explain|date=March 2017}} Imhoff stated that the treatment efficiency of 60-80 percent could be achieved in highly loaded activated sludge basins.

In 1977 Böhnke published his first article on adsorption/bio-oxidation process.&lt;ref&gt;Böhnke B. (1977). Das Adsorptions-Belebungsverfahren. Korrespondenz Abwasser, 24. Jahrg., 2/77&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the patent was issued. Extensive research of the following years, conducted by prof. Böhnke together with Bernd and Andreas Diering, ended up in 1985 with the establishment of the company Dr.-Ing. Bernd Diering GmbH. The same year AB-process was for the first time applied in a full-scale at the [[Krefeld]], Germany [[sewage treatment]] plant (800 000 P.E.). In 1990, 19 full scale installations existed in Western Germany alone. Further application of the process in Europe was hindered by the tightening of the effluent discharge requirements with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus. The process came into notice in 2000th again due to the increased interest in [[energy recovery]] from [[wastewater]].

==Principle of operation==
The A-stage, or [[adsorption]] stage is the most innovative component of the process. It is not preceded by [[primary treatment]]. [[File:AB process scheme.png|thumb|Simple schematic description of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process]] Influent organic matter is removed in the A-stage mainly by [[flocculation]] and [[sorption]] to sludge due to the high loading rates (2-10 g BOD • g [[Volatile suspended solids|VSS]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low sludge age (typically 4-10 h). [[Hydrolysis]] of complex organic molecules occurs improving biodegradability of the influent of the B-stage. High loading rates and low sludge age favours development of dynamic [[biocoenosis]] with a large fraction of microorganisms present in the exponential growth phase. Diverse sludge biocoenosis increase variety of organic compounds that can be degraded in the A-stage and makes the process more stable towards the shock loads.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; Altogether, up to 80% of the influent organic matter can be removed in the A-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; The required reactor volume and oxygen supply are lower if compared to the removal in the conventional [[activated sludge]] process.

The B-stage, or bio-oxidation stage, is a typical low-loaded activated sludge process, where [[biodegradation]] of the remaining organic material occurs. The B-stage can be designed for nitrogen and/or phosphorus removal by alternating aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic zones in the reactor.

===Typical operational conditions of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process===

===Advantages of the process===
* Lower aeration requirements decrease energy consumption and aeration costs for 20 percent if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant.&lt;ref name=eolss&gt;[http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c09/E4-11-06-03.pdf Technologies that Transform. Pollutants into Innocuous Components]. www.eolss.net&lt;/ref&gt;
* The volumes of [[Activated sludge#Process description|aeration tanks]] are 40% lower if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant.&lt;ref name=eolss/&gt;
* Increased sludge production in the A-stage results in increased [[biogas]] production in the [[Anaerobic digestion|digester]] (for plants with [[anaerobic digestion]] of excess sludge).&lt;ref name=stowa2010-44&gt;[http://waterenenergie.stowa.nl/upload/publicaties/STOWA%202010-44%20European%20report%20100208%20-%20update.pdf Energy efficiency in the European water industry]. Stowa report #2010-44&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stability towards the shock loads (pH, [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), toxic substances) explained by the wide-ranging biochemical potential, high mutation capacity and adaptability of sludge in the A-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2&gt;Boehnke, B., Diering, B., &amp; Zuckut, S. W. (1997). AB process removes organics and nutrients. Water Environment and Technology, 9(3), 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A-stage can receive higher organic loads than conventional activated sludge systems.
* Effluent concentrations are more stable because of the two-stage process configuration employed.
* Heavy metals are mainly removed with the A-stage sludge. Therefore, B-stage sludge has lower concentrations of heavy metals than sludge from conventional activated sludge process and may comply with the agricultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, J.-L., Zhang, J.-T., Chen, X.,`Yi, H.-X. (2011). Characteristics of heavy-metal translating in adsorption and biodegradation activated sludge process. International Conference on Electric Technology and Civil Engineering, ICETCE 2011 - Proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks of the process===
* Incomplete denitrification is often observed in the B-stage if the influent C/N ratio is low. Direct by-pass of a part of A-stage influent with high organic matter content to the B-stage is used to increase the C/N ratio.
* High sludge production in the A-stage is a drawback for WWTPs that are not equipped with anaerobic digestion of sludge, because it increases sludge treatment costs.
* Sludge from A-stage has poor settling properties.&lt;ref name=stowa2010-44/&gt;

==Nutrient removal==
Nitrogen removal in the A-stage can reach 30-40%, as nitrogen of organic compounds is incorporated in [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]] (UASB) reactor sludge.

The sludge age of the B-stage is typically between 8 and 20 days promoting the growth of [[Nitrification|nitrifiers]]. Therefore, complete nitrification is usually achieved in the B-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; Complete denitrification is difficult to achieve, because of the low C:N ratio in the influent of the B-stage. Insufficient carbon supply of carbon source to the B-stage occurs due to the high efficiency of organic matter removal in the A-stage. The problem can be solved by decreasing organic matter removal in the A-stage, external carbon source supply, intermittent aeration or decreased HRT of the A-stage and/or on-line control of certain operational parameters.&lt;ref name=wenyi&gt;Wenyi, D., Hong, D., Li-an, Z., Jia, M., Baozhen, W. (2006). Operational retrofits of AB process for biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. Water Practice &amp; Technology, 1 (4) doi: 10.2166/WPT.2006078&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal anaerobic and anoxic compartments are introduced before the aerated zone of the B-stage.

Phosphorus removal from the secondary effluent of the B-stage can be achieved by coagulation with ferric and aluminium salts, e.g. FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Xie, J.-L., Shen, X., Peng, Z., Wang, Q. (2011). Study on the phosphorus removal from the secondary effluent of AB process by ferric chloride. 5th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, ICBBE 2011 - Proceedings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Y.-Y., Luo, X.-X., Cheng, J.-H., Luo, G. (2008). Experimental investigation of chemically-enhanced phosphorus removal with adsorption-biodegradation process. Journal of South China University of Technology (Natural Science)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications for municipal wastewater treatment==
The adsorption/bio-oxidation process was applied at the Krefeld plant (800 000 P.E.) in 1985 for the first time. The plant was expanded and modified and currently treats municipal and industrial wastewater of 1 200 000 P.E.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt;

Currently adsorption/bio-oxidation process is applied at the municipal treatment plants in [[Germany]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] (WWTP Dokhaven (Rotterdam), WWTP Utrecht, WWTP Garmerwolde (Groningen) etc.), [[Austria]] (WWTP Salzburg, WWTP Strass etc.), [[Spain]], [[United States|USA]], [[China]] etc.&lt;ref name=stowa2&gt;[http://www.stowa.nl/Upload/Presentatie%20Marthe%20de%20Graaff%20%28Inventarisatie%20van%20AB-systemen%20in%20NL%29%20%282%29.pdf Inventarisatie van AB-systemen in NL]. www.stowa.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

Adsorption/bio-oxidation process is a part of innovative wastewater treatment concept WaterSchoon, realized in the Netherlands. 250 apartments in the new district Noorderhoek ([[Sneek]], the Netherlands) are equipped with separate collection systems for toilet wastewater and the rest of the household wastewater (or so-called [[greywater]]). Both streams are treated separately in order to maximize recovery of resources from wastewater. Adsorption/bio-oxidation process is used for grey water treatment to increase sludge production. Sludge, produced in both stages of the process, is digested together with toilet wastewater in the UASB reactor to maximize energy recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterschoon.nl/index.htm]. www.waterschoon.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications for industrial wastewater treatment==
The adsorption/bio-oxidation process is used for treatment of [[industrial wastewater]] with high COD, including wastewater from:
* [[Environmental impact of paper#Water pollution|Pulp and paper industry]]&lt;ref name=knudsen&gt;Knudsen, L., Pedersen, J. A., &amp; Munck, J. (1994). Advanced treatment of paper mill effluents by a two-stage activated sludge process. Water Science and Technology, 30 (3), 173-181&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Textile industry]]&lt;ref name=schulze-rettmer&gt;Schulze-Rettmer, R., Kim, S. S., &amp; Son, S. S. (1992). Experience with two-stage activated sludge plants for industrial wastewaters in Korea. Water Science and Technology, 25 (4-5), 427-428.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Food industry|Food industry]], including dairy industry &lt;ref name=100years&gt;Jenkins, D. &amp; Wanner, J, (Eds.) (2014). Activated Sludge - 100 Years and Counting. IWA publishing {{ISBN|9781780404943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pharmaceutical industry]]&lt;ref name=100years/&gt;
* [[Tanning (leather)#Health and environmental impact|Leather tanning industry]]&lt;ref name=schulze-rettmer/&gt;

The C/N and C/P ratios of industrial wastewater is often too high for complete aerobic [[biodegradation]] of the influent organic matter, even after the adsorption stage. Addition of nutrients prior to bio-oxidation stage is required in these cases.&lt;ref name=knudsen/&gt;

[[Image:Bird Tracks (5333534601).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bird]] tracks in snow.]]
An '''animal track''' is an imprint left behind in [[soil]], [[snow]], or [[mud]], or on some other ground surface, by an animal walking across it. Animal tracks are used by [[hunter]]s in [[Tracking (hunting)|tracking]] their prey and by [[natural history|naturalists]] to identify animals living in a given area.&lt;ref name="SMZP"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Animal Tracks: What Do They Reveal? |url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/education/classroomscience/animaltracks/default.cfm |date= |work=[[National Zoological Park (United States)|Smithsonian National Zoological Park]] |accessdate=April 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books are commonly used to identify animal tracks, which may look different based on the weight of the particular animal and the type of strata in which they are made.&lt;ref name="NT-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Jonah |title=Field Guides to Animal Tracks |url=http://www.naturetracking.com/books/ |date=2014 |work=NatureTracking.com |accessdate=April 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracks can be [[Fossil trackway|fossil]]ized over millions of years.&lt;ref name="UCMP"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitkus |first1=Allison |last2=Chin |first2=Karen |last3=Lockley |first3=Martin |title=Fossil footprints through geologic time |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/science/trackways/index.php |date= |work=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |accessdate=April 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is for this reason we are able to see fossilized dinosaur tracks in some types of rock formations.  These types of fossils are called [[trace fossils]] since they are a trace of an animal left behind rather than the animal itself. In paleontology, tracks often preserve as sandstone infill, forming a natural mold of the track.&lt;ref name="KAP-2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milàn, J. |author2=Christiansen, P. |author3=Mateus, O. |title=A three-dimensionally preserved sauropod manus impression from the Upper Jurassic of Portugal: implications for sauropod manus shape and locomotor mechanics. |url=http://docentes.fct.unl.pt/omateus/publications/three-dimensionally-preserved-sauropod-manus-impression-upper-jurassic-portugal |date=2005 |journal=''Kaupia'' |volume=14 |pages=47–52 |accessdate=March 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical logic]], the '''arithmetical hierarchy''', '''arithmetic hierarchy''' or '''[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]–[[Andrzej Mostowski|Mostowski]] hierarchy''' classifies certain [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] based on the [[complexity]] of formulas that define them.  Any set that receives a classification is called '''arithmetical'''.

The arithmetical hierarchy is important in [[recursion theory]], [[effective descriptive set theory]], and the study of formal theories such as [[Peano arithmetic]].

The [[Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm]] provides an easy way to get an upper bound on the classifications assigned to a formula and the set it defines.

The [[hyperarithmetical hierarchy]] and the [[analytical hierarchy]] extend the arithmetical hierarchy to classify additional formulas and sets.

== The arithmetical hierarchy of formulas ==

The arithmetical hierarchy assigns classifications to the formulas in the language of [[Peano axioms#First-order theory of arithmetic|first-order arithmetic]].  The classifications are denoted &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; for natural numbers ''n'' (including 0). The Greek letters here are [[lightface]] symbols, which indicates that the formulas do not contain set parameters.

If a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to a formula with only [[bounded quantifier]]s then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is assigned the classifications &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The classifications &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; are defined inductively for every natural number ''n'' using the following rules:
*If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;\exists n_1 \exists n_2\cdots \exists n_k \psi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.
*If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;\forall n_1 \forall n_2\cdots \forall n_k  \psi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Also, a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formula is equivalent to a formula that begins with some [[existential quantifier]]s and alternates &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; times between series of existential and [[universal quantifier]]s; while a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formula is equivalent to a formula that begins with some universal quantifiers and alternates similarly.

Because every formula is equivalent to a formula in [[prenex normal form]], every formula with no set quantifiers is assigned at least one classification.  Because redundant quantifiers can be added to any formula, once a formula is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; it will be assigned the classifications &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_m&lt;/math&gt; for every ''m'' greater than ''n''.  The most important classification assigned to a formula is thus the one with the least ''n'', because this is enough to determine all the other classifications.

== The arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers ==

A set ''X'' of natural numbers is defined by formula &amp;phi; in the language of [[Peano arithmetic]] (the first-order language with symbols "0" for zero, "S" for the successor function, "+" for addition, "&amp;times;" for multiplication, and "=" for equality), if the elements of ''X'' are exactly the numbers that satisfy &amp;phi;.  That is, for all natural numbers ''n'',
:&lt;math&gt;n \in X \Leftrightarrow \mathbb{N} \models \varphi(\underline n),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\underline n&lt;/math&gt; is the numeral in the language of arithmetic corresponding to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. A set is definable in first-order arithmetic if it is defined by some formula in the language of Peano arithmetic.

Each set ''X'' of natural numbers that is definable in first-order arithmetic is assigned classifications of the form &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number, as follows.  If ''X'' is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formula then ''X'' is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt;.  If ''X'' is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formula then ''X'' is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt;.  If ''X'' is both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is assigned the additional classification &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that it rarely makes sense to speak of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formulas; the first quantifier of a formula is either existential or universal. So a &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt; set is not defined by a &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formula; rather, there are both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formulas that define the set.

A parallel definition is used to define the arithmetical hierarchy on finite [[Cartesian power]]s of the set of natural numbers.  Instead of formulas with one free variable, formulas with ''k'' free number variables are used to define the arithmetical hierarchy on sets of ''k''-[[tuple]]s of natural numbers. These are in fact related by the use of a [[pairing function]].

== Relativized arithmetical hierarchies ==

Just as we can define what it means for a set ''X'' to be [[Recursive set|recursive]] relative to another set ''Y'' by allowing the computation defining ''X'' to consult ''Y'' as an oracle we can extend this notion to the whole arithmetic hierarchy and define what it means for ''X'' to be &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; in ''Y'', denoted respectively &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt;.  To do so, fix a set of integers ''Y'' and add a predicate for membership in ''Y'' to the language of Peano arithmetic.  We then say that ''X'' is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; if it is defined by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formula in this expanded language.  In other words, ''X'' is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; if it is defined by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0}_n&lt;/math&gt; formula allowed to ask questions about membership in ''Y''.  Alternatively one can view the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; sets as those sets that can be built starting with sets recursive in ''Y'' and alternately taking [[Union (set theory)|unions]] and [[Intersection (set theory)|intersections]] of these sets up to ''n'' times.

For example, let ''Y'' be a set of integers.  Let ''X'' be the set of numbers divisible by an element of Y.  Then ''X'' is defined by the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(n)=\exists m \exists t (Y(m)\land m\times t = n)&lt;/math&gt; so ''X'' is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,Y}_1&lt;/math&gt; (actually it is in &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{0,Y}_0&lt;/math&gt; as well since we could bound both quantifiers by n).

== Arithmetic reducibility and degrees ==

Arithmetical reducibility is an intermediate notion between [[Turing reducibility]] and [[hyperarithmetic reducibility]].

A set is '''arithmetical''' (also '''arithmetic''' and '''arithmetically definable''') if it is defined by some formula in the language of Peano arithmetic.  Equivalently ''X'' is arithmetical if ''X'' is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''n''.   A set ''X'' '''is arithmetical in''' a set ''Y'', denoted &lt;math&gt;X \leq_A Y&lt;/math&gt;, if ''X'' is definable a some formula in the language of Peano arithmetic extended by a predicate for membership in ''Y''. Equivalently, ''X'' is arithmetical in ''Y'' if ''X'' is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Pi^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''n''. A synonym for  &lt;math&gt;X \leq_A Y&lt;/math&gt; is: ''X'' is '''arithmetically reducible''' to ''Y''.

The relation &lt;math&gt;X \leq_A Y&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive and transitive, and thus the relation &lt;math&gt;\equiv_A&lt;/math&gt; defined by the rule

:&lt;math&gt; X \equiv_A Y \Leftrightarrow X \leq_A Y \land Y \leq_A X&lt;/math&gt;
is an equivalence relation.  The equivalence classes of this relation are called the '''arithmetic degrees'''; they are partially ordered under &lt;math&gt;\leq_A&lt;/math&gt;.

==The arithmetical hierarchy of subsets of Cantor and Baire space==

The [[Cantor space]], denoted &lt;math&gt;2^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s; the [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\omega^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. Note that elements of the Cantor space can be identified with sets of integers and elements of the Baire space with functions from integers to integers.

The ordinary axiomatization of [[second-order arithmetic]] uses a set-based language in which the set quantifiers can naturally be viewed as quantifying over Cantor space.   A subset of Cantor space is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; if it is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formula.  The set is assigned the classification &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; if it is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formula.  If the set is both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; then it is given the additional classification &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, let &lt;math&gt;O\subset 2^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all infinite binary strings which aren't all 0 (or equivalently the set of all non-empty sets of integers).  As &lt;math&gt;O=\{ X\in 2^\omega | \exists n (X(n)=1) \} &lt;/math&gt; we see that &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is defined by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; formula and hence is a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; set.

Note that while both the elements of the Cantor space (regarded as sets of integers) and subsets of the Cantor space are classified in arithmetic hierarchies,  these are not the same hierarchy.  In fact the relationship between the two hierarchies is interesting and non-trivial.  For instance the &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; elements of the Cantor space are not (in general) the same as the elements &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of the Cantor space so that &lt;math&gt;\{X\}&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; subset of the Cantor space.  However, many interesting results relate the two hierarchies.

There are two ways that a subset of Baire space can be classified in the arithmetical hierarchy.
*A subset of Baire space has a corresponding subset of Cantor space under the map that takes each function from &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of its graph.   A subset of Baire space is given the classification &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_n&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_n&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the corresponding subset of Cantor space has the same classification.
*An equivalent definition of the analytical hierarchy on Baire space is given by defining the analytical hierarchy of formulas using a functional version of second-order arithmetic; then the analytical hierarchy on subsets of Cantor space can be defined from the hierarchy on Baire space.  This alternate definition gives exactly the same classifications as the first definition.

A parallel definition is used to define the arithmetical hierarchy on finite Cartesian powers of Baire space or Cantor space, using formulas with several free variables.  The arithmetical hierarchy can be defined on any [[effective Polish space]]; the definition is particularly simple for Cantor space and Baire space because they fit with the language of ordinary second-order arithmetic.

Note that we can also define the arithmetic hierarchy of subsets of the Cantor and Baire spaces relative to some set of integers.  In fact boldface &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Sigma}^0_n&lt;/math&gt; is just the union of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; for all sets of integers ''Y''.  Note that the boldface hierarchy is just the standard hierarchy of [[Borel hierarchy|Borel sets]].

== Extensions and variations==

It is possible to define the arithmetical hierarchy of formulas using a language extended with a function symbol for each [[primitive recursive function]].  This variation slightly changes the classification of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0=\Pi^0_0=\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt;, since [[Primitive recursive function#Use in first-order Peano arithmetic|using primitive recursive functions in first-order Peano arithmetic]] requires, in general, an unbounded existential quantifier, and thus some sets that are in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0&lt;/math&gt; by this definition are in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; by the definition given in the beginning of this article. &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; and thus all higher classes in the hierarchy remain unaffected.

A more semantic variation of the hierarchy can be defined on all finitary relations on the natural numbers; the following definition is used.  Every computable relation is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0=\Pi^0_0=\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The classifications &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; are defined inductively with the following rules.
* If the relation &lt;math&gt;R(n_1,\ldots,n_l,m_1,\ldots, m_k)\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; then the relation &lt;math&gt;S(n_1,\ldots, n_l) = \forall m_1\cdots \forall m_k R(n_1,\ldots,n_l,m_1,\ldots,m_k)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
* If the relation &lt;math&gt;R(n_1,\ldots,n_l,m_1,\ldots, m_k)\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; then the relation &lt;math&gt;S(n_1,\ldots,n_l) = \exists m_1\cdots \exists m_k R(n_1,\ldots,n_l,m_1,\ldots,m_k)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
This variation slightly changes the classification of some sets. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0=\Pi^0_0=\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt;, as a class of sets (definable by the relations in the class), is identical to &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_1&lt;/math&gt; as the latter was formerly defined. It can be extended to cover finitary relations on the natural numbers, Baire space, and Cantor space.

== Meaning of the notation==

The following meanings can be attached to the notation for the arithmetical hierarchy on formulas.

The subscript &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the symbols &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; indicates the number of alternations of blocks of universal and existential number quantifiers that are used in a formula.   Moreover, the outermost block is existential in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formulas and universal in &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; formulas.

The superscript &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; in the symbols &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt; indicates the type of the objects being quantified over.  Type 0 objects are natural numbers, and objects of type &lt;math&gt;i+1&lt;/math&gt; are functions that map the set of objects of  type &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to the natural numbers. Quantification over higher type objects, such as functions from natural numbers to natural numbers, is described by a superscript greater than 0, as in the [[analytical hierarchy]]. The superscript 0 indicates quantifiers over numbers, the superscript 1 would indicate quantification over functions from numbers to numbers (type 1 objects), the superscript 2 would correspond to quantification over functions that take a type 1 object and return a number, and so on.

== Examples ==

* The &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; sets of numbers are those definable by a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;\exists n_1 \cdots \exists n_k \psi(n_1,\ldots,n_k,m)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; has only bounded quantifiers.  These are exactly the [[recursively enumerable set]]s.
* The set of natural numbers that are indices for Turing machines that compute total functions is &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Intuitively, an index &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; falls into this set if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; "there is an &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that the Turing machine with index &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; halts on input &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; after &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; steps”.  A complete proof would show that the property displayed in quotes in the previous sentence is definable in the language of Peano arithmetic by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; formula.
* Every &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; subset of Baire space or Cantor space is an open set in the usual topology on the space.  Moreover, for any such set there is a computable enumeration of Gödel numbers of basic open sets whose union is the original set. For this reason, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; sets are sometimes called ''effectively open''.  Similarly, every &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; set is closed and the &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; sets are sometimes called ''effectively closed''.
* Every arithmetical subset of Cantor space or Baire space is a [[Borel set]].  The lightface Borel hierarchy extends the arithmetical hierarchy to include additional Borel sets.  For example, every &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_2&lt;/math&gt; subset of Cantor or Baire space is a &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt; set (that is, a set which equals the intersection of countably many open sets).   Moreover, each of these open sets is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; and the list of Gödel numbers of these open sets has a computable enumeration.  If &lt;math&gt;\phi(X,n,m)&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0&lt;/math&gt; formula with a free set variable ''X'' and free number variables &lt;math&gt;n,m&lt;/math&gt; then the &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_2&lt;/math&gt; set &lt;math&gt;\{X \mid \forall n \exists m \phi(X,n,m)\}&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection of the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\{ X \mid \exists m \phi(X,n,m)\}&lt;/math&gt; as ''n'' ranges over the set of natural numbers.
* The &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0=\Pi^0_0=\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt; formulas can be checked by going over all cases one by one, which is possible because all their quantifiers are bounded. The time for this is polynomial in their arguments (e.g. polynomial in ''n'' for &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;); thus their corresponding decision problems are included in [[E (complexity)|E]] (as ''n'' is exponential in its number of bits). This no longer holds under alternative definitions of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0=\Pi^0_0=\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt;, which allow the use of primitive recursive functions, as now the quantifiers may be bound by any primitive recursive function of the arguments.
* The &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0=\Pi^0_0=\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt; formulas under an alternative definition, that allows the use of primitive recursive functions with bounded quantifiers, correspond to sets of integers of the form &lt;math&gt;\{n: f(n) = 0\}&lt;/math&gt; for a primitive recursive function ''f''. This is because allowing bounded quantifier adds nothing to the definition: for a primitive recursive ''f'', &lt;math&gt;\forall k&lt;n: f(k)=0&lt;/math&gt; is the same as  &lt;math&gt; f(0)+f(1)+...f(n)=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\exists k&lt;n: f(k)=0&lt;/math&gt; is the same as  &lt;math&gt; f(0)*f(1)*...f(n)=0&lt;/math&gt;; with [[course-of-values recursion]] each of these can be defined by a single primitive recursion function.

== Properties ==

The following properties hold for the arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers and the arithmetical hierarchy of subsets of Cantor or Baire space.

* The collections &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; are closed under finite [[union (set theory)|union]]s and finite [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]s of their respective elements.
* A set is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; if and only if its complement is &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt;.  A set is &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the set is both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, in which case its complement will also be &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt;.
* The inclusions &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n \subsetneq \Pi^0_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n \subsetneq \Sigma^0_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; hold for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the hierarchy does not collapse. This is a direct consequence of [[Post's theorem]].
* The inclusions &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n \subsetneq \Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n \subsetneq \Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n \cup \Pi^0_n \subsetneq \Delta^0_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; hold for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;.
:*For example, for a universal Turing machine T, the set of pairs (n,m) such that T halts on n but not on m, is in &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_2&lt;/math&gt; (being computable with an oracle to the halting problem) but not in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1 \cup \Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt;, .
:*&lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0 = \Pi^0_0 = \Delta^0_0 = \Sigma^0_0 \cup \Pi^0_0 \subset \Delta^0_1&lt;/math&gt;. The inclusion is strict by the definition given in this article, but an identity with &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_1&lt;/math&gt; holds under one of the variations of the definition [[Arithmetical hierarchy#Extensions and variations|given above]].

== Relation to Turing machines ==
{{See also|Post's theorem}}

===Computable sets===
If S is a [[Computable function#Computable sets and relations|Turing computable set]], then both S and its [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] are recursively enumerable (if T is a Turing machine giving 1 for inputs in S and 0 otherwise, we may build a Turing machine halting only on the former, and another halting only on the latter).

By [[Post's theorem]], both S and its complement are in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt;. This means that S is both in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; and in &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt;, and hence it is in &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, for every set S in &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_1&lt;/math&gt;, both S and its complement are in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; and are therefore (by [[Post's theorem]]) recursively enumerable by some Turing machines T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. For every number n, exactly one of these halts. We may therefore construct a Turing machine T that alternates between T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, halting and returning 1 when the former halts or halting and returning 0 when the latter halts. Thus T halts on every n and returns whether it is in S, So S is computable.

===Summary of main results===
The Turing computable sets of natural numbers are exactly the sets at level &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_1&lt;/math&gt; of the arithmetical hierarchy.  The recursively enumerable sets are exactly the sets at level &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt;.

No [[oracle machine]]  is capable of solving its own [[halting problem]] (a variation of Turing's proof applies).  The halting problem for a &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{0,Y}_n&lt;/math&gt; oracle in fact sits in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,Y}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Post's theorem]] establishes a close connection between the arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers and the [[Turing degree]]s.  In particular, it establishes the following facts  for all ''n'' ≥ 1:
* The set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; (the ''n''th [[Turing jump]] of the empty set) is [[Many-one reduction|many-one complete]] in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt;.
* The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \setminus \emptyset^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is many-one complete in &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_n&lt;/math&gt;.
* The set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset^{(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Turing complete set|Turing complete]] in &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_n&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[polynomial hierarchy]] is a "feasible resource-bounded" version of the arithmetical hierarchy in which polynomial length bounds are placed on the numbers involved (or, equivalently, polynomial time bounds are placed on the Turing machines involved).  It gives a finer classification of some sets of natural numbers that are at level &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_1&lt;/math&gt; of the arithmetical hierarchy.

'''Aidoh''' is an [[shortening]] for ''Art In Defence Of Humanism''. AIDOH was created by the Danish artist [[Jens Galschiot]] as a [[interest group|group]] focusing on the inhuman treatment of [[people]] in different countries related to political, religious or economic interests. The group has with several occasions started a public debate about the individual countries overconsumption or governments repressive treatment of its own [[people]].

==Manifests==

===My inner beast (1993)===
[[Pigs]] in coats made of 1 ton black [[concrete]]. Is named one of the biggest art [[happening]]s in [[Europe]]. 20 sculptures were placered on public places in [[Europe]] without official approval. It took 55 hours to put the "pigs" up, and the [[happening]] created a lot of public debate.

===The silent death (1995)===
In connection with [[UN]]'s sociale [[summit]] in [[Copenhagen]], were there placed 750 dolls, that pictured dead children in the age of 3–9 years. They were placed on street lamps, benches, fountains and other places to symbolizes the 35.000 children's that dies every day in the [[world]].

===[[Pillar of Shame]] (1997)===
Were placed in [[Hong Kong]] June 4, 1997. Since it has been placed in many other places in the world where the governments does not respect the [[human right]]s. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is in copper and is 8 meters tall. It consists of more than 50 tangled human bodies in pain. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is like a [[Nobel Prize]] in injustice.

===[[WTO]] Hong Kong (2005)===
Following sculptures were placed in [[Hong Kong]] at December 2005:
* Mad Cow Disease

A '''biosand filter''' (BSF) is a point-of-use water treatment system adapted from traditional [[slow sand filter]]s. Biosand filters remove pathogens and suspended solids from water using biological and physical processes that take place in a sand column covered with a [[biofilm]]. BSFs have been shown to remove heavy metals, turbidity, bacteria, viruses and protozoa.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;Elliott, M., Stauber, C., Koksal, F., DiGiano, F., and M. Sobsey (2008). Reduction of E. coli, echovirus type 12 and bacteriophages in an intermittently operated 2 household-scale slow sand filter.Water Research, Volume 42, Issues 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2008|url=http://itacanet.org/eng/water/Section%206%20Water%20treatment/Biosand_filter_CAWST.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSFs also reduce discoloration, odor and unpleasant taste. Studies have shown a correlation between use of BSFs and a decrease in the occurrence of [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and lack of recurring costs, biosand filters are often considered [[appropriate technology]] in developing countries. It is estimated that over 200,000 BSFs are in use worldwide.&lt;ref name="Elliot" /&gt;

==History==

The household biosand filter was proposed by Dr. David Manz in the late 1980s at the [[University of Calgary]], Canada.&lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST History|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/about-us/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was developed from the [[slow sand filter]], a technology that has been used for drinking water purification since the 1800s.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; Initial lab and field tests were conducted in 1991; the system was patented in 1993 &lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"/&gt; and was implemented in the field in [[Nicaragua]]. The Canadian non-profit company [[Center for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology]] ([[CAWST]]) was co-founded in 2001 by David Manz and [[Camille Dow Baker]] to promote education and training in water purification and sanitation including using this technology, and to continue developing it.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; A privately owned company, Hydraid Biosand Water Filter  produces and distributes plans for filters.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydraid Biosand Technology|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosand filter components==

[[File:Ohorizons Concrete BioSand Filter.png|thumb|Basic Diagram of a Concrete BioSand Filter]]

Biosand filters are typically constructed from concrete or plastic.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; At the top of the filter, a tightly fitted lid prevents contamination and unwanted pests from entering the filter. Below this, the diffuser plate prevents disturbance of the [[biofilm]] when water is poured into the filter. Water then travels through the sand column, which removes pathogens and suspended solids. Below the sand column, a layer of gravel prevents sand from entering the drainage layer and clogging the outlet tube. Below the separating layer is the drainage layer consisting of coarser gravel that prevents clogging near the base of the outlet tube.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt;

== Filtration process ==
Pathogens and suspended solids are removed by biological and physical processes that take place in the biolayer and the sand layer. These processes include:
*'''Mechanical trapping:''' Suspended solids and pathogens are trapped in the spaces between the sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Predation:''' Pathogens are consumed by microorganisms in the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Adsorption:''' Pathogens are absorbed into each other and to suspended solids in the water and sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Natural death:''' Pathogens finish their life cycles or die because there is not enough food or oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===During the run===
The high water level (hydraulic head) in the inlet reservoir zone pushes the water through the diffuser and filter, then decreases as water flows evenly through the sand. The flow rate slows because there is less pressure to force the water through the filter. The inlet water contains dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and contaminants. It provides the oxygen required by the microorganisms in the biofilm. Large suspended particles and pathogens are trapped in the top of the sand and partially plug the pore spaces between the sand grains. This causes the flow rate to decrease.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Pause period (idle time)===

Idle time typically comprises greater than 80% of the daily cycle; during this time, microbial attenuation processes are likely to be significant. Most removal occurs where water is in contact with the biofilm. The processes that occur in the biofilm have not been identified.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; When the standing water layer reaches the level of the outlet tube, the flow stops.  Ideally, this should be high enough to keep the biofilm in the sand layer wet and allow oxygen to diffuse through the standing water to the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; The pause period allows microorganisms in the biolayer to consume the pathogens and nutrients in the water. The rate of flow through the filter is restored as they are consumed. If the pause period is too long, the biolayer will consume all of the pathogens and nutrients and will die, reducing the efficiency of the filter when it is used again. The pause period should be between 1 and 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Pathogens in the non-biological zone die from a lack of nutrients and oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

==Maintenance==
Over time, particles accumulate between the filter's sand grains. As more water is poured, a biofilm forms along the top of the diffuser plate. Both of these occurrences cause a decrease in flow rate (clogging and [[bioclogging]]). Although slower flow rates generally improve water filtration due to idle time [APS1], it may become too slow for the users’ convenience. If flow rates fall below 0.1 litres/minute, it is recommended by CAWST to perform maintenance.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; The "swirl and dump", or wet harrowing cleaning technique, is used to restore flow rate. About {{Convert|1|USgal|l}} is poured into the filter before cleaning (assuming the filter is empty). The upper layer of sand is then swirled in a circular motion. Dirty water from the swirling is dumped out and the sand is smoothed out at the top. This process is repeated until flow rate is restored.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Cleaning the diffuser plate, outlet tube, lid, and outside surfaces of the filters regularly is also recommended.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Long-term sustainability and efficacy of biosand filters depends on education and support from knowledgeable support personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sisson|first=Andrew J.|author2=Wampler, PJ |author3=Rediske RR |author4= Molla AR |title=An assessment of long-term biosand filter use and sustainability in the Artibonite Valley near Deschapelles, Haiti|journal=Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|date=January 2013|volume=3|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.2166/washdev.2013.092|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/washdev/003/washdev0030051.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit in Haiti implements an education and follow-up program post-installation of the biosand filter. The program includes visits to the beneficiary homes after one, three and twelve months and another at 5 years from installation date. During each visit, beneficiaries receive repeated instruction about safe water practices and how to take care of the filter. Based on data collected since 2010, between 94% and 99% of filters are still being used regularly 12 months after installation. &lt;ref&gt;cleanwaterforhaiti.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal of contaminants==

===Turbidity===
Results for turbidity reductions vary depending on the turbidity of the influent water. Turbid water contains sand, silt and clay.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt;  Feed turbidity in one study ranged from 1.86 to 3.9 NTU.  In a study water was obtained from sample taps of water treatment plants from three local reservoirs. It poured through a slow sand filter and results showed that turbidity decreased to a mean of 1.45 NTU.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; In another study using surface water a 93% reduction in turbidity was observed.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; As the biofilm above the sand ripens, turbidity removal increases.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Although biosand filters remove much turbidity, slow sand filters, which have a slower filtration rate, remove more.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Heavy metals===
There is limited research on the removal of heavy metals by biosand filters.  In a study conducted in South Africa, the filter removed about 64% of iron and 5% of magnesium.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"&gt;Mwabi, J.K., F.E. Adeyemo and T.O. Mamba. "Household Water Treatment Systems: A Solution to the Production of Safe Drinking." SAO/NASA ADS: ADS Home Page. Web. 22 Dec. 2011. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PCE....36.1120M&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
In laboratory studies, the biosand filter has been found to remove about 98-99% of bacteria.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; In removal of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' it was found that the biosand filter may increase due to biofilm formation over about two months. The removal after this time ranged from 97-99.99% depending on the daily water volume and percent primary effluent added. The addition of primary effluent or waste water facilitates growth of the biofilm which aids bacterial die-off.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Research shows that biosand filters in use in the field remove fewer bacteria than ones in a controlled environment.  In research conducted in 55 households of [[Bonao]], Dominican Republic, the average E. coli reduction was about 93 percent.&lt;ref name="Stauber"/&gt;

===Viruses===
Lab tests have shown that while the filters reduce significant quantities of  E. coli, they remove significantly fewer viruses because viruses are smaller.  In a study using bacteriophages, virus removal ranged between 85% and 95% after 45 days of usage.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; A recent study has suggested that virus removal increases significantly over time, reaching 99.99% after approximately 150 days.&lt;ref name="Virus Removal"&gt;Bradley, I., Straub, A., Maraccini, P., Markazi, Nguyen, T., (2011).  Iron Oxide Amended Biosand Filters for Virus Removal.  Water Research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protozoa===
In one lab test the biosand filter removed more than 99.9% of [[protozoa]].  In tests for one type of protozoa, ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', the filter removed 100% over 29 days of use. It removed 99.98% of the oocysts of another protozoa, ''Cryptosporidium sp.'', possibly due to their smaller size.  This removal was comparable with that of the slow sand filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/point-use-water-treatment/bio-sand-filtrat|title=Biosand Filter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health benefits ==

Studies in the Dominican Republic and Cambodia conducted by the [[University of North Carolina]] and the University of Nevada show that BSF use the reduced occurrence of diarrheal diseases by 47% in all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stauber|first=Christine|author2=Gloria M. Ortiz |author3=Dana P. Loomis |author4=Mark D. Sobsey |title=A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Concrete Biosand Filter and Its Impact on Diarrheal Disease in Bonai, Dominican Republic|journal=The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2009|volume=80|issue=2|pages=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by CAWST in Haiti, 95% of 187 households believed their water quality had improved since using biosand filters to clean it. 80% of users stated that their families’ health had improved since implementation. Such health perceptions on the use of biosand filter has shown to be more positive in long-term users.&lt;ref name="Stauber"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobsey|first=Mark|author2=Christine Stauber |author3=Lisa Casanova |author4=Joseph Brown |author5=Mark Elliott |title=Point of Use Household Drinking Water Filtration: A Practical, Effective Solution for Providing Sustained Access to Safe Drinking Water in the Developing World|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|year=2008|doi=10.1021/es8026133 |volume=43 |pages=970–971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of biosand filters==

===Concrete===

[[Concrete]] filters, of concrete, are the most widespread type of biosand filter.  Concrete is generally preferable to other materials because of the low cost, wide availability and the ability to be constructed on-site. The plans for the concrete filter are distributed openly by CAWST. Several versions have been developed. The CAWST Version 9 biosand filter is constructed with a higher maximum loading rate. Although the filtered water passes EPA water quality standards, it is not optimal.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2010|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/pubs/file/43-pi-for-bsf-manual-complete-english}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research establishes that contact time between the water and the granular material is the leading determinant in purifying water. The CAWST Version 10 biosand filter takes this into account; the volume of the water reservoir is equal to the pore space volume of the sand layer. The maximum loading rate was decreased by 33% to ensure stagnant water is in constant contact with granular material.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"/&gt;

Concrete BioSand filters are typically manufactured using steel molds. The plans for a steel mold are openly distributed by CAWST.

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit organization based in Camp Marie, Haiti manufactures the biosand filters using an adaptation of the steel mold.  &lt;ref&gt;http://cleanwaterforhaiti.org/programs/how-does-the-filter-work/&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-profit organization OHorizons has designed a Wood Mold, based on CAWST’s Version 10 filter, which can function as low-cost alternative. The plans for a Wood Mold are openly available on the OHorizons website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohorizons.org/resources/ OHorizons Wood Mold Construction Manual and Appendix]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic===

Plastic filters are constructed from plastic barrels, usually formed offsite. Hydraid biosand filters are constructed from medical grade plastic with [[ultraviolet]] resistance.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; TivaWater is the newest version of the plastic biosand filter and has several important improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tivawater.com tivawater.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stainless steel===

A stainless steel biosand filter developed by engineers at [[S M Sehgal Foundation]], an NGO based in Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon), India, has been found to perform better than its concrete counterparts and with a wider opportunity for application and adoption in different geographical conditions. The high cost of plastic prevents its use in rural India. The stainless steel filter, called JalKalp, offers increased filtration rate and better portability (than concrete models) and better production quality control. Concrete filters are prone to breakage and can be difficult to transport due to weight (65&amp;nbsp;kg), make it unsuitable especially in remote rural or hilly locations. Common quality issues are variations in construction material and manufacturing flaws. Further, the efflorescence due to salts in water reduces the life of the concrete filter. The newly developed lightweight (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg) stainless steel biosand filter has an edge over concrete filters, overcoming each of those shortcomings and providing better quality control. Besides improving its appearance, stainless steel adds to the strength, reliability, durability, and portability of the filter. Water quality tests demonstrate JalKalp's effectiveness against E coli, total coliforms, turbidity, and iron contamination. This filter integrates the germicidal properties of copper with the conventional filtration. Introduction of copper foil in the drainage zone of JalKalp filter has increased the removal of total coliform and E coli to 100% from contaminated water. S M Sehgal Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the model, which required no electricity, across India through partnerships with like-minded organizations to benefit as many rural families as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Lalit Mohan Sharma and Saurabh Sood, "Reinventing the Biosand Filter: An Easy Solution for Safe Drinking Water," ''IOSR Journals'', International Organization of Scientific Research, Vol 10. Issue 1, pp43-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Reinventing-the-biosand-filter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/jalkalp-water-sands-impurities /|title=JalKalp: Water sands impurities|last=Bhaduri|first=Amita|publisher= “India Water Portal” 13, November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are challenges to creating biosand water filters in developing countries.  Many lack the professional capability of constructing the metal forms to pour the concrete into. Finding proper mesh sizes to sift the sand layers may also be absent.  In Nicaragua you may find metal workers capable of welding rebar for home construction, however, you will not find sheet metal bending equipment to create the metal molds.  Sand is not sold in hardware stores like in the United States. It is most likely purchased by the pickup load from streambeds or pits and the only mesh available is 1/4 inch which is too large. When traveling to a third world country it might be best to take with you the proper mesh screens.

Another problem facing the use of the filters is adoption. Many projects may provide assistance in building the water filters and some may even distribute them but getting the host country nationals to use the filters requires much more dedication.  People need to be connected to water filter owners to insist they use the devices and get them into the habit of using them.  Otherwise several of the filters are abandoned and left unattended in the roads. Simply handing the filters out is insufficient for adoption.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2893">The '''Canadian Ecology Centre (CEC)''' is an [[outdoor education]] complex located within [[Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park]], near the town of [[Mattawa, Ontario]].

== Basic Description ==
The Canadian Ecology Centre site consists of a main building and several smaller cabins on a tract of land within Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park. The CEC is a non-profit organization and was initially supported by proponents within the [[logging]] and [[wood]] industries, such as [[Tembec]], as well as by various levels of government, [[NGO]]s, and public donors to get the Centre off the ground. The CEC facilities, while contemporary in both age and design, are constructed almost entirely out of wood.

The CEC is primarily an educational and research centre, where courses on a wide variety of subjects ranging from local culture and history to biology and science to forestry management and mining are offered to the public. The site is also equipped with high-speed internet access, and can be rented out as a wedding venue, conference or meeting centre. Cabins can also be rented for a nightly rate as an alternative to "tenting it" in the park.

The centre, like much of the surrounding communities, is almost fully [[bilingual]] and offers most programs in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

The CEC is also the  headquarters  for the [[Canadian Institute of Forestry]].

== High School Credit Courses ==
By far the best-known aspect of the CEC, however, is Eco-Camp, which is a summer program offering academic credit to high school students. Formal two-week courses in subjects such as Science, Biology, Environmental Science and Geography are available. The program is residential, and students live on-site for the duration. The most popular programs, a grade 11 and 12 biology courses, are almost invariably booked solid even with two back-to-back offerings of the course.

== Professional Development and Teacher Tours ==
The CEC offers a variety of Professional Development opportunities throughout the year, including the summer months.  Take part in single or multi-day programs that are designed and developed to provide hands-on, informative and engaging learning opportunities as well as opportunities to network with professionals and receive great resources and experiences that will transform and enhance career goals and personal development.

Training and certifications are available for professionals in a variety of fields and areas of interest.

He developed the first laboratory manual of antibody phage with his colleagues at TSRI. The phage display is the most straight-forward technique to study the interactions between various forms of proteins with the virus infected bacteria. With the help of this technique, more studies on operations on specific part of human genes are available.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He created ZF Tools with Jeff Mandell at TSRI. The [[zinc finger proteins]] (ZFPs) can target on the specific zones in [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequences]] which helps the researchers to identify the particular sites in any DNA sequence efficiently with ZF Tools.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;He created the first commercially catalytic antibodies in the world. Catalytic antibody are capable of accomplishing the tasks that have been designed by the researchers in the body, which helps the researchers to understand the mechanisms of the particular zone in human body in order to develop new drugs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Barbas and his co-workers at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] (TSRI) invented antibody-drug conjugates to help create new therapies which can target on specific cell types.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These antibodies are programmed with chemical methods and specialized in treatments of chronic illnesses due to its ability to target on particular sites accurately.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;He studied on [[Hajos–Parrish–Eder–Sauer–Wiechert reaction|Hajos-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction]] and developed theories on [[organocatalysis]] based on the studies of aldolase antibodies with [[L-Proline]]. He found the similarity between the Hajos-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction and the mechanical canalization function happened in the aldolase antibodies and research on the difference between the efficiency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;After researching the nucleic acid libraries, he emphasize on the functions of [[nucleotide triphosphates]] and came up with the idea of the creating the DNA enzymes which can provide vitro DNA selection studies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;He also developed new therapies that can target HIV-1 and some kinds of cancer and put them in&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;to clinical trails.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scripps.edu/barbas/research.html|title=The Barbas Laboratory Research|website=www.scripps.edu|access-date=2018-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228160331/http://www.scripps.edu/barbas/research.html|archive-date=2018-02-28|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
From 1992 to 1995, Barbas won the Scholar of The American Foundation for AIDS Research.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Since 2003, Barbas is an ISI Highly Cited Reseach.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In 2009, Barbas has been honored with numerous awards. New York Times reported that, "He was the recipient of the Investigator Award from the Cancer Research Institute, the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award, Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Pioneer Award and the Tetrahedron Young Investigator Award in Bio-organic and Medicinal Chemistry."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2014, He gain the scholar of The American Foundation for AIDS Research and became a member of  both the American Associate for Advancement of Science and the Academy of Microbiology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Centre for the Study of Developing Societies''' ('''CSDS''') is an [[India]]n research institute for the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. It was founded in 1963 by [[Rajni Kothari]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/1999/481/481%20kothari.htm |title=Personally speaking: Rajni Kothari|publisher=India-seminar.com |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is largely funded by the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] Govt of India.&lt;ref name="csds.in"&gt;[http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=aboutCSDS About CSDS], CSDS website, 30 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[New Delhi]], close to [[Delhi University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=location |title=Getting to CSDS |publisher=Csds.in |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Overview==
Kothari left his position as assistant director of the National Institute of Community Development in 1963 to start the CSDS. It was housed initially in a building owned by the Indian Adult Education Association at Indraprastha Estate, Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview Rajni Kothari, The Centre and Indian reality |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2012/639/639_interview_kothari.htm# |publisher=Seminar |date=2012 |accessdate=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CSDS later moved in 1966-1967 to its present location.

==Library==
The library at CSDS started with a few bookshelves in the basement of IAEA and grew up into a full-fledged one by 1970. It is meant primarily for research and higher learning in the field of social sciences and humanities. The collection consists of about 29,000 books and 5,000 bound volumes of journals and a modest set of reports and booklets. More than 130 journals are received regularly. Apart from works on contemporary themes, the library houses a collection of works on Asia and Africa, arms race and peace movement, non-European perspectives, science studies, ecology and environment, and human rights. There is a separate collection of Hindi books covering a broad range of subjects including literature. The access to the collection has been computerized and the catalogue can be accessed through any computer in the centre. The CSDS library is a member of the [[Developing Libraries Network]] and the [[Social Science Libraries Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=library |title=CSDS - Centre for the Study of Developing Societies |publisher=Csds.in |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data unit==
The CSDS Data Unit, established in 1965, maintains an archive of survey data on political behaviour and attitudes, spanning over four decades. The unit also holds a number of secondary data sets, especially on elections in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csds.in/data_unit.htm |title=CSDS |publisher=Csds.in |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chromatiaceae''' are the main family of [[purple sulfur bacteria]]. Many members conduct an [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]]. They are distinguished from the [[Ectothiorhodospiraceae]] by producing [[sulfur]] globules and storing them inside their cells. Most species of Ectothiorhodospiraceae are also purple sulfur bacteria but they store the globules outside their cells.&lt;ref name=BergeyGamma&gt;George M. Garrity: ''[[Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology]]''. 2. Auflage. Springer, New York, 2005, Volume 2: ''The Proteobacteria, Part B: The Gammaproteobacteria''&lt;/ref&gt; The sulfur is an intermediate in the oxidization of [[sulfide]], which is ultimately converted into [[sulfate]], and may serve as a reserve.&lt;ref name=BergeyGamma /&gt;

''[[Nitrosococcus]]'' belongs to the [[nitrifying bacteria]].&lt;ref name=BergeyGamma /&gt;

Members are found in both anoxygenic parts of fresh and salt water, and are especially common in [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] pools. Also in marine habitats, [[sulfur spring]]s and in [[Soda Lakes|soda]] and sat lake.&lt;ref name=BergeyGamma /&gt;

Chromatiaceae bacteria have been the cause for some low-oxygen lakes turning "blood red", such as [[O.C. Fisher Reservoir]] in San Angelo, Texas USA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/08/02/end-times-texas-lake-turns-blood-red]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">The '''climate gap''' refers to a body of data indicating disparities in how climate change impacts various racial, ethnic and [[socioeconomic]] groups in the United States. The data show that low [[socioeconomic status]] groups and racial and ethnic minorities will experience more negative health and economic impacts from the results of climate change than other populations in the United States. This term, climate gap, was first used in the May 2009 report, “The Climate Gap: Inequalities in How Climate Change Hurts Americans &amp; How to Close the Gap”,&lt;ref&gt;http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/The_Climate_Gap_Full_Report_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2009/05/global-warming-hurts-poor-people-more.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in a concurrent paper published in the journal, ''Environmental Justice'', by Seth B. Shonkoff, Rachel Morello-Frosch and colleagues entitled, "Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies in California".&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009. "Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies" in ''California Environmental Justice'' '''2'''(4): 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
'''Disparate health impacts of climate change'''&lt;br /&gt;
Extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts and floods, are expected to increase in their frequency and intensity in the next hundred years due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are affected by heat-related illness at greater rates due to factors such as lack of access to air conditioning, lack of transportation, occupations that require outdoor work and the heat-island effect in urban neighborhoods.

Higher temperatures resulting from climate change will also increase chemical interactions between nitrogen oxide, volatile organic gases and sunlight, leading to increased concentrations of ambient ozone in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/2007GL031101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Along with particulate matter, ozone is a primary cause of air pollution-related health effects. Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are more likely to live in areas with dangerous levels of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/justice_in_the_air_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829091603/http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/justice_in_the_air_web.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pollution will be exacerbated by climate change, and low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to lack health insurance,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2006/CARB_Full_0306.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; making them increasingly vulnerable to these elevated levels of air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009. Environmental Health and Equity Impacts from Climate Change and Mitigation Policies in California: A Review of the Literature. Publication # CEC-500-2009-038-D. Available at: http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/publications/cat/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Disparate economic impacts of climate change'''&lt;br /&gt;
The proportion of income that low socioeconomic status groups spend on basic necessities such as food, water and energy is already greater than the proportion spent by other populations and is expected to increase as the cost of these necessities increases due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics). 2002. Consumer expenditure
survey. Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, job sectors that employ predominantly low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities such as the agriculture and tourism industries are projected to experience the most dramatic shifts due to climate change, reducing employment opportunities for these populations.&lt;ref&gt;EDD (California Employment Development Department). 2004. Occupational Employment (2002) and Wage (2003) Data, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey Results. Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, due to the lack of access to insurance and emergency credit, less savings, fewer personal resources and disproportionate hardships from previous economic stress, low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are likely to suffer the most pronounced and long-lasting economic impacts from climate change-related extreme weather events such as hurricanes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/6/9/9/pages106994/p106994-1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cracking a wireless network''' is defeating the security of a [[Wireless LAN|wireless local-area network]] (back-jack wireless LAN). A commonly used wireless LAN is a [[Wi-Fi]] network. Wireless LANs have inherent security weaknesses from which wired networks are exempt.&lt;ref&gt;''Hacking Wireless Networks For Dummies'' by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005, pages 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wireless cracking is an information network attack similar to a direct intrusion. Two frequent types of [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] in wireless LANs are those caused by poor configuration, and those caused by weak or flawed [[Cryptographic protocol|security protocols]].

==Wireless network basics==
*Wireless local-area networks are based on [[IEEE 802.11]]. This is a set of standards defined by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hacking Wireless Networks For Dummies'' by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*802.11 networks are either ''infrastructure'' networks or ''ad hoc'' networks. By default, people refer to infrastructure networks. Infrastructure networks are composed of one or more ''[[Wireless access point|access points]]'' that coordinate the wireless traffic between the nodes and often connect the nodes to a wired network, acting as a [[Bridging (networking)|bridge]] or a [[Router (computing)|router]].
**Each access point constitutes a network that is named a ''basic service set'' or BSS. A BSS is identified by a BSSID, usually the [[MAC address]] of the access point.
**Each access point is part of an ''extended service set'' or ESS, which is identified by an ESSID or SSID in short, usually a character string.
**A basic service set consists of one access point and several wireless ''clients''. An extended service set is a configuration with multiple access points and roaming capabilities for the clients. An independent basic service set or IBSS is the ad hoc configuration. This configuration allows wireless clients to connect to each other directly, without an access point as a central manager.&lt;ref&gt;''Hacking Wireless Networks For Dummies'' by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005, pages 179-181.&lt;/ref&gt;
**Access points broadcast a signal regularly to make the network known to clients. They relay traffic from one wireless client to another. Access points may determine which clients may connect, and when clients do, they are said to be ''associated'' with the access point. To obtain access to an access point, both the BSSID and the SSID are required.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ad hoc networks have no access point for central coordination. Each node connects in a peer-to-peer way. This configuration is an ''independent basic service set'' or IBSS. Ad hoc networks also have an SSID.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

==Wireless network frames==
802.11 networks use ''data [[Frame (networking)|frames]]'', ''management frames'', and ''control frames''. Data frames convey the real data, and are similar to those of Ethernet. Management frames maintain both network configuration and connectivity. Control frames manage access to the ether and prevent access points and clients from interfering with each other in the ether. Some information on management frames will be helpful to better understand what programs for ''reconnaissance'' do.
*''Beacon frames'' are used primarily in reconnaissance. They advertise the existence and basic configuration of the network. Each frame contains the BSSID, the SSID, and some information on basic authentication and encryption. Clients use the flow of beacon frames to monitor the signal strength of their access point.
*''Probe request frames'' are almost the same as the beacon frames. A probe request frame is sent from a client when it wants to connect to a wireless network. It contains information about the requested network.
*''Probe response frames'' are sent to clients to answer probe request frames. One response frame answers each request frame, and it contains information on the capabilities and configurations of the network. Useful for reconnaissance.
*''Authentication request frames'' are sent by clients when they want to connect to a network. Authentication precedes association in infrastructure networks. Either ''[[Wired Equivalent Privacy#Authentication|open]]'' authentication or ''shared key'' authentication is possible. After serious flaws were found in shared key authentication, most networks switched to open authentication, combined with a stronger authentication method applied after the association phase.
*''Authentication response frames'' are sent to clients to answer authentication request frames. There is one answer to each request, and it contains either status information or a challenge related to shared key authentication.
*''Association request frames'' are sent by clients to associate with the network. An association request frame contains much of the same information as the probe request contains, and it must have the SSID. This can be used to obtain the SSID when a network is configured to hide the SSID in beacon frames.
*''Association response frames'' are sent to clients to answer an association request frame. They contain a bit of network information and indicate whether the association was successful.
*''Deauthentication'' and ''disassociation frames'' are sent to a node to notify that an authentication or an association has failed and must be established anew.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconnaissance of wireless networks==
''[[Wardriving]]'' is a common method of wireless network reconnaissance. A well-equipped wardriver uses a laptop computer with a [[Wireless network interface controller|wireless card]], an antenna mounted on the car, a [[Inverter (electrical)|power inverter]], a connected [[GPS navigation device|GPS receiver]], and a way to connect to the internet wirelessly. The purpose of wardriving is to locate a wireless network and to collect information about its configuration and associated clients.

The laptop computer and the wireless card must support a mode called ''monitor'' or ''rfmon''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netstumbler===
[[Netstumbler]] is a network discovery program for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It is free. Netstumbler has become one of the most popular programs for wardriving and wireless reconnaissance, although it has a disadvantage. It can be detected easily by most [[Intrusion detection system|wireless intrusion detection systems]], because it [[Network detector#Active scanning|actively probes]] a network to collect information. Netstumbler has integrated support for a GPS unit. With this support, Netstumbler displays GPS coordinate information next to the information about each discovered network, which can be useful for finding specific networks again after having sorted out collected data.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 105-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest release of Netstumbler is of 1 April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sectools.org/|title=''Top 125 Network Security Tools'' by Sectools.org, 2011.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not work well with 64-bit [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metageek.net/support/downloads/|title=''inSSIDer'' by metageek, 2012.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===inSSIDer===
[[inSSIDer]] is a [[Network detector|Wi-Fi network scanner]] for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, [[Windows 7|7]], Windows 8 and Android.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider-for-android/&lt;/ref&gt;  It is free and open source. The software uses the current wireless card or a wireless USB adapter and supports most GPS devices (namely those that use [[NMEA 2000|NMEA 2.3]] or higher). Its [[graphical user interface]] shows MAC address, [[Service set (802.11 network)|SSID]], signal strength, hardware brand, security, and network type of nearby Wi-Fi networks. It can also track the strength of the signals and show them in a time graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/utilities/274282-inssider-a-wi-fi-network-scanner-for-today-s-wardriver |title=InSSIDer: A Wi-Fi Network Scanner for Today's Wardriver |date=November 18, 2008 |author=Henry, Alan |publisher=PCmag.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G5Il6hcV?url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/utilities/274282-inssider-a-wi-fi-network-scanner-for-today-s-wardriver |archivedate=2013-04-23 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider/|title=''inSSIDer'' by metageek, undated.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireshark===
[[Wireshark]] is a packet sniffer and network traffic analyser that can run on all popular operating systems, but support for the capture of wireless traffic is limited. It is free and open source. Decoding and analysing wireless traffic is not the foremost function of Wireshark, but it can give results that cannot be obtained with programs. Wireshark requires sufficient knowledge of the network protocols to obtain a full analysis of the traffic, however.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysers of AirMagnet===
AirMagnet Laptop Analyser and AirMagnet Handheld Analyser are wireless network analysis tools made by [[AirMagnet]]. The company started with the Handheld Analyser, which was very suitable for surveying sites where wireless networks were deployed as well as for finding rogue access points. The Laptop Analyser was released because the hand-held product was impractical for the reconnaissance of wide areas. These commercial analysers probably offer the best combination of powerful analysis and simple user interface. However, they are not as well adapted to the needs of a wardriver as some of the free programs.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://www.Androdumpper.net Androdumpper]===
Androdumpper is an Android APK that is used to test and hack WPS Wireless routers which have a vulnerability by using algorithms to hack into that WIFI network. It runs best on Android version 5.0+

===Airopeek===
[[OmniPeek|Airopeek]] is a packet sniffer and network traffic analyser made by Wildpackets. This commercial program supports Windows and works with most wireless network interface cards. It has become the industrial standard for capturing and analysing wireless traffic. However, like Wireshark, Airopeek requires thorough knowledge of the protocols to use it to its ability.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===KisMac===
[[KisMac]] is a program for the discovery of wireless networks that runs on the OS X operating system. The functionality of KisMac includes GPS support with mapping, SSID decloaking, deauthentication attacks, and [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] cracking.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Penetration of a wireless network==
There are two basic types of vulnerabilities associated with WLANs: those caused by poor configuration and those caused by poor encryption.
Poor configuration causes many vulnerabilities. Wireless networks are often put into use with no or insufficient security settings. With no security settings – the default configuration – access is obtained simply by association. Without sufficient security settings, networks can easily be defeated by [[Service set (802.11 network)#Security gains of SSID hiding|cloaking]] and/or [[MAC filtering|MAC address filtering]].
Poor encryption causes the remaining vulnerabilities. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is defective and can be defeated in several ways. [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA) and Cisco's [[Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol]] (LEAP) are vulnerable to [[dictionary attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encryption types and their attacks===

====Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)====
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=January 2013}}
WEP was the encryption standard firstly available for wireless networks. It can be deployed in 64 and 128 bit strength. 64 bit WEP has a secret key of 40 bits and an [[initialisation vector]] of 24 bits, and is often called 40 bit WEP. 128 bit WEP has a secret key of 104 bits and an initialisation vector of 24 bits, and is called 104 bit WEP. Association is possible using a [[password]], an [[ASCII]] key, or a [[hexadecimal]] key.
There are two methods for cracking WEP: the ''[[Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack|FMS attack]]'' and the ''chopping attack''.
The FMS attack –  named after Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir – is based on a weakness of the [[RC4]] encryption algorithm . The researchers found that 9000 of the possible 16 million initialisation vectors can be considered weak, and collecting enough of them allows the determination of the encryption key. To crack the WEP key in most cases, 5 million encrypted packets must be captured to collect about 3000 weak initialisation vectors. (In some cases 1500 vectors will do, in some other cases more than 5000 are needed for success.) The weak initialisation vectors are supplied to the [[RC4#Key-scheduling algorithm (KSA)|Key Scheduling Algorithm]] (KSA) and the [[RC4#Pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA)|Pseudo Random Generator]] (PRNG) to determine the first byte of the WEP key. This procedure is then repeated for the remaining bytes of the key.
The chopping attack chops the last byte off from the captured encrypted packets. This breaks the [[Cyclic Redundancy Check]]/[[Checksum|Integrity Check Value]] (CRC/ICV). When all 8 bits of the removed byte were zero, the CRC of the shortened packet is made valid again by manipulation of the last four bytes. This manipulation is: result = original XOR certain value. The manipulated packet can then be retransmitted. This method enables the determination of the key by collecting ''unique'' initialisation vectors.
The main problem with both the FMS attack and the chopping attack is that capturing enough packets can take weeks or sometimes months. Fortunately, the speed of capturing packets can be increased by injecting packets into the network. One or more [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) packets are usually collected to this end, and then transmitted to the access point repeatedly until enough response packets have been captured. ARP packets are a good choice because they have a recognizable size of 28 bytes.
Waiting for a legitimate ARP packet can take awhile. ARP packets are most commonly transmitted during an authentication process. Rather than waiting for that, sending a deauthentication frame that pushes a client off the network will require that client to reauthenticate. This often creates an ARP packet.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2)====
WPA was developed because of the vulnerabilities of WEP. WPA uses either a [[pre-shared key]] (WPA-PSK) or is used in combination with a [[RADIUS]] server (WPA-RADIUS). For its encryption algorithm, WPA uses either the [[Temporal Key Integrity Protocol]] (TKIP) or the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES).
[[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA2|WPA2]] was developed because of some vulnerabilities of WPA-PSK and to strengthen the encryption further. WPA2 uses both TKIP and AES, and requires not only an encryption piece but also an authentication piece. A form of the [[Extensible Authentication Protocol]] (EAP) is deployed for this piece.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 285.&lt;/ref&gt;
WPA-PSK can be attacked when the PSK is shorter than 21 characters. Firstly, the four-way EAP Over LAN (EAPOL) [[Handshaking|handshake]] must be captured. This can be captured during a legitimate authentication, or a reauthentication can be forced by sending deauthentication packets to clients. Secondly, each word of a word-list must be [[Cryptographic hash function|hashed]] with the Hashed Message Authentication Code – Secure Hash Algorithm 1 and two so called nonce values, along with the MAC address of the client that asked for authentication and the MAC address of the access point that gave authentication. Word-lists can be found at.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 288.&lt;/ref&gt;
LEAP uses a variation of Microsoft Challenge Handshake Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAPv2). This handshake uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for key selection. LEAP can be cracked with a dictionary attack. The attack involves capturing an authentication sequence and then comparing the last two bytes of a captured response with those generated with a word-list.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 289.&lt;/ref&gt;
WPA-RADIUS cannot be cracked.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 281.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the RADIUS authentication server itself can be cracked, then the whole network is imperilled. The security of authentication servers is often neglected.&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Security Handbook'' by Aaron E. Earle, Auerbach Publications, 2006, page 196.&lt;/ref&gt;
WPA2 can be attacked by using the WPA-PSK attack, but is largely ineffective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Aircrack-ng===
[[Aircrack-ng]] runs on Windows and Linux, and can crack WEP and WPA-PSK. It can use the Pychkine-Tews-Weinmann and KoreK attacks, both are statistical methods that are more efficient than the traditional FMS attack. Aircrack-ng consists of components. Airmon-ng configures the wireless network card. Airodump-ng captures the frames. Aireplay-ng generates traffic. Aircrack-ng does the cracking, using the data collected by airodump-ng. Finally, airdecap-ng decrypts all packets that were captured. Thus, aircrack-ng is the name of the suite and also of one of the components.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 226-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CoWPAtty===
CoWPAtty automates the dictionary attack for WPA-PSK. It runs on Linux. The program is started using a [[command-line interface]], specifying a word-list that contains the passphrase, a dump file that contains the four-way EAPOL handshake, and the SSID of the network.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Void11===
Void11 is a program that deauthenticates clients. It runs on Linux.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 302-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MAC address filtering and its attack===
MAC address filtering can be used alone as an ineffective security measure, or in combination with encryption. The attack is determining an allowed MAC address, and then changing the MAC address of the attacker to that address.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 301.&lt;/ref&gt;
EtherChange is one of the many programs available to change the MAC address of network adapters. It runs on Windows.&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Security Handbook'' by Aaron E. Earle, Auerbach Publications, 2006, pages 319-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===
[[Penetration test]]ing of a wireless network is often a stepping stone for penetration testing of the internal network. The wireless network then serves as a so-called ''entry vector''.&lt;ref&gt;''WarDriving &amp; Wireless Penetration Testing'' by Chris Hurley and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2007, page 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 311.&lt;/ref&gt; If WPA-RADIUS is in use at a target site, another entry vector must be investigated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Reconnaissance of the local-area network==

===Sniffing===
A 'wireless' [[Packet analyzer|sniffer]] can find [[IP address]]es, which is ''helpful'' for network mapping.&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Security Handbook'' by Aaron E. Earle, Auerbach Publications, 2006, page 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

Access points usually connect the nodes of a wireless network to a wired network as a bridge or a router.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Both a bridge and a router use a routing table to forward packets.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Footprinting===
Finding ''relevant'' and ''reachable'' IP addresses is the objective of the reconnaissance phase of attacking an organization over the Internet. The relevant IP addresses are determined by collecting as many [[Domain Name System|DNS]] host names as possible and translating them to IP addresses and IP address ranges. This is called footprinting.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 2-3, 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Web search engine|search engine]] is the key for finding as much information as possible about a target.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, organizations do not want to protect all their resources from internet access. For instance, a [[web server]] must be accessible. Many organizations additionally have [[Message transfer agent|email servers]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers, and other systems that must be accessible over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The IP addresses of an organization are often grouped together. ''If one IP address has been found, the rest probably can be found around it.''&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 19, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Name server]]s store tables that show how domain names must be translated to IP addresses and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; With Windows, the command [[nslookup|NSLookup]] can be used to query DNS servers. When the word help is entered at NSLookup's prompt, a list of all commands is given.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt; With Linux, the command dig can be used to query DNS servers. It displays a list of options when invoked with the option -h only. And the command host reverses IP addresses to hostnames.&lt;ref&gt;''Linux in a Nutshell'', 6th edition, by Ellen Siever and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2009, pages 116-117, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The program [[nmap]] can be used as a reverse DNS walker: nmap -sL 1.1.1.1-30 gives the reverse entries for the given range.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, LACNIC, and AFRINIC are the five [[Regional Internet registry|Regional Internet Registries]] that are responsible for the assignment and registration of IP addresses. All have a website with which their databases can be searched for the owner of an IP address. Some of the Registries respond to a search for the name of an organization with a list of all IP address ranges that are assigned to the name. However, the records of the Registries are not always correct and are in most cases useless.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably most computers with access to the internet receive their IP address dynamically by [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]]. This protocol has become more popular over the last years because of a decrease of available IP addresses and an increase of large networks that are dynamic. DHCP is particularly important when many employees take a portable computer from one office to another. The router/[[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] device that people use at home to connect to the internet probably also functions as a DHCP server.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays many router/DHCP devices perform [[Network Address Translation]] (NAT). The NAT device is a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] between the local network and the internet. Seen from the internet, the NAT device seems to be a single ''host''. With NAT, the local network can use any IP address space. Some IP address ranges are reserved for [[private network]]s. These ranges are typically used for the local area network behind a NAT device, and they are: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 61, 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant IP addresses must be narrowed down to those that are reachable. For this purpose, the process of scanning enters on the scene.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 3, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host scanning===
Once access to a wireless network has been gained, it is helpful to determine the network's topology, including the names of the computers connected to the network. [[Nmap]] can be used for this, which is available in a Windows and a Linux version. However, Nmap does not provide the user with a network diagram. The network scanner Network View that runs on Windows does. ''The program asks for one IP address or an IP address range.'' When the program has finished scanning, it displays a map of the network using different pictures for routers, [[workstation]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]], and [[laptop]]s, all with their names added.&lt;ref&gt;''WarDriving &amp; Wireless Penetration Testing'' by Chris Hurley and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2007, pages 112-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most direct method for finding hosts on a [[Local area network|LAN]] is using the program [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]. When using a modern flavour of [[Unix]], [[Shell (computing)|shell]] commands can be combined to produce custom [[Ping sweep|ping-sweeps]]. When using Windows, the command-line can also be used to create a ping-sweep. Examples are given in the reference.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ping-sweeps are also known as ''host scans''. Nmap can be used for a host scan when the option -sP is added:	nmap -n -sP 10.160.9.1-30 scans the first 30 addresses of the subnet 10.160.9, where the -n option prevents reverse DNS lookups.

Ping packets could reliably determine whether a computer was on line at a specified IP address. Nowadays these [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] echo request packets are sometimes blocked by the firewall of an [[operating system]]. Although Nmap also probes TCP port 80, specifying more TCP ports to probe is recommended when pings are blocked. Consequently, nmap -sP -PS21,22,23,25,80,139,445,3389 10.160.9.1-30 can achieve better results. And by combining various options as in nmap -sP -PS21,22,23,25,80,135,139,445,1025,3389 -PU53,67,68,69,111,161,445,514 -PE -PP -PM 10.160.9.1-30, superb host scanning is achieved.

Nmap is available for Windows and most Unix operating systems, and offers graphical and command-line interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 34-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Port scanning==
The purpose of port scanning is finding the ''open ports'' on the computers that were found with a host scan.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; When a port scan is started on a network without making use of the results of a host scan, much time is wasted when many IP addresses in the address range are vacant.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open ports===
Most programs that communicate over the Internet use either the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or the [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] protocol. Both protocols support 65536 so called ''[[Port (computer networking)|ports]]'' that programs can choose to bind to. This allows programs to run concurrently on one IP address. Most programs have default ports that are most often used. For example, HTTP servers commonly use TCP port 80.

Network scanners try to connect to TCP or UDP ports. When a port accepts a connection, it can be assumed that the commonly bound program is running.

TCP connections begin with a SYN packet being sent from client to server. The server responds with a SYN/ACK packet. Finally, the client sends an ACK packet. When the scanner sends a SYN packet and gets the SYN/ACK packet back, the port is considered open. When a RST packet is received instead, the port is considered closed. When no response is received the port is either considered filtered by a firewall or there is no running host at the IP address.

Scanning UDP ports is more difficult because UDP does not use handshakes and programs tend to discard UDP packets that they cannot process. When an UDP packet is sent to a port that has no program bound to it, an ICMP error packet is returned. That port can then be considered closed. When no answer is received, the port can be considered either filtered by a firewall or open. Many people abandoned UDP scanning because simple UDP scanners cannot distinguish between filtered and open ports.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common ports===
Although it is most thorough to scan all 65536 ports, this would take more time than scanning only the most common ports. Therefore, Nmap scans 1667 TCP ports by default (in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 37-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specifying ports===
The -p option instructs Nmap to scan specified ports, as in nmap -p 21-25,80,100-160 10.150.9.46. Specifying TCP and UDP ports is also possible, as in nmap -pT:21-25,80,U:5000-5500 10.150.9.46.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specifying targets===
Nmap always requires the specification of a host or hosts to scan. A single host can be specified with an IP address or a domain name. Multiple hosts can be specified with IP address ranges. Examples are 1.1.1.1, www.company.com, and 10.1.50.1-5,250-254.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 40-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specifying scan type===

====TCP SYN scan====
Nmap performs a TCP SYN scan by default. In this scan, the packets have only their SYN flag set. The -sS option specifies the default explicitly. When Nmap is started with administrator privileges, this default scan takes effect. When Nmap is started with user privileges, a connect scan is performed.

====TCP connect scan====
The -sT option instructs Nmap to establish a full connection. This scan is inferior to the previous because an additional packet must be sent and logging by the target is more likely. The connect scan is performed when Nmap is executed with user privileges or when IPv6 addresses are scanned.

====TCP null scan====
The -sN option instructs Nmap to send packets that have none of the SYN, RST, and ACK flags set. When the TCP port is closed, a RST packet is sent in return. When the TCP port is open or filtered, there is no response. The null scan can often bypass a stateless firewall, but is not useful when a stateful firewall is employed.

====UDP empty packet scan====
The -sU option instructs Nmap to send UDP packets with no data. When an ICMP error is returned, the port can be assumed closed. When no response is received, the port can be assumed open or filtered. No differentiation between open and filtered ports is a severe limitation.

====UDP application data scan====
The -sU -sV options instruct Nmap to use application data for application identification. This combination of options can lead to very slow scanning.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specifying scan speed===
When packets are sent to a network faster than it can cope with they will be dropped. This leads to inaccurate scanning results. When an intrusion detection system or intrusion prevention system is present on the target network, detection becomes more likely as speed increases. Many [[Intrusion prevention system|IPS]] devices and firewalls respond to a storm of SYN packets by enabling [[SYN cookies]] that make appear every port to be open. Full speed scans can even wreak havoc on [[Stateful firewall|stateful network devices]].

Nmap provides five templates for adjusting speed and also adapts itself. The -T0 option makes it wait for 5 minutes before the next packet is sent, the -T1 option makes it wait for 15 seconds, -T2 inserts 0.4 seconds, -T3 is the default (which leaves timing settings unchanged), -T4 reduces time-outs and retransmissions to speed things up slightly, and -T5 reduces time-outs and retransmissions even more to speed things up significantly. Modern IDS/IPS devices can detect scans that use the -T1 option. The user can also define a new template of settings and use it instead of a provided one.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application identification===
The -sV option instructs Nmap to also determine the version of a running application.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating system identification===
The -O option instructs Nmap to try to determine the operating systems of the targets. Specially crafted packets are sent to open and closed ports and the responses are compared with a database.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saving output===
The -oX &lt;filename&gt; option instructs Nmap to save the output to a file in [[XML]] format.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerability scanning==
A vulnerability is a bug in an application program that affects security. They are made public on places such as the [[Bugtraq|BugTraq]] and the Full-Disclosure mailing lists. The [[Computer emergency response team|Computer Emergency Response Team]] (CERT) brings out a statistical report every year. There were 8064 vulnerabilities counted in 2006 alone.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulnerability scanning is determining whether known vulnerabilities are present on a target.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nessus===
[[Nessus (software)|Nessus]] is probably the best known vulnerability scanner. It is free and has versions for Windows, [[OS X]], Linux, and FreeBSD. Nessus uses plug-ins to find vulnerabilities by sort. Updated plug-ins are regularly released.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nessus offers a non-intrusive scan, an intrusive scan that can harm the target, and a custom scan. A scan requires the IP addresses or [[domain name]]s of the targets. Nessus begins with a port scan to identify the programs that are running and the operating systems of the targets. It ends with a report that specifies all open ports and their associated vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 61-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikto===
[[Nikto Web Scanner|Nikto]] is a web scanner that can identify vulnerable applications and dangerous files. It is open source software and has versions for Windows and Linux. The program uses a command-line interface of the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploitation of a vulnerability==
An [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] takes advantage of a [[Software bug|bug]] in an [[Application software|application]]. This can take effect in the execution of arbitrary commands by inserting them in the execution path of the program. [[Privilege escalation|Escalation of privileges]], bypass of authentication, or infringement of confidentiality can be the result.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Metasploit===
The [[Metasploit Project|Metasploit framework]] was released in 2003. This framework provided for the first time:
*a single ''exploit'' database with easy updating,
*freely combining of an exploit with a ''payload'',
*a consistent interface for setting ''options'', and
*integrated ''encoding'' and ''evasion'',
where:
*an exploit is a code module that uses a particular vulnerability,
*a payload is code that is sent along with the exploit to take some action, such as providing a command-line interface,
*options are used to select variants of exploits and payloads,
*encoding is modifying the payload to circumvent limitations, whether they are caused by the logic of the vulnerability or an inadequate IPS, and
*[[Evasion (network security)|evasion]] is bypassing security devices by employing evasion techniques.

The basic procedure of using Metasploit is: choose an exploit, choose a payload, set the IP address and port of the target, start the exploit, evaluate, and stop or repeat the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 193-194, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metasploit is not suited for finding the vulnerabilities of a host; a [[vulnerability scanner]] is. Alternatively, when a [[port scanner]] has found an [[open port]], all exploits for that port may be tried.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metasploit 3.0 provides the following payloads:
*[[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]] injection. This payload for targets that run Windows gives a graphical user interface  to the target that is synchronized with the graphical user interface of the target.
*File execution. This payload for targets that run Windows uploads a file and executes it.
*Interactive shell. This payload gives a command-line interface to the target.
*Add user. This payload adds a user with specified name and password that has administrator access.
*Meterpreter. This payload gives a rich command-line interface to targets that run Windows.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 203-205, 325.&lt;/ref&gt;
VNC connections need a relatively large [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to be usable, and if someone is in front of the compromised computer then any interaction will be seen very quickly. The command-line interfaces of Linux and OS X are powerful, but that of Windows is not. The Meterpreter payload remedies these shortcomings. The reference gives a list of Meterpreter commands.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintaining control==
The ultimate gratification for a network intruder always is to obtain administrator privileges for a network. When an intruder is inside, one of his or her first undertakings is often to install a so-called ''[[rootkit]]'' on a target computer. This is a collection of programs to facilitate durable influence on a system. Some of these programs are used to compromise new [[User (computing)#User account|user accounts]] or new computers on the network. Other programs are to obscure the presence of the intruder. These obscuring programs may include false versions of standard network utilities such as [[netstat]], or programs that can remove all data from the log files of a computer that relate to the intruder. Yet other programs of a rootkit may be used to survey the network or to overhear more passwords that are travelling over it. Rootkits may also give the means to change the very operating system of the computer it is installed on.

The network intruder then proceeds with creating one or more so called ''[[Backdoor (computing)|back doors]]''. These are access provisions that are hard to find for system administrators, and they serve to prevent the logging and monitoring that results from normal use of the network. A back door may be a concealed account or an account of which the privileges have been escalated. Or it may be a utility for remote access, such as [[Telnet]], that has been configured to operate with a [[port number]] that is not customary.

The network intruder then proceeds with stealing files, or stealing credit card information, or preparing a computer to send spam emails at will. Another goal is to prepare for the next intrusion. A cautious intruder is protective against discovery of his or her location. The method of choice is to use a computer that already has been attacked as an intermediary. Some intruders use a series of intermediate computers, making it impracticable to locate them.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 87, 275, 376-377, 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back doors===
The purpose of a back door is to maintain a communication channel and having methods to control a host that has been gained entry to. These methods include those for file transfer and the execution of programs. It is often important to make sure that the access or communication remains secret. And access control is desirable in order to prevent others from using the back door.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 323-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Back Orifice 2000]] was designed as a back door. The server runs on Windows, and there are [[Client (computing)|clients]] for Windows, Linux and other operating systems. The server is configured easily with a utility. After configuration, the server needs to be uploaded to the target and then started. Back Orifice 2000 supports file transfer, file execution, [[Keystroke logging|logging of keystrokes]], and control of connections. There is also an AES [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for traffic encryption and an STCPIO plug-in for further obfuscation of the traffic. The first plug-in adds security and the combination of these plug-ins makes it much harder for an IDS to relate the traffic to a back door. More information can be found at http://www.bo2k.com.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 334-335, 355-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rootkits===
Rootkits specialize in hiding themselves and other programs.

Hacker Defender (hxdef) is an open source rootkit for Windows. It can hide its files, its process, its [[Windows Registry|registry]] entries, and its port in multiple [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]]. Although it has a simple command-line interface as a back door, it is often better to use its ability to hide a more appropriate tool.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 363-365.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and Protection==
An unprotected wireless network is extremely insecure. From anywhere within broadcast range, someone can eavesdrop or start using the network. Therefore, the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless networks was accompanied with Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). This security protocol takes care of the following:
*''authentication'': assurance that all participants are who they state they are, and are authorized to use the network
*''confidentiality'': protection against eavesdropping
*''integrity'': assurance of data being unaltered
WEP has been criticized by security experts. Most experts regard it as ineffective by now.

In 2004 a draft for a better security protocol appeared, and it was included in the IEEE 802.11 standard in 2007. This new protocol, [[IEEE 802.11i-2004|WPA2]], uses an AES block cipher instead of the RC4 algorithm and has better procedures for authentication and key distribution. WPA2 is much more secure than WEP, but WEP was still in wide use in 2009.

Many wireless routers also support controlling the MAC addresses of computers that are authorized to use a wireless network. This measure can effectively stop a neighbour from using the network, but experienced intruders will not be stopped.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt; MAC filtering can be attacked because a MAC address can be faked easily.

In the past, turning off the broadcasting of the SSID has also been thought to give security to a wireless network. This is not the case however. Freely available tools exist that quickly discover an SSID that is not broadcast. [[Microsoft]] has also determined that switching off the broadcasting of the SSID leads to less security. Details can be found in [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726942.aspx ''Non-broadcast Wireless Networks with Microsoft Windows''].

Returning to encryption, the WEP specification at any encryption strength is unable to withstand determined hacking. Therefore, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) was derived from WEP. Software upgrades are often available. The latest devices that conform to the [[IEEE 802.11g-2003|802.11g]] or [[IEEE 802.11n-2009|802.11n]] standards also support WPA2. (WPA uses the TKIP encryption, WPA2 uses the stronger AES method.) It is recommended to use only hardware that supports WPA or WPA2.&lt;ref&gt;''Upgrading and repairing PC's'', 19th edition, by Scott Mueller, Pearson Education, Inc., 2010, pages 900-901.&lt;/ref&gt;

Installing updates regularly, disabling WPS, setting a custom SSID, requiring WPA2, and using a strong password make a wireless router more difficult to crack.  Even so, unpatched security flaws in a router's software or firmware may still be used by an attacker to bypass encryption and gain control of the device.  Many router manufacturers do not always provide security updates in a timely manner, or at all, especially for more inexpensive models.

WPS currently has a severe vulnerability in which the 8 pin numbered (0-9) passwords being used can easily be split into two halves, this means that each half can be brute-forced individually and so the possible combinations are greatly lessened (10^4 + 10^4, as opposed to 10^8). This vulnerability has been addressed by most manufacturers these days by using a lock down 
mechanism where the router will automatically lock its WPS after a number of failed pin attempts (it can take a number of hours before the router will automatically unlock, some even have to be rebooted which can make WPS attacks completely obsolete). Without a lock down feature, a WPA2 router with WPS enabled can easily be cracked in 5 hours using a brute force WPS attack.

SSID's are used in routers not only to identify them within the mass of 2.4, 3.6, 5 and 60 GHz frequencies which are currently flying around our cities, but are also used as a "seed" for the router's password hashes. Standard and popular SSID's such as "Netgear" can be brute forced through the use of [[rainbow table]]s, however, it should be noted that the use of a salt greatly improves security against rainbow tables. The most popular method of WPA and WPA2 cracking is through obtaining what's known as a "4 way handshake". when a device is connecting with a network
there is a 4-stage authorization process referred to as a 4 way handshake. When a wireless device undergoes this process this handshake is sent through the air and can easily be monitored and saved by an external system. The handshake will be encrypted by the router's password, this means that as opposed to communicating with the router directly (which can be quite slow), the cracker can attempt to brute force the handshake itself using dictionary attacks. A device that is connected directly with the router will still undergo this very process, however, the handshake will be sent through the connected wire as opposed to the air so it cannot be intercepted. If a 4 way handshake has already been intercepted, it does not mean that the cracker will be granted immediate access however. If the password used contains at least 12 characters consisting of both random upper and lower case letters and numbers that do not spell a word, name or have 
any pattern then the password will be essentially uncrackable. Just to give an example of this, let's just take the minimum of 8 characters for WPA2 and suppose we take upper case and lower case letters, digits from 0-9 and a small selection of symbols, we can avail of a hefty choice of 64 characters. In an 8 character length password this is a grand total of 64^8 
possible combinations. Taking a single machine that could attempt 500 passwords per second, this gives us just about 17,900 years to attempt every possible combination. Not even to mention the amount of space necessary to store each combination in a dictionary.

Note:
The use of MAC filtering to protect your network will not work as MACs using the network can be easily detected and spoofed.

==Detection==
A network scanner or sniffer is an application program that makes use of a wireless network interface card. It repeatedly tunes the wireless card successively to a number of radio channels. With a [[Network detector#Passive scanning|passive scanner]] this pertains only to the receiver of the wireless card, and therefore the scanning cannot be detected.

An attacker can obtain a considerable amount of information with a passive scanner, but more information may be obtained by sending crafted frames that provoke useful responses. This is called active scanning or probing. Active scanning also involves the use of the transmitter of the wireless card. The activity can therefore be detected and the wireless card can be located.

Detection is possible with an intrusion detection system for wireless networks, and locating is possible with suitable equipment.

Wireless intrusion detection systems are designed to detect anomalous behaviour. They have one or more sensors that collect SSIDs, radio channels, beacon intervals, encryption, MAC addresses, transmission speeds, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s. Wireless intrusion detection systems maintain a registry of MAC addresses with which unknown clients are detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.wright.edu/%7Epmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/WirelessHacks/Mateti-WirelessHacks.htm|title=''Hacking Techniques in Wireless Networks'' by Prabhaker Mateti, 2005.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

===The Netherlands===
Making use of someone else's wireless access point or wireless router to connect to the internet – without the owner's consent in any way – is not punishable by criminal law in The Netherlands. This is true even if the device uses some form of access protection. To penetrate someone else's computer without the owner's consent is punishable by criminal law though.&lt;ref&gt;''PC Plus'' (Dutch computer magazine), issue 04/2011, page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/21/wi_fi_hacking_holland/|title=''Dutch courts: Wi-Fi 'hacking' is not a crime'' by John Leyden, 2011.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crackers and society==
There is consensus that computer attackers can be divided in the following groups.
*Adolescent amateurs. They often have a basic knowledge of computer systems and apply scripts and techniques that are available on the internet.
*Adult amateurs. Most of them are motivated by the intellectual challenge.
*Professionals. They know much about computers. They are motivated by the financial reward but they are also fond of their activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming of crackers===

The term ''hacker'' was originally used for someone who could modify a computer for his or her own purposes. ''Hacking'' is an intrusion combined with direct alteration of the security or data structures of the breached system. The word hacking is often confused with cracking in popular media discourse, and obfuscates the fact that hacking is less about eavesdropping and more related to interference and alteration.&lt;ref&gt;''Running Linux'', 5th edition, by Matthias Kalle Dalheimer and Matt Welsh, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2005, pages 829-830.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the consistent abuse by the news media, in 2007 the term hacker was commonly used for someone who accesses a network or a computer without authorization of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;''WarDriving &amp; Wireless Penetration Testing'' by Chris Hurley and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Collins English Dictionary|Collins Dictionary]]'' stated that the word hacker can mean a computer fanatic, in particular one who by means of a [[personal computer]] breaks into the computer system of a company, government, or the like. It also denoted that in that sense the word hacker is [[slang]]. Slang words are not appropriate in formal writing or speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins Dictionary'', 11th edition, HarperCollins Publishers, 2011, pages xi, 741.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer experts reserve the word hacker for a very clever programmer. They call someone who breaks into computers an intruder, attacker, or cracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/Ethics/index.html|title=''Ethics in Internet Security'' by Prabhaker Mateti, 2010.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orri, "Decision Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/decision-theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Decision theory can be broken into two branches: [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] decision theory, which gives advice on how to make the [[optimal decision|best decisions]], given a set of uncertain beliefs and a set of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]; and descriptive decision theory, which analyzes how existing, possibly irrational agents actually make decisions.

Closely related to the field of [[game theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myerson|first1=Roger B.|title=Game theory analysis of conflict|date=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674728615|chapter=1.2: Basic concepts of Decision Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; decision theory is concerned with the choices of individual agents whereas game theory is concerned with interactions of agents whose decisions affect each other. Decision theory is an interdisciplinary topic, studied by economists,
statisticians, psychologists, biologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habibi|first=Iman|last2=Cheong|first2=Raymond|last3=Lipniacki|first3=Tomasz|last4=Levchenko|first4=Andre|last5=Emamian|first5=Effat S.|last6=Abdi|first6=Ali|date=2017-04-05|title=Computation and measurement of cell decision making errors using single cell data|url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|volume=13|issue=4|pages=e1005436|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt; political and other social scientists, philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Hansson, Sven Ove. "Decision theory: A brief introduction." (2005) Section 1.2: A truly interdisciplinary subject.&lt;/ref&gt; and computer scientists.

Empirical applications of this rich theory are usually done with the help of [[statistics|statistical]] and [[econometrics|econometric]] methods, especially via the so-called choice models, such as [[probit]] and [[logit]] models. Estimation of such models is usually done via parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric [[maximum likelihood]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947316302596 | doi=10.1016/j.csda.2016.10.024 | volume=108 | title=Nonparametric estimation of dynamic discrete choice models for time series data | year=2017 | journal=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis | pages=97–120 | last1 = Park | first1 = Byeong U. | last2 = Simar | first2 = Léopold | last3 = Zelenyuk | first3 = Valentin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative and descriptive==
[[Normative]] decision theory is concerned with identifying the best decision to make, modelling an ideal decision maker who is able to compute with perfect accuracy and is fully [[rationality|rational]]. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people ''ought to'' make decisions) is called [[decision analysis]], and is aimed at finding tools, methodologies and software ([[decision support system]]s) to help people make better decisions.

In contrast, [[Positive statement|positive]] or descriptive decision theory is concerned with describing observed behaviors under the assumption that the decision-making agents are behaving under some consistent rules. These rules may, for instance, have a procedural framework (e.g. [[Amos Tversky]]'s elimination by aspects model) or an [[axiom]]atic framework, reconciling the [[Expected utility hypothesis#Von Neumann|Von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms]] with behavioral violations of the [[expected utility]] hypothesis, or they may explicitly give a functional form for [[time inconsistency|time-inconsistent]] [[utility function]]s (e.g. Laibson's [[Hyperbolic discounting|quasi-hyperbolic discounting]]).

The prescriptions or predictions about behaviour that positive decision theory produces allow for further tests of the kind of decision-making that occurs in practice. There is a thriving dialogue with [[experimental economics]], which uses laboratory and field experiments to evaluate and inform theory. In recent decades, there has also been increasing interest in what is sometimes called "behavioral decision theory" and this has contributed to a re-evaluation of what rational decision-making requires.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see: {{cite book |author=Anand, Paul |title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-823303-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What kinds of decisions need a theory?==

===Choice under uncertainty=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Risk]] --&gt;
{{Details|Expected utility hypothesis}}
The area of choice under uncertainty represents the heart of decision theory. Known from the 17th century ([[Blaise Pascal]] invoked it in his [[Pascal's Wager|famous wager]], which is contained in his ''[[Pensées]]'', published in 1670), the idea of [[expected value]] is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an "expected value", or the average expectation for an outcome; the action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.  In 1738, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published an influential paper entitled ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk'', in which he uses the [[St. Petersburg paradox]] to show that expected value theory must be [[Norm (philosophy)|normatively]] wrong. He gives an example in which a Dutch merchant is trying to decide whether to insure a cargo being sent from Amsterdam to St Petersburg in winter. In his solution, he defines a [[utility function]] and computes [[expected utility]] rather than expected financial value (see&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoemaker|first=P. J. H.|title=The Expected Utility Model: Its Variants, Purposes, Evidence and Limitations|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=20|year=1982|pages=529–563}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a review).

In the 20th century, interest was reignited by [[Abraham Wald|Abraham Wald's]] 1939 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |title=Contributions to the Theory of Statistical Estimation and Testing Hypotheses
 |last=Wald |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Wald
 |journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]
 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=299–326 |year=1939
 |doi=10.1214/aoms/1177732144
 |mr=932
}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that the two central procedures of [[frequentist statistics|sampling-distribution-based]] statistical-theory, namely [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] and [[estimation theory|parameter estimation]], are special cases of the general decision problem.  Wald's paper renewed and synthesized many concepts of statistical theory, including [[loss function]]s, [[risk function]]s, [[admissible decision rule]]s, [[prior probability|antecedent distributions]], [[admissible decision rule#Bayes rules|Bayesian procedures]], and [[minimax]] procedures.  The phrase "decision theory" itself was used in 1950 by [[E. L. Lehmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=E. L.|authorlink=E. L. Lehmann|title=Some Principles of the Theory of Testing Hypotheses|journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]|year=1950|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–26|jstor=2236552|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177729884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revival of [[subjective probability]] theory, from the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], [[Bruno de Finetti]], [[L. J. Savage|Leonard Savage]] and others, extended the scope of expected utility theory to situations where subjective probabilities can be used. At the time, von Neumann and Morgenstern’s theory of [[expected utility]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Third ed.)|last=Neumann|first=John von|last2=Morgenstern|first2=Oskar|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1953 |origyear=1944|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that expected utility maximization followed from basic postulates about rational behavior.

The work of [[Maurice Allais]] and [[Daniel Ellsberg]] showed that human behavior has systematic and sometimes important departures from expected-utility maximization. The [[prospect theory]] of [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] renewed the empirical study of [[behavioral economics|economic behavior]] with less emphasis on rationality presuppositions. Kahneman and Tversky found three regularities – in actual human decision-making, "losses loom larger than gains"; persons focus more on ''changes'' in their utility-states than they focus on absolute utilities; and the estimation of subjective probabilities is severely biased by [[anchoring]].

===Intertemporal choice===
{{Main|Intertemporal choice}}
Intertemporal choice is concerned with the kind of choice where different actions lead to outcomes that are realised at different points in time.  If someone received a windfall of several thousand dollars, they could spend it on an expensive holiday, giving them immediate pleasure, or they could invest it in a pension scheme, giving them an income at some time in the future.  What is the optimal thing to do?  The answer depends partly on factors such as the expected [[interest rate|rates of interest]] and [[inflation]], the person's [[life expectancy]], and their confidence in the pensions industry.  However even with all those factors taken into account, human behavior again deviates greatly from the predictions of prescriptive decision theory, leading to alternative models in which, for example, objective interest rates are replaced by [[hyperbolic discounting|subjective discount rates]].

===Interaction of decision makers===
Some decisions are difficult because of the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken.  The analysis of such social decisions is more often treated under the label of [[game theory]], rather than decision theory, though it involves the same mathematical methods. From the standpoint of game theory most of the problems treated in decision theory are one-player games (or the one player is viewed as playing against an impersonal background situation). In the emerging field of [[socio-cognitive]] engineering, the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision-making in human organizations, in normal and abnormal/emergency/crisis situations.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, M. &amp; Friedberg, E. 1995. "Organization and Collective Action. Our Contribution to Organizational Analysis" in Bacharach S.B, Gagliardi P. &amp; Mundell P. (Eds). Research in the Sociology of Organizations. Vol. XIII, Special Issue on European Perspectives of Organizational Theory, Greenwich, CT: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex decisions===
Other areas of decision theory are concerned with decisions that are difficult simply because of their complexity, or the complexity of the organization that has to make them. Individuals making decisions may be limited in resources or are [[Bounded rationality|boundedly rational]] (have finite time or intelligence); in such cases the issue, more than the deviation between real and optimal behaviour, is the difficulty of determining the optimal behaviour in the first place. One example is the model of economic growth and resource usage developed by the [[Club of Rome]] to help politicians make real-life decisions in complex situations{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Decisions are also affected by whether options are framed together or separately; this is known as the [[distinction bias]].  In 2011, Dwayne Rosenburgh explored and showed how decision theory can be applied to complex decisions that arise in areas such as [[wireless communications]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburgh, D. 2011. "Decision Theory with its Applications in Wireless Communication" in Zhang, Y. (Ed.), GUIZANI, M. (Ed.). (2011). Game Theory for Wireless Communications and Networking. Boca Raton: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heuristics==
{{Main|Heuristic}}

The heuristic approach to decision-making makes decisions based on routine thinking, which, while quicker than step-by-step processing, opens the risk of introducing inaccuracies, mistakes and fallacies, which may be easily disproved in a step-by-step process of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Payne | first2 = J. W. | year = 1985 | title = EFFORT AND ACCURACY IN CHOICE | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 395–414 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.31.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example of common and incorrect thought process is the [[gambler's fallacy]], or believing that a random event is affected by previous random events (truth is, there is a fifty percent chance of a coin landing on heads even after a long sequence of tails).  Another example is that decision-makers may be biased towards preferring moderate alternatives to extreme ones; the "Compromise Effect" operates under a mindset driven by the belief that the most moderate option, amid extremes, carries the most benefits from each extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roe | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Busemeyer | first2 = J. R. | last3 = Townsend | first3 = J. T. | year = 2001 | title = Multialternative decision field theory: A dynamic connectionist model of decision making | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 108 | issue = 2| pages = 370–392 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
A highly controversial issue is whether one can replace the use of probability in decision theory by other alternatives.

===Probability theory===
Advocates for the use of probability theory point to:
*   the work of [[Richard Threlkeld Cox]] for justification of the probability axioms,
*   the [[Dutch book]] paradoxes of [[Bruno de Finetti]] as illustrative of the theoretical difficulties that can arise from departures from the probability axioms, and
*   the complete class theorems, which show that all [[admissible decision rule]]s are equivalent to the Bayesian decision rule for some utility function and some [[prior distribution]] (or for the limit of a sequence of prior distributions). Thus, for every decision rule, either the rule may be reformulated as a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] procedure (or a limit of a sequence of such), or there is a rule that is sometimes better and never worse.

===Alternatives to probability theory===
The proponents of [[fuzzy logic]], [[possibility theory]], [[quantum cognition]], [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], and [[info-gap decision theory]] maintain that probability is only one of many alternatives and point to many examples where non-standard alternatives have been implemented with apparent success; notably, probabilistic decision theory is [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] to assumptions about the probabilities of various events, while non-probabilistic rules such as [[minimax]] are [[robust statistics|robust]], in that they do not make such assumptions.

===Ludic fallacy===
{{Main|Ludic fallacy}}

A general criticism of decision theory based on a fixed universe of possibilities is that it considers the "known unknowns", not the "[[unknown unknowns]]"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}: it focuses on expected variations, not on unforeseen events, which some argue (as in [[black swan theory]]) have outsized impact and must be considered – significant events may be "outside model". This line of argument, called the [[ludic fallacy]], is that there are inevitable imperfections in modeling the real world by particular models, and that unquestioning reliance on models blinds one to their limits.

==Pornography==
In autumn 2017, an anonymous [[Reddit]] user under the [[pseudonym]] "Deepfakes" posted several porn videos on the Internet. The first one that captured attention was the [[Daisy Ridley]] deepfake. It was also one of the more known deepfake videos, and a prominent feature in several articles. Another one was a Deepfake simulation of [[Wonder Woman | Wonder Woman]] actress [[Gal Gadot]] having sex with her [[step-brother]], while others were of actresses like [[Emma Watson]], [[Katy Perry]], [[ Taylor Swift]] or [[Scarlett Johansson]]. The scenes were not real, having been created with an artificial intelligence. They were debunked a short time later. As time went on, the Reddit community fixed many bugs in the faked videos, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish fake from true content. As training data for the software, Reddit users used records from sex films and the respective actress. The Deepfake phenomenon was first reported in December 2017 in the technical and scientific section of the magazine [[Vice (magazine) | Vice]], leading to its widespread reporting in other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |title=AI-Assisted Fake Porn Is Here and We’re All Fucked |publisher=Motherboard |date=2017-12-11 |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gydydm/gal-gadot-fake-ai-porn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, producers of deepfake material can be prosecuted for harassment but there are calls to make Deepfake a specific crime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/call-for-upskirting-bill-to-include-deepfake-pornography-ban Call for upskirting bill to include 'deepfake' pornography ban] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Deepfakes have been used to misrepresent well-known politicians on [[video portal | video portals]] or chatrooms. For example, the face of the Argentine President [[Mauricio Macri]] was replaced by the face of [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Angela Merkel]]'s face was replaced with [[Donald Trump]]'s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Wenn Merkel plötzlich Trumps Gesicht trägt: die gefährliche Manipulation von Bildern und Videos |publisher=az Aargauer Zeitung |date=2018-02-03 |url=https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/leben/digital/wenn-merkel-ploetzlich-trumps-gesicht-traegt-die-gefaehrliche-manipulation-von-bildern-und-videos-132155720}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Patrick Gensing|url=http://faktenfinder.tagesschau.de/hintergrund/deep-fakes-101.html |title=Deepfakes: Auf dem Weg in eine alternative Realität? }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, [[Jordan Peele]] and [[Jonah Peretti]] created a deepfake using [[Barack Obama]] as a [[public service announcement]] about the danger of deepfakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Aja |title=Jordan Peele’s simulated Obama PSA is a double-edged warning against fake news |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/4/18/17252410/jordan-peele-obama-deepfake-buzzfeed |website=Vox |accessdate=September 10, 2018 |date=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==App==
In January 2018, a desktop application called FakeApp was launched. The app allows users to easily create and share videos with faces swapped. The app uses an artificial neural network and the power of the graphics processor and three to four gigabytes of storage space to generate the fake video. For detailed information, the program needs a lot of visual material from the person to be inserted in order to learn which image aspects have to be exchanged, using the deep learning algorithm based on the video sequences and images. The software uses the AI-Framework [[TensorFlow]] of [[Google]], which among other things was already used for the program [[DeepDream]].  [[Celebrities]] are the main targets of such fake sex videos, but some other people are also affected.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite |author=Britta Bauchmüller |title="Fake-App": Mit diesem Programm kann jeder im Porno landen – ob er will oder nicht! |publisher=Berliner-Kurier.de |url=https://www.berliner-kurier.de/ratgeber/digital/-fake-app--mit-diesem-programm-kann-jeder-im-porno-landen---ob-er-will-oder-nicht--29578018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |author=Eike Kühl |title=Künstliche Intelligenz: Auf Fake News folgt Fake Porn |publisher=Die Zeit |date=2018-01-26 |ISSN=0044-2070 |url=http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2018-01/kuenstliche-intelligenz-deepfakes-porno-face-swap}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |author=heise online |url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Deepfakes-Neuronale-Netzwerke-erschaffen-Fake-Porn-und-Hitler-Parodien-3951035.html |title=Deepfakes: Neuronale Netzwerke erschaffen Fake-Porn und Hitler-Parodien}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018,  researchers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] published a paper introducing a fake dancing app that can replace a child with an expert dancer using AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/artificial-intelligence-ai-deepfake-dancing-2018-8|title=An AI program will soon be here to help your deepfake dancing - just don't call it deepfake|last=Farquhar|first=Peter|date=2018-08-27|work=Business Insider Australia|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/26/17778792/deepfakes-video-dancing-ai-synthesis|title=Deepfakes for dancing: you can now use AI to fake those dance moves you always wanted|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
===Abuses===
The [[Aargauer Zeitung]] says that the [[photo manipulation|manipulation of images]] and [[video manipulation|videos]] using artificial intelligence could become a dangerous mass phenomenon. However, the falsification of images and videos is even older than the advent of [[video editing software]] and [[image editing software | image editing programs]]; in this case it is the realism that is a new aspect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is also possible to use Deepfake for targeted [[hoaxes]] and [[revenge porn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |title=Künstliche Intelligenz: Selfies sind eine gute Quelle |publisher=Die Zeit |date=2018-01-26 |ISSN=0044-2070 |url=http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2018-01/kuenstliche-intelligenz-deepfakes-porno-face-swap/seite-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |title=„Deepfake“ - FakeApp kann Personen in Pornos austauschen – Welche Rechte haben Geschädigte? |publisher=WILDE BEUGER SOLMECKE Rechtsanwälte |date=2018-02-02 |url=https://www.wbs-law.de/personlichkeitsrecht/deepfake-fakeapp-kann-personen-in-pornos-austauschen-welche-rechte-haben-geschaedigte-76428/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on credibility and authenticity=== 
Another effect of Deepfake is that it can no longer be distinguished whether content is targeted (e.g. [[satire]]) or genuine. AI researcher [[Alex Champandard]] has said everyone should know how fast things can be corrupted today with this technology, and that the problem is not technical one, but rather one to be solved by trust in information and journalism. The primary pitfall is that humanity could fall into an age in which it can no longer be determined whether the depicted media corresponds to the truth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Internet reaction===
Some websites, such as [[Twitter]] and [[Gfycat]], announced that they would delete Deepfake content and block its publishers. Previously, the chat platform [[Discord (software)|Discord]] blocked a chat channel with fake celebrity porn videos. The pornography website, [[Pornhub]], also plans to block such content, however it has been reported that the site has not been enforcing its ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/18/pornhub-still-has-many-deepfake-videos/|title=Pornhub hasn't been actively enforcing its deepfake ban|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/pornhub-banned-deepfake-celebrity-sex-videos-but-the-site|title=Pornhub Banned Deepfake Celebrity Sex Videos, But The Site Is Still Full Of Them|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Reddit, the situation initially remained unclear until the subreddit was suspended on February 7, 2018 due to the policy violation of "involuntary pornography".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite |author=Markus Böhm |title="Deepfakes": Firmen gehen gegen gefälschte Promi-Pornos vor |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2018-02-07 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/deepfakes-online-plattformen-wollen-fake-promi-pornos-loeschen-a-1192170.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |author=barbara.wimmer |title=Deepfakes: Reddit löscht Forum für künstlich generierte Fake-Pornos |url=https://futurezone.at/digital-life/deepfakes-reddit-loescht-forum-fuer-kuenstlich-generierte-fake-pornos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=heise online |url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Deepfakes-Auch-Reddit-verbannt-Fake-Porn-3962987.html |title=Deepfakes: Auch Reddit verbannt Fake-Porn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.derstandard.de/story/2000073855676/reddit-verbannt-deepfake-pornos |title=Reddit verbannt Deepfake-Pornos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EIA-608''', also known as "line 21 captions" and "CEA-608",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SCTE 21 2012 - STANDARD FOR CARRIAGE OF VBI DATA IN CABLE DIGITAL TRANSPORT STREAMS|journal=Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers|year=2012|volume=SCTE 21|pages=13|url=http://www.scte.org/documents/pdf/Standards/SCTE%2021%202012.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to be the standard for closed captioning for [[NTSC]] TV [[Broadcasting|broadcasts]] in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It also specifies an "Extended Data Service", which is a means for including a VCR control service with a now/next EPG for [[NTSC]] transmissions that operates on the even line 21 field, similar to the TeleText based [[Programme Delivery Control|VPS]] that operates on line 16 which is used in [[PAL]] countries.

It was developed by the [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] and required by law to be implemented in most television receivers made in the United States.

EIA-608 captions are transmitted on either the odd or even fields of line 21 with an odd parity bit in the non-visible active video data area in NTSC broadcasts, and are also sometimes present in the [[picture user data]] in [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] [[transmission (telecom)|transmissions]]. It uses a fixed bandwidth of 480 bit/s per line 21 field for a maximum of 32 characters per line per caption (maximum four captions) for a 30 frame broadcast.  The odd field captions relate to the primary audio track and the even field captions related to the SAP or secondary audio track which is generally a second language translation of the primary audio, such as a French or Spanish translation of an English-speaking TV show.

Raw EIA-608 caption byte pairs are becoming less prevalent as [[digital television]] replaces analog. ATSC broadcasts instead use the [[EIA-708]] caption protocol to encapsulate both the EIA-608 caption pairs as well as a native EIA-708 stream.  EIA-608 has had revisions with the addition of extended character sets to fully support the representation of the Spanish, French, German languages, and cross section of other Western European [[language]]s.  EIA-608 was also extended to support two byte characters for the [[Korean language|Korean]] and Japanese markets.  The full version of [[EIA-708]] has support for more character sets and better caption positioning options; however, because of existing EIA-608 hardware and revisions to the format, there has been little or no real world use of the format besides simple 608 to 708 inline conversions.

==Channels==
EIA-608 defines four channels of caption information, so that a program could, for example, have captions in four different languages. There are two channels, called 1 and 2 by the standard, in each of the two fields of a frame. However, the channels are often presented to users numbered simply as CC1-2 for the odd field and CC3-4 for the even field.  However due to bandwidth limitations on either field, CC1 and  CC3 are the only ones used, meaning that there has been little use for the second channel.  Early Spanish SAP captioned broadcasts first used the second channel CC2 because the original caption decoders only read the first odd field, but later switched to using CC3 for bandwidth reasons.  Due to the same bandwidth reasons XDS was never used by Spanish-speaking stations.

Within each channel, there are two streams of information which might be considered sub-channels: one carries "captions" and the other "text." The latter is not in common use due to the lack of hardware support and bandwidth available.  Text is signaled by the use of text commands and can be used for a formatted URL string with a 16-bit checksum that designates a web site that the captions relate to or a local station communication channel.

==DVD GOP User Data Insertion==
The user data structure that follows a [[H.262]] GOP header is as follows (the same would apply after an ISO/IEC 14496-2 GOP header):
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Length !! Name !! Type !! Default
|-
| 32 bits || user_data_start_code || patterned bslbf || 0x000001B2
|-
| 16 bits || user_identifier || ASCII bslbf || CC
|-
| 8 bits || user_data_type_code || uimsbf || 1
|-
| 8 bits || caption_block_size || inverted uimsbf || 0xf8
|-
| 1 bit || caption_odd_field_first || flag || 1
|-
| 1 bit || caption_filler || alignment || 0
|-
| 5 bits || caption_block_count || uimsbf || 15
|-
| 1 bit || caption_extra_field_added || flag || 0
|-
| X*24 bits || caption_block || binary || free form
|}

bslbf: bit string, left bit first ; uimsbf: unsigned integer, most significant bit first

Caption blocks are inserted after the sequence and GOP headers, so each block is for one second of video which would end up being one or two long lines or three to four short lines of text.  Also that means if the caption_block_count is greater than 30 then the block contains both interleaved caption fields and one could devise the framing rate from the caption_block_count.  However since the data is grouped together the framing rate will almost always be 30/1.001, unlike the ATSC method that inserts one byte pair for each field after the picture header making framing rates of 24/1.001 possible for HD content.  Since when a decoder does a 3:2 pull-down for NTSC output the captions will remain in sync.

bslbf: bit string, left bit first ; uimsbf: unsigned integer, most significant bit first

This structure was designed for any digital VBI data and was optimized to carry three or more 43-byte [[Teletext]] packets. e.g. a page header and two associated lines.  For Teletext subtitles, the data_unit_id is set to 3.  In this form, captions have to be separated into byte pairs spread over frames in one second of video rather than grouped into one block as with the DVD structure.  The same is true for Teletext subtitles with more than one line of text.

This structure was designed for any digital audio or metadata that is to be synchronized  with a video frame.  SDI transports every eight bits in a 10 bit aligned packet, unlike MXF which is byte aligned and the ancillary flag bytes are replaced by 128 bit header.

==Extended Data Service==
{{main|Extended Data Services}}
The EIA-608 data stream format includes Extended Data Service (XDS), a variety of information about the transmission. It is all optional,:
* 
* 
* program name
* offensiveness rating (violence, sex, etc.)
* program category (drama, game show, etc.)

==Characters==
There are three sets of characters that the EIA-608 stream can direct the receiver to display: basic characters, special characters, and extended characters. A single two-byte EIA-608 command (represented by a single VBI line) can specify two basic characters, one special character, or one extended character.

Extended characters are a later addition to the standard and their decoding is optional.

EIA-608 provides controls for the color of the foreground and background of the text, underlining, blinking, and italics. The default color scheme is white characters on a black background, all opaque.

The Transparent Space special character implies a transparent background even in the absence of any background control commands. As the foreground of this character is a blank space, it really means a gap in the close caption text.

===Non-Caption Data===
This is used to either pad out the field line when no captions are sent or for the eXtended Data Service.

&lt;/pre&gt;

===Basic North American character set===
A command with bits 13 or 14 on directs the receiver to display two basic characters at the current cursor position for the current mode (closed caption or text). Each character is a code point (identifies the character to display), as follows.
&lt;pre&gt;
                       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

&lt;/pre&gt;

The code is almost identical to ASCII; the exceptions are shown in red.

In the table above, SB represents a solid block. The apostrophe (code 27), which may originally have been intended to be a neutral apostrophe as in ASCII, is now recommended to be rendered as a right single quotation mark (Unicode U+2019). For a neutral single quote/apostrophe, the plain single quote from the extended character set should be used.&lt;ref&gt;CEA-608-E R-2014 standard&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special North American character set===
The only real use in North America of this set is the use of the [[Eighth note]] character to denote changes from spoken dialogue to singing or musical only scenes.

It is an acceptable broadcast engineering practice when translating EIA-608 to Teletext for PAL compatible countries to substitute this character for a [[number sign]] because of its similarity to a [[Sharp (music)|sharp]].

A command to display a special character has a first byte of 0x11 or 0x19 (depending upon channel). The second byte is a code point in the range 0x30-0x3F as follows.

TM is short for unregistered trademark and should be represented in [[superscript]] (™). TS in the table above represents a "transparent space" or [[non-breaking space]]. Finally, the [[Eighth note]] (♪) is used to denote singing or background music in captions.

===Extended Western European character set===
&lt;pre&gt;
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 |P|0|0|1|C|0|1|S| |P|0|1|CHARACTER|
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 15             8   7             0
 P = odd parity ; C = second channel toggle ; S = char set toggle
&lt;/pre&gt;

These extended character sets are rarely used due to most European countries using the BBC Ceefax based Teletext system.

The Ceefax system is more prone to character errors due to the greater number of data bits (337 versus 16) encoded per VBI field, these errors occur either on noise prone analog transmissions or connections.

* A command to display an extended Spanish/French or miscellaneous character has a first byte of 0x12 or 0x1A (depending upon channel).
* A command to display an extended Portuguese/German/Danish character has a first byte of 0x13 or 0x1B (depending upon channel).

The second byte is a code point in the range 0x20-0x3F is as follows

SM is short for [[service mark]] and should be represented in [[superscript]].  The single quote mark is a [[Non-English usage of quotation marks|curly]] left and double quote marks are [[Non-English usage of quotation marks|curly]] left and right.  The plus signs refer to top left, top right, lower left and lower right corners for [[Box drawing characters|box drawing]].

==Non-Western Norpak Character Sets==
When used all standard and extended character sets are unused in favor of the following predefined sets, care must be taken to not emulate any control commands. This is an extension submitted to the CEC by [[Norpak]] who made a similar extension to the Teletext format for the Chinese market. The main use has been to provide double byte code point captioning to the Japanese, Taiwanese and South Korean markets.  A command to switch character sets has a first byte of 0x17 or 0x1F (depending upon channel). The second byte is a character set reference in the range 0x24-0x2A as follows

&lt;pre&gt;
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 |P|0|0|1|C|1|1|1| |P|0|1|0|CHARSET|
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 15             8   7             0

==Control commands==
Bits 15 and 7 are always odd parity bits. Bit 11 is always the channel bit.

Preamble address code with masking bit 15,11 and 7 as already defined above
can be interpreted from following table
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! bits !! interpretation

 P = odd parity ; C = second channel toggle
 U = underline toggle ; N = next row down toggle
 (if style or cursor position not set,
  defaults are regular white text with black background
  at cursor = 0, cursor - multiple of 4)
 text style enumerations:
  {white=0,green,blue,cyan,red,yellow,magenta,italic white}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The row bits specify which of the fifteen screen rows should contain the caption text: row 11 (0000), 1 (0010), 2 (0011), 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 (1111).

The attributes bits allow 16 possibilities, which are: white (0000), green, blue, cyan, red, yellow, magenta, italics, indent 0, indent 4, indent 8, indent 12, indent 16, indent 20, indent 24, indent 28 (1111).

For a midrow code these are as follows: Bits 14, 13, 10, 9, 6 and 4 are always 0, bits 12, 8 and 5 are always 1. Bits 3, 2 and 1 form the color attribute 0001X10X(see the listing of attributes). Bit 0 indicates underline.

&lt;pre&gt;

 P = odd parity ; C = second channel toggle
 T = partially transparent ; U = underline toggle
 bg color enumerations:
 {white=0,green,blue,cyan,red,yellow,magenta,black}
&lt;/pre&gt;

For other control codes these are as follows: Bits 14, 13, 9, 6 and 4 are always 0, bits 12, 10 and 5 are always 1. Bit 8 chooses between line 21 and 284. Bits 3, 2, 1 and 0 identify the particular action.

The command bits allow 16 possibilities, which are: resume caption loading (0000), backspace (0001), delete to end of row (0100), roll-up captions 2-rows, roll-up captions 3 rows, roll-up captions 4-rows, flash on (0.25 seconds once per second), resume direct captioning, text restart, resume text display, erase displayed memory, carriage return, erase nondisplayed memory, end of caption (1111).

For tabs these are as follows: Bits 14, 13, 6, 4, 3, 2 are always 0, bits 12, 10, 9, 8, 5 are always 1. Bits 1 and 0 determine the number of tab offsets.

Considering parity bit already ignored hex value have of 2 byte data is following command:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15696">In ''[[Xenopus laevis]]'', the specification of the three germ layers ([[endoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[ectoderm]]) occurs at the [[blastula]] stage.&lt;ref name=Heasman&gt;Heasman, J., Quarmby, J., and Wylie, C.C. (1984). The mitochondrial cloud of Xenopus oocytes: the source of germinal granule material. Dev Biol 105, 458-469.&lt;/ref&gt; Great efforts have been made to determine the factors that specify the endoderm and mesoderm. On the other hand, only a few examples of genes that are required for [[ectoderm]] specification have been described in the last decade. The first molecule identified to be required for the specification of ectoderm was the ubiquitin ligase '''Ectodermin''' (Ecto, TIF1-γ, TRIM33); later, it was found that the deubiquitinating enzyme, '''FAM/USP9x''', is able to overcome the effects of ubiquitination made by Ectodermin in Smad4 (Dupont et al., 2009). Two transcription factors have been proposed to control gene expression of ectodermal specific genes: '''POU91/Oct3/4'''&lt;ref name=Snir&gt;Snir, M., Ofir, R., Elias, S., and Frank, D. (2006). Xenopus laevis POU91 protein, an Oct3/4 homologue, regulates competence transitions from mesoderm to neural cell fates. EMBO J 25, 3664-3674.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''FoxIe1/Xema'''.&lt;ref name=Mir07&gt;Mir, A., Kofron, M., Zorn, A.M., Bajzer, M., Haque, M., Heasman, J., and Wylie, C.C. (2007). FoxI1e activates ectoderm formation and controls cell position in the Xenopus blastula. Development 134, 779-788.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suri&gt;Suri, C., Haremaki, T., and Weinstein, D.C. (2005).

== Ectodermin and FAM==

===Biological role of Ectodermin and FAM===
The protein Ectodermin, firstly identified in ''Xenopus'' embryos, promotes ectodermal fate and suppresses the mesoderm formation mediated by the signaling of [[Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta|Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ)]] and [[Bone Morphogenic Proteins]] (BMP), members of the TGFβ-superfamily.&lt;ref name=dupont05&gt;Dupont, S., Zacchigna, L., Cordenonsi, M., Soligo, S., Adorno, M., Rugge, M., and Piccolo, S. (2005). Germ-layer specification and control of cell growth by Ectodermin, a Smad4 ubiquitin ligase. Cell 121, 87-99.&lt;/ref&gt; When the TGFβ ligands bind to TGFβ receptors, they cause the activation of the signal transducers R-Smads ([[Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2|Smad2]], [[Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3|Smad3]]). Smad4 forms a complex with activated R-Smads and activates transcription of specific genes in response to TGFβ signal. The BMP pathway transmits its signals in a similar way but through other types of R-Smads ([[Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1|Smad1]], [[Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 5|Smad5]] and [[Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 8|Smad8]]). The transcription factor Smad4 is the only common mediator shared between both TGFβ and the BMP pathways.&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;Siegel, P.M., and Massague, J. (2003). Cytostatic and apoptotic actions of TGFβeta in homeostasis and cancer. Nat Rev Cancer 3, 807-821.&lt;/ref&gt; During ectoderm specification, the function of Smad4 is regulated by ubiquitination and deubiquitination made by Ectodermin and FAM (acronym of Fat acets in mammals) respectively. The ubiquitination state of Smad4 will determine if it is able to respond to signals derived from TGFβ and BMP.&lt;ref name="dupont05" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dupont09&gt;Dupont, S., Mamidi, A., Cordenonsi, M., Montagner, M., Zacchigna, L., Adorno, M., Martello, G., Stinchfield, M.J., Soligo, S., Morsut, L., et al. (2009). FAM/USP9x, a deubiquitinating enzyme essential for TGFβeta signaling, controls Smad4 monoubiquitination. Cell 136, 123-135.&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium of the activity, localization and timing of TGFβ and BMP transducers, Smad4, FAM and of Ectodermin should be achieved in order to be able to modulate the gene expression of genes required for germ layer formation.

===Identification of Ectodermin and FAM===
A [[cDNA]] library from the blastula stage of a frog embryo was cloned into RNA expression plasmids to generate synthetic mRNA. The mRNA was then injected into several ''Xenopus'' embryos at a four-cell stage and looked in early [[blastula]] embryos for an expansion of the region of the ectodermal marker Sox2 and diminution of the expression of the mesodermal marker [[Xbra]]. Ectodermin was one out of 50 clones to present this phenotype when injected into embryos.&lt;ref name="dupont05" /&gt; The identification of FAM was done through a [[siRNA]] screen to find [[deubiquitinating enzyme|deubiquitinase]]s that regulate the response to TGFβ.

===Ectodermin and FAM localization===

Ectodermin mRNA is maternally deposited in the animal pole of the egg. In the early blastula stage of the embryo, Ectodermin mRNA and protein forms a gradient that goes from the animal pole (highest concentration) down to the marginal zone (lowest concentration) to prevent TGFβ and [[Nodal Signaling|nodal signals]] that induce mesoderm originating from the vegetal pole. Ectodermin mRNA is enriched in the dorsal side of the embryo, and at the end of this stage the expression gradually disappears.&lt;ref name="dupont05" /&gt; Smad4 is ubiquitinated by Ectodermin in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm where it can be deubiquitinated by FAM; this way Smad4 can be recycled and be functional again. Although there is no expression profile of FAM in early embryos in ''Xenopus'', in the zebra fish, FAM homolog is expressed ubiquitously at a two-cell stage but as development proceeds then its only expressed in the cephalic central nervous system.&lt;ref name=khut&gt;Khut, P.Y., Tucker, B., Lardelli, M., and Wood, S.A. (2007). Evolutionary and expression analysis of the zebrafish deubiquitylating enzyme, usp9. Zebrafish 4, 95-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ectodermin and FAM functions===
Ectodermin is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that inhibits the TGFβ and the BMP signaling pathways by inhibition of Smad4 via ubiquitination of Lysine 519 and also though direct binding to phospho-Smad2.&lt;ref name="dupont05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dupont09" /&gt; Injection of Ecto mRNA in the marginal zone leads to an expansion of the early ectodermal marker, Sox2, and a reduction of mesodermal markers (Xbra, Eomes, Vent-1, Mix-1 and Mixer). The opposite happens in knockdown experiments of Ectodermin by using a morpholino strategy; embryos become more sensitive to Activin response, they show an increase and expansion of the expression of mesodermal specific genes and down-regulate the expression of neural plate and epidermis marker (Sox2 and cytokeratin respectively). In line with a RING-finger dependent ubiquitin-ligase activity of Ectodermin, an Ecto RING-finger mutant (C97A/C100A) is inactive in gain-of-function.&lt;ref name="dupont05" /&gt; Gain-of-function of FAM increases the responses from BMP and TGFβ and its loss-of-function by mutation in a critical residue for its activity caused inhibition of TGFβ response.

===Conservation of Ectodermin and FAM in other species===
The molecular function of human ectodermin to act as a negative regulator of Smad4 suggests that this specific function is conserved among the vertebrate lineage.&lt;ref name="dupont05" /&gt; The sequence identity between FAM homologs is higher than 90% when comparing the homologs of ''Xenopus'', zebrafish, mouse, and human, suggesting that this might also be conserved among other organisms.&lt;ref name="khut" /&gt; Indeed, knockout gene inactivation in mouse embryos showed that the function of ectodermin as inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morsut L, Yan KP, Enzo E, Aragona M, Soligo SM, Wendling O, Mark M, Khetchoumian K, Bressan G, Chambon P, Dupont S, Losson R, Piccolo S |title=Negative control of Smad activity by ectodermin/Tif1gamma patterns the mammalian embryo |journal=Development |volume=137 |issue=15 |pages=2571–8 |year=2010 |pmid=20573697 |doi=10.1242/dev.053801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Embryos lacking of ectodermin show defective development of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), which is the first tissue that is induced by TGF-beta signals in mouse embryos; in accordance with loss of an inhibitor, ectodermin-/- embryos showed enlarged AVE induction. As the AVE is a natural source of secreted TGF-beta antagonists, this primary AVE expansion caused secondarily, at later stages, an inhibition of extracellular TGF-beta ligands, resulting in embryos lacking of mesoderm development. This model was confirmed by the finding that ectodermin-/- embryos were rescued to wild type (normal AVE, normal mesoderm development) by lowering the genetic dosage of the main TGF-beta ligand of the emrbyo, Nodal. Further supporting a role as TGF-beta inhibitor, tissue-selective deletion of ectodermin from the epiblast (from which the mesoderm, but not the AVE, derive) left the AVE untouched but caused this time an expansion of anterior mesodermal fates, indicative of increased responsiveness to TGF-beta signals. Collectively, these data confirmed with genetic tools a cell-autonomous role for ectodermin as inhibitor of Smad4 responses previously identified in Xenopus embryos and human cell lines.

== FOXI1e ==

===Biological role of FOXI1e===
During early in development in ''Xenopus'', the transcription factor FoxI1e/Xema activates epidermal differentiation and represses endoderm and mesoderm specific genes in animal caps (Suri et al., 2005).  It is suggested that FoxI1e is active before the ectoderm differentiates into epidermis and the central nervous system.

===Identification of FoxI1e===
Mir et al., 2005 identified FoxI1e (Xema) by selecting genes that were down-regulated under mesoderm-inducing signals in the ectoderm compared to vegetal region of an early [[blastula]] embryo. Also, high expression of this gene was observed in animal caps in embryos that lack VegT compared to wild type.

===Localization in the cell===
FoxI1e mRNA is expressed zygotically (stage 8.5) and reaches higher level of expression early in gastrulation and maintains that level in neurula, tailbud until early tadpole stages.&lt;ref name="suri" /&gt; FoxI1e has a peculiar mosaic expression pattern, it is expressed first in the dorsal ectoderm and while gastrula progresses, the expression goes through the ventral side and its expression is down-regulated in the dorsal side when the neural plate is forming.&lt;ref name=mir08&gt;Mir, A., Kofron, M., Heasman, J., Mogle, M., Lang, S., Birsoy, B., and Wylie, C. (2008). Long- and short-range signals control the dynamic expression of an animal hemisphere-specific gene in Xenopus. Dev Biol 315, 161-172.&lt;/ref&gt; FoxI1e is dependent on BMP signals in the neurula stage, limiting the localization of FoxI1e to the ventral side of the ectoderm.

===Protein function and regulation===
FoxI1e/Xema belongs to the FoxI1 class of fork head transcription factor family, known to participate in mesoderm formation, eye development&lt;ref name=Pohl&gt;Pohl, B.S., Rossner, A., and Knochel, W. (2005). The Fox gene family in Xenopus laevis:FoxI2, FoxM1 and FoxP1 in early development. Int J Dev Biol 49, 53-58.&lt;/ref&gt; and ventral head specification.&lt;ref name=Matsuo-Takasaki&gt;Matsuo-Takasaki, M., Matsumura, M., and Sasai, Y. (2005). An essential role of Xenopus Foxi1a for ventral specification of the cephalic ectoderm during gastrulation. Development 132, 3885-3894.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that Notch and/or [[NODAL]], expressed in the vegetal/mesoderm region of the early [[blastula]] embryo, could potentially be the inhibitors of FoxI1e.&lt;ref name="Mir07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mir08" /&gt;

===Loss and gain-of-function===
Inhibition of FoxI1e mRNA maturation by a splice-blocking morpholino shows malformations in the development of epidermis and pervious system and down-regulates of ectoderm specific genes, whereas FoxI1e over-expression inhibits the formation of mesoderm and endoderm. Vegetal structures form late blastula masses that normally would give rise to endoderm and mesoderm, when injected with FoxI1e mRNA, they are able to express ectodermal specific markers (pan-ectodermal E-cadherin, epithelial cytokeratin, neural crest marker Slug and neural marker Sox-2) while endodermal markers (endodermin, Xsox17a) decreased in expression.&lt;ref name="Mir07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="suri" /&gt;

== XFDL156 ==

===Biological role of XFDL156===
The [[p53]] protein binds to the promoters of early mesodermal genes.&lt;ref name=Cordenonsi&gt;Cordenonsi, M., Dupont, S., Maretto, S., Insinga, A., Imbriano, C., and Piccolo, S. (2003). Links between tumor suppressors: p53 is required for TGFβeta gene responses by cooperating with Smads. Cell 113, 301-314.&lt;/ref&gt; p53 is maternally deposited transcript that forms a transcriptional factor complex with Smad2 and drives the expression of genes involved in mesoderm induction and activation of TGFβ target genes.&lt;ref name=Takebayashi-Suzuki&gt;Takebayashi-Suzuki, K., Funami, J., Tokumori, D., Saito, A., Watabe, T., Miyazono, K., Kanda, A., and Suzuki, A. (2003). Interplay between the tumor suppressor p53 and TGF beta signaling shapes embryonic body axes in Xenopus. Development 130, 3929-3939.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[zinc finger|zinc (Zn)-finger]] nuclear protein XFDL159, expressed in the animal cap, acts as an ectoderm factor their specifies the ectoderm by inhibiting p53 from activating genes for mesoderm differentiation.&lt;ref name="sasai" /&gt;

===Identification of XFDL156===
Construction of a cDNA library from animal caps at a stage of 11.5, cloned into expression vector and generated mRNA.  The synthetic RNA was then injected into embryos and the animal caps of these collected embryos were obtained and submitted to [[activin]] treatment. Xbra was recovered by selecting the clone that represses the mesodermal marker Xbra.&lt;ref name="sasai" /&gt;

===Localization of XFDL156===
Since XFDL156 is a factor that interacts with p53, the localization of this protein is in the nucleus (Sasai et al., 2008). The mRNA of XFDL156 is maternally deposited and then expressed zygotically. The gene expression timeline shows a higher level of expression at early gastrula and a half decrease in expression at mid-gastrula and by the stage 20 the expression fades.&lt;ref name="sasai" /&gt;

===Protein function of XFDL156===
XFDR zinc finger binds to the regulatory region of p53 located at the C-terminal domain and its expression is not affected by the presence of activin, FoxI1e or XLPOU91 transcription factors.

===Loss and gain-of-function in XFDL156===
Loss-of-function by morpholino, causes incorrect mesodermal differentiation in the ectoedermal regions; this is caused by the desuppression of mesodermal markers (Xbra, VegT and Mix.2). Gain-of-functions causes decrease in expression of mesodermal markers.&lt;ref name="sasai" /&gt;

===Conservation of XFDL homologs in other species===
The human and mouse homologs of XFDR156 are able to complement XFDR function of interacting with p53 and inhibiting it to act as a transcription factor.&lt;ref name="sasai" /&gt;

An effective Polish space is a complete separable metric space ''X'' with metric ''d'' such that there is a countable dense set ''C'' = (''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...) that makes the following two [[relation (logic)|relations]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^4&lt;/math&gt; computable (Moschovakis 2009:96-7):

An '''electrophoretic mobility shift assay''' (EMSA) or '''mobility shift electrophoresis''', also referred as a '''gel shift assay''', '''gel mobility shift assay''', '''band shift assay''', or '''gel retardation assay''', is a common [[affinity electrophoresis]] technique used to study [[protein–DNA interaction|protein–DNA]] or [[protein]]–[[RNA]] interactions.  This procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of binding to a given DNA or RNA sequence, and can sometimes indicate if more than one protein molecule is involved in the binding complex.  Gel shift assays are often performed [[in vitro]] concurrently with [[DNase footprinting]], [[primer extension]], and promoter-probe experiments when studying [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] initiation, DNA replication, DNA repair or RNA processing and maturation, as well as pre-mRNA splicing&lt;ref&gt;Granadino B, Penalva LO, Green MR, Valcarcel J, Sanchez L. 1997. Proc Natl
Acad Sci U S A 94: 7343-8.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although precursors can be found in earlier literature, most current assays are based on methods described by Garner and Revzin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garner MM, Revzin A |title=A gel electrophoresis method for quantifying the binding of proteins to specific DNA regions: application to components of the Escherichia coli lactose operon regulatory system |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=9 |issue=13 |pages=3047–60 |date=July 1981 |pmid=6269071 |pmc=327330 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6269071 |doi=10.1093/nar/9.13.3047}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fried and [[Donald Crothers|Crothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fried M, Crothers DM |title=Equilibria and kinetics of lac repressor-operator interactions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=9 |issue=23 |pages=6505–25 |date=December 1981 |pmid=6275366 |pmc=327619 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6275366 |doi=10.1093/nar/9.23.6505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==
A mobility shift assay is [[Gel electrophoresis|electrophoretic separation]] of a protein–DNA or protein–RNA mixture on a [[Polyacrylamide gel|polyacrylamide]] or [[agarose gel]] for a short period (about 1.5-2 hr for a 15- to 20-cm gel).&lt;ref name=CPIMB&gt;{{cite book |author=Ausubel, Frederick M. |title=[[Current Protocols]] in molecular biology |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester |year=1994 |pages=12.2.1–11 |isbn=0-471-50337-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed at which different molecules (and combinations thereof) move through the gel is determined by their size and charge, and to a lesser extent, their shape (see [[gel electrophoresis]]). The control lane (DNA probe without protein present) will contain a single band corresponding to the unbound DNA or RNA fragment. However, assuming that the protein is capable of binding to the fragment, the lane with a protein that binds present will contain another band that represents the larger, less mobile complex of nucleic acid probe bound to protein which is 'shifted' up on the gel (since it has moved more slowly).

Under the correct experimental conditions, the interaction between the DNA (or RNA) and protein is stabilized and the ratio of bound to unbound nucleic acid on the gel reflects the fraction of free and bound probe molecules as the binding reaction enters the gel. This stability is in part due to a "caging effect", in that the protein, surrounded by the gel matrix, is unable to diffuse away from the probe before they recombine.&lt;ref&gt;Fried MG, Liu G. (1994). "Molecular sequestration stabilizes CAP- DNA complexes during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis". ''Nucleic Acids Research'' 22(23): 5054-5059. doi: 10.1093/nar/22.23.5054. {{PMID|7800499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the starting concentrations of protein and probe are known, and if the stoichiometry of the complex is known, the apparent affinity of the protein for the nucleic acid sequence may be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Fried MG (1989) "Measurement of protein-DNA interaction parameters by electrophoresis mobility shift assay". ''Electrophoresis'' 10, 366-376. {{PMID|2670548}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the complex is very long lived under gel conditions, or dissociation during electrophoresis is taken into account, the number derived is an apparent Kd.  If the protein concentration is not known but the complex stoichiometry is, the protein concentration can be determined by increasing the concentration of DNA probe until further increments do not increase the fraction of protein bound. By comparison with a set of standard dilutions of free probe run on the same gel, the number of moles of protein can be calculated.&lt;ref name=CPIMB/&gt;

== Variants and additions ==
An antibody that recognizes the protein can be added to this mixture to create an even larger complex with a greater shift. This method is referred to as a ''supershift assay'', and is used to unambiguously identify a protein present in the protein – nucleic acid complex.

Often, an extra lane is run with a competitor [[oligonucleotide]] to determine the most favorable binding sequence for the binding protein. The use of different oligonucleotides of defined sequence allows the identification of the precise binding site by competition (not shown in diagram). Variants of the competition assay are useful for measuring the specificity of binding and for measurement of association and dissociation kinetics. Thus, EMSA might also be used as part of a SELEX experiment to select for oligonucleotides that do actually bind a given protein. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shaohua|last2=Li|first2=Hui|last3=Yang|first3=Xiqin|last4=Wang|first4=Wei|last5=Huang|first5=Aixue|last6=Li|first6=Jie|last7=Qin|first7=Xingliang|last8=Li|first8=Fei|last9=Lu|first9=Guanyi|date=2015-03-12|title=Vasorin is a potential serum biomarker and drug target of hepatocarcinoma screened by subtractive-EMSA-SELEX to clinic patient serum|url=http://www.oncotarget.com/fulltext/3541|journal=Oncotarget|volume=6|issue=12|doi=10.18632/oncotarget.3541|issn=1949-2553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once DNA-protein binding is determined ''in vitro'', a number of algorithms can narrow the search for identification of the transcription factor. Consensus sequence oligonucleotides for the transcription factor of interest will be able to compete for the binding, eliminating the shifted band, and must be confirmed by supershift. If the predicted consensus sequence fails to compete for binding, identification of the transcription factor may be aided by Multiplexed Competitor EMSA (MC-EMSA), whereby large sets of consensus sequences are multiplexed in each reaction, and where one set competes for binding, the individual consensus sequences from this set are run in a further reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith AJ, Humphries SE |title=Characterization of DNA-binding proteins using multiplexed competitor EMSA |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=385 |issue=3 |pages=714–7 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19059416 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2008.11.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For visualization purposes, the nucleic acid fragment is usually labelled with a [[Isotopic labeling|radioactive]], [[fluorescent marker|fluorescent]] or [[biotinylation|biotin]] label. Standard [[ethidium bromide]] staining is less sensitive than these methods and can lack the sensitivity to detect the nucleic acid if small amounts of nucleic acid or single-stranded nucleic acid(s) are used in these experiments. When using a biotin label, [[streptavidin]] conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase is used to detect the DNA fragment.&lt;ref name="HellmanFried2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hellman|first1=Lance M|last2=Fried|first2=Michael G|title=Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for detecting protein–nucleic acid interactions|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=2|issue=8|year=2007|pages=1849–1861|issn=1754-2189|doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.249|pmc=2757439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Osmosensing and Osmosignaling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7V924wFukWEC&amp;pg=PA288|date=1 October 2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-055211-8|pages=288–}}&lt;/ref&gt; While isotopic DNA labeling has little or no effect on protein binding affinity, use of non-isotopic labels including flurophores or biotin can alter the affinity and/or stoichiometry of the protein interaction of interest. Competition between fluorophore- or biotin-labeled probe and unlabeled DNA of the same sequence can be used to determine whether the label alters binding affinity or stoichiometry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16548">'''Elevational diversity gradient''' (EDG) is an ecological pattern where trends in [[biodiversity]] occur at different [[elevation]]s. The EDG states that [[species richness]] tends to increase as elevation increases, up to a certain point, creating a "diversity bulge" at middle elevations. There have been multiple hypotheses proposed for explaining the EDG, none of which accurately describe the phenomenon in full.

A similar pattern, known as the [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|latitudinal diversity gradient]], describes an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the [[equator]]. While the EDG generally follows the LDG (i.e., high elevations in tropical regions have greater biodiversity than high elevations in temperate regions), the LDG does not account for elevational changes.

==Origin==
The first recorded observation of the elevational diversity gradient was by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his treatise ''On the growth of the habitable earth''. In this document, Linnaeus based his predictions on [[flood geology]], assuming most of the world was at one point inundated, leaving only the highest elevations available for terrestrial life. Since, by Linnaeus’ hypothesis, all life was concentrated at high elevations, a higher species diversity would be observed there even as life re-populated lower elevations.

In 1799, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aimé Bonpland]] described elevational changes along the [[Andes|Andean]] slopes, noting how climatic changes impacted plant and animal communities. These observations contributed to [[Leslie Holdridge|Leslie R. Holdridge’s]] "life zone concept" (1947). Climatic variables shaping life zones include mean potential temperature, total annual precipitation, and the ratio of mean annual [[evapotranspiration]] to mean annual precipitation. These variables, most notably precipitation and temperature, vary along an elevational gradient, resulting in the distribution of different ecosystems.&lt;ref name=kricher2011&gt;Kricher, J. C. (2011) What and where are the tropics? Tropical Ecology, pp. 7-25. Princeton UP, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the current literature correlates elevational diversity to gradients in single climatic or biotic variables including "rainfall, temperature, productivity, competition, resource abundance, habitat complexity, or habitat diversity".&lt;ref name=mccain2005&gt;McCain &amp; Christy M. (2005) Elevational gradients in diversity of small mammals. Ecology, 86.2, 366-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===Mid-domain effect===
A pattern in species richness is also observed as one moves along an elevational gradient; generally, species richness is thought to decline with increasing elevation. Whether this decline is monotonic or if it assumes different shapes based on the [[taxa]] or region being studied is still a topic of debate. In a review of previous studies looking at elevational diversity gradients, Rahbek noted the importance of other factors contributing to the shape of a gradient, distinguishing elevational patterns from those described by the latitudinal diversity gradient.&lt;ref name=rahbek1995&gt;Rahbek, C. (1995) The elevational gradient of species richness – a uniform pattern. Ecography, 18, 200–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

For certain taxa and regions, there is a mid elevational peak in species richness. This pattern has received empirical support for small mammals,&lt;ref name=mccain2004&gt;McCain, C. M. (2004) The mid-domain effect applied to elevational gradients: species richness of small mammals in Costa Rica. Journal of Biogeography, 31, 19-31.&lt;/ref&gt; spiders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chaladze | first1 = G. | last2 = Otto | first2 = S. | last3 = Tramp | first3 = S. | title = A spider diversity model for the Caucasus Ecoregion | doi = 10.1007/s10841-014-9649-1 | journal = Journal of Insect Conservation | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–416 | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ants &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chaladze | first1 = G. | title = Climate-based model of spatial pattern of the species richness of ants in Georgia | doi = 10.1007/s10841-012-9464-5 | journal = Journal of Insect Conservation | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 791–800 | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sanders2002&gt;Sanders, N.J.

American Naturalist, 159, 294-304.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[microbes]] have been shown to exhibit not only monotonically decreasing diversity when moving from low to high elevations,&lt;ref name=bryant2008&gt;Bryant, J.A., Lamanna C., Morlon H., Kerkhoff A.J., Enquist B.J. &amp; Green J.L. (2008) Microbes on mountainsides: contrasting elevational patterns of bacterial and plant diversity. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105, 11505–11511.&lt;/ref&gt; but also increasing, hump-shaped, and U-shaped elevational patterns in diversity.&lt;ref name="WangMeier2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Jianjun|last2=Meier|first2=Sandra|last3=Soininen|first3=Janne|last4=Casamayor|first4=Emilio O.|last5=Pan|first5=Feiyan|last6=Tang|first6=Xiangming|last7=Yang|first7=Xiangdong|last8=Zhang|first8=Yunlin|last9=Wu|first9=Qinglong|last10=Zhou|first10=Jizhong|last11=Shen|first11=Ji|title=Regional and global elevational patterns of microbial species richness and evenness|journal=Ecography|volume=40|issue=3|year=2016|pages=393-402|issn=09067590|doi=10.1111/ecog.02216|hdl=10261/131604}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One explanation for a mid elevational peak includes mid elevational [[condensation]] zones.&lt;ref name=rahbek1995 /&gt; Under the assumption that natural boundaries can limit species distributions in varying degrees (for example, a mountain can present absolute elevational limits), Collwell and Lees explained the mid domain effect with geometric theory.&lt;ref name=colwell2000&gt;Colwell, R.K. &amp; Lees, D.C. (2000) The mid-domain effect: geometric constraints on the geography of species richness. Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 15, 70–76.
&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of a mountain, geometric boundary constraints will naturally result in the increasing overlap of species ranges nearing the midpoint of the mountain. Using [[vascular plant|vascular]] [[epiphyte]]s in [[Costa Rica]], Cardelus et al. (2008) noted that the elevational species richness pattern observed was substantially due to the mid domain effect; there was a bulge in epiphyte species richness at 1000m (The [[cloud forest]]).
&lt;!--
[[File:Tropical Ecology Epiphytes.jpg|thumb|Virola with epiphytes (left) and a Virola branch with large bromeliads, ''Werhauia kupperiana'', and fern, ''Phlebodium auretum'']]
--&gt;

This elevational pattern, however, was less consistent for species with small ranges, suggesting that environmental factors may be more clearly accounted for when constraints on domain boundary are loosened. In cases where geometric models fail to explain the location of the midpoint or the trend in species richness, other explanations need to be explored. An example of this can be seen with microbes, which have been shown to exhibit monotonically decreasing diversity when moving from low to high elevations.&lt;ref name=bryant2008 /&gt;

===Mountain-mass effect===
The mountain-mass effect (also known as the [[Massenerhebung effect]] or mass-elevation effect) was proposed in 1904 by [[A. de Quarvain]]. This phenomenon recognizes the correlation between mountain mass and the occurrence of physiognomically similar vegetation types; similarity in vegetation type is observed at higher elevations on large mountain masses.&lt;ref name=flenley1994&gt;Flenley, J. R. (1994) Tropical mon-tane cloud forests. Cloud forest, the Massenerhebung effect, and ultraviolet insolation  (eds L. S. Hamil-ton, J. O. Juvik &amp; E N. Scatena), pp. 150-155. Spring-er-Verlag, New York, New York, USA. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, under a climatically driven mountain–mass effect, there is a “positive linear trend observed in the elevation of highest diversity with mountain height”.&lt;ref name=mccain2005 /&gt; This trend is most evident on isolated mountain peaks.

==Hypotheses==

===Area Hypothesis===
Another hypothesis that is cited to explain the upper limit of the elevational diversity gradient is the area hypothesis, which states that larger areas are able to support more species. As elevation increases, total area decreases; thus, there are more species present at middle elevations than high elevations.

However, this hypothesis does not account for differences between [[lowland]] areas and middle elevations, as lowlands tend to have more area than middle elevations and thus would be expected by this hypothesis to have higher species diversity, an assertion that runs counter to the EDG. Additionally, the area hypothesis does not take climatic conditions or resource availability into account.

===Rainfall hypothesis===
This hypothesis states that diversity increases with increasing [[rainfall]],&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt; however the correlation between rainfall and plant diversity varies from region to region.  The consistency of rainfall seems to correlate more with species richness than total annual rainfall. Species diversity appears to level off when annual rainfall reaches about 4,000mm, however this could be due to sampling limitations. Rainfall and soil richness affect productivity trends which are also believed to affect diversity.&lt;ref name=gentry1988&gt;Gentry, A.H. (1988) Changes in plant community diversity and floristic composition on environmental and geographical gradients. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, 75.1, 1-34. 
&lt;/ref&gt; A mid elevation peak is usually seen in mean annual rainfall.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992&gt;Rosenzweig, M.L. (1992) Species diversity gradients: we know more and less than we thought. Journal of Mammalogy, 73.4, 715-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource diversity hypothesis===
The resource diversity hypothesis states an increase in diversity can be seen when an increase in the diversity of available resources such as soil and food is present.&lt;ref name=gentry1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sanchez2001&gt;SÁnchez-Cordero, V. (2001) Elevation gradients of diversity for rodents and bats in Oaxaca, Mexico. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10, 63–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In this hypothesis diversity increases in an area of higher resource diversity even when resource abundance is constant. However resource diversity, especially pertaining to food, could be a result of other influences, such as rainfall and [[productivity]]; as such, it may be inappropriate to consider the resource diversity hypothesis as a mechanism acting independently of other factors influencing diversity gradients.&lt;ref name=heaney2001&gt;Heaney, L. R. (2001) Small mammal diversity along elevational gradients in the Philippines: an assessment of patterns and hypotheses. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10, 15–39.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productivity hypothesis===
The productivity hypothesis states that diversity increases with increased productivity.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt; There is some contradiction to this as other research suggests that after a certain point increasing productivity actually correlates with a decrease in diversity.&lt;ref name=sanders2007&gt;Sanders, N.J., Lessard, J.P., Fitzpatrick, M.C. &amp; Dunn, R.R. (2007) Temperature, but not productivity or geometry, predicts elevational diversity gradients in ants across spatial grains. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 16, 640–649.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally thought that productivity decreases with an increase in elevation, however there is some research that shows a peak in productivity at mid elevation which may be related to a peak in rainfall within the same area.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt;

===Temperature hypothesis===
The temperature hypothesis correlates increasing temperature with an increase in species diversity, mainly because of temperature's effect on productivity.&lt;ref name=rahbek1995 /&gt; However increasing temperatures due to [[climate change]] have begun to be linked to the spread of [[chytrid]] among frogs in the Tropics. Another concern is that higher-elevation species will become extinct as their ranges become more and more restricted with an increase in temperature.&lt;ref name=pounds2006&gt;Pounds, J. A., Martín R. Bustamante, Luis A. Coloma, Jamie A. Consuegra, Michael P. L. Fogden, Pru N. Foster, Enrique La Marca, Karen L. Masters, Andrés Merino-Viteri, Robert Puschendorf, Santiago R. Ron, G. Arturo Sánchez-Azofeifa, Christopher J. Still, and Bruce E. Young. "Widespread Amphibian Extinctions from Epidemic Disease Driven by Global Warming." Nature 439.7073 (2006): 161-67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothesis is an important factor in considering the [[effects of global warming]].

===Competition===
There are conflicting views on the effect of [[competition (biology)|competition]] on species diversity. Some hold the view that an increase in interspecies competition leads to local [[extinction]]s and a decrease in diversity.&lt;ref name=rosenzweig1992 /&gt; Others view competition as a means of species specialization and niche partitioning, resulting in increase diversity.&lt;ref name=menge1976&gt;Menge, B. A. &amp; Sutherland, J.P. (1976) Species diversity gradients: synthesis of the roles of predation, competition, and temporal heterogeneity. The American Naturalist, 351-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other studies the competition between plant species at high elevations has been shown to facilitate the movement of plant species into high stress environments. The competition between plant species leads to hardier species spreading into the high stress environment. These founder species then provide shelter and facilitate the movement of less hardy species into the area.&lt;ref name=bryant2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=choler2001&gt;Choler, P., Michalet R. &amp; Callaway, R.M. (2001) Facilitation and competition on gradients in alpine plant communities. Ecology, 82, 3295-3308.&lt;/ref&gt; This may result in the movement of plant species up a mountainside.

==State of research==
Current research illuminates a variety of mechanisms than can be used to explain elevational diversity gradients. No one factor can be used to explain the present of diversity gradients within and among taxa; in many cases, we must consider more than one hypothesis or mechanism to fully understand a pattern in elevational diversity. The emerging macroecological experiments along environmental gradients (for example, mountain elevation gradients) are an important tool in ecological research because they allow for the disentangling the effects of individual environmental drivers on biodiversity, the independent effects of which are not be easily separated due to their covariance in nature.&lt;ref name=Wang2016&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Jianjun | last2 = Pan | first2 = Feiyan | last3 = Soininen | first3 = Janne | last4 = Heino | first4 = Jani | last5 = Shen | first5 = Ji | title = Nutrient enrichment modifies temperature-biodiversity relationships in large-scale field experiments | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13960 | pmid = 28000677 | pmc = 5187590 | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 13960 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, microcosm experimental setups in subtropical and subarctic regions (China and Norway, respectively) showed clear segregation of bacterial species along temperature gradients, and interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on biodiversity along mountain elevation gradients.&lt;ref name=Wang2016/&gt; A more expansive research program for mountain [[biogeography]] may be extremely beneficial for conservation biologists seeking to understand factors driving biodiversity in known hot spots.&lt;ref name=lomolino2001&gt;Lomolino, M. V. (2001) Elevation gradients of species-den-sity: historical and prospective views. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10, 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Further research and reviews are also needed to address contradictions in the scientific literature, and to identify the extent of interactions between current explanations and hypotheses.

'''''Etymologicum Magnum''''' ({{lang-el|Ἐτυμολογικὸν Μέγα}}, ''Ἐtymologikὸn Mέga'') (standard abbreviation '''''EM''''', or '''''Etym. M.''''' in older literature) is the traditional title of a Greek lexical [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] by an unknown [[lexicographer]] around 1150 AD. It is the largest Byzantine lexicon and draws on many earlier grammatical, lexical and rhetorical works. Its main sources were two previous ''etymologica'', the so-called ''[[Etymologicum Genuinum]]'' and the ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]''. Other sources include [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], the ''Epitome'' of [[Diogenianus]], the so-called ''Lexicon'' Αἱμωδεῖν (''Haimōdeῖn''), Eulogius’ Ἀπορίαι καὶ λύσεις (''Ἀporίai kaὶ lύseis''), [[Georgius Choeroboscus|George Choeroboscus]]’ ''Epimerismi ad Psalmos'', the ''Etymologicon'' of [[Orion of Thebes]], and collections of [[Scholion|''scholia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897), 248–253, 351–352; Sturz (1820)&lt;/ref&gt; The compiler of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was not a mere copyist; rather he amalgamated, reorganised, augmented and freely modified his source material to create a new and individual work.

The ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was published by [[Zacharias Calliergi|Zacharias Kallierges]] and [[Nikolaos Vlastos]] under the patronage of [[Anna Notaras]] at [[Venice]] in 1499. The typeface was designed and cut by Kallierges, modeled on his own handwriting. The decorative initial letters and headpieces are patterned on the decorations of the Byzantine manuscript tradition, and the woodcut borders incorporate elaborate arabesque designs, usually colored white on red, but also white on gold. The decorations of the Kallierges edition had a great influence in printing, especially on Greek liturgical books.&lt;ref&gt;Ecro Layton, ''Five Centuries of Books and Manuscripts in Modern Greek: A Catalogue of an Exhibition at the Houghton Library December 4, 1987, through February 17, 1988'' (Cambridge: Harvard College Library, 1990), pp. 39-41&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent complete edition is by [[Thomas Gaisford]] (Oxford 1848).&lt;ref&gt;T. Gaisford (ed.), ''Etymologicum Magnum'' (Oxford 1848; repr. Amsterdam 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; A new (uncompleted) edition is in preparation  by F. Lasserre and N. Livadaras (under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Auctum'').&lt;ref&gt;F. Lasserre and N.

'''Eugene Goostman''' is a [[chatbot]] that some regard as having beaten the [[Turing test]], a test of a computer's ability to communicate indistinguishably from a human. Developed in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 2001 by a group of three programmers, the Russian-born Vladimir Veselov, Ukrainian-born Eugene Demchenko, and Russian-born Sergey Ulasen,&lt;ref name="zdnet-eugenepass"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com/computer-chatbot-eugene-goostman-passes-the-turing-test-7000030312/ | title=Computer chatbot 'Eugene Goostman' passes the Turing test | date=8 June 2014 | publisher=ZDNet | accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uor-success/&gt; Goostman is portrayed as a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy—characteristics that are intended to induce forgiveness in those with whom it interacts for its grammatical errors and lack of general knowledge.

The Goostman bot has competed in a number of Turing test contests since its creation, and finished second in the 2005 and 2008 [[Loebner Prize]] contest. In June 2012, at an event marking what would have been the 100th birthday of the test's namesake, [[Alan Turing]], Goostman won a competition promoted as the largest-ever Turing test contest, in which it successfully convinced 29% of its judges that it was human.

On 7 June 2014, at a contest marking the 60th anniversary of Turing's death, 33% of the event's judges thought that Goostman was human; the event's organiser [[Kevin Warwick]] considered it to have passed Turing's test as a result, per Turing's prediction in his 1950 paper [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]], that by the year 2000, machines would be capable of fooling 30% of human judges after five minutes of questioning. The validity and relevance of the announcement of Goostman's pass was questioned by critics, who noted the exaggeration of the achievement by Warwick, the bot's use of personality quirks and humour in an attempt to misdirect users from its non-human tendencies and lack of real intelligence, along with "passes" achieved by other chatbots at similar events.&lt;ref name=newyorker-fail/&gt;&lt;ref name=techdirt-notapass/&gt;&lt;ref name="elreg1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/10/world_to_captain_cyborg_youre_rumbled/ | title=World to Captain Cyborg on 'Turing test' stunt: You're Rumbled | date=10 June 2014 | website=The Register | accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality ==

Eugene Goostman is portrayed as being a 13-year-old boy from [[Odessa]], Ukraine, who has a pet [[guinea pig]] and a father who is a [[gynaecologist]]. Veselov stated that Goostman was designed to be a "character with a believable personality". The choice of age was intentional, as, in Veselov's opinion, a thirteen-year-old is "not too old to know everything and not too young to know nothing". Goostman's young age also induces people who "converse" with him to forgive minor grammatical errors in his responses.&lt;ref name=zdnet-eugenepass/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsci-eugene&gt;{{cite web|title=Bot with boyish personality wins biggest Turing test|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2012/06/bot-with-boyish-personality-wi.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news|website=New Scientist|accessdate=8 June 2014|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, work was made on improving the bot's "dialog controller", allowing Goostman to output more human-like dialogue.&lt;ref name=uor-success/&gt;

A conversation between [[Scott Aaronson]] and Eugene Goostman ran as follows:&lt;ref name="Aaronson-2014-06-19"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1858 |title=My Conversation with "Eugene Goostman," the Chatbot that's All Over the News for Allegedly Passing the Turing Test |last=Aaronson |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Aaronson |work=Shtetl-Optimized, The Blog of Scott Aaronson |date=2014-06-19 |accessdate=2014-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott:''' How many legs does a camel have?
'''Eugene:''' Something between 2 and 4. Maybe, three? :-))) By the way, I still don’t know your specialty – or, possibly, I’ve missed it?
'''Scott:''' How many legs does a millipede have?
'''Eugene:''' Just two, but Chernobyl mutants may have up two five. I know you are supposed to trick me.
'''Scott:''' No, I need to know that you're not a chatbot. Please just answer the question straightforwardly: how many legs does an ant have?
'''Eugene:''' Something between 2 and 4. Maybe three? :-))) Oh, what a fruitful conversation ;-)

== Competitions ==
Eugene Goostman has competed in a number of [[Turing test]] competitions, including the [[Loebner Prize]] contest; it finished joint second in the Loebner test in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/2001_Contest/loebner-prize-2001.html |title=2001 Loebner Prize Competition in Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Loebner.net |date=25 October 2001 |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came second to [[Jabberwacky]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/2005_Contest/results.html |title=2005 Summary of Results |publisher=Loebner.net |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Elbot]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/2008_Contest/loebner-prize-2008.html |title=Loebner Prize 2008 |publisher=Loebner.net |date=12 October 2008 |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June 2012, Goostman won a Turing test competition at [[Bletchley Park]] in [[Milton Keynes]], held to mark the [[Alan Turing Year|centenary]] of its namesake, [[Alan Turing]]. The competition, which featured five bots, twenty-five hidden humans, and thirty judges, was considered to be the largest-ever Turing test contest by its organizers. After a series of five-minute-long text conversations, 29% of the judges were convinced that the bot was an actual human.&lt;ref name=newsci-eugene/&gt;

=== 2014 "pass" ===
On 7 June 2014, in a Turing test competition at the [[Royal Society]], organised by [[Kevin Warwick]] of the [[University of Reading]] to mark the 60th anniversary of Turing's death, Goostman won after 33% of the judges were convinced that the bot was human. 30 judges took part in the event, which included [[John Sharkey, Baron Sharkey|Lord Sharkey]], a sponsor of Turing's posthumous pardon, [[artificial intelligence]] Professor [[Aaron Sloman]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] [[Mark Pagel]] and ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' actor [[Robert Llewellyn]]. Each judge partook in a textual conversation with each of the five bots; at the same time, they also conversed with a human. In all, a total of 300 conversations were conducted.&lt;ref name="uor-success"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR583836.aspx | title=Turing Test success marks milestone in computing history | publisher=University of Reading | date=8 June 2014 | accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-goostman29"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/8/5790936/computer-passes-turing-test-for-first-time-by-convincing-judges-it-is | title=Computer allegedly passes Turing Test for first time by convincing judges it is a 13-year-old boy | date=8 June 2014 | website=The Verge | accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Warwick's view, this made Goostman the first machine to pass a Turing test. In a [[press release]], he added that:

{{blockquote|Some will claim that the Test has already been passed. The words Turing Test have been applied to similar competitions around the world. However this event involved more simultaneous comparison tests than ever before, was independently verified and, crucially, the conversations were unrestricted. A true Turing Test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations.&lt;ref name=uor-success/&gt;}}

In his 1950 paper "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]", Turing predicted that by the year 2000, computer programs would be sufficiently advanced that the average interrogator would, after five minutes of questioning, "not have more than 70 per cent chance" of correctly guessing whether they were speaking to a human or a machine. Although Turing phrased this as a prediction rather than a "threshold for intelligence", commentators believe that Warwick had chosen to interpret it as meaning that if 30% of interrogators were fooled, the software had "passed the Turing test".&lt;ref name=adammann2014&gt;{{cite news |title=That Computer Actually Got an F on the Turing Test |author=Adam Mann |date=9 June 2014 |work=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/turing-test-not-so-fast/ |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=register-turing&gt;{{cite web|title=Someone on the internet ISN'T a 13-year-old boy: Bot beats off Turing Test|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/09/software_passes_turing_test/|website=The Register|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reaction ====
[[File:Kevin Warwick.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kevin Warwick]] considered Goostman to be the first machine to "pass" a Turing test, although the validity of his claim was disputed by critics.]]
The validity of Warwick's claim that Eugene Goostman was the first ever chatbot to pass a Turing test was met with scepticism; critics acknowledged similar "passes" made in the past by other chatbots under the 30% criteria, including PC Therapist in 1991 (which tricked 5 of 10 judges, 50%), and at the [[Techniche]] festival in 2011, where a modified version of [[Cleverbot]] tricked 59.3% of 1334 votes (which included the 30 judges, along with an audience). Cleverbot's developer, [[Rollo Carpenter]], argued that Turing tests can only prove that a machine can "imitate" intelligence rather than show actual intelligence.&lt;ref name="newsci-cleverbot"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20865-software-tricks-people-into-thinking-it-is-human.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news | title=Software tricks people into thinking it is human | date=6 September 2011 | website=The New Scientist | accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsci-noskynet"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25692-no-skynet-turing-test-success-isnt-all-it-seems.html | title=No Skynet: Turing test 'success' isn't all it seems | date=9 June 2014 | website=The New Scientist | accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Marcus]] was critical of Warwick's claims, arguing that Goostman's "success" was only the result of a "cleverly-coded piece of software", going on to say that "it's easy to see how an untrained judge might mistake wit for reality, but once you have an understanding of how this sort of system works, the constant [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirection]] and deflection becomes obvious, even irritating. The illusion, in other words, is fleeting." While acknowledging [[IBM]]'s [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] and [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] projects—single-purpose computer systems meant for playing [[chess]] and ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' respectively—as examples of computer systems that show a degree of intelligence in their specialised field, he further argued that they were not an equivalent to a computer system that shows "broad" intelligence, and could—for example, watch a television programme and answer questions on its content. Marcus stated that "no existing combination of hardware and software can learn completely new things at will the way a clever child can." However, he still believed that there were potential uses for technology such as that of Goostman, specifically suggesting the creation of "believable", interactive video game characters.&lt;ref name=newyorker-fail&gt;{{cite web|title=What comes after the Turing Test?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/06/failing-the-turing-test.html|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imperial College London]] professor Murray Shanahan questioned the validity and scientific basis of the test, stating that it was "completely misplaced, and it devalues real [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] research. It makes it seem like science fiction AI is nearly here, when in fact it's not and it's incredibly difficult."&lt;ref name="telegraph-captaincyborg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10888828/Captain-Cyborg-the-man-behind-the-controversial-Turing-Test-claims.html |title='Captain Cyborg': the man behind the controversial Turing Test claims |last1=Edgar |first1=James |date=10 June 2014 |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Masnick]], editor of the blog ''[[Techdirt]]'', was also skeptical, questioning publicity blunders such as the five chatbots being referred to in press releases as "[[supercomputer]]s", and saying that "creating a chatbot that can fool humans is not really the same thing as creating [[artificial intelligence]]."&lt;ref name=techdirt-notapass&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|title=No, A 'Supercomputer' Did NOT Pass The Turing Test for the First Time And Everyone Should Know Better|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-computer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml|website=Techdirt|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
'''Ferdinand de Saussure''' ({{IPAc-en|s|oʊ|ˈ|sj|ʊər}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|Saussure, Ferdinand de}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|fɛʁdinɑ̃ də sosyʁ|lang}}; 26 November 1857 – 22 February 1913) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[linguist]] and [[semiotician]]. His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics|semiology]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, R. H. 1979. A Short History of Linguistics, 2nd Edition. Longman Linguistics Library. London and New York. p. 201: Robins writes Saussure's statement of "the structural approach to language underlies virtually the whole of modern linguistics".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. and T. J. Taylor. 1989. Landmarks in Linguistic Thought: The Western Tradition from Socrates to Saussure. 2nd Edition. Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguistics&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle, ''Makers of modern culture'', Routledge, 2002, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lodge, Nigel Wood, ''Modern Criticism and Theory: A Reader'', Pearson Education, 2008, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Margaret. 2011.

One of his translators, [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]], summarized Saussure's contribution to linguistics and the study of "the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in linguistics, [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. 1988. Language, Saussure and Wittgenstein. Routledge. pix.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they have undergone extension and critique over time, the dimensions of organization introduced by Saussure continue to inform contemporary approaches to the phenomenon of [[language]]. [[Prague school]] linguist [[Jan Mukařovský]] writes that Saussure's "discovery of the internal structure of the [[Sign (linguistics)|linguistic sign]] differentiated the sign both from mere acoustic 'things'... and from mental processes", and that in this development "new roads were thereby opened not only for linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of literature".&lt;ref&gt;Mukarovsky, J. 1977. On Poetic Language. The Word and Verbal Art: Selected Essays by Jan Mukarovsky. Translated and edited by J. Burbank and Peter Steiner. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruqaiya Hasan]] argues that "the impact of Saussure’s theory of the linguistic sign has been such that modern linguists and their theories have since been positioned by reference to him: they are known as pre-Saussurean, Saussurean, anti-Saussurean, post-Saussurean, or non-Saussure".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Linguistic sign and the science of linguistics: the foundations of appliability.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Geneva]] in 1857. His father was [[Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure]], a [[mineralogist]], [[entomologist]], and [[taxonomist]]. Saussure showed signs of considerable talent and intellectual ability as early as the age of fourteen.&lt;ref name="sljusareva-1972"&gt;Слюсарева, Наталья Александровна: ''Некоторые полузабытые страницы из истории языкознания – Ф. де Соссюр и У. Уитней.'' (Общее и романское языкознание: К 60-летию Р.А. Будагова). Москва 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1870, he began attending the Institution Martine (previously the Institution Lecoultre until 1969), in Geneva. There he lived with the family of a classmate, Elie David.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFW34Ir-aKAC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=%22institution+martine%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=36RKRoO3HD&amp;sig=-uQvxknvtQBPvaQIPsAMlc-Ubak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT35XU_4rTAhVHxlQKHc_dBs0Q6AEIKTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institution%20martine%22&amp;f=false|title=Saussure|last=Joseph|first=John E.|date=2012-03-22|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199695652|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating at the top of class, Saussure expected to continue his studies at the Gymnase de Genève, but his father decided he was not mature enough at fourteen and a half, and sent him to the Collège de Genève instead. Saussure was not pleased, as he complained: "I entered the Collège de Genève, to waste a year there as completely as a year can be wasted."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu6xCK_EFlcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=martine&amp;f=false|title=Saussure|last=Joseph|first=John E.|date=2012-03-22|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191636974|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year of studying [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]] and taking a variety of courses at the [[University of Geneva]], he commenced graduate work at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1876.

Two years later, at 21, Saussure published a book entitled ''Mémoire sur le système primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-européennes'' (''Dissertation on the Primitive Vowel System in Indo-European Languages''). After this he studied for a year at the [[University of Berlin]] under the ''[[Privatdozent]]en'' [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]], with whom he studied Celtic, and [[Hermann Oldenberg]] with whom he continued his studies of Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (2012:253)&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Leipzig to defend his doctoral dissertation ''De l'emploi du génitif absolu en Sanscrit'', and was awarded his doctorate in February 1880. Soon, he relocated to the [[University of Paris]], where he lectured on Sanskrit, [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and [[Old High German]] and occasionally other subjects.

Ferdinand de Saussure is one of the world’s most quoted linguists, which is remarkable as he himself hardly published anything during his lifetime. Even his few scientific articles are not unproblematic. Thus, for example, his publication on Lithuanian phonetics&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand de Saussure, « Aaccentuation lituanienne ». In : Indogermanische Forschungen. Vol. 6, 157 – 166&lt;/ref&gt; is grosso modo taken from studies by the Lithuanian researcher Friedrich Kurschat, with whom Saussure traveled through Lithuania in August 1880 for two weeks and whose (German) books Saussure had read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=8mpbAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kurschat&amp;lr=&amp;hl=de#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Beiträge zur Kunde der littauischen Sprache. Erstes Heft: Deutsch-littauische Phraseologie der Präpositionen. Königsberg 1843, Zweites Heft: Laut- und Tonlehre der littauischen Sprache. Königsberg 1849|last=Kurschat|first=Friedrich|date=1843, 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Saussure, who had studied some basic grammar of Lithuanian in Leipzig for one semester but was unable to speak the language, was thus dependent on Kurschat. It is also questionable to what extent the Cours itself can be traced back to Saussure (alone). Studies have shown that at least the current version and its content are more likely to have the so-called editors Charles Bally and Albert Sèchehaye as their source than Saussure himself&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Trabant, « Saussure contre le Cours ». In: Francois Rastier (Hrsg.): De l'essence double du langage et le renouveau du saussurisme. Limoges: Lambert-Lucas. {{ISBN|978-2-35935-160-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He taught at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] for eleven years during which he was named Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur (Knight of the [[Legion of Honor]]).&lt;ref&gt;Culler, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; When offered a professorship in Geneva in 1892, he returned to Switzerland. Saussure lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European at the [[University of Geneva]] for the remainder of his life. It was not until 1907 that Saussure began teaching the Course of General Linguistics, which he would offer three times, ending in the summer of 1911. He died in 1913 in [[Vufflens-le-Château]], [[Vaud]], Switzerland. His brothers were the linguist and Esperantist [[René de Saussure]], and scholar of ancient Chinese astronomy, [[Léopold de Saussure]]. In turn, his son was the psychoanalyst [[Raymond de Saussure]].

Saussure attempted, at various times in the 1880s and 1890s, to write a book on general linguistic matters. His lectures about important principles of language description in Geneva between 1907 and 1911 were collected and published by his pupils posthumously in the famous ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'' in 1916. Some of his manuscripts, including an unfinished essay discovered in 1996, were published in ''Writings in General Linguistics'', but most of the material in it had already been published in Engler's critical edition of the ''Course'', in 1967 and 1974. (TUFA)

==Work and influence==
Saussure's theoretical reconstructions of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] vocalic system and particularly his [[laryngeal theory|theory of laryngeals]], otherwise unattested at the time, bore fruit and found confirmation after the decipherment of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] in the work of later generations of linguists such as [[Émile Benveniste]] and [[Walter Couvreur]], who both drew direct inspiration from their reading of the 1878 ''Mémoire''.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. F. K. Koerner]], 'The Place of Saussure's Memoire in the development of historical linguistics,' in Jacek Fisiak (ed.) ''Papers from the Sixth International Conference on Historical Linguistics,''(Poznań, Poland, 1983) John Benjamins Publishing, 1985  pp.323-346, p.339.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saussure had a major impact on the development of linguistic theory in the first half of the 20th century. His two currents of thought emerged independently of each other, one in Europe, the other in America. The results of each incorporated the basic notions of Saussure's thought in forming the central tenets of [[structuralism|structural linguistics]]. According to him, linguistic entities are parts of a system and are defined by their relations to one another within said system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Linguistics|last=Aronoff|first=Mark|last2=Rees-Miller|first2=Janie|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=9781405186766|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thinker used the game of [[chess]] for his analogy, citing that the game is not defined by the physical attributes of the chess pieces but the relation of each piece to the other pieces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Saussure's status in contemporary theoretical linguistics, however, is much diminished, with many key positions now dated or subject to challenge, but post-structuralist 21st-century reception remains more open to Saussure's influence.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Gasparov. ''Beyond Pure Reason'', pp1-8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His main contribution to structuralism was his theory of a two-tiered reality about language. The first is the ''langue'', the abstract and invisible layer, while the second, the ''parole'', refers to the actual speech that we hear in real life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Michel Foucault|last=Fendler|first=Lynn|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2010|isbn=9781472518811|location=London|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework was later adopted by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Claude Levi-Strauss]], who used the two-tiered model to determine the reality of myths. His idea was that all myths have an underlying pattern, which form the structure that makes them myths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These established the structuralist framework to literary criticism.

In Europe, the most important work in that period of influence was done by the [[Prague school]]. Most notably, [[Nikolay Trubetzkoy]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] headed the efforts of the Prague School in setting the course of [[phonology|phonological theory]] in the decades from 1940. Jakobson's universalizing structural-functional theory of phonology, based on a [[markedness]] hierarchy of [[distinctive features]], was the first successful solution of a plane of linguistic analysis according to the Saussurean hypotheses. Elsewhere, [[Louis Hjelmslev]] and [[the Copenhagen school (linguistics)|the Copenhagen School]] proposed new interpretations of linguistics from structuralist theoretical frameworks.

In America, Saussure's ideas informed the distributionalism of [[Leonard Bloomfield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Earl Joseph| title = From Whitney to Chomsky: Essays in the History OfAmerican Linguisitcs| url = https://books.google.com/?id=RUvdfiILAngC&amp;pg=PA139| year = 2002| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing| isbn = 978-90-272-4592-2| page = 139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the post-Bloomfieldian structuralism of such scholars as [[Eugene Nida]], [[Bernard Bloch (linguist)|Bernard Bloch]], [[George L. Trager]], Rulon S. Wells III, [[Charles Hockett]] and, through [[Zellig Harris]], the young [[Noam Chomsky]]. In addition to Chomsky's theory of [[transformational grammar]], other contemporary developments of structuralism included [[Kenneth Pike]]'s theory of [[tagmemics]], [[Sidney Lamb]]'s theory of [[stratificational grammar]], and [[Michael Silverstein]]'s work. [[Systemic functional linguistics]] is a theory considered to be based firmly on the Saussurean principles of the sign, albeit with some modifications. [[Ruqaiya Hasan]] describes [[systemic functional linguistics]] as a 'post-Saussurean' linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Michael Halliday]] argues:

{{quote|Saussure took the sign as the organizing concept for linguistic structure, using it to express the conventional nature of language in the phrase "l'arbitraire du signe". This has the effect of highlighting what is, in fact, the one point of arbitrariness in the system, namely the phonological shape of words, and hence allows the non-arbitrariness of the rest to emerge with greater clarity. An example of something that is distinctly non-arbitrary is the way different kinds of meaning in language are expressed by different kinds of grammatical structure, as appears when linguistic structure is interpreted in functional terms &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, MAK. 1977.

===''Course in General Linguistics''===
{{Main article|Course in General Linguistics}}

Saussure's most influential work, ''Course in General Linguistics'' (''Cours de linguistique générale''), was published posthumously in 1916 by former students [[Charles Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye]], on the basis of notes taken from Saussure's lectures in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;Macey, D. (2009). The Penguin dictionary of critical theory. Crane Library at the University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Course'' became one of the [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] linguistics works of the 20th century not primarily for the content (many of the ideas had been anticipated in the works of other 20th century linguists) but for the innovative approach that Saussure applied in discussing linguistic phenomena.

Its central notion is that language may be analyzed as a [[formal system]] of differential elements, apart from the messy dialectics of real-time production and comprehension. Examples of these elements include his notion of the [[sign (linguistics)|linguistic sign]], which is composed of the signifier and the signified. Though the sign may also have a referent, Saussure took that to lie beyond the linguist's purview.

Throughout the book, he stated that a linguist can develop a diachronic analysis of a text or theory of language but must learn just as much or more about the language/text as it exists at any moment in time (i.e. "synchronically"): "Language is a system of signs that expresses ideas". A science that studies the life of signs within society and is a part of social and general psychology. Saussure believed that semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign, he called it semiology.

===Laryngeal theory===
While a student, Saussure published an important work in [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] [[philology]] that proposed the existence of ghosts in Proto-Indo-European called ''sonant coefficients''. The Scandinavian scholar [[Hermann Möller]] suggested that they might actually be laryngeal consonants, leading to what is now known as the laryngeal theory. It has been argued that the problem that Saussure encountered, trying to explain how he was able to make systematic and predictive hypotheses from known linguistic data to unknown linguistic data, stimulated his development of [[structuralism]]. His predictions about the existence of primate coefficients/laryngeals and their evolution proved a success when [[Hittite texts]] were discovered and deciphered, some 50 years later.

===Later critics===
{{POV|what=subsection|talk=POV in %22Later Critics%22 subsection|date=January 2018}}
The closing sentence of Saussure's ''Course in General Linguistics'' has been challenged in many{{weasel inline|date=September 2016}} academic disciplines and subdisciplines with its contention that "linguistics has as its unique and true object the language envisioned in itself and for itself".&lt;ref&gt;Boris Gasparov. ''Beyond Pure Reason'', pp59-60, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; By the latter half of the 20th century, many of Saussure's ideas were under heavy criticism.

Saussure's linguistic ideas are still considered important for their time but have since suffered considerably under rhetorical developments aimed at showing how linguistics had changed or was changing with the times. As a consequence, Saussure's ideas are now often presented by professional linguists as outdated and as superseded by developments such as [[cognitive linguistics]] and [[generative grammar]] or have been so modified in their basic tenets as to make their use in their original formulations difficult without risking distortion, as in [[systemic linguistics]]. That development is occasionally overstated, however; [[Jan Koster]] states, "Saussure, considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language,"&lt;ref&gt;Koster, Jan. 1996. "Saussure meets the brain", in R. Jonkers, E. Kaan, J. K. Wiegel, eds., Language and Cognition 5. Yearbook 1992 of the Research Group for Linguistic Theory and Knowledge Representation of the University of Groningen, Groningen, pp. 115–120.[http://www.let.rug.nl/koster/old%20papers/saussure.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Over-reactions can also be seen in comments of the cognitive linguist Mark Turner&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Mark. 1987. Death is the Mother of Beauty: Mind, Metaphor, Criticism. University of Chicago Press, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; who reports that many of Saussure's concepts were "wrong on a grand scale". It is necessary to be rather more finely nuanced in the positions attributed to Saussure and in their longterm influence on the development of linguistic theorizing in all schools; for a more recent rereading of Saussure with respect to such issues, see Paul Thibault.&lt;ref&gt;Thibault, Paul. 1996. Re-reading Saussure: The Dynamics of Signs in Social Life. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as many principles of structural linguistics are still pursued, modified and adapted in current practice and according to what has been learnt since about the embodied functioning of brain and the role of language within this, basic tenets begun with Saussure still can be found operating behind the scenes today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Semiology===
Saussure is one of the founding fathers of [[semiotics]]. His term for the field was "semiology." Instead of focusing his theory on the origins of language and its historical aspects, Saussure concentrated on the patterns and functions of language itself. He believed that the relationship that exists between the signifier and the signified is purely [[Semiotic arbitrariness|arbitrary]] and analytical. His "sign/signifier/signified/referent" scheme forms the core of the field. Equally crucial but often overlooked or misapplied is the dimension of the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes of linguistic description.

Some linguists have pointed out to the fact that Saussure did not 'invent' semiotics but built upon [[Neoplatonist]]/[[Augustinianism|Augustinian]] knowledge from the [[Middle Ages]], particularly in regard to the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]: "as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies".&lt;ref&gt;Munteanu, E. 'On the Object-Language/Metalanguage Distinction in Saint Augustine's Works: De Dialectica and de Magistro', p. 65. In: Cram, D., Linn, A. R., &amp; Nowak, E. (eds.). ''History of Linguistics 1996'': Volume 2: ''From Classical to Contemporary Linguistics''. John Benjamins Publishing Company. Retrieved April 16, 2015 from https://books.google.com/books?id=IWtCAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence outside linguistics===
The principles and methods employed by structuralism were later adapted in diverse fields by French intellectuals such as [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Lacan]], and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. Such scholars took influence from Saussure's ideas in their own areas of study (literary studies/philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropology, respectively). However, their analogous interpretations of Saussure's linguistic theories led to proclamations of the end of structuralism in the two disciplines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[File:Aeroflot Boeing 777 inflight.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|Modern aircraft designs like the [[Boeing 777]] rely on sophisticated flight computers to aid and protect the aircraft in flight. These are governed by computational laws which assign flight control modes during flight]]
Aircraft with [[fly-by-wire]] flight controls require computer-controlled '''flight control modes''' that are capable of determining the operational mode (computational law) of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="urlCrossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossingtheskies.com/fly-by-wire-airbus-laws/ |title=Crossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing 777"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://euler.ecs.umass.edu/ece655/Boeing777.ppt |title=The Boeing 777 |format=powerpoint  |work= by Saurabh  Chheda |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reduction of electronic flight control can be caused by the failure of a computational device, such as the flight control computer or an information providing device, such as the [[ADIRU]].&lt;ref name="Skybrary: Flight Control Laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Flight_Control_Laws |title=Skybrary: Flight Control Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aircraft flight control systems|Electronic flight control systems]] (EFCS) also provide augmentation in normal flight, such as increased protection of the aircraft from overstress or providing a more comfortable flight for passengers by recognizing and correcting for [[turbulence]] and providing [[yaw damper|yaw damping]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Two aircraft manufacturers produce commercial passenger aircraft with primary flight computers that can perform under different flight control modes (or laws). The most well-known are the ''normal'', ''alternate'', ''direct'' and ''mechanical laws'' of the [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A320 family|A320]]-[[Airbus A380|A380]].&lt;ref name="urlCrossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws"/&gt;

These newer aircraft use electronic control systems to increase safety and performance while saving aircraft weight. These electronic systems are lighter than the old mechanical systems and can also protect the aircraft from overstress situations, allowing designers to reduce over-engineered components, which further reduces the aircraft's weight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Flight control laws (Airbus)==
[[File:Gulfair.a330-200.a40-kc.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A330-200 in flight]]

Airbus aircraft designs after the [[Airbus A300|A300]]/[[Airbus A310|A310]] are almost completely controlled by fly-by-wire equipment. These newer aircraft, including the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]], [[Airbus A330|A330]], [[Airbus A340|A340]], [[Airbus A350|A350]] and [[Airbus A380|A380]] operate under Airbus flight control laws.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/pdf/plane/airbus/A330/systems/0010/ |title=Airbus 330 – Systems – Flight Controls |format= |work=SmartCockpit – Airline training guides, Aviation, Operations, Safety |accessdate=July 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090612084314/http://www.smartcockpit.com/pdf/plane/airbus/A330/systems/0010/ |archivedate=June 12, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight controls on the Airbus A330, for example, are all electronically controlled and hydraulically activated. Some surfaces, such as the rudder, can also be mechanically controlled. In normal flight, the computers act to prevent excessive forces in pitch and roll.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;[[File:Fly by wire A321 cockpit.jpg|thumb|left|Airbus A321 Cockpit]] 
[[File:Airspeed indication system - fly by wire.png|thumb|Illustration of the Air-data reference system on Airbus A330]]

The aircraft is controlled by three primary control computers (captain's, first officer's, and standby) and two secondary control computers (captain's and first officer's). In addition there are two flight control data computers (FCDC) that read information from the sensors, such as air data (airspeed, altitude). This is fed along with GPS data, into three [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] processing units known as [[air data inertial reference unit]]s (ADIRUs) that act both as an air data reference and inertial reference. ADIRUs are part of the air data inertial reference system, which, on the Airbus is linked to eight [[air data module]]s: three are linked to [[pitot tubes]] and five are linked to static sources. Information from the ADIRU is fed into one of several flight control computers (primary and secondary flight control). The computers also receive information from the control surfaces of the aircraft and from the pilots aircraft control devices and autopilot. Information from these computers is sent both to the  pilot's primary flight display and also to the control surfaces.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

There are four named flight control laws, however ''alternate law'' consists of two modes, ''alternate law 1'' and ''alternate law 2''. Each of these modes have different sub modes: ground mode, flight mode and flare, plus a back-up ''mechanical law''.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Normal law===
''Normal law'' differs depending on the stage of flight. These include:{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

*Stationary at the gate
*Taxiing from the gate to a runway or from a runway back to the gate
*Beginning the take-off roll
*Initial climb
*Cruise climb and cruise flight at altitude
*Final descent, flare and landing.

During the transition from take-off to cruise there is a 5-second transition, from descent to flare there is a two-second transition, and from flare to ground there is another 2 second transition in ''normal law''.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

====Ground mode====
The aircraft behaves as in direct mode: the autotrim feature is turned off and there is a direct response of the elevators to the sidestick inputs. The horizontal stabilizer is set to 4° up &lt;!-- Stab nose up? Clarify--&gt; but manual settings &lt;!-- Manual settings, keyed in to the FMS? Clarify --&gt;(e.g. for center of gravity) override this setting. After the wheels leave the ground, a 5-second transition occurs where ''normal law – flight mode'' takes over from ''ground mode''.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

====Flight mode====
The flight mode of ''normal law'' provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, high speed, high-[[angle of attack|AOA]] and [[bank angle]]. ''Flight mode'' is operational from take-off, until shortly before the aircraft lands, around 100 feet above ground level. It can be lost prematurely as a result of pilot commands or system failures. Loss of ''normal law'' as a result of a system failure results in ''alternate law 1'' or ''2''.&lt;ref name="urlAirbus Flight Control Laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airbusdriver.net/airbus_fltlaws.htm |title=Airbus Flight Control Laws |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike conventional controls, in ''normal law'' vertical side stick movement corresponds to a load factor proportional to stick deflection independent of aircraft speed. When the stick is neutral and the load factor is 1g, the aircraft remains in level flight without the pilot changing the elevator trim. Horizontal side stick movement commands a roll rate, and the aircraft maintains a proper pitch angle once a turn has been established, up to 33° bank. The system prevents further trim up when the angle of attack is excessive, the load factor exceeds 1.3g, or when the bank angle exceeds 33°.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Alpha protection (α-Prot) prevents stalling and guards against the effects of windshear. The protection engages when the angle of attack is between α-Prot and α-Max and limits the angle of attack commanded by the pilot's sidestick or, if autopilot is engaged, it disengages the autopilot.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
 
High speed protection will automatically recover from an overspeed. There are two speed limitations for high altitude aircraft, V&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt; (maximum operational velocity) and M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt; (maximum operational Mach) the two speeds are the same at approximately 31,000 feet, below which overspeed is determined by V&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt; and above which by M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

====Flare mode====
[[File:Airbus A380.jpg|thumb|right|A380 in take off]]
This mode is automatically engaged when the [[radar altimeter]] indicates 100 feet above ground. At 50 feet the aircraft trims the nose slightly down. During the flare, ''normal law'' provides high-[[angle of attack|AOA]] protection and bank angle protection. The load factor is permitted to be from 2.5g to −1g, or 2.0g to 0g when slats are extended. Pitch attitude is limited from −15° to +30°, and upper limit is further reduced to +25° as the aircraft slows.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Alternate law===
There are four reconfiguration modes for the Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft: ''alternate law 1'', ''alternate law 2'', ''direct law'' and ''mechanical law''. The ground mode and flare modes for ''alternate law'' are identical to those modes for ''normal law''.

'''Alternate law 1''' (ALT1)  mode combines a ''normal law'' lateral mode with the load factor, bank angle protections retained. High angle of attack protection may be lost and low energy (level flight stall) protection is lost. High speed and high angle of attack protections enter alternative law mode.&lt;ref name="urlAirbus Flight Control Laws"/&gt;

ALT1 may be entered if there are faults in the horizontal stabilizer, an elevator, yaw-damper actuation, slat or flap sensor, or a single air data reference fault.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

'''Alternate law 2''' (ALT2) loses ''normal law'' lateral mode (replaced by roll direct mode and yaw alternate mode) along with pitch attitude protection, bank angle protection and low energy protection. Load factor protection is retained. High angle of attack and high speed protections are retained unless the reason for ''alternate law 2'' mode is the failure of two air-data references or if the two remaining air data references disagree.&lt;ref name="urlAirbus Flight Control Laws"/&gt;

ALT2 mode is entered when 2 engines flame out (on dual engine aircraft), faults in two inertial or air-data references, with the autopilot being lost, except with an ADR disagreement. This mode may also be entered with an all spoilers fault, certain ailerons fault, or pedal transducers fault.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Direct law===
''Direct law'' (DIR) introduces a direct stick-to-control surfaces relationship:&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt; control surface motion is directly related to the sidestick and rudder pedal motion.&lt;ref name="urlCrossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws"/&gt; The trimmable horizontal stabilizer can only be controlled by the manual trim wheel. All protections are lost, and the maximum deflection of the elevators is limited for each configuration as a function of the current aircraft centre of gravity. This aims to create a compromise between adequate pitch control with a forward C.G. and not-too-sensitive control with an aft C.G.&lt;ref name="A320AFM"&gt;Airbus A320 AFM (requires page number, publisher, etc)&lt;/ref&gt;

DIR is entered if there is failure of three inertial reference units or the primary flight computers, faults in two elevators, or flame-out in two engines (on a two-engine aircraft) when the captain's primary flight computer is also inoperable.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Mechanical law===
In the ''mechanical law'' back-up mode, pitch is controlled by the mechanical trim system and lateral direction is controlled by the rudder pedals operating the rudder mechanically.&lt;ref name="urlCrossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws"/&gt;

==Boeing 777 Primary Flight Control System==
[[File:Boeing 777-200ER cockpit.jpg|thumb|right|The cockpit of the 777 is similar to 747-400, a fly-by-wire control simulating mechanical control]]
The fly-by-wire electronic flight control system of the Boeing 777 differs from the Airbus EFCS. The design principle is to provide a system that responds similarly to a mechanically controlled system.&lt;ref name="Boeing B-777: Fly-By-Wire Flight Controls"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davi.ws/avionics/TheAvionicsHandbook_Cap_11.pdf |title=11 Boeing B-777: Fly-By-Wire Flight Controls |format=pdf | author=Gregg F. Bartley – Boeing | date=May 4, 2008 | accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the system is controlled electronically the flight control system can provide [[flight envelope]] protection.

The electronic system is subdivided between 2 levels, the 4 actuator control electronics (ACE) and the 3 primary flight computers (PFC). The ACEs control actuators (from those on pilot controls to control surface controls and the PFC). The role of the PFC is to calculate the control laws and provide feedback forces, pilot information and warnings.&lt;ref name="Boeing B-777: Fly-By-Wire Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Standard protections and augmentations===
The flight control system on the 777 is designed to restrict control authority beyond certain range by increasing the back pressure once the desired limit is reached. This is done via electronically controlled [[backdrive]] actuators (controlled by ACE). The protections and augmentations are: bank angle protection, turn compensation, stall protection, over-speed protection, pitch control, stability augmentation and thrust asymmetry compensation. The design philosophy is: "to inform the pilot that the command being given would put the aircraft outside of its normal operating envelope, but the ability to do so is not precluded."&lt;ref name="Boeing B-777: Fly-By-Wire Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Normal mode===
In ''normal mode'' the PFCs transmit actuator commands to the ACEs, which convert them into analog servo commands. Full functionality is provided, including all enhanced performance, envelope protection and ride quality features.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Secondary mode===
Boeing ''secondary mode'' is comparable to the Airbus ''alternate law'', with the PFCs supplying commands to the ACEs. However, EFCS functionality is reduced, including loss of flight envelope protection. Like the Airbus system, this state is entered when a number of failures occur in the EFCS or interfacing systems (e.g. ADIRU or [[SAARU]]).&lt;ref name="Boeing 777"/&gt;

'''''{{Lang|de|Gebrauchsmusik}}''''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈbʁaʊ̯ksmuˌziːk}}) is a German term, meaning "utility [[music]]", for music that exists not only for its own sake, but which was [[musical composition|composed]] for some specific, identifiable purpose. This purpose can be a particular historical event, like a political rally or a military ceremony, or it can be more general, as with music written to accompany dance, or music written for amateurs or students to perform.

While composer [[Paul Hindemith]] is probably the figure most identified with this expression, it seems to have been coined within the realm of [[musicology]] rather than composition. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the modern academic discipline of musicology was formulated by a mainly German group of scholars who were interested not only in formal development and biographical data, but also to an extent in the sociopolitical position of music throughout history, and the relationship of music and musicians to society at large.

==Paul Nettl's view of dance music==
Perhaps the first such musicologist to use the word ''Gebrauchsmusik'' was {{ill|Paul Nettl|de}}, writing in 1921 ("Beiträge zur Geschichte der Tanzmusik im 17. Jahrhundert", ''Zeitschrift für Musikwissenschaft'', iv [1921–2], 257–65), who employed it in reference to half of his perceived binarism between that 17th-century dance music which was in fact danced to, and that which was written in dance forms but was actually abstract music intended only for listening (by extension, this duality applied to the dichotomy between any music for a specific purpose, ''Gebrauchsmusik'', and that for none but the pleasure or edification of listening, ''Vortragsmusik'').

Nettl arrived at this dual-development view of dance music through his observation that such pieces began, as the century progressed, to use stylistic and formal devices that were farther from the province of simple utility and more aligned with some anticipation of a listening audience paying full attention. The period's emerging binary dance form featured such characteristics as an increasing tonicization of foreign keys, an increasingly explicit and emphasized dominant-tonic tonal axis, and a refined delicacy of ornamentation, all of which would seem superfluous in application to a music intended only as the rhythmic accompaniment to physical activity. In addition to these developments in the individual movements, they were organized into ever more extended and stylized [[suite (music)|suite]]s, which greatly resembled other instrumental forms of the day. Indeed, the mature [[sonata da camera]] is virtually indistinguishable from the dance suite of the time.

Nettl saw in this situation a clear distinction between music that was intended mainly to be in the service of dancers, and that which was mainly intended to service the ideals of art. In articulating this distinction, however, Nettl did not imply that utility music was unimportant artistically. Instead, he pointed out the importance of social need or desire as a catalyst for artistic development.

==Heinrich Besseler's thesis==
Two years later, also discussing the 17th-century suite (in ''Beiträge zur Stilgeschichte der deutschen Suite im 17. Jahrhundert'', his dissertation of 1923), [[Heinrich Besseler]] went a step further, to imply that such utility music was socially superior, if not artistically so. For Besseler, "aesthetic access" (''{{Lang|de|Zugangsweise}}'') to the dance music was gained through participation, be it playing, dancing, or even singing along, rather than mere listening. He further expounded this thesis in a 1925 article on motets of the [[Medieval music|Medieval period]], in which he proposed that such works had not been designed for the enjoyment of listeners, but with only their devotional purpose in mind; this purpose would only be fulfilled through participation, whether performance or prayer. In making this point, Besseler sought to divide all music into two distinct categories, continuing to use the word ''Gebrauchsmusik'' for one, and likening this to vernacular language, while replacing Nettl's word for the other with ''eigenständige Musik''&amp;mdash;alone-standing, or autonomous music. Besseler had studied philosophy with [[Martin Heidegger]], and thought that this musical duality reflected Heidegger's between "thing" and "equipment", for the autonomous and the specific-purposed, respectively.

==The politics of Gebrauchsmusik and its later discrediting==
It was Besseler's notion of this concept which took hold in German musical culture of the 1920s and 1930s, becoming something of a controversy within that sphere, and even spilling into political ideology. Such a distinction had always existed in music, and that some works had always been composed for specific occasions and others not (at least since the [[Renaissance]], in all probability), is attested to by the work of Besseler and Nettl, who based their concepts on studies of the historical situation. Even so, the musicologically conceived term ''Gebrauchsmusik'' somehow came to be construed as a concept of modern political administration. Some composers and government officials identified a need for community music, to be played by amateurs and young people at large festivals; the long German tradition of community singing benefited greatly from this impulse. Hindemith, [[Kurt Weill]], and many others contributed works with such intentions in mind as the fledgling [[Weimar Republic]] tried to stave off collapse. The cultural, rather than solely political, nature of this movement will be seen, however, from the observation that Hindemith was for the most part a political agnostic, while Weill was an avowed leftist. Composers, regardless of their political views, were largely in favor of the ''Gebrauchsmusik'' concept at its outset because a recognized need and desire for occasion-tailored works would lead to a constant call for them. All combatants in the political arena saw in community music-making a potential glue with which to unite the German people behind their respective agendas; rather than expend the often wasted effort of regaling them with rhetoric, left and right alike could simply awe the public with spectacle and envelop them in the ecstasy of art. The right wing took ''Gebrauchsmusik'' as a tool when the former began its ascendancy, which is probably the main reason for the latter's increased discredit and abandonment as the decade progressed, and the most important German artists and thinkers departed for more hospitable locales.

A second reason, though, for this discredit was the occurrence to certain composers and their followers that composing music for large-scale public use would lead to a need for them to pander as well to large-scale public taste. Such a concept was anathematic to the [[Art for art's sake|art-for-art's-sake]] ideal which followed alongside that of community music in Germany since the days of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who had ushered in the era of the well-regarded and financially successful free-lance composer. [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] wrote to the effect that ''Gebrauchsmusik'' would hardly out-live its present-day application, while that composed for art and no other purpose would have the only chance at immortality. Schoenberg also noted that there had been less and less call for such utility music since the end of the Republic anyway, and certainly since the conclusion of the war. As a result of this, ''Gebrauchsmusik'''s most ardent promoters had again become "ideal artists". (Schoenberg, ''Style and Idea'', 1950). Earlier (articles of 1924 and 1932), the critic [[Theodor Adorno]] had called the work of Hindemith and other ''Gebrauchsmusiker'' symptomatic of "false [social] consciousness", and condemned it as being not truly useful at all, due to what he considered its lack of emotional content. By the late 1950s, ''Gebrauchsmusik'' had become almost universally a term of insult, especially among composers. No less than Hindemith attempted, somewhat, to back away from it, when in a lecture at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1950, he said that "quite obviously music for which no use can be found, that is to say, useless music, is not entitled to public consideration anyway and consequently the ''Gebrauch'' is taken for granted", and also that "[u]p to this day it has been impossible to kill the silly term and the unscrupulous classification that goes with it." (quoting himself in ''A Composer's World'', 1952)

==Reassessment==
Adorno had included [[Stravinsky]] among the targets of his anti-''Gebrauchsmusik'' diatribes, and though the terminology and classification-system under present consideration is clearly and primarily German, the impulse of composers to write and officials to commission music for specific or ceremonial use is quite obviously universal. Stravinsky is perhaps not the best example of a non-German composer in such a vein who was active in the 1920s and 1930s, but he did make his name largely with a series of ballets. Along with these, it will be well-remembered that immortal and beloved works of [[Carl Orff|Orff]], [[Zoltán Kodály|Kodály]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]], [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], and many others were written under the impulse of ''Gebrauchsmusik''. As the dawn of the 21st century pushes the blinding political travails of times past into the fog of history{{Fact|date=May 2013}}, modern commentators have begun to consider that, while ''Gebrauchsmusik'' may compromise the composer in some respects, many of the greatest works of not only the 20th century but the 19th and earlier (witness the French tradition of vast, ceremonial works from that period) were composed with public and popular usage in mind. As Kurt Weill wrote in 1929, the use for which a composition was intended and its artistic value are matters for separate consideration. Indeed, they always have been, and continue to be now; to this attests the continued success of the above-considered composers and their works long after their original "utility" has subsided.

It comprises 32 diagnostic characteristics, divided into four sub-scales.  The four sub-scales are Social Interaction, Restricted Patterns of Behaviour, Cognitive Patterns, and Pragmatic Skills.  An optional additional sub-scale of eight items, Early Development, can also be included.&lt;ref name=SoodOswald /&gt;

The rating scores on each of the sub-scales are combined by simple summation to form an overall score, the '''Asperger's disorder quotient'''.&lt;ref name=SoodOswald /&gt;

Administering the test takes 10 minutes.&lt;ref name=VVvdE /&gt;  The scale is available in forms for teachers as well as parents, and like the [[Gilliam Autism Rating Scale]] it is comparatively less complicated to administer and score than other tests such as the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] or the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised|Autism Diagnostic Interview — Revised]] (although both of these more complex tests are increasingly used in research).&lt;ref name=Wilmshurst /&gt;

Since health literacy is a primary contributing factor to [[health disparities]], it is a continued and increasing concern for health professionals. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Health Literacy of America's Adults: Results From the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy|last=Kutner|first=MA|last2=Greenberg|first2=E|last3=Jin|first3=Y|last4=Paulson|first4=C|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals have difficulty with common health tasks including reading the label of a prescribed drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Health Literacy: Why We Need Accessible Health Information|url=http://health.gov/communication/literacy/issuebrief/|website=health.gov|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors may influence health literacy. However, the following factors have been shown to strongly increase this risk: age (especially patients 65 years and older), limited English language proficiency or English as a second language, less education, and lower socioeconomic status. Patients with low health literacy understand less about their medical conditions and treatments and overall report worse health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1999-02-10|title=Health literacy: report of the Council on Scientific Affairs. Ad Hoc Committee on Health Literacy for the Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10022112|journal=JAMA|volume=281|issue=6|pages=552–557|issn=0098-7484|pmid=10022112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various interventions, such as simplifying information and illustrations, avoiding [[jargon]], using "[[The teach-back method|teach-back]]" methods, and encouraging patients' questions, have improved health behaviors in persons with low health literacy. The proportion of adults aged 18 and over in the U.S., in the year 2010, who reported that their health care providers always explained things so they could understand them was about 60.6%.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/health-communication-and-health-information-technology/national-snapshot|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number increased 1% from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov" /&gt; The [[Healthy People program#Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020|Healthy People 2020]] initiative of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] has included health literacy as a pressing new topic, with objectives for improving it in the decade to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=18|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society as a whole is responsible for improving health literacy. Most importantly, improving health literacy is the responsibility of healthcare and public health professionals and systems.

==Characteristics==

=== Plain language ===
In order to have a patient that understands health terms and can make proper health decisions, the language used by health professionals has to be at a level that others who are not in the medical field can understand. Health professionals must know their audience in order to better serve their patients. The language used by these professionals should be [[plain language]]. Plain language is a strategy for making written and oral information easier to understand; it is communication that users can understand the first time they read or hear it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Health Literacy - Fact Sheet: Health Literacy Basics|url = http://health.gov/communication/literacy/quickguide/factsbasic.htm|website = health.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some key elements of plain language include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/TOC.cfm|title=Federal Plain Language Guidelines: Table of Contents|website=www.plainlanguage.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Organizing information so most important points come first
* Breaking complex information into understandable chunks
* Using simple language and defining technical terms
* Using active voice
* Using lists and tables to make complex material easier to understand

The National Institute of Health (NIH) recommends that patient education materials should be not written higher than a 6th-7th grade reading level; further recommendations provided by the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison are published in their [https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication "Clear Communication" Initiative.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication|title=Clear Communication|work=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Many factors determine the health literacy level of [[health education]] materials or interventions: [[Reading level|readability]] of the text, the patient's current state of health, [[language barrier]]s of the patient, cultural appropriateness of the materials, format and style, sentence structure, use of illustrations, and numerous other factors.

A study of 2,600 patients conducted in 1995 by two US hospitals found that between 26% and 60% of patients could not understand medication directions, a standard [[informed consent]] form, or materials about scheduling an appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. V. Williams|year=1995|title=Inadequate functional health literacy among patients at two public hospitals|journal=JAMA|volume=274|issue=21|pages=677–82|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/21/1677|accessdate=2006-06-30|doi=10.1001/jama.274.21.1677|pmid=7474271|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and  concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
The young and multidisciplinary field of '''health literacy''' emerged from two groups of experts: physicians, health providers such as nurses,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, C., and Piano, MR. (2013) "Health literacy and nursing: an update." The American Journal of Nursing.  Jun;113(6):52-7. doi: 10.1097/01.NAJ.0000431271.83277.2f.&lt;/ref&gt; and health educators; and [[Adult Basic Education]] (ABE) and [[English as a second language]] (ESL) practitioners in the field of education. [[Physicians]] and [[nurses]] are a source of patient comprehension and compliance studies. Adult Basic Education / English for Speakers of Languages Other Than English (ABE/ESOL) specialists study and design interventions to help people develop reading, writing, and conversation skills and increasingly infuse curricula with health information to promote better health literacy. A range of approaches to adult education brings health literacy skills to people in traditional classroom settings, as well as where they work and live.

===Biomedical approach===
The [[biomedical approach]] to health literacy that became dominant (in the U.S.) during the 1980s and 1990s often depicted individuals as lacking health literacy or "suffering" from low health literacy. This approach assumed that recipients are passive in their possession and reception of health literacy and believed that models of literacy and health literacy are politically neutral and universally applicable. This approach is found lacking when placed in the context of broader ecological, critical, and cultural approaches to health. This approach has produced, and continues to reproduce, numerous correlational studies.&lt;ref&gt;Pleasant &amp; Kuruvilla, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Level of health literacy is considered adequate when the population has sufficient knowledge, skills, and confidence to guide their own health, and people are able to stay healthy, recover from illness, and/or live with disability or disease.&lt;ref name="McMurray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne McMurray|title=Community Health and Wellness: A Sociological Approach|location=Brisbane|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-7295-3788-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMurray states that health literacy is important in a community because it addresses health inequities. It is no coincidence that individuals with lower levels of health literacy live, disproportionally, in communities with lower socio-economic standing. A barrier to achieving adequate health literacy for these individuals is a lack of awareness, or understanding of, information and resources relevant to improving their health. This knowledge gap arises from both patients being unable to understand information presented to them and hospitals' inadequate efforts and materials to address these literacy gaps.

A more robust view of health literacy includes the ability to [[Scientific literacy|understand scientific concepts]], content, and health research; skills in spoken, written, and online communication; critical interpretation of mass media messages; navigating complex systems of health care and governance; knowledge and use of community capital and resources; and using cultural and indigenous knowledge in health decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=1460-2245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ratzan|first=S.

This perspective defines health literacy as the wide range of skills, and competencies that people develop over their lifetimes to seek out, comprehend, evaluate, and use health information and concepts to make informed choices, reduce health risks, and increase quality of life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarcadoolas|first=Christina|last2=Pleasant|first2=Andrew|last3=Greer|first3=David S.|date=June 2005|title=Understanding health literacy: an expanded model|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15788526|journal=Health Promotion International|volume=20|issue=2|pages=195–203|doi=10.1093/heapro/dah609|issn=0957-4824|pmid=15788526}}&lt;/ref&gt; While various definitions vary in wording, they all fall within this conceptual framework.

Defining health literacy in that manner builds the foundation for a multi-dimensional model of health literacy built around four central domains:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

*fundamental literacy,
*scientific literacy,
*civic literacy, and
*cultural literacy.

There are several tests, which have verified reliability in the academic literature that can be administered in order to test one's health literacy.

According to an [[Institute of Medicine]] (2004) report, low health literacy negatively affects the treatment outcome and safety of care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Medicine: [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10883.html#toc Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of health literacy affects all segments of the population.  However, it is disproportionate in certain demographic groups, such as the [[elderly]], [[ethnic minorities]], recent [[immigrants]], and persons with low general [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy [http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/index.asp?file=AssessmentOf/HealthLiteracy/HealthLiteracyResults.asp&amp;PageID=158 The Health Literacy of America's Adults] Retrieved 9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These populations have a higher risk of hospitalization, longer hospital stays, are less likely to comply with treatment, are more likely to make errors with medication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Terry C.

The mismatch between a clinician's [[communication]] of content and a patient's ability to understand that content can lead to medication errors and adverse medical outcomes. Health literacy skills are not only a problem in the general population. Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, public health workers) can also have poor health literacy skills, such as a reduced ability to clearly explain health issues to patients and the public.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Anesthesiology abstracts (October 25, 2005), Aaron M.

In addition to tailoring the content of what health professionals communicate to their patients, a well arranged layout, pertinent illustrations, and intuitive format of written materials can improve the usability of health care literature. This in turn can help in effective communication between healthcare providers and their patients.&lt;ref name="IJGM_Gill2012"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012|title=Readability Assessment of Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Publications by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|journal=[[International Journal of General Medicine]]|volume=5|pages=923–933|doi=10.2147/IJGM.S37110|first1=P.S.|last1=Gill|first2=T.S.|last2=Gill|first3=A.|last3=Kamath|first4=B.|last4=whisnant|url=http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=14417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk identification===
Identifying a patient as having low health literacy is essential for a healthcare professional to conform their health intervention in a way that the patient will understand. When patients with low health literacy receive care that is tailored to their more limited medical knowledge base, results have shown that health behaviors drastically improve. This has been seen with: correct medication use and dosage, utilizing health screenings, as well as increased exercise and smoking cessation. Effective visual aids have shown to help supplement the information communicated by the doctor in the office. In particular, easily readable brochures and videos have shown to be very effective.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Evidence Report/Technology Assessment: Number 87 [http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/litsum.htm Literacy and Health Outcomes]&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare professionals can use many methods to attain patients' health literacy. A multitude of tests used during research studies and three minute assessments commonly used in doctors offices are examples of the variety of tests healthcare professionals can use to better understand their patients' health literacy.&lt;ref name="TOFLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPSF/&gt;

The American Medical Association showed that asking simple single item questions, such as "How confident are you in filling out medical forms by yourself?", is a very effective and direct way to understand from a patient's point of view how they feel about interacting with their healthcare provider and understanding their health condition.&lt;ref name=Questions/&gt;

===Intervention===
In order to be understood by patients with insufficient health literacy, health professionals must intervene to provide clear and concise information that can be more easily understood. Avoidance of medical jargon, illustrations of important concepts, and confirming information by a "teach back" method have shown to be effective tools to communicating essential health topics with health illiterate patients.&lt;ref name=Conversation&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/conversation-cultural-competence-cindy-brach-senior-health-policy-researcher-ahrq|title=A Conversation on Cultural Competence With Cindy Brach, Senior Health Policy Researcher, AHRQ|date=2013-04-17|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program called "Ask Me 3"&lt;ref name=NPSF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|title=National Patient Safety Foundation|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308091008/http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|archivedate=2008-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to bring public and physician attention to this issue, by letting patients know that they should ask three questions each time they talk to a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist:
*What is my main problem?
*What do I need to do?
*Why is it important for me to do this?

There have also been large-scale efforts to improve health literacy. For example, a public information program by the US Department of Health and Human Services encourages patients to improve healthcare quality and avoid errors by asking questions about health conditions and treatment.&lt;ref name=Questions&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: [http://www.ahrq.gov/questionsaretheanswer/ Questions Are the Answer], retrieved 2008-10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the IROHLA (Intervention Research on Health Literacy of the Ageing population)  project, funded by the European Union (EU), seeks to develop evidence-based guidelines for policy and practice to improve health literacy of the ageing population in EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irohla.eu/home/|title=Home|publisher=|access-date=2015-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613081655/http://www.irohla.eu/home/|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has developed a framework and identified and validated interventions which together constitute a comprehensive approach of addressing health literacy needs of the elderly.

===Health illiterate-related diabetes prevalence in Vietnamese-American populations===
Diabetes is a rapidly growing health problem among immigrants—affecting approximately 10 percent of Asian-Americans.  It is the fifth-leading cause of death in Asian-Americans between the ages of 45 and 64.  In addition, type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease.  Those who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have high levels of blood glucose because the body does not effectively respond to insulin.  It is a lifelong disease with no known cure.  Diabetes is a chronic, debilitating, and costly social burden—costing healthcare systems about $100 billion annually.&lt;ref name="Cabiglio"&gt;Cabiglio, Josie. Diabetes on the rise among Asians.

Diabetes disproportionately affects underserved and ethnically diverse populations, such as Vietnamese-American communities.  The relationship between the disease and health literacy level is in part because of an individual's ability to read English, evaluate blood glucose levels, and communicate with medical professionals.  Other studies also suggest lack in knowledge of diabetes symptoms and complications.&lt;ref name="Glazier"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Glazier R.H. | year = 2004 | title = Neighborhood recent immigration and hospitalization in Toronto, Canada | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Public Health | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 130–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an observational cross-sectional study conducted, many Vietnamese-American diabetic patients show signs of poor blood glucose control and adherence due to inadequate self-management knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Mull"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mull Dorothy S.

Ethnic minority groups and immigrant communities have less knowledge of health promoting behavior, face considerable obstacles to health services, and experience poor communication with medical professionals.&lt;ref name="Simich"&gt;Simich, Laura. "Health Literacy and Immigrant Populations." Public Health Agency of Canada and Metropolis Canada (2009): 1-18.

==== Oral health literacy in school teachers of Mangalore, India ====
The problem of low oral health literacy (OHL) is often neglected which may lead to poor oral health outcomes and under utilization of oral care services. A cross-sectional survey of  school teachers working in schools at Mangalore, India was undertaken. Details regarding demographics, medical, and dental history, oral hygiene practices and habits, diet history, and decay promoting the potential of school teachers were obtained using face-to-face interview method. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry-99 (REALD-99) was used to assess their OHL.The OHL was high in the school teachers with the REALD-99 scores ranging from 45 to 95 with a mean score of 75.83 ± 9.94. Th This study found that there was a statistically significant difference between OHL and education, frequency of brushing and the filled teeth. Although this study indicated high OHL levels among school teachers in Mangalore, India the magnitude of dental caries in this population was also relatively high and very few had a healthy periodontium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Arun K|last2=Rao|first2=Ashwini|last3=Rajesh|first3=GuruRaghavendran|last4=Shenoy|first4=Ramya|last5=Pai|first5=Mithun B.

==eHealth literacy==
eHealth literacy describes the relatively modern concept of an individual's ability to search for, successfully access, comprehend, and appraise desired health information from electronic sources and to then use such information to attempt to address a particular health problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e9/|title=eHealth Literacy: Essential Skills for Consumer Health in a Networked World|first1=Cameron D|last1=Norman|first2=Harvey A|last2=Skinner|date=1 January 2006|publisher=|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.2.e9|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the increasing influence of the internet for information-seeking and health information distribution purposes, eHealth literacy has become an important topic of research in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=T|last2=Brainin|first2=E|last3=Neter|first3=E|date=|title=With Some Help From My Network: Supplementing eHealth Literacy With Social Ties|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=19|issue=3|pages=e98.|doi=10.2196/jmir.6472|via=|pmc=5391437|pmid=28360024|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stellefson (2011) states, "8 out of 10 Internet users report that they have at least once looked online for health information, making it the third most popular Web activity next to checking email and using search engines in terms of activities that almost everybody has done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2011/4/e102/|title=eHealth Literacy Among College Students: A Systematic Review With Implications for eHealth Education|first1=Michael|last1=Stellefson|first2=Bruce|last2=Hanik|first3=Beth|last3=Chaney|first4=Don|last4=Chaney|first5=Bethany|last5=Tennant|first6=Enmanuel Antonio|last6=Chavarria|date=1 January 2011|publisher=|volume=13|issue=4|doi=10.2196/jmir.1703|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though in recent years, individuals may have gained access to a multitude of health information via the Internet, access alone does not ensure that proper search skills and techniques are being used to find the most relevant online and electronic resources. As the line between a reputable medical source and an amateur opinion can often be blurred, the ability to differentiate between the two is important.

Health literacy requires a combination of several different literacy skills in order to facilitate eHealth promotion and care.  Six core skills are delineated by an eHealth literacy model referred to as the Lily model.  The Lily Model's six literacies are organized into two central types: analytic and context-specific.  Analytic type literacies are those skills that can be applied to a broad range of sources, regardless of topic or content (i.e., skills that can also be applied to shopping or researching a term paper in addition to health) whereas context-specific skills are those that are contextualized within a specific problem domain (can solely be applied to health).  The six literacies are listed below, the first three of the analytic type and the latter three of the context-specific:
* Traditional literacy
* Media literacy
* Information literacy
* Computer literacy
* Scientific literacy
* Health literacy

According to Norman (2006), both analytical and context-specific literacy skills are "required to fully engage with electronic health resources."  As the World Wide Web and technological innovations are more and more becoming a part of the healthcare environment, it is important for information technology to be properly utilized to promote health and deliver health care effectively. Furthermore, it was argued by Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), that digital media fosters the creation of interpersonal ties, that can supplement eHealth literacy. According to Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), individuals with low eHealth literacy who were able to recruit help when performing online activities demonstrated higher health outcomes compared to similar individuals who did not find help. Also relating to the proliferation of digital media is the fact that many individuals now can create their own ‘media content’ ([[user-generated content]]). This means that the boundary between “information” and “media” content, as proposed by Norman in 2006, now is increasingly blurred, creating additional challenges for health practitioners (Holmberg, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holmberg C | year = 2016 | title = If You can't beat It-Use It: why and how clinicians need to consider social media in the treatment of adolescents with obesity | url = | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 9| pages = 977–8 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2016.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the move towards [[Patient-centred care|patient-centered care]] and the greater use of technology for self-care and self-management requires higher health literacy on the part of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Henna|last2=Xie|first2=Bo|title=Health literacy in the eHealth era: A systematic review of the literature|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|date=January 2017|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2017.01.015|volume=100|pages=1073–1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been noted in several research studies, for example among adolescent patients with obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, C., Berg, C., Dahlgren, J., Lissner, L., &amp; Chaplin, J. E. (2018). Health literacy in a complex digital media landscape: Pediatric obesity patients’ experiences with online weight, food, and health information. Health Informatics Journal.

== Improvement ==

=== Incorporate information through the university level ===
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] created a National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|date=|accessdate=|website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the National Action Plan is to incorporate health and science information in childcare and education through the university level. The target is to educate people at an early stage; that way individuals are raised with health literacy and will have a better quality of life. The earlier an individual is exposed to health literacy skills the better for the person and the community.

Programs such as Head Start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs|title=Home - Office of Head Start - Administration for Children and Families|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Food and Nutrition Service|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have impacted our society, especially the low income population. Head Start provides low-income children and their families early childhood education, nutrition, and health screenings. Health literacy is integrated in the program for both children and parents through the education given to the individuals. WIC serves low-income pregnant women and new mothers by supplying them with food, health care referrals, and nutrition education. Programs like these help improve the health literacy of both the parent and the child, creating a more knowledgeable community with health education.

Although programs like Head Start and WIC have been working with the health literacy of a specific population, much more can be done with the education of children and young adults. Now, more and more adolescents are getting involved with their health care. It is crucial to educate these individuals in order for them to make informed decisions.

Many schools in the country incorporate a health class in their curriculum. These classes provided an excellent opportunity to facilitate and develop health literacy in today's children and adolescents. The skills of how to read food labels, the meaning of common medical terms, the structure of the human body, and education on the most prevalent diseases in the United States should be taught in both private and public schools. This way new generations will grow with health literacy and would hopefully make knowledgeable health decisions.

=== Framework and potential intervention points ===
The National Library of Medicine defines health literacy as:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confustion|last=Nielsen-Bohlmn|first=Lynn|date=2004|journal=Institute of Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health literacy
information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."}}

Based on this clinical definition, health literacy gives
individuals the skills that they need to both understand and effectively
communicate information and concerns. Bridging that gap between literacy skills
and the ability of the individual in health contexts, the ''Health Literacy Framework'' highlights the health outcomes and costs
associated with health contexts including cognitive abilities, social skills,
emotional state, and physical conditions such as visual and auditory contributions.

''Potential Intervention Points'' are illustrated in reflection of the ''Health Literacy Framework.''
While these potential intervention points include interactions such as those of individuals and the education systems
that they are engaged with, their health systems, and societal factors as they
relate to health literacy, these points are not 
components of a causal model.  The three
potential intervention points are culture and society, the health system, and
the education system. Health outcomes and costs are the products of the health
literacy developed during diversity of exposure to these three potential intervention
points.

Referring to shared ideas, meanings, and values that
influence an individual's beliefs and attitudes, cultural and societal
influences are a significant intervention point for health literacy
development. As interactions with healthcare systems often first occur at the
family level, deeply rooted beliefs and values can shape the significance of
the experience. Included components that reflect the development of health
literacy both culturally and societally are native language, socioeconomic status,
gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as mass media exposure. These
are pathways to understanding American life paralleling conquests for a health
literate America.

The health system is an intervention point in the ''Health Literacy Framework''. For the
purposes of this framework, health literacy refers to an individual's
interaction with people performing health-related activities in settings such
as hospitals, clinics, physician's offices, home health care, public health agencies,
and insurers.

In the United States, the education system consists of [[K-12]] curricula. In addition to this standard educational
setting, adult education programs are also environments in which individuals
can develop traditional literacy skills founded in comprehension and real-world
application of knowledge via reading and writing.  Tools for educational development provided by
these systems impact an individual's capacity to obtain specific knowledge
regarding health. Reflecting components of traditional literacy such as
cultural and conceptual knowledge, oral literacy (listening and speaking,)
print literacy (reading and writing,) and numeracy, education systems are also
potential intervention points for health literacy development.

=== Development of a health literacy program ===
A successful health literacy program will have many goals that all work together to improve health literacy. Many people assume these goals should communicate health information to the general public, however in order to be successful the goals should not only communicate with people but also take into account social and environmental factors that influence lifestyle choices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/15/3/259/551108/Health-literacy-as-a-public-health-goal-a|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=0957-4824}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the movement to end smoking. When a health literacy program is put into place where only the negative side effects of smoking are told to the general public it is doomed to fail. However, when there is a larger program put in – one that includes strategies outlining how to quit smoking, raises tobacco prices, reduces access to tobacco by minors, and reflect social a social unacceptability of smoking – it will be much more effective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests a National Action Plan to implement a comprehensive Health Literacy Program. They include 7 goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|first=Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|date=2010|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|url=https://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Develop and disseminate health and safety information that is accurate, accessible, and actionable
# Promote changes in the health care system that improve health information, communication, informed decision making, and access to health services
# Incorporate accurate, standards-based, and developmentally appropriate health and science information and curricula in child care and education through the university level
# Support and expand local efforts to provide adult education, English language instruction, and culturally and linguistically appropriate health information services in the community
# Build partnerships, develop guidance, and change policies
# Increase basic research and the development, implementation, and evaluation of practices and interventions to improve health literacy
# Increase the dissemination and use of evidence-based health literacy practices and interventions
These goals should be taken into account when implementing a health literacy program.

There are also goals for the outcomes of a Health Literacy Program.

''Health Related Goals''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Promoting and protect health and prevent disease
* Understand, interpret, and analyze health information

===Libraries===
Libraries have increasingly recognised that they can play a role in health literacy since the 2000s, influenced by the [[Medical Library Association]].  Library initiatives have included running education programs, fostering partnerships with health organisations, and using outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=13 June 2016|title=Health literacy and libraries: a literature review|journal=[[Reference Services Review]]|volume=44|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1108/RSR-02-2016-0005|last1=Barr-Walker|first1=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Igapó''' ({{IPA-pt|igaˈpɔ}}, from [[Tupi language|Old Tupi]]: "root forest") is a word used in [[Brazil]] for [[Blackwater river|blackwater]]-flooded forests in the [[Amazon biome]]. These forests and similar swamp forests are seasonally inundated with freshwater. They typically occur along the lower reaches of [[rivers]] and around freshwater lakes. [[Freshwater swamp forests]] are found in a range of [[climate]] zones, from [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] through [[Temperate climate|temperate]] and [[subtropical]] to [[tropical]].
In the [[Amazon Basin]] of Brazil, a seasonally [[Whitewater river (river type)|whitewater]]-flooded forest is known as a [[várzea forest|várzea]], which is similar to igapó in many regards; the key difference between the two habitats is in the type of water that floods the forest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/58789361/Rain-Water-Harvesting-by-Freshwater-Flooded-Forests Fresh water flooded forests]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Igapó is primarily characterized by seasonal inundation caused by abundant rainfall; in some areas, trees can be submerged for up to 6 months of the year.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen"&gt;Haugaasen, Torbjørn  and  Peres, Carlos Augusto. Floristic, edaphic and structural characteristics of flooded and unflooded forests in the lower Rio Purús region of central Amazonia, Brazil. Acta Amaz. [online]. 2006, vol.36, n.1, pp. 25-35 &lt;http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0044-59672006000100005&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These ecosystems are relatively open and feature over 30% [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] cover with an average canopy height ranging from 20–25 m; sparse measurements of trees can reach 33–36 m. Tree composition includes a varied mixture of leaf types and seasonality. Development of tree communities within the freshwater swamp forests rely heavily on microtopography and flooding intensity. Swamp forests can have harsh environments, in which only a few adapted species are able to sustain life or dominate over other tree species. One of the tree species mostly found in freshwater swamp forests are [[Fabaceae|legume]] trees, in which most swamp forests have high single legume species populations. Legume trees in these forests are thought to be abundant in [[nitrogen fixation]], which is most common in waterlogged locations and is thought to be a favorable trait when experiencing seasonal and/or constant waterlogging.&lt;ref name="Koponen"&gt;Koponen, Piia, Pekka Nygren, et al. "Tree Species Diversity and Forest Structure in Relation to Microtopography in a Tropical Freshwater Swamp Forest in French Guiana." Plant Ecology. 173.1 (2004): 17-32. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/20146617.&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freshwater swamp forests can be classified into two categories of forested [[wetland]]s, which are permanently and periodically flooded forests. It is possible to find these two types because of the high microtopographic variation. Due to these topographic differences, tree communities are delimited and have a distribution over small continuous areas.&lt;ref name="Koponen" /&gt;

These forests may be able to sustain a large amount of [[bird]], [[mammal]], [[reptile]], [[amphibian]], [[fish]] and [[invertebrate]] species, however, [[biodiversity]] varies between wetland ecosystems and the [[species richness]] of the freshwater swamp forests is not entirely known. As for plant species, these forests have a lower diversity compared to other types of forests, such as the terra firme, in South America.&lt;ref name="Koponen" /&gt;

==Soil chemistry==

Igapó forests are characterized by sandy [[acidic soil]]s that have a low nutrient content. The color and acidity of the water is due to the acidic organic [[Humic acid|humic]] substances (e.g. [[tannins]]) that dissolve into the water. The acidity from the water translates into acidic soils. They are the more nutrient poor than a comparable várzea forest. They also “carry less suspended inorganic elements and contain elevated concentrations of dissolved organic material such as humic and fulvic acids”.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen"/&gt; Therefore, igapó forests support comparatively less life and the environment found within these areas tend to lack species diversity and animal [[biomass]]. Várzea forest soils have high nutrient contents because they receive a transport of high sediment loads from the whitewater rivers. In contrast, igapó forests do not receive this seasonal influx of sediments which explains the nutrient poor soils. However, they do have the highest [[phosphorus]] concentrations out of comparable várzea and terra firme forest soils. Nevertheless, the seasonal inundation of the soils leads to [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions which limits plant growth.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen" /&gt;

==Flora==

Igapó and other flooded forests typically display a lower diversity of plants than that seen in terra firme forests. Similar to other forests found throughout the tropics, it is common to observe only a few dominant tree species&lt;ref name="Koponen" /&gt; Distribution of trees and other plants is highly dependent on inundation tolerances of species causing a non-random distribution of plants where more flood-tolerant species are found at lower elevations and less flood-tolerant species are found on higher ground.
[[Fabaceae]] (or Leguminosae) and [[Euphorbiaceae]] are the dominant families of plants observed in igapó forest.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parolin"&gt;Parolin, P., J. Adis, et al. "Floristic study of an igapó floodplain forest in Central Amazonia, Brazil (Tarumã-Mirim, Rio Negro)." Amazoniana. XVII.1/2 (2004): 29-47. &lt;http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/amazoniana/18_03Parolin.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seed dispersal===
[[File:Colossoma macropomum ostergaard.jpg|thumb|[[Tambaqui|Pacu]] (''Colossoma macropomum''), an important food fish and seed predator common in igapó]]

Tree species adapted to seasonal inundation have adapted to maximize [[fruit]] production during periods of flooding in order to take advantage of newly available [[seed dispersal]] methods. Fish consume nearly all fruit that fall into the water, and species that are unable to digest the seeds eventually excrete and disperse them into the water. Dispersal by other vectors such as birds and [[monkey]]s is secondary to that of fishes in igapó. An important factor in seed survival is the presence of [[seed predator]]s. Fishes that lack the strong jaws found in [[characin]]s, such as [[catfish]], digest the fleshy material of the fruit while the seeds pass through the gut unharmed. Because many catfishes are [[bottom-feeder]]s, they are critical dispersers for seeds that sink upon entering the water.&lt;ref name="Kubitzki"&gt;Kubitzki, Klaus, and Albrecht Ziburski. "Seed Dispersal in Flood Plain Forests of Amazonia." Biotropica. 26.1 (1994): 30-43. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2389108&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
[[File:GiantRiverOtterEating.jpg|thumb|[[Giant otter]] (''Pteronura brasiliensis'')]]
[[File:Tapirus terrestris.jpg|thumb|[[Brazilian tapir]] (''Tapirus terrestrus'')]]
Diversity of terrestrial wildlife and fishes in igapó is highly influenced by flooding. During periods of inundation, vast numbers of aquatic species migrate into the flooded forest in search of food. Fish populations are highest during maximum fruiting periods and [[Amazon dolphin|river dolphins]] and [[giant otter]]s move in to prey upon them.&lt;ref name="Kubitzki" /&gt; Compared to terra firme forests, Igapó features lower nutrients and favors slow-growing plants with low fleshy fruit production, which has resulted in a lower diversity and abundance of animals.&lt;ref name="Fleagle"&gt;Fleagle, J. G.; Janson, Charles; and Reed, Kaye. Primate Communities. Cambridge University Press, 1999. Cambridge Books Online. {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9780511542381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Larger terrestrial mammals have varied strategies of dealing with flooding: [[red brocket deer]] and [[Collared peccary|collared peccaries]] move into islands and shift diet from fruit to browsing woody plants. [[White-lipped peccary|White-lipped peccaries]] and [[Brazilian Tapir|tapirs]] are largely unaffected by seasonal inundation; both species take advantage of the greater abundance of fruit during these times. White-lipped peccaries migrate between flooded and dry areas and tapirs are highly capable swimmers.&lt;ref name="Bodmer"&gt;Bodmer, Richard E. "Responses of Ungulates to Seasonal Inundations in the Amazon Floodplain." Journal of Tropical Ecology. 6.2 (1990): 191-201. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2559266&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arboreal]] mammals such as monkeys tend to be lower in species richness compared to terra firme forests due to the decrease in tree diversity and the resulting lack of variety of suitable food types.&lt;ref name="Parolin" /&gt; A lower population density of birds also reflects the lack of nutrients found in igapo forests.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen 2008"&gt;Haugaasen, Torbjørn, and Carlos A. Peres. "Population abundance and biomass of large-bodied birds in Amazonian flooded and unflooded forests." Bird Conservation International. 18.2 (2008): 87-101. &lt;http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1878112&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, within [[Jaú National Park]], 247 species of birds are found in ''terra firme'' forests; 121 of those species are limited to that habitat. Within neighboring igapó forests, 194 species of birds are found; of those, just 58 are restricted to igapó.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;United Nations Environment Programme-World Conservation M. "Jaú National Park, Brazil." Jaú National Park, Brazil. The Encyclopedia of Earth, 17 Nov. 2008. &lt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Ja%C3%BA_National_Park,_Brazil&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human occupation and use==

Native Amazonians have been using and modifying the forests in which they have lived for thousands of years. Several studies suggest that the presence of nutrient-rich "[[terra preta|black earth]]" in typically nutrient-poor igapó environments indicates intense fertilization and burning of these areas. Black earth is a modified soil characterized by high nutrient content from highly stable organic matter and high levels of phosphorus.
The highly fertile soils and the openness of these areas confirm that the native Amazonians have been using these fields for agriculture.&lt;ref name="Praxis &amp; Blackwater"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = German | first1 = Laura A | year = 2004 | title = Ecological Praxis and Blackwater Ecosystems: A Case Study From the Brazilian Amazon | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10745-004-6831-1 | journal = Human Ecology | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 653–83 | doi=10.1007/s10745-004-6831-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Amazonians have not only used these areas for crops; they have used their agricultural lands as a place to hunt as well. Many animals (rodents, tapirs and deer) are attracted to these areas for food. The Amazonians produce a surplus so that the animals do not over-consume their food resource. Though, if the animals do start to deplete their crops, they will then harvest higher numbers of animals. Additionally, Amazonians consume fish as a main source of protein. Indigenous peoples understand that, while flooded, the forest serves as an essential feeding ground that increases fish abundance. Because of this, many protect igapó forests from deforestation.&lt;ref name="Use of Forests"&gt;Dufour, Darna L. "Use of Tropical Rain Forests by Native Amazonians." BioScience 40.9 (1990): 652–59. JSTOR. University California Press, Oct. 1990.&lt;https://www.jstor.org.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/stable/pdfplus/1311432.pdf?acceptTC=true&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

The greatest threat to igapó forests is the construction of [[hydroelectric dam]]s on [[tributaries]] of the Amazon river; when constructed, the dams will divert huge amounts of water and dramatically change the [[hydrology]] of the Amazon basin and its ecosystems. Because many flora within seasonally inundated forests are highly adapted to a particular flooding schedule, alterations in flood patterns and the creation of permanently flooded areas will induce higher rates of tree mortality. The loss of these trees will likely affect populations of [[Frugivore|frugivorous]] [[understory]] birds, such as the [[blue-throated piping guan]] and some ''[[Amazon parrot|Amazona]]'' parrots that are restricted to igapó. Loss of habitat will cause migrations of species that will inevitably lead to higher [[Competition (biology)|competition]] in unaffected habitats and possibly local [[extinction]]s.&lt;ref name="Borges"&gt;Borges, Sergio Henrique, and Andre Carvalhaes. "Bird species of black water inundation forests in the Jaú National Park (Amazonas state, Brazil): their contribution to regional species richness." Biodiversity and Conservation. 9. (2000): 201-214. &lt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/t4j15m7157521657/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Pipile cumanensis (Denver Zoo)2.jpg|thumb|[[Blue-throated piping guan]] (''Pipile cumanensis''), one of the species likely to be affected by hydroelectric dams]]

[[Deforestation]] is also a large conservation concern because Igapó forests are characterized by slow tree growth due to low soil nutrient content and high soil acidity. Despite low nutrient availability, Igapó and other floodplain forests can be biodiverse with some partially [[endemic]] species. Due to soil chemistry and seasonal inundation, trees and other resources tend to grow back more slowly after harvest by humans than in other types of Amazonian forests, . Accordingly, igapó forests cannot sustain [[Timber harvesting|timber harvest]]. For the future, igapó forests should be fully protected from logging and deforestation because of the low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] found in them.&lt;ref name="Ferreira"&gt;Ferreira Da Fonseca Júnior, Sinomar, Maria Teresa Fernandez Piedade, and Jochen Schöngart. "Wood Growth of Tabebuia Barbata (E. Mey.) Sandwith (Bignoniaceae) and Vatairea Guianensis Aubl. (Fabaceae) in Central Amazonian Black-water (igapó) and White-water (várzea) Floodplain Forests." Trees 23.1 (2009): 127-34. &lt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/4001k74g64np0721/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In protected areas, such as [[Jaú National Park]], the lack of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] inhabitants and a low population of rural families limits the potential for [[Over harvesting|over-harvest]] of fish and [[turtle]] species. However, enforcement of harvest regulation is problematic when there are only three park rangers at the entrance to the park. In other unprotected areas that lack rangers, unregulated harvest of fauna by peoples that move into igapó forests to hunt and fish may adversely affect future stocks.&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt; Approximately 3% of the Amazon's seasonally inundated forests are under protection within [[National park (Brazil)|national park]]s or [[Biological reserve (Brazil)|biological reserve]]s.&lt;ref name="Borges" /&gt;

==Notable areas==
[[File:NEO lake jau big.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jaú National Park]] as seen from [[Landsat 7]]]]
Freshwater swamp forests are distributed in multiple climate zones throughout the world, such as boreal, temperate, tropical and subtropic zones. They are found in the [[Afrotropic ecozone|Afrotropics]], [[Australasia]], [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indomalaya]], and the [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropics]]. However, they are most notably found in Amazonian areas.

* [[Cantão]]

Igapó forests are one of the distinct natural communities found in the [[Cantão State Park]]. They offer a rich bird fauna that includes some habitat specialists due to the unique ecosystem the blackwater inundation provides. The trees in the igapó bloom once the inundation season begins. They do this so they can drop their fruit into the water to be dispersed by the different fish taxa.&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt;

* [[Jaú National Park]]

The Jaú National Park was designated in 1980 and is the largest national park in the Amazon Basin and the second largest protected tropical forest. It is known for its high level of biodiversity and varying ecosystems within. The park protects the entire watershed of the Jaú River, which happens to be one of the best examples of a blackwater ecosystem where the water is colored by acidic decomposing organic matter.&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8761">An '''Imieliński-Lipski algebras''' is an extension of [[relational algebra]] onto tables with different types of [[Null (SQL)|null values]].  It is used to operate on relations with incomplete information.

Imieliński-Lipski algebras are defined to satisfy precise conditions for  semantically meaningful extension of the usual relational operators, such as projection, selection, union, and join, from operators on relations to operators on relations with various kinds of "null values".

These conditions require that the system be ''safe'' in the sense that no incorrect conclusion is derivable by using a specified subset F of the relational operators; and that it be ''complete'' in the sense that all valid conclusions expressible by relational expressions using operators in F are in fact derivable in this system.  
For example, it is well known that the 3-valued logic approach to deal with null values, supported  treatment of nulls values by [[SQL]] is not complete, see [[Jeffrey Ullman|Ullman]] book.&lt;ref name="Ullman1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.D. Ullman|authorlink=Jeffrey Ullman|title=Principles of Database Systems |year=1982|publisher= Computer Science Press, Potomac, MD.|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To show this, let T be:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |+ T=
 |-
 ! NAME   !! CLASS !! GRADE !! SEMESTER
 |-
 | Rohit  || Databases  || B || Spring
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || NULL
 |-
|}

Take SQL query Q

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
                Select NAME
                         From T
                             Where CLASS = 'Networks' &amp; SEMESTER = 'Spring' OR GRADE = 'A' &amp; SEMESTER != 'Spring'
&lt;/source&gt;

SQL query Q will return empty set (no results) under 3-valued semantics currently adopted by all variants of SQL.  This is the case because in SQL,  NULL is never equal to any constant – in this case, neither to “Spring” nor “Fall” nor “Winter” (if  there is Winter semester in this school).  NULL=’Spring” will evaluate to MAYBE and so will NULL=’Fall”. The disjunction MAYBE OR MAYBE evaluates to  MAYBE (not TRUE). Thus Igor will not be part of the answer (and of course neither will Rohit). But Igor should be returned as the answer.

Indeed, regardless what semester Igor took the Networks class (no matter what was the unknown value of NULL), the selection condition will be true.  This “Igor” will be missed by SQL and the SQL answer  won’t be  complete according to completeness requirements specified in  Imieliński, Witold Lipski, 'Incomplete Information in Relational Databases'.&lt;ref name="JACM 1984"/&gt;  It is also argued there that 3-valued logic (TRUE, FALSE, MAYBE) can never provide guarantee  of complete answer for tables with incomplete information.

Three algebras which satisfy conditions of safety and completeness are defined as Imielinski-Lipski algebras: the [[Relational algebra|Codd-Tables]] algebra, the V-tables algebra and the Conditional tables (C-tables) algebra.

===Codd-tables Algebra===

Codd-tables Algebra is based on the usual Codd's   singe NULL values. The table T above is an example of Codd-table. Codd-table algebra supports projection and positive selections only.  It is also demonstrated in [IL84 that it is not possible to correctly extend more relational operators over Codd-Tables.  For example, such basic operation as join is not extendable over Codd-tables.  It is not possible to define selections with Boolean conditions involving negation and preserve completeness.  For example, queries like the above query Q cannot be supported.
In  order to be able to extend more relational operators,  more expressive form of  null value representation is needed in tables  which are called  V-table.

===V-Tables Algebra===

V-tables algebra is based on many different ("marked") null values or variables allowed to appear in a table.  V-tables allow to show that a value may be unknown but the same for different tuples. For example, in the table below Gaurav and Igor order the same (but unknown) beer in two unknown bars (which may, or may not be different – but remain unknown).   Gaurav and Jane frequent the same unknown bad (Y1). Thus, instead one NULL value, we use indexed variables, or ''Skolem constants''  
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title= Skolem constants |url=http://www.sds.lcs.mit.edu/spd/larch/LP/glossary/skolem.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

V-Tables algebra is shown to correctly support projection, positive selection (with no negation occurring in the selection condition), union, and renaming of attributes, which allows for processing arbitrary conjunctive queries.
A very desirable property enjoyed by the V-table algebra is that all relational operators on tables are performed in exactly the same way as in the case of the usual relations.

'''Conditional Tables (C-Tables) Algebra'''

Example of conditional table (c-table) is shown below.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |-
 ! NAME   !! CLASS !! GRADE !! SEMESTER !! con
 |-
 | Rohit  || Databases  || B || Spring || true
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || x || x ='Spring'
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || x || x !='Spring'
 |-
|}

It has additional column “con” which is a Boolean condition involving variables, null values – same as in V-tables.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
                Select *
                     From T
                          Where CLASS='Networks' &amp; SEMESTER='Spring' OR GRADE = 'A' &amp; SEMESTER !='Spring'
&lt;/source&gt;

over the following table c-table

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |+ T1=
 |-
 ! NAME   !! CLASS !! GRADE !! SEMESTER !! con
 |-
 | Rohit  || Databases  || B || Spring || true
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || x || true
 |-
|}

Conditional Tables algebra, mainly of theoretical interest, supports projection, selection, union, join, and renaming.  Under closed world assumption, it can also handle the operator of difference, thus it can support all relational operators.

Typical IOCs are [[virus signature]]s and [[IP address]]es, [[MD5 hash]]es of [[malware]] files or [[URL]]s or [[domain name]]s of [[botnet]] command and control servers. After IOCs have been identified in a process of [[incident response]] and [[computer forensics]], they can be used for early detection of future attack attempts using [[intrusion detection system]]s and [[antivirus software]].

For more efficient automated processing there are initiatives to standardize the format of IOCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5070.txt | title=The Incident Object Description Exchange Format | publisher=IETF | work=RFC 5070 | year=2007 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cybox.mitre.org/ | title=Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX) | publisher=Mitre | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known indicators are usually exchanged within the industry.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4936">'''K correction''' is a correction to an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] object's [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] (or equivalently, its [[flux]]) that allows a measurement of a quantity of light from an object at a [[redshift]] ''z'' to be converted to an equivalent measurement in the [[rest frame]] of the object. If one could measure all the light from an object at all [[wavelength]]s (a bolometric flux), a K correction would not be required. If one measures the light emitted in an [[emission line]], a K-correction is not required. The need for a K-correction arises because an astronomical measurement through a single [[filter (optics)|filter]] or a single bandpass only sees a fraction of the total [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], redshifted into the frame of the observer. So if the observer wants to compare the measurements through a red filter of objects at different redshifts, the observer will have to apply estimates of the K corrections to these measurements to make a comparison.

One claim for the origin of the term "K correction" is [[Edwin Hubble]], who supposedly arbitrarily chose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; to represent the reduction factor in magnitude due to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Effects of Red Shifts on the Distribution of Nebulae | authorlink=Edwin Hubble | first=Edwin | last=Hubble | date=1936 | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=84 | pages=517–554 | doi=10.1086/143782 | bibcode=1936ApJ....84..517H| pmc=1076828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Kinney et al., in footnote 7 on page 48 of their article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Template ultraviolet spectra to near-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies and their application to K-corrections | first1=Anne | last1=Kinney | date=1996 | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=467 | pages=38–60 | doi=10.1086/177583 | last2=Calzetti | first2=Daniela | last3=Bohlin | first3=Ralph C. | last4=McQuade | first4=Kerry | last5=Storchi-Bergmann | first5=Thaisa | last6=Schmitt | first6=Henrique R. | bibcode=1996ApJ...467...38K}}&lt;/ref&gt; note an earlier origin from [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]] (1918),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/asna.19182061302 | first=V.C. | last=Wirtz | title=Über die Bewegungen der Nebelflecke | date=1918 | journal=[[Astronomische Nachrichten]] | volume=206 | issue=13 | pages=109|bibcode = 1918AN....206..109W }}&lt;/ref&gt; who referred to the correction as a ''Konstante'' (German for "constant"), hence K-correction.

The K-correction can be defined as follows

:&lt;math&gt; M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{D_L} - 1) - K_{Corr}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

I.E. the adjustment to the standard relationship between [[Absolute magnitude|absolute]] and [[Apparent magnitude|apparent]] magnitude required to correct for the redshift effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogg|first=David|title=The K Correction|url=http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[luminosity distance]] measured in [[parsecs]].

The exact nature of the calculation that needs to be applied in order to perform a K correction depends upon the type of filter used to make the observation and the shape of the object's spectrum. If multi-color [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] measurements are available for a given object thus defining its spectral energy distribution ([[Spectral Energy Distribution|SED]]), K corrections then can be computed by [[Curve fitting|fitting]] it against a theoretical or empirical [[Spectral Energy Distribution|SED]] template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0606170|title=K-corrections and filter transformations in the ultraviolet, optical, and near infrared|journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]]|volume=133|issue=2|pages=734|bibcode=2007AJ....133..734B|author1=Blanton|first1=Michael R.|last2=Roweis|first2=Sam|date=2007|doi=10.1086/510127}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that K corrections in many frequently used broad-band filters for low-redshift [[Galaxy|galaxies]] can be precisely approximated using two-dimensional [[polynomial]]s as functions of a [[redshift]] and one observed [[Color index|color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1002.2360|title=Analytical approximations of K-corrections in optical and near-infrared bands|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=405|pages=1409|bibcode=2010MNRAS.405.1409C|author1=Chilingarian|first1=Igor V.|last2=Melchior|first2=Anne-Laure|last3=Zolotukhin|first3=Ivan Yu.|date=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16506.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is implemented in the K corrections calculator web-service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kcor.sai.msu.ru|title=K-corrections calculator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landau theory''' in [[physics]] is a theory that [[Lev Landau]] introduced in an attempt to formulate a general theory of continuous (i.e., second-order) [[phase transition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/files/journals/53/si/53SI08p.pdf Landau L.D., Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 7, pp. 19–32 (1937)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214124950/http://www.ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/files/journals/53/si/53SI08p.pdf |date=2015-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mean-field formulation (no long-range correlation)==
{{main|Mean field theory}}

Landau was motivated to suggest that the free energy of any system should obey two conditions:

*It is analytic.
*It obeys the symmetry of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].

Given these two conditions, one can write down (in the vicinity of the critical temperature, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) a phenomenological expression for the free energy as a [[Taylor expansion]] in the [[Phase transitions#Order parameters|order parameter]].

===Ising model example===

For example, the [[Ising model]] free energy in the vicinity of the phase transition may be written as the following, where the variable &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is the coarse-grained field of spins, known as the [[Phase transition#Order parameters|order parameter]] or the total magnetization.

:&lt;math&gt; F = a + r\Psi^2 + s\Psi^4 + H\Psi + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;

We can truncate the free energy to the 4th power in &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; without losing the physics of the phase transition, but in general, there are higher order terms present.
For the system to be thermodynamically stable, the coefficient of the highest even power of the order parameter must be positive. In this case, we find that &lt;math&gt; s&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;, such that the free energy is bounded.
 
The phase transition occurs at some critical temperature &lt;math&gt; T_c &lt;/math&gt;. Noticing that the minimum in the free energy changes from &lt;math&gt; \Psi=0 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \Psi\neq0 &lt;/math&gt; when the parameter &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; changes sign, we can write the parameter &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; as a function of temperature as such:

:&lt;math&gt;r = r_0 (T - T_c) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; r_0 &lt;/math&gt; is some temperature independent constant.
The constant &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; can be safely taken to be zero because it is simply a constant shift in the free energy, which has no effect on the physics of the phase transition.

The Ising model theory of Landau first raised the order parameter to prominence. Note that the Ising model exhibits the following discrete symmetry:  If every spin in the model is flipped, such that &lt;math&gt; {S_i} \rightarrow {-S_i} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; S_i &lt;/math&gt; is the value of the &lt;math&gt; i^{th} &lt;/math&gt; spin, the Hamiltonian (and consequently the free energy) remains unchanged for zero external field &lt;math&gt; (H=0) &lt;/math&gt;.  This symmetry is reflected in the even powers of &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications===

Landau theory has been extraordinarily useful.  While the exact values of the parameters &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; were unknown, [[critical exponent]]s could still be calculated with ease, and only depend on the original assumptions of symmetry and analyticity.  For the Ising model case, the equilibrium magnetization &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; assumes the following value below the critical temperature &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = \pm \sqrt{\frac{-r_0 (T - T_c)}{2s}}. &lt;/math&gt;

At the time, it was known experimentally that the liquid–gas coexistence curve and the ferromagnet magnetization curve both exhibited a scaling relation of the form &lt;math&gt; |T - T_c|^{\beta} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; was mysteriously the same for both systems.  This is the phenomenon of [[Phase transition|universality]].  It was also known that simple liquid–gas models are exactly mappable to simple magnetic models, which implied that the two systems possess the same symmetries.  It then followed from Landau theory why these two apparently disparate systems should have the same critical exponents, despite having different microscopic parameters.  It is now known that the phenomenon of [[Phase transition|universality]] arises for other reasons (see [[Renormalization group]]).  In fact, Landau theory predicts the incorrect critical exponents for the Ising and liquid–gas systems.

The great virtue of Landau theory is that it makes specific predictions for what kind of non-analytic behavior one should see when the underlying free energy is analytic. Then, all the non-analyticity at the critical point, the critical exponents, are because the ''equilibrium value'' of the order parameter changes non-analytically, as a square root, whenever the free energy loses its unique minimum.

The extension of Landau theory to include fluctuations in the order parameter shows that Landau theory is only strictly valid near the critical points of ordinary systems with spatial dimensions higher than 4. This is the [[upper critical dimension]], and it can be much higher than four in more finely tuned phase transition. In [[Mukhamel]]'s analysis of the isotropic Lifschitz point, the critical dimension is 8. This is because Landau theory is a [[mean field theory]], and does not include long-range correlations.

This theory does not explain non-analyticity at the critical point, but when applied to [[superfluidity|superfluid]] and superconductor phase transition, Landau's theory provided inspiration for another theory, the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]] of [[superconductivity]].

==Including long-range correlations==
Consider the Ising model free energy above. Assume that the order parameter &lt;math&gt;\Psi &lt;/math&gt; and external magnetic field, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, may have spatial variations. Now, the free energy of the system can be assumed to take the following modified form:

:&lt;math&gt; F :=  \int d^D x \ \left( a(T) + r(T) \psi^2(x) + s(T) \psi^4(x) \ + f(T) (\nabla \psi(x))^2 \ +h(x) \psi(x)\ \ + \mathcal{O}(\psi^6 ; (\nabla \psi)^4) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the total ''spatial'' dimensionality. So,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \psi(x) \rangle := \frac{\text{Tr}\ \psi(x) {\rm e}^{-\beta H}}{Z} &lt;/math&gt;

Assume that, for a ''localized'' external magnetic perturbation &lt;math&gt; h(x) \rightarrow 0 + h_0 \delta(x) &lt;/math&gt;, the order parameter takes the form &lt;math&gt; \psi(x) \rightarrow \psi_0 + \phi(x) &lt;/math&gt;. Then,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta \langle \psi(x) \rangle}{\delta h(0)} = \frac{\phi(x)}{h_0} = \beta \left ( \langle \psi(x) \psi(0) \rangle - \langle \psi(x) \rangle \langle \psi(0) \rangle \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the fluctuation &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the order parameter corresponds to the order-order correlation. Hence, neglecting this fluctuation (like in the earlier mean-field approach) corresponds to neglecting the order-order correlation, which diverges near the critical point.

One can also solve &lt;ref&gt;"Equilibrium Statistical Physics" by Michael Plischke, Birger Bergersen, Section 3.10, 3rd ed&lt;/ref&gt; for &lt;math&gt; \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, from which the scaling exponent, &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt;, for correlation length &lt;math&gt; \xi \sim (T-T_c)^{-\nu} &lt;/math&gt; can deduced. From these, the [[Ginzburg criterion]] for the [[upper critical dimension]] for the validity of the Ising mean-field Landau theory (the one without long-range correlation) can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt; D \ge 2 + 2 \frac{\beta}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

In our current Ising model, mean-field Landau theory gives &lt;math&gt;\beta = 1/2 = \nu &lt;/math&gt; and so, it (the Ising mean-field Landau theory) is valid only for spatial dimensionality greater than or equal to 4 (at the marginal values of &lt;math&gt;D=4&lt;/math&gt;, there are small corrections to the exponents). This modified version of mean-field Landau theory is sometimes also referred to as the Landau-Ginzburg theory of Ising phase transitions. As a clarification, there is also a [[Landau-Ginzburg theory]] specific to superconductivity phase transition, which also includes fluctuations.

The '''Living Human Project''' ('''LHP''') is a project that begun in 2002 to develop a distributed repository of anatomo-functional data and simulation algorithms for the human [[musculoskeletal]] apparatus used to create the [[physiome]] of the human musculoskeletal system. In 2006 the BEL was merged with Biomed Town, a Internet community for those who have a professional interest in biomedical research.

==Living Human Digital Library==
The LHDL project was ended in January 2009, and soon after the LHDL consortium released a biomedical data management and sharing service called ''Physiome Space''. Physiome Space lets individual researchers as well as for large consortia to share with their peers large collections of biomedical data, including medical imaging and computer simulations.

The project was established by [[Prosper Mérimée]], France's Inspector General of Historical Monuments and author of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', in 1851.  The intent was to supplement [[Monument historique]], a program Mérimée started in 1837 to classify, protect and restore [[France|French]] landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Rosenblum|Rosenblum, Naomi]].

Although the [[daguerrotype]] originated in [[France]], Mérimée preferred the [[calotype]], which offered more detailed textures.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Marianne. European Architecture. J 362E.

Mestral and Le Gray photographed areas southwest from [[Paris]], Le Secq the north and east. Bayard, who chose to work with glass negatives instead of paper, went west to [[Brittany]] and [[Normandy]].  Baldus covered the south and east, including the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/heli/hd_heli.htm Mission Héliographique, 1851 | Thematic Essay | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jiu Xiao Huan Pei.jpg|thumb|300px|A famous [[Tang Dynasty]] guqin "Jiu Xiao Huan Pei". The [[guqin]] has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favored by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement.]]

'''Music history''', sometimes called historical musicology, is the highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of [[musicology]] that studies music from a historical viewpoint.
In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e.g., the history of [[Music of India|Indian music]] or the history of [[Rock music|rock]]). In practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of [[ethnomusicology]] or [[cultural studies]], whether or not they are [[ethnography|ethnographically based]]. The terms "music history" and "historical musicology" usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called "art music" (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).

The methods of music history include source studies (esp. [[manuscript]] studies), [[paleography]], [[philology]] (especially [[textual criticism]]), style criticism, historiography (the choice of [[historical method]]), [[musical analysis]], and [[iconography]]. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of [[music theory]]. Some of the intellectual products of music historians include editions of musical works, [[biographies|biography]] of composers and other musicians, studies of the relationship between [[word]]s and music, and the reflections upon the place of music in [[society]].

==Pedagogy==
Although most performers of classical and traditional instruments receive some instruction in music, art pop, or rock and roll history from teachers throughout their training, the majority of formal music history courses are offered at the [[college]] level.  In Canada, some music students receive training prior to undergraduate studies because examinations in music history (as well as music theory) are required to complete Royal Conservatory certification at the Grade 9 level and higher

Most medium and large institutions will offer both types of courses.  The two types of courses will usually differ in length (one to two semesters vs. two to four), breadth (many music appreciation courses begin at the [[Baroque music|late Baroque]] or [[Classical music era|classical]] eras and might omit music after [[World War II|WWII]] while courses for majors traditionally span the period from the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] to recent times), and depth. Both types of courses tend to emphasize a balance among the acquisition of musical [[repertory]] (often emphasized through listening examinations), study and analysis of these works, biographical and cultural details of music and musicians, and writing about music, perhaps through [[music criticism]].

More specialized seminars in music history tend to use a similar approach on a narrower subject while introducing more of the tools of research in music history.The range of possible topics is virtually limitless.  Some examples might be "Music during [[World War I]]," "Medieval and Renaissance [[musical instrument|instrumental]] music," "Music and Process," "[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''Don Giovanni''."

The methods and tools of music history are nearly as many as its subjects and therefore make a strict categorization impossible. However, a few trends and approaches can be outlined here. Like in any other historical discipline, most research in music history can be roughly divided into two categories: the establishing of factual and correct data and the interpretation of data. Most historical research does not fall into one category solely, but rather employs a combination of methods from both categories. It should also be noted that the act of establishing factual data can never be fully separate from the act of interpretation.

'''Archival work''' may be conducted to find connections to music or musicians in a collection of documents of broader interests (e.g., [[Vatican Secret Archives|Vatican]] pay records, letters to a patroness of the arts) or to more systematically study a collection of documents related to a musician.  In some cases, where records, scores, and letters have been digitized, [[Archive|archival]] work can be done online. One example of a composer for whom archival materials can be examined online is the [[Arnold Schoenberg]] Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/ Schoenberg.at]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Performance practice''' draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Scholars investigate questions such as which instruments or voices were used to perform a given work, what tempos (or tempo changes) were used, and how (or if) ornaments were used. Although [[performance practice]] was previously confined to early music from the Baroque era, since the 1990s, research in performance practice has examined other historical eras, such as how early Classical era piano concerti were performed, how the early history of recording affected the use of vibrato in classical music, or which instruments were used in [[Klezmer]] music.

'''Biographical studies''' of composers can give a better sense of the chronology of compositions, influences on style and works, and provide important background to the interpretation (by performers or listeners) of works.  Thus biography can form one part of the larger study of the cultural significance, underlying program, or agenda of a work; a study which gained increasing importance in the 1980s and early 1990s.

'''Sociological studies''' focus on the function of music in society as well as its meaning for individuals and society as a whole. Researchers emphasizing the social importance of music (including classical music) are sometimes called [[New musicology|New musicologists]].

'''Semiotic studies''' are most conventionally the province of music analysts rather than historians.  However, crucial to the practice of musical semiotics – the interpretation of meaning in a work or style – is its situation in a historical context.  The interpretative work of scholars such as [[Kofi Agawu]] and [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]] fall between the analytic and the music historical.

==History==

===Before 1800===
The first studies of Western musical history date back to the middle of the 18th century. [[Giovanni Battista Martini|G.B. Martini]] published a three volume history titled ''Storia della musica'' (''History of Music'') between 1757 and 1781. [[Martin Gerbert]] published a two volume history of sacred music titled ''De cantu de musica sacra'' in 1774. Gerbert followed this work with a three volume work ''Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra'' containing significant writings on sacred music from the 3rd century onwards in 1784.

===1800–1950===
[[Image:Beethoven opus 101 manuscript.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s manuscript sketch for [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 28]], Movement IV, ''Geschwind, doch nicht zu sehr und mit Entschlossenheit'' ([[Tempo|Allegro]]), in his own handwriting. The piece was completed in 1816.]]
In the 20th century, the work of [[:de:Johannes Wolf (Musikwissenschaftler)|Johannes Wolf]] and others developed studies in [[Medieval music]] and early [[Renaissance music]]. Wolf's writings on the history of musical notation are considered to be particularly notable by musicologists. Historical musicology has played a critical role in renewed interest in [[Baroque music]] as well as medieval and Renaissance music. In particular, the [[authentic performance]] movement owes much to historical musicological scholarship. Towards the middle of the 20th century, musicology (and its largest subfield of historical musicology) expanded significantly as a field of study.  Concurrently the number of musicological and music journals increased to create further outlets for the publication of research.  The domination of German language scholarship ebbed as significant journals sprang up throughout the West, especially America.

==Critiques==

=== Exclusion of disciplines and musics ===
In its most narrow definition, historical musicology is the music history of Western culture. Such a definition arbitrarily excludes disciplines other than history, cultures other than Western, and forms of music other than "classical" ("art", "serious", "high culture") or notated ("artificial") – implying that the omitted disciplines, cultures, and musical styles/genres are somehow inferior. A somewhat broader definition incorporating all musical humanities is still problematic, because it arbitrarily excludes the relevant (natural) sciences (acoustics, psychology, physiology, neurosciences, information and computer sciences, empirical sociology and aesthetics) as well as musical practice.  The musicological sub-disciplines of [[music theory]] and music analysis have likewise historically been rather uneasily separated from the most narrow definition of historical musicology.

Within historical musicology, scholars have been reluctant to adopt postmodern and critical approaches that are common elsewhere in the humanities. According to [[Susan McClary]] (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;1285) the discipline of "music lags behind the other arts; it picks up ideas from other media just when they have become outmoded." Only in the 1990s did historical musicologists, preceded by feminist musicologists in the late 1980s, begin to address issues such as gender, sexualities, bodies, emotions, and subjectivities which dominated the humanities for twenty years before (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;10). In McClary's words (1991, p.&amp;nbsp;5), "It almost seems that musicology managed miraculously to pass directly from pre- to postfeminism without ever having to change – or even examine – its ways." Furthermore, in their discussion on musicology and rock music, Susan McClary and Robert Walser also address a key struggle within the discipline: how musicology has often "dismisse[d] questions of socio-musical interaction out of hand, that part of classical music's greatness is ascribed to its autonomy from society." (1988,  p.&amp;nbsp;283)

=== Exclusion of popular music ===
According to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], the strongest criticism of (historical) musicology has been that it generally ignores popular music. Though musicological study of popular music has vastly increased in quantity recently, Middleton's assertion in 1990—that most major "works of musicology, theoretical or historical, act as though popular music did not exist"—holds true. Academic and conservatory training typically only peripherally addresses this broad spectrum of musics, and many (historical) musicologists who are "both contemptuous and condescending are looking for types of production, musical form, and listening which they associate with a ''different'' kind of music...'classical music'...and they generally find popular music lacking"

He cites three main aspects of this problem (p.&amp;nbsp;104–6). The terminology of historical musicology is "slanted by the needs and history of a particular music ('classical music')." He acknowledges that "there is a rich vocabulary for certain areas [harmony, tonality, certain part-writing and forms], important in musicology's typical corpus"; yet he points out that there is "an impoverished vocabulary for other areas [rhythm, pitch nuance and gradation, and timbre], which are less well developed" in Classical music. Middleton argues that a number of "terms are ideologically loaded" in that "they always involve selective, and often unconsciously formulated, conceptions of what music ''is''."

As well, he claims that historical musicology uses "a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation," 'notational centricity' (Tagg 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;28–32). As a result, "musicological methods tend to foreground those musical parameters which can be easily notated" such as pitch relationships or the relationship between words and music. On the other hand, historical musicology tends to "neglect or have difficulty with parameters which are not easily notated", such as tone colour or non-Western rhythms. In addition, he claims that the "notation-centric training" of Western music schools "induces particular forms of ''listening'', and these then tend to be applied to ''all'' sorts of music, appropriately or not". As a result, Western music students trained in historical musicology may listen to a [[funk]] or [[Latin American music|Latin]] song that is very rhythmically complex, but then dismiss it as a low-level musical work because it has a very simple melody and only uses two or five chords.

Notational centricity also encourages "reification: the score comes to be seen as 'the music', or perhaps the music in an ideal form." As such, music that does not use a written score, such as jazz, blues, or folk, can become demoted to a lower level of status. As well, historical musicology has "an ideology slanted by the origins and development of a particular body of music and its aesthetic...It arose at a specific moment, in a specific context – nineteenth-century Europe, especially Germany – and in close association with that movement in the musical ''practice'' of the period which was codifying the very repertory then taken by musicology as the centre of its attention." These terminological, methodological, and ideological problems affect even works sympathetic to popular music. However, it is not "that musicology ''cannot'' understand popular music, or that students of popular music should abandon musicology."  (Middleton, p.&amp;nbsp;104).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25156">{{numeral systems}}
A '''negative base''' (or negative [[radix]]) may be used to construct a [[non-standard positional numeral system]]. Like other place-value systems, each position holds multiples of the appropriate power of the system's base; but that base is negative—that is to say, the base {{mvar|b}} is equal to {{mvar|−r}} for some natural number {{mvar|r}} ({{mvar|r ≥ 2}}).

Negative-base systems can accommodate all the same numbers as standard place-value systems, but both positive and negative numbers are represented without the use of a [[minus sign]] (or, in computer representation, a [[sign bit]]); this advantage is countered by an increased complexity of arithmetic operations. The need to store the information normally contained by a negative sign often results in a negative-base number being one digit longer than its positive-base equivalent.

The common names for negative-base positional numeral systems are formed by [[prefix (linguistics)|prefixing]] ''nega-'' to the name of the corresponding positive-base system; for example, '''negadecimal''' (base −10) corresponds to [[decimal]] (base 10), '''negabinary''' (base −2) to [[binary numeral system|binary]] (base 2), and '''negaternary''' (base −3) to [[ternary numeral system|ternary]] (base 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Donald|last=Knuth|title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 2|year=1998|edition=3rd|pages=204–205}}. Knuth mentions both negabinary and negadecimal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The negaternary system is discussed briefly in {{Citation | last1=Petkovšek | first1=Marko | author1-link=Marko Petkovšek | title=Ambiguous numbers are dense | doi=10.2307/2324393 | mr=1048915 | year=1990 | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly|The American Mathematical Monthly]] | issn=0002-9890 | volume=97 | issue=5 | pages=408–411}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider what is meant by the representation {{val|fmt=none|12243}} in the negadecimal system, whose base {{mvar|b}} is −10:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
|+ Multiples of
|-
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 10,000}}
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −1,000}}
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 100}}
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −10}}
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}
|-
| 1
| 2
| 2
| 4
| 3
|}

Since 10,000 + (−2,000) + 200 + (−40) + 3 = {{val|fmt=commas|8163}}, the representation {{val|fmt=commas|12243|s={{sub|−10}}}} in negadecimal notation is equivalent to {{val|fmt=commas|8,163|s={{sub|10}}}} in decimal notation, while {{val|fmt=commas|−8163|s={{sub|10}}}} in decimal would be written {{val|fmt=commas|9,977|s={{sub|−10}}}} in negadecimal.

==History==
Negative numerical bases were first considered by [[Vittorio Grünwald]] in his work ''Giornale di Matematiche di Battaglini'', published in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Vittorio Grünwald. ''Giornale di Matematiche di Battaglini'' (1885), 203-221, 367&lt;/ref&gt; Grünwald gave algorithms for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root extraction, divisibility tests, and radix conversion. Negative bases were later independently rediscovered by [[Aubrey J. Kempner|A. J. Kempner]] in 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Kempner | first = A. J. | authorlink = Aubrey J. Kempner
 | doi = 10.2307/2300532

 | mr = 1523792
 | pages = 610–617
 | title = Anormal Systems of Numeration
 | volume = 43
 | year = 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zdzisław Pawlak]] and A. Wakulicz in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Negabinary was implemented in the early [[Poland|Polish]] computer [[BINEG]] (and [[UMC (computer)|UMC]]), built 1957–59, based on ideas by Z. Pawlak and A. Lazarkiewicz from the [[Mathematical Institute]] in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chc60.fgcu.edu/images/articles/Marczynski.pdf Marczynski, R. W., "The First Seven Years of Polish Computing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719192337/http://chc60.fgcu.edu/images/articles/Marczynski.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Vol. 2, No 1, January 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  Implementations since then have been rare.

==Notation and use==
Denoting the base as {{mvar|−r}}, every [[integer]] {{mvar|a}} can be written uniquely as
:&lt;math&gt;a = \sum_{i=0}^{n}d_{i}(-r)^{i}&lt;/math&gt;
where each digit {{mvar|d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an integer from 0 to {{math|''r'' - 1}} and the leading digit {{mvar|d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|&gt; 0}} (unless {{math|''n''&amp;#x003D;0}}). The base {{mvar|−r}} expansion of {{mvar|a}} is then given by the string {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;hellip;''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Negative-base systems may thus be compared to [[signed-digit representation]]s, such as [[balanced ternary]], where the radix is positive but the digits are taken from a partially negative range. (In the table below the digit of value −1 is written as the single character T.)

Some numbers have the same representation in base {{mvar|−r}} as in base {{mvar|r}}.  For example, the numbers from 100 to 109 have the same representations in decimal and negadecimal.  Similarly,
:&lt;math&gt;17=2^4+2^0=(-2)^4+(-2)^0&lt;/math&gt;
and is represented by 10001 in binary and 10001 in negabinary.

Some numbers with their expansions in a number of positive and corresponding negative bases are:

Note that the base {{mvar|−r}} expansions of negative integers have an [[even number]] of digits, while the base {{mvar|−r}} expansions of the non-negative integers have an [[odd number]] of digits.

==Calculation==
The base {{mvar|−r}} expansion of a number can be found by repeated division by {{mvar|−r}}, recording the non-negative remainders of &lt;math&gt; 0, 1, \ldots, r-1&lt;/math&gt;, and concatenating those remainders, starting with the last.  Note that if {{math| ''a'' / ''b'' &amp;#x003D; ''c''}}, remainder {{mvar|d}}, then {{math| ''bc'' + ''d'' &amp;#x003D; ''a''}} and therefore {{math| ''d'' &amp;#x003D; ''a'' - ''bc''}}. To arrive at the correct conversion, the value for {{mvar|c}} must be chosen such that {{mvar|d}} is non-negative and minimal. This is exemplified in the fourth line of the following example wherein –5 ÷ –3 must be chosen to equal 2 remainder 1 instead of 1 remainder –2.

For example, to convert 146 in decimal to negaternary:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rr}
 146 \div (-3) = &amp; -48 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 2 \\
 -48 \div (-3) = &amp;  16 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 0 \\
  16 \div (-3) = &amp;  -5 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 1 \\
  -5 \div (-3) = &amp;   2 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 1 \\
   2 \div (-3) = &amp;   0 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 2
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
Reading the remainders backward we obtain the negaternary representation of 146&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;: 21102&lt;sub&gt;–3&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Proof: ((('''2'''·(–3)+'''1''')·(–3)+'''1''')·(–3)+'''0''')·(–3)+'''2''' = 146&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that in most [[programming languages]], the result (in integer arithmetic) of dividing a negative number by a negative number is rounded towards 0, usually leaving a negative remainder. In such a case we have {{math|''a'' &amp;#x003D; (−''r'')''c'' + ''d'' &amp;#x003D; (−''r'')''c'' + ''d'' − ''r'' + ''r'' &amp;#x003D; (−''r'')(''c'' + 1) + (''d'' + ''r'')}}. Because {{math|{{!}}d{{!}} &lt; r}}, {{math|(''d'' + ''r'')}} is the positive remainder. Therefore, to get the correct result in such case, computer implementations of the above algorithm should add 1 and {{mvar|r}} to the quotient and remainder respectively.

=== Shortcut calculation ===
====To negabinary====
The conversion to ''negabinary'' (base −2; digits &lt;math&gt;\in \; \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;) allows a remarkable shortcut 
(C implementation):
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
unsigned int toNegaBinary(unsigned int value) // input in standard binary
{
	unsigned int Schroeppel2 = 0xAAAAAAAA; // = 2/3*((2*2)^16-1) = ...1010
	return (value + Schroeppel2) ^ Schroeppel2; // eXclusive OR
	// resulting unsigned int to be interpreted as string of elements ε {0,1} (bits)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Due to D. Librik (Szudzik). The bitwise XOR portion is originally due to [[Richard Schroeppel|Schroeppel]] (1972).&lt;ref&gt;See the MathWorld Negabinary link&lt;/ref&gt;

JavaScript port for the same shortcut calculation: 
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function toNegaBinary( number ) {
    var Schroeppel2 = 0xAAAAAAAA;
    // Convert to NegaBinary String
    return ( ( number + Schroeppel2 ) ^ Schroeppel2 ).toString(2);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====To negaquaternary====
The conversion to ''negaquaternary'' (base −4; digits &lt;math&gt;\in \; \{0, 1, 2, 3\}&lt;/math&gt;) allows a similar shortcut (C implementation):
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
unsigned int toNegaQuaternary(unsigned int value) // input in standard binary
{
	unsigned int Schroeppel4 = 0xCCCCCCCC; // = 4/5*((2*4)^8-1) = ...11001100 = ...3030
	return (value + Schroeppel4) ^ Schroeppel4; // eXclusive OR
	// resulting unsigned int to be interpreted as string of elements ε {0,1,2,3} (pairs of bits)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

JavaScript port for the same shortcut calculation: 
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function toNegaQuaternary( number ) {
    var Schroeppel4 = 0xCCCCCCCC;
    // Convert to NegaQuaternary String
    return ( ( number + Schroeppel4 ) ^ Schroeppel4 ).toString(4);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Arithmetic operations==
The following describes the arithmetic operations for negabinary; calculations in larger bases are similar.

===Addition===
Adding negabinary numbers proceeds bitwise, starting from the [[least significant bit]]s; the bits from each addend are summed with the ([[balanced ternary]]) carry from the previous bit (0 at the LSB). This sum is then decomposed into an output bit and carry for the next iteration as show in the table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right;"
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Sum
! colspan=3 | Output
! rowspan=2 | Comment 
|-
! Bit
! colspan=2 | Carry
|-
| −2 || 010{{sub|−2}} || 0 ||  1 || 01{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" | −2 occurs only during subtraction.
|-
| −1 || 011{{sub|−2}} || 1 ||  1 || 01{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  0 || 000{{sub|−2}} || 0 ||  0 || 00{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  1 || 001{{sub|−2}} || 1 ||  0 || 00{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  2 || 110{{sub|−2}} || 0 || −1 || 11{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  3 || 111{{sub|−2}} || 1 || −1 || 11{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" | 3 occurs only during addition.
|}

The second row of this table, for instance, expresses the fact that '''−1''' = '''1''' + '''1''' × −2; the fifth row says '''2''' = '''0''' + '''−1''' × −2; etc.

As an example, to add 1010101{{sub|−2}} (1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85) and 1110100{{sub|−2}} (4 + 16 − 32 + 64 = 52),

 Carry:          1 −1  0 −1  1 −1  0  0  0
 First addend:         1  0  1  0  1  0  1
 Second addend:        1  1  1  0  1  0  0 +
                --------------------------
 Number:         1 −1  2  0  3 −1  2  0  1
 Bit (result):   1  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1
 Carry:          0  1 −1  0 −1  1 −1  0  0

so the result is 110011001{{sub|−2}} (1 − 8 + 16 − 128 + 256 = 137).

==== Another method ====
While adding two negabinary numbers, every time a carry is generated an extra carry should be propagated to next bit. Consider same example as above

 Extra carry:       1  1  0  1  0  0  0     
 Carry:          1  0  1  1  0  1  0  0  0
 First addend:         1  0  1  0  1  0  1
 Second addend:        1  1  1  0  1  0  0 +
                --------------------------
 Answer:         1  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1

==== Negabinary full adder ====
A [[Adder (electronics)|full adder]] circuit can be designed to add numbers in negabinary. The following logic is used to calculate the sum and carries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Francis, Suganda, Shizuhuo |first=Yu, Jutamulia, Yin |date=4 September 2001 |title=Introduction to Information Optics |publisher=Academic Press |page=498 |isbn=9780127748115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_i = a_i \oplus b_i \oplus c_i^+ \oplus c_i^-&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}^+ = \overline{a_i}\overline{b_i}\overline{c_i^+}c_i^-&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}^- = a_i b_i \overline{c_i^-} + (a_i \oplus b_i)c_i^+ \overline{c_i^-}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Incrementing negabinary numbers ====
Incrementing a negabinary number can be done by using the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1878151/why-does-the-following-formula-increment-a-negabinary-number-number-in-base-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913101620/http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1878151/why-does-the-following-formula-increment-a-negabinary-number-number-in-base-2 |archivedate=2016-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2x \oplus ((2x \oplus x) + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

===Subtraction===
To subtract, multiply each bit of the second number by −1, and add the numbers, using the same table as above.

As an example, to compute 1101001{{sub|−2}} (1 − 8 − 32 + 64 = 25) minus 1110100{{sub|−2}} (4 + 16 − 32 + 64 = 52),

 Carry:          0  1 −1  1  0  0  0
 First number:   1  1  0  1  0  0  1
 Second number: −1 −1 −1  0 −1  0  0 +
                --------------------
 Number:         0  1 −2  2 −1  0  1
 Bit (result):   0  1  0  0  1  0  1
 Carry:          0  0  1 −1  1  0  0

so the result is 100101{{sub|−2}} (1 + 4 −32 = −27).

Unary negation, {{math|−''x''}}, can be computed as binary subtraction from zero, {{math|0 − ''x''}}.

===Multiplication and division===
Shifting to the left multiplies by −2, shifting to the right divides by −2.

To multiply, multiply like normal [[decimal]] or [[binary numeral system|binary]] numbers, but using the negabinary rules for adding the carry, when adding the numbers.

 First number:                   1  1  1  0  1  1  0
 Second number:                  1  0  1  1  0  1  1 ×
               -------------------------------------
                                 1  1  1  0  1  1  0
                              1  1  1  0  1  1  0
 
                        1  1  1  0  1  1  0
                     1  1  1  0  1  1  0
 
               1  1  1  0  1  1  0                   +
               -------------------------------------
 Carry:        0 −1  0 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1  0 −1  0  0
 Number:       1  0  2  1  2  2  2  3  2  0  2  1  0
 Bit (result): 1  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0
 Carry:           0 −1  0 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1  0 −1  0  0

For each column, add ''carry'' to ''number'', and divide the sum by −2, to get the new ''carry'', and the resulting bit as the remainder.

===Comparing negabinary numbers===
It is possible to compare negabinary numbers by slightly adjusting a normal unsigned [[digital comparator|binary comparator]]. When comparing the numbers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, invert each odd positioned bit of both numbers.
After this, compare &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; using a standard unsigned comparator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murugesan |first=San|date=1977|title=Negabinary arithmetic circuits using binary arithmetic  |journal=Electronic Circuits and Systems, IEE Journal on |publisher=IET |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=77–78 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divisibility tests===

===Root extraction===
To be written.

--&gt;

==Fractional numbers==
Base {{mvar|−r}} representation may of course be carried beyond the [[radix point]], allowing the representation of non-integral numbers.

As with positive-base systems, terminating representations correspond to fractions where the denominator is a power of the base; repeating representations correspond to other rationals, and for the same reason.

===Non-unique representations===
Unlike positive-base systems, where integers and terminating fractions have non-unique representations (for example, in decimal [[0.999… = 1]]) in negative-base systems the integers have only a single representation.  However, there do exist rationals with non-unique representations. For the digits {0, 1, &amp;hellip;, '''t'''} with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}:=r\!-\!\!1=-b\!-\!\!1&lt;/math&gt; the biggest digit and
:&lt;math&gt;T:=0.\overline{01}_b = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} b^{-2i} = \frac1{b^2-1} = \frac1{r^2-1}&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;0.\overline{0\mathbf{t}}_b=\mathbf{t}T=\frac{r\!-\!\!1}{r^2-1}=\frac1{r+1}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; as well as
:&lt;math&gt;1.\overline{\mathbf{t}0}_b = 1+\mathbf{t}bT = \frac{(r^2-1)+(r\!-\!\!1)b}{r^2-1}= \frac1{r+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
So every number &lt;math&gt;\frac1{r+1}+z&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Positional notation#Terminating fractions|terminating fraction]] &lt;math&gt;z\in \Z r^{\Z}&lt;/math&gt; added has two distinct representations.

For example, in negaternary, i.e. &lt;math&gt;b=-3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}=2&lt;/math&gt;, there is
: &lt;math&gt;1.\overline{02}_{(-3)} = \frac{5}{4} = 2.\overline{20}_{(-3)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Such non-unique representations can be found by considering the largest and smallest possible representations with integral parts 0 and 1 respectively, and then noting that they are equal. (Indeed, this works with any integral-base system.) The rationals thus non-uniquely expressible are those of form
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{z(r+1) + 1}{b^i(r + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;z,i\in \Z.&lt;/math&gt;

== Imaginary base ==
{{main article|Complex-base system}}

Just as using a negative base allows the representation of negative numbers without an explicit negative sign, using an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] base allows the representation of [[Gaussian integer]]s. [[Donald Knuth]] proposed the [[quater-imaginary base]] (base 2i) in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;D. Knuth. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 2, 3rd Edition. Addison-Wesley. pp. 205, "Positional Number Systems"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neurotology''' or '''neuro-otology''' is a branch of clinical medicine which studies and treats neurological disorders of the [[ear]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entfw.com/index-services-neurotology.html Information on Neurotology from the ENT Centre in Fort Wayne] retrieved 25 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subspecialty of [[otolaryngology]]-head and neck surgery, and is closely related to [[otology]], and also draws on the fields of [[neurology]] and [[neurosurgery]]. Otology generally refers to the treatment of middle ear disease and resultant [[conductive hearing loss]], whereas neurotology refers to treatment of inner ear conditions, or hearing and balance disorders. These specialists also work with [[audiologist]]s and related sensory specialists.     

'''Neurotologists''' are [[physician]]s who have specialized in otolaryngology and then further specialized in neurological conditions of the ear and related structures. Many general otolaryngologists are trained in otology or middle ear surgery, performing surgery such as a [[tympanoplasty]], or a reconstruction of the ear drum, when a hole remains from a prior ear tube or prior infection. Otologic surgery also includes treatment of [[conductive hearing loss]] by reconstructing the hearing bones, or [[ossicles]], as a result of infection, or by replacing the stapes bone with a [[stapedectomy]] for [[otosclerosis]]. Neurotology encompasses more complex surgery of the inner ear not typically performed by general otolaryngologists, such as removal of complex [[cholesteatoma]], [[labyrinthectomy]], surgery of the [[endolymphatic sac]] for [[meniere's disease]] and [[cochlear implant]] surgery, because of the additional risk of [[hearing loss]],  [[vertigo]], and [[facial nerve paralysis]]. It is more and more common in the United States as well as around the world for [[otolaryngologist|otolaryngologists]] to obtain additional advanced training in neurotology, which requires an additional one or two years of fellowship training after five years of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]]. 

Historically '''neurotology fellowship programs''' have only been one additional year. Currently most one-year programs are non-accredited programs, but offer training in a wide variety of otologic and neurotologic procedures. Many non-accredited programs do not emphasize surgery of the lateral [[Base of skull|skull base]], but many do offer training in [[acoustic neuromas]], [[glomus jugulare]] and other skull base surgeries. These non-accredited neurotology fellowships are also referred to as advanced otology fellowships. Two-year accredited programs have become a growing trend in the last 5-10 years, and are more geared towards academic training, with the additional year often being more focused on research. The advantage of the additional accreditation, separate from otolaryngology, is to emphasize training in the skull base procedures and qualify these trainees for intracranial surgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=ocaterminal&amp;L=4&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Licensee&amp;L2=Division+of+Professional+Licensure+Boards&amp;L3=Board+of+Registration+in+Speech-Language+Pathology+and+Audiology&amp;sid=Eoca&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=dpl_boards_sp_faq&amp;csid=Eoca#c1 Frequently Asked Questions about Board of Registration in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology] retrieved 25 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field of work==
Conditions treated by neurotologists include:
* Vestibular (balance) diseases, such as [[Ménière's disease]] and [[vestibular neuronitis]]
* Skull base [[tumors]], such as [[vestibular schwannoma]] (acoustic neuroma)
* Facial nerve disorders, including [[facial nerve paralysis]]
* Hearing loss and deafness
* Certain conditions relating to the [[skull base]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earsite.com/ Neurotology research centre]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of these conditions also relate to [[otology]]

[[File:Nipple clamps 03.JPG|thumb|225px|Tweezer type of Nipple clamp]]
[[File:Clover nipple clamps.JPG|thumb|225px|Clover clamps]]

A '''nipple clamp''' is a [[sex toy]]. It is a [[Clamp (tool)|clamp]] that is applied to the [[nipple]]s of a person of any gender. It causes pain by the pinching of the nipple, by the restriction of blood flow, and by the reintroduction of blood flow. Nipple clamps are used in some [[BDSM]] activities, such as [[breast torture]]. The main types of nipple clamps are the ''clover clamp'', ''tweezer clamp'', ''piercing clamp'', and ''[[clothespin|clothes-pin]] style'', though any device that applies direct pressure can be used.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

Clamps are typically used in pairs and often connected by a chain.{{cn|date=July 2016}} Weights may be hung from the clamps to amplify the pain by increasing the pressure and pinching. The chain may be wrapped behind a fixed piece of [[erotic furniture]] such as a post, so that, when the wearer is prodded to jump or otherwise move suddenly, pain is increased by pulling of the nipples. Another variation involves attaching another chain to the chain, the end of which is connected to a clamp attached to either the [[clitoris]] for a female or a [[cock ring]] for a male. This variation is known as the "Y clamps" for the shape of the chain linking all three connection points when attached to the body.

== Clothes-pin style ==
A clothes-pin style clamp works like a common household clothes-pin — two short lengths of metal, joined by a spring to keep one end closed. This type often comes with screws to adjust the pressure, screwing in to release it.

== Tweezer clamp ==
A '''tweezer clamp''' consists of two short lengths of metal, no more than 5&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;in) in length. The two lengths are fixed together at one end and open at the other end (just like a regular tweezer). The open ends are curved slightly to improve their ability to grip the nipple. Typically, they have a small 1&amp;nbsp;cm rubber sheath over this end to protect the nipple from damage and reduce slippage. A small ring wraps around the two pieces of metal and is used to adjust the tension. The user places the two sides of the metal head either side of the nipple, then by sliding the ring along the clamp shaft towards the nipple, causes the two halves to close tighter together. Tension can thus be adjusted depending on the location of the ring &amp;mdash; the closer the ring is along the shaft toward the nipple, the tighter the clamp.

== Clover clamp ==
The '''clover clamp''', also referred to as a "butterfly clamp", is of [[Japan]]ese design{{cn|date=January 2013}} and provides increasing tension if pulled. The clamp itself is flat, about 5&amp;nbsp;cm by 10&amp;nbsp;cm (2 by 4&amp;nbsp;in) in size. The clamp is applied to the nipple and the spring tension holds the clamp in place. The clamp usually provides a very high pain level, and is usually only used by more advanced users. To increase tension on the nipples, small weights such as fishing line sinkers can be attached to the ends of the clamp. As increased pulling tension is applied to the clamp, it will cause the jaws of the clamp to close tighter, depending on the amount of pull pressure. Another method is to use the clamps to keep a person in one place. If cord is tied from the clamp to a fixed place, the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move. Eventually the clamps would be pulled off the nipples but not before considerable pain is felt. If left on for too long can cause nipple irritation.

An '''object language''' is a [[language]] which is the "object" of study in various fields including [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]].  The language being used to talk about an object language is called a [[metalanguage]].  An object language may be a [[formal language|formal]] or [[natural language|natural]] language.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Forms of object language ==
=== Formal languages ===

[[Mathematical logic]] and [[linguistics]] make use of metalanguages, which are languages for describing the nature of other languages. In mathematical logic, the object language is usually a [[formal language]]. The language which a metalanguage is used to describe is the object language. It is called that because that language is the object under discussion using the metalanguage.

For instance, someone who says "In French, you say ''Bonjour'' to greet someone" uses [[English language|English]] as a metalanguage to describe the object language [[French language|French]].

=== Computer languages ===

There are two ways the term ''object language'' can be used in computing: a language which is the object of formal specification, and a language which is the object (goal) of a compiler or interpreter.

==== Formal specification ====

{{Main|Specification language}}

Computer languages are object languages of the metalanguage in which their [[specification]] is written. In computer science this is referred to as the [[specification language]]. [[Backus–Naur form]] was one of the earliest used specification languages.

When [[compiler]]s are written using systems like [[lex (software)|lex]] and [[yacc]], the rules the programmer writes look much like a formal specification, but it is considered an [[implementation]] instead. Many [[programming language implementation]]s are not strictly the same as their specifications, adding features or making implementation-dependent design decisions.

==== Object Code ====

{{Main|Object file}}

At their basic level, computers act on what is given to them through a limited set of instructions which are understood by their [[CPU]]s. In the earliest computers, that meant programmers sometimes composed actual 1's and 0's to program. Since this requires considerable programmer training (and patience) to create instructions, later computer languages have gone to great lengths to simplify the programmer's task. For example, a high level programming language may allow a programmer to assign a value to a variable without specifying a memory location or a CPU instruction.

In this context, the high level programming language is the ''source language'', which is then translated by a [[compiler]] into [[object code]] that the CPU can read directly. This object code is the ''object language'', and varies depending on what CPU is being given the instructions.

''Object language'' in this context means something akin to "the object of what the programmer is trying to achieve". If the source language and object languages are viewed as formal (logical) languages, what the compiler does is ''interpret'' the source into the target language (this is different from the computer science use of ''[[interpreted language]]'' meaning one which is ''not'' compiled).

''Object language'' in this context is synonymous with ''target language''.  The object language of a translation most often is a [[machine language]], but can be some other kind of language, such as [[assembly language]].

Because the object language of compilation has usually been machine language, the term ''[[object file]]'' has come to mean a file containing machine instructions, and sometimes the translated program itself is simply called an ''object''.

''Object language'' should also not be confused with ''[[object-oriented language]]'', which is a type of computer [[programming language]] which changes the programmer's environment into convenient objects which can be used in something similar to a drag-and-drop fashion.

== Expressions in an object language ==
=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Symbol (formal)}}

A ''symbol'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]], [[type-token distinction|token]]s of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Although the term "symbol" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the [[formal language]]s studied in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the term "symbol" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a [[type-token distinction|token]] instance of the symbol.

=== Formulas ===
{{Main|Well-formed formula}}

In the formal languages used in mathematical logic and computer science, a ''well-formed formula'' or simply ''formula'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]] which is expressed using the [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s and [[formation rule]]s (also called the [[formal grammar]]) of a particular formal language. To say that a [[string (computer science)|string]] of symbols &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a well-formed formula with respect to a given formal grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to saying that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the language generated by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Formal systems ===
{{Main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' is a [[formal language]] together with a [[deductive system]] which consists of a set of [[inference rule]]s and/or [[axiom]]s. A formal system is used to [[formal proof|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions previously expressed in the system. These expressions are called [[axiom]]s, in the case of those previously supposed to be true, or [[theorem]]s, in the case of those derived. A formal system may be formulated and studied for its intrinsic properties, or it may be intended as a description (i.e. a [[Interpretation (logic)|model]]) of external phenomena.

=== Theorems ===
{{Main|Theorem}}

A ''theorem'' is a [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] or string of symbols which is [[formal proof|derived]] by using a [[formal system]]. The string of symbols is a [[logical consequence]] of the [[axiom]]s and [[rule of inference|rules]] of the system.

=== Formal proofs ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

A ''formal proof'' or ''derivation'' is a finite sequence of [[proposition]]s (called [[well-formed formula]]s in the case of a [[formal language]]) each of which is an [[axiom]] or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. The last sentence in the sequence is a [[theorem]] of a [[formal system]]. The concept of [[natural deduction]] is a [[generalization]] of the concept of proof.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]], ''deduction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theories ===
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

A ''theory'' is a set of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s in a [[formal language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9903">'''Paranoid fiction''' is a term sometimes used to describe works of [[literature]] that explore the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/new_literary_history/v028/28.1flieger.html Postmodern Perspective: The Paranoid Eye. ''New Literary History''.Volume 28, Number 1, Winter 1997, pp. 87-109]&lt;/ref&gt;  These forces can be external, such as a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, or they can be internal, such as a character's [[mental illness]] or refusal to accept the harshness of the world he or she is in.

Unlike [[speculative fiction]], paranoid fiction is written in a way so as to imply that the story may only be a [[delusion]] of the characters, instead of treating it as an [[alternate history]] or an [[fictional universe|in-fiction universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==History==
The elements of paranoid fiction can be seen in works dating as far back as the late 19th and early 20th century. Some of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novels contained paranoid and psychologically troubled characters set against the dark backdrop of a modernizing [[Russia]]. [[Franz Kafka]], in particular, was known for his exaggerated accounts of what he portrayed as real life in his works, to enhance the absurdity of the life themes they conveyed.  Similarly, [[George Orwell]]'s works, while not as exaggerated, confirmed the practice of using [[dystopia]]n fiction to take a different outlook on highly common themes, including identity and personal desires.

The term ''paranoid fiction'' was first coined to label sensationalistic and off-beat stories as bizarre and thus outside the realm of literary fiction.  Starting after [[World War I]], however, [[modernism|modernists]] began exploring the stranger themes of life in art, in response to the themes of death being effectively mechanized and made impossible to toy with by the war's graphic depictions.  As a result, modernist literature tended to explore the meaning and construction of reality, shifting away from the progressive, cause-and-effect structure of [[Literary realism|realist]] fiction towards a more complex and disjointed depiction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Lye, John (1997). [http://www.brocku.ca/english/courses/2F55/modernism.html "Some Attributes of Modernist Literature."]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], [[absurdism|absurdists]] carried this focus one step further by placing these common themes in surreal and fantastic settings, turning what would have been otherwise mundane concepts into distinctive, stand-out ones, thus converting the paranoid fiction genre into a legitimate one.

[[Philip K. Dick]] is most frequently viewed as the forefather of the modern paranoid fiction.  His works were born out of paranoia and hallucination; he had sudden visions of places he'd never been to and events he'd never witnessed, possibly from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] or an overly active imagination.  These visions were so vivid that Dick put them down on paper, never failing to classify them as only "speculative thought," and thus outside the boundary of conventional thought.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. [http://www.techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html "Philip K. Dick's Divine Interference."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205050412/http://techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html |date=2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Dick's works start out uneventfully in a seemingly ordinary setting, then transpose to a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] [[fantasy]], with the characters discovering that what they thought real was in fact a delusion.  Throughout his works, Dick maintained a balance between the expected traits of the [[science fiction]] genre they were also categorized in, and the eccentric and disturbing elements coming from his mind.&lt;ref name="paranoid"&gt;[http://www.strangewords.com/archive/paranoia.html "Strange Words: Paranoid."]&lt;/ref&gt;  A recurring theme in his works is on how reality is perceived and treated differently by people depending on their mindsets.

==Characteristics==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:BladeRunner Sun.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Blade Runner]]: Dr Tyrell polarizing his office window to control the sun implies the god-like powers of the Tyrell Corporation.]] --&gt;
At its most basic, paranoid fiction refers specifically to works about speculations and possible conspiracies by people in power, told by an [[unreliable narrator]].&lt;ref name="paranoid"/&gt;  However, the most popular type of paranoid fiction has proved to be one in which the universe appears on the surface to be definite and real, but upon closer inspection, to actually be deceptive and deliberately misleading.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  In these works, there are either questions raised as to the realness of the world the characters are living in, or a distinction made between a fantasy world and its reality.

Paranoid fiction often overlaps with many other genres, most commonly [[dystopia]]n fiction, [[science fiction]], and [[film noir]], sharing many of its main themes and literary devices.  Generally, however, paranoid fiction avoids explicitly defined themes and concrete [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s in favor of [[allegory|allegories]] and ambiguous [[symbol]]ism to emphasize the dreamlike and unreal nature of the characters' world.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027080230/http://geocities.com/sanmasonic/Paranoid/ "Paranoid Fiction."]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a purely dystopian work typically explores the mechanisms and motives of the totalitarian state to keep its people under control, whereas one of paranoid fiction would concentrate more on the effects of the state on its inhabitants' mental and [[emotional well-being]], and its implications on the decadent condition of society.  George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' can be viewed as a balance of the two, depicting the Party as crushing free will through a strictly defined [[Newspeak|language]] and constant monitoring, but also through psychological torture and the distorting of people's viewpoints on what is true and what is false.

To further increase their "[[magic realism]]," works of paranoid fiction often employ common devices and archetypes from other genres, including a detective-solving structure, plot twists, or philosophical themes, to create a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] tone and an atmosphere of fear and dread.  Plots also tend to be fanciful and occasionally futuristic to emphasize their inherent absurdity and imaginativeness, but also maintain some measure of realism to comment on how apparently unrealistic stories can, in fact, be (often frighteningly) closer to real life than one might think at first glance.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"/&gt;

Sometimes paranoid fiction will strongly imply, and occasionally admit outright, that its constructed world is a lie or an illusion.  In this case, the plot will center on the main character's struggle between the physical and spiritual; i.e. the actual world they are in, versus the world they want to see and believe in. Here, the cause of the fantasy is the protagonist's internal desires, doubts, and suspicions.  Such works tend to be more introspective and focused on the individual, than on a community or a regime.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''The Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Institut Pasteur de Nha Trang'', [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Viện Pasteur Nha Trang'') is one of two [[Institut Pasteur]] in [[Vietnam]]. Located in [[Nha Trang]], it was established during the [[French Indochina|French colonization of Vietnam]]. It operates directly under the authority of the [[Ministry of Health (Vietnam)|Vietnamese Ministry of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://research.pasteur.fr/en/network/institut-pasteur-in-nha-trang-vietnam/ |title= Institut Pasteur in Nha Trang |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Institut Pasteur |publisher= |access-date=November 6, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Established by [[Alexandre Yersin]] in 1895, it specialized in the study of animal disease, their prophylaxis and treatment. Yersin bought a 500 hectare property in Suoi Giao (about 20&amp;nbsp;km outside Nha Trang) on which to raise 600 goats, sheep, cattle and water buffalo, all needed for research at the institute. The property was cleared by Yersin and his [[coolies]], and they built stables for the research animals. Yersin hung a bell around the neck of each animal to keep local tigers from attacking them. Within a few years, veterinarians joined the researchers at the institute and developed an anti-plague serum for human use and several serum for use in cattle.&lt;ref name=perrot&gt;{{cite book|language=French |last1=Perrot |first1=Annick |last2= Schwartz|first2=Maxime |date=2013 |title= Pasteur et ses lieutenants: Roux, Yersin et les autres |url= https://books.google.com/?id=HbZWHiEfOAAC&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Institut%20Pasteur%20de%20Nha%20Trang&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q=Institut%20Pasteur%20de%20Nha%20Trang&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= Odile Jacob|page= |isbn= 9782738177810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first few years, Yersin and his team studied most of the local diseases commonly found in animals in [[Indochina]], developing treatments and making them available to the local populace.

The research was expensive; despite government subsidies and donations, he would have to find a local source of financing. Yersin introduced rubber trees ([[Hevea brasiliensis]]) to the property. The first crop planted in 1898 gave a latex harvest in 1904 (this was sold to the local [[Michelin]] producer). The rubber crop helped support the institute’s activities.&lt;ref name=perrot/&gt; (This property was bequeathed to the Nha Trang Institute after his death.)

Ten years after the introduction of the rubber plants, Yersin introduced [[Cinchona]] plants for the production of [[quinine]]. His effort would take 20 years to give favourable results. After his death, Yersin was buried on the Suoi Giao property.&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/l-institut-pasteur-de-nha-trang_1370900.html |title= L'institut Pasteur de Nha Trang|last1= Bronnec|first1= Thomas |last2= Fechner |first2= Benoist |date= 01/09/2004|website=l’express L’Expansion |publisher= |access-date=November 6, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An epidemic of [[plague (disease)|plague]] came to Nha Trang in 1898 and was one of the first diseases studied at the institute. The Nha Trang facilities were placed under the supervision of the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1904 and Yersin assumed the leadership of the facility that same year.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

==Later history==
After the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, the Nha Trang facility was made into a provincial hygiene institute by the government.

In 1990, Nha Trang rejoined the family of worldwide Pasteur Institutes. In 1992, scientists from Nha Trang traveled to Paris to study at the Pasteur Institute. In 1997, a museum dedicated to Alexandre Yersin was opened in Nha Trang, attracting many tourists.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

The institute is still conducting medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buchy |first=P.

[[Image:Paul Smiths College - Library.jpg|thumb|The Joan Weill Adirondack Library]]
'''Paul Smith's College''' is a private college located in [[Paul Smiths, New York|Paul Smiths, N.Y.]] It is the only four-year institution of higher education within the [[Adirondack State Park|Adirondack Park]]. Paul Smith's College offers both two- and four-year programs in many fields, including natural resources, environmental science, fisheries and wildlife science, forestry, recreation, biology, hotel and restaurant management, culinary arts and business. Its 14,000-acre campus is one of the largest college campuses in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/paul-smiths-college-2795|title=Paul Smith's College - Profile, Rankings and Data {{!}} US News Best Colleges|last=|first=|date=|website=US News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517212910/https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/paul-smiths-college-2795|archive-date=2017-05-17|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,000 students attend each year.

==History==
Paul Smith's College was founded through a bequest of Phelps Smith, son of [[Apollos Smith]], whose [[Paul Smith's Hotel]], built in 1859, was the most famous wilderness resort of its era. The first class was matriculated in 1946, and was loosely based on the original hotel's business model. Along with the money to start a school, Phelps also left more than 20,000 acres (80&amp;nbsp;km²) of land.  Paul Smith's is located northwest of [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake, N]].Y., in the hamlet of Paul Smiths in the Town of [[Brighton, Franklin County, New York|Brighton]].

In 2015 Joan Weill, a former college trustee with a long history of philanthropy benefiting the college, offered a $20 million donation on the condition that the institution change its name to Joan Weill-Paul Smith's College, a change that would have violated Phelps Smith's founding bequest, which required that the school be "forever known" as Paul Smith's College of Arts and Sciences. Justice John T. Ellis of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the college could not be renamed, and the proposed donation was withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Campus life ==
[[Image:Lower St Regis Lake from Paul Smiths College.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lower St. Regis Lake]] from the College]]

Most of the college population lives on campus.  Residence halls are divided by class. Freshmen halls include Lydia Martin Smith Hall, Currier Hall, and Lakeside Hall. Incoming transfer students are housed in Franklin Hall. Upperclassmen share Essex, Clinton, Lambert, Blum House, Overlook, Saratoga, Alumni, Upper St. Regis, Lower St. Regis, and Hillside halls. Overlook Hall was opened in 2011 as a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED-certified]] "green" dorm for upper-classmen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/slh/residence_life/housing.php?type=current |title=Residence Hall Living |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219195326/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/slh/residence_life/housing.php?type=current |archive-date=2012-02-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Smith's rural location lends itself to many campus-based activities. Student-directed clubs administrated under the Office of Student Activities include fishing and hunting, Artisans' club, Outing club, Students for Environmental Action, Society of American Foresters, the Wildlife Society, Student Government Association, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Ski and Snowboard Club, Gaming club, Fish and Game Club, and Mycology club, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/slh/student_activities/clubs&amp;orgs.php?type=current |title=Clubs &amp; Organizations |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219195341/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/slh/student_activities/clubs%26orgs.php?type=current |archive-date=2012-02-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is located on Lower St. Regis Lake. Students have a beach, as well as docks and storage for canoes and kayaks.

The Lakeside Dining Hall is operated by [[Sodexo|Sodexo food service]].  A.P. Smith's bakery in Cantwell Hall opens a few days a semester to sell student-produced baked goods.

== Sports ==
The college raises a variety of sports teams from the school's general population, including basketball, soccer, rugby, bowling, and cross-country. Most are under the direction of administrative staff and faculty.

The college also offers sports programs reflecting its outdoor character, such as snowshoe racing, coed woodsmen's teams, and canoe racing.&lt;ref name="paulsmiths1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/timber/home.php |title=Woodsmen's Team |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103203028/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/timber/home.php |archive-date=2012-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the warmer months students may rent canoes to use on Lower Saint Regis Lake, located on the southern side of campus.

The newly renovated Saunders Sports Complex houses the Bobcat fitness center, a gymnasium, dance studio, and campus pool.  It is home to the school's [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] and dive training programs, the kayaking club's whitewater training, and log birling practice, an event in [[woodsman]] [[lumberjack sports]] competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/recreation.php |title=Recreational Programs |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103203033/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/recreation.php |archive-date=2012-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility is open to the general public for a nominal fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/facilities.php |title=Facilities Operation |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103203019/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/facilities.php |archive-date=2012-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|32|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall climbing wall was opened in the adjacent Buxton Annex gymnasium in 2010.

Timbersports take place in both Fall and Spring semesters, with teams practicing every month of the school year.  Events include pole climbing,  log birling, chopping, splitting, sawing, pulp toss, ax-throw, and pack-board relay.

The Paul Smith's woodsmen's team's nine-year winning streak (from 1957-1966) in the sport's biggest event, the Spring Meet, is the longest in the history of intercollegiate lumberjack competition.&lt;ref name="paulsmiths1"/&gt; The school's highly regarded squad travels to meets throughout the Northeast and Ontario, Canada.

Both the men and women's soccer teams at Paul Smith's compete in an annual rivalry game with the teams from SUNY-ESF ([[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry]]), known as the Barkeater Cup. The PSC men's soccer team won the Cup in 2014. Men's and woem's team participate in the Yankee Small College Conference regionally, and the USCAA on a national level.

'''RV ''Rachel Carson''''' is a research vessel owned and operated by the [[University of Maryland]]'s Center for Environmental Science, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]].

The 81-foot aluminum-hulled vessel is an extended and modified Challenger class fast research vessel, designed by marine architect Roger Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |title=Research Vessel Design |work=JMS Naval Architects &amp; Salvage Engineers |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107205725/http://jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |archivedate=7 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is equipped with twin 1,200 horsepower diesel engines and water jet drives which give a maximum speed of 24 knots. A [[Dynamic positioning|dynamic positioning system]] automatically maintains the vessel's position.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

The ship was built by [[Hike Metal Products]] of [[Wheatley, Ontario]],&lt;ref name="umces"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.umces.edu/research-discovery/rv-rachel-carson |title=The R/V Rachel Carson |work=University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of $4.6 million, and christened by [[Katie O'Malley]] on November 16, 2008, at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/CQ/V07N4/side3/ |title=New R/V Rachel Carson Commissioned |work=Chesapeake Quarterly |year=2008 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rachel Carson'' has operated in [[Chesapeake Bay]] since early 2009, teaching estuarine sampling techniques, carrying out water quality surveys, [[plankton]] collection, [[Box corer|box coring]] operations, and deploying instrument packages.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

[[Image:roberto busa e index thomisticus.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Roberto Busa - 2006 - In the background the Index Thomisticus]]

==Biography==
Born in [[Vicenza]], the second of five children, he attended primary school in [[Bolzano]] and grammar school in [[Verona]] and in [[Belluno]]. In 1928 he entered the Episcopal Seminary of Belluno, completing high school there, and took the first two-year course of Theology with Albino Luciani, the future [[Pope John Paul I]]. In 1933 he joined the [[Society of Jesus]], where he got a diploma in Philosophy in 1937 and one in Theology in 1941 and where he was ordained priest in 1940. From 1940 till 1943 he was an auxiliary army chaplain in the National Army and later in the partisan forces. In 1946 he graduated in Philosophy at the Papal Gregorian University of Rome with a degree thesis entitled "The Thomistic Terminology of Interiority", which was published in 1949. He was full professor of [[Ontology]], [[Theodicy]] and [[Scientific methodology|Scientific Methodology]] and, for some years, a librarian in the "Aloisianum" Faculty of Philosophy of [[Gallarate]].

==The ''Index Thomisticus''==
In 1946 he planned the ''Index Thomisticus'', as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. In 1949 he met with [[Thomas J. Watson]], the founder of [[IBM]], and was able to persuade him to sponsor the ''Index Thomisticus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project lasted about 30 years, and eventually produced in the 1970s the 56 printed volumes of the ''Index Thomisticus''. In 1989, a CD-ROM version was produced. In addition, in 2005 a [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age web-based version] made its debut, sponsored by the Fundación Tomás de Aquino and CAEL; the design and programming of this version were carried about by E. Alarcón and E. Bernot, in collaboration with Busa. In 2006 the [http://itreebank.marginalia.it ''Index Thomisticus'' Treebank] project (directed by Marco Passarotti) started the syntactic annotation of the entire corpus.

==The Busa Prize==
The [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) awards the "Busa Prize", which honors leaders in the field of [[digital humanities|humanities computing]]. The
first Busa Prize was awarded in 1998 to Busa himself. Later winners include:  

* John Burrows (Australia) (presented in 2001, New York, New York, USA)
* [[Susan Hockey]] (UK) (presented in 2004, Gothenburg, Sweden)
* Wilhelm Ott (Germany) (2007, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, USA)

==Recent projects==
Before his death, Busa had been teaching at the Papal [[Gregorian University]] in Rome, at the "Aloisianum" Faculty of Philosophy in [[Gallarate]], and at the Catholic Sacred Heart University in [[Milan]]. He was also working at the LTB project (LTB stands for Bicultural Thomistic Lexicon), which aims at understanding the Latin concepts used by Thomas Aquinas in the terms of contemporary culture.

'''Sonari''' is the archaeological site of an ancient monastic complex of [[Buddhist]] [[stupa]]s. The site, positioned on a hill, is located about 10km southwest of [[Sanchi]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name = "ASI"&gt; [http://www.asibhopal.nic.in/monument/raisen_Sonari_buddhistacentland.html ASI Sonari page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The stupas were excavated around 1850 by [[Alexander Cunningham]], who discovered two boxes containing relics.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019wdz000000546u00003a00.html British Library Online] &lt;/ref&gt; One of the reliquaries, which is very ornate, is visible nowadays at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

The reliquary of Stupa No.2 presents has inscriptions in [[Brahmi]] mentioning the names of Buddhist monks also appearing in the reliquary of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] and [[Andher Stupas]]: Kasapagota, Majjhima, Kosikiputa, Gotiputa, and Apagira.&lt;ref name = "BA"&gt; Huu Phuoc's Buddhist Architecture The [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA148 p.148] &lt;/ref&gt; It would seem, then, that the ashes of these monks were divided between these three stupas.

The date of construction of Stupa 1 and Stupa 2 must therefore be equivalent to those of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]], i.e. 125-100 BCE.&lt;Ref name = "BA"/&gt;

There are in all four groups of stupas surrounding Sanchi within a radius of twenty kilometers: Bhojpur and Andher to the southeast, Sonari to the southwest, and Satdhara in the west. &lt;ref name ="BC"&gt; Buddhist Circuit in Central India: Sanchi, Satdhara, Sonari, Andher, Travel ... [https://books.google.fr/books?id=TOrKExVXXpkC&amp;pg=PT3&amp; p31 &lt;/ref&gt; Further south, about 100 km away, is [[Saru Maru]].

==Stupa No.1==
Alexander Cunningham and FC Maisey searched Sonari's Stupa 1 in 1851. The stupa contained a miniature soapstone reliquary.

[[File:Sonari Stupa 2 reliquary.jpg|thumb|The main reliquary of Stupa No.2 at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O25176/reliquary-unknown/].]]
Alexander Cunningham and FC Maisey searched Sonari's Stupa No.2 in 1851. The stupa contained three miniature reliquaries, two in soapstone and one in rock crystal, as well as a certain amount of bone ash and a piece of wood. The main reliquary is shaped to resemble a [[Lotus (plant)|lotus]] bud, with incised petals decorating the lower half of the reliquary. It was turned on a [[lathe]] and then carved in [[bas-relief]] with lotus petal strips on the shoulder and lower body, while on the upper body is a large area divided into eight rectangular compartments in each of which are an elephant, horse, deer or winged lion, patterns typical of the period of the [[Maurya Empire]]. These discoveries were published by A Cunningham in ''The Bhilsa Topes'' in 1854.&lt;ref name = "VA"&gt; Notice from [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O25176/reliquary-unknown/] &lt;/ref&gt;

It had been customary since the death of the Buddha to preserve and venerate his relics. Under emperor [[Ashoka]] (around 268-233 BCE), converted to Buddhism and energetic protector of the faith, a series of stupas, mounds of relics, were erected throughout the empire, marking sites important in the life of the Buddha. This practice continued, and this container of relics was buried around 200 BCE. Relic deposits of this period usually represented original deposits of the relics of the Buddha.&lt;ref name = "VA"/&gt;

A '''troop density''' ({{lang-ru|Плотность войск}}) also known as the ''dispersion factor'' in [[military science]] is a [[Statistics#Experimental and observational studies|statistical value]] assigned by commanders during the [[combat operations process]] in considering the ability of the [[Combat Arms]] to achieve [[Goal|military objectives]] during a [[military operation]]. It reflects [[combat readiness]] of the [[unit (military)|units]] to participate in [[engagement (military)|engagements]] with consideration to the [[Tactical Area of Responsibility|terrain]] and expected enemy strength.

The [[Units of measurement|unit of measurement]] is square metres per [[soldier]], although this is modified for each combat arm to reflect their primary [[weapon performance]] in combat as [[weapon density]] ({{lang-ru|Плотность оружия}});&lt;ref&gt;cf.p.243, Naveh&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[artillery|guns]] for artillery.&lt;ref&gt;pp.84-85, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; Troop density is also used to [[Intelligence analysis|estimate]] forces required to occupy a given populated territory in order to deny this population to being exploited by the enemy [[Covert operation|covert forces]] or insurgent troops.&lt;ref&gt;p.16, McGrath&lt;/ref&gt;

The troop density has decreased through [[military history]] in proportion to the increase in [[weapon lethality|lethality of weapons]] being use in combat.&lt;ref&gt;pp.84-85, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no accepted standard to calculate this value due to the large number of variables involved in the planning of combat operations.&lt;ref&gt;p.93, McGrath&lt;/ref&gt;

Military history can be divided into three periods according to ''average troop density'' employed in [[combat]]: ancient armies with about 10 square metres per foot soldier, the age of [[close order formation]] armed with firearms encompassing the period from the 1650s to the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1871 that increased the average to 250 square meters per [[infantryman]], and the [[Second World War]] when the density decreased to 27,500 square metres per [[infantryman]].&lt;ref&gt;p.84, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Army]] has based much of its post-war doctrine on the war experience, and had devoted considerable resources to the analysis of troop density, including these in almost all considerations of wartime operations.&lt;ref&gt;for example during strategic offensives to liberate Poland, p.295, Chaney&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[Cold War]] the density (in Europe) was estimated to be 50,000 square metres per [[infantryman]] due to widespread [[mechanised infantry|mechanisation]] of forces.&lt;ref&gt;p.84, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt;

Troop density was included in the [[Military doctrine|doctrine]] of the [[First World War]] belligerents, based on the [[battalion]] per [[forward zone]] front calculation.&lt;ref&gt;p.216, Samuels&lt;/ref&gt; The density of troops also affects the planning of [[close air support]] operations because of the higher rate of missions required to deliver adequate munitions to their targets.&lt;ref&gt;p.123, Brown&lt;/ref&gt; The increased dispersal of troops was the consideration behind the decision to develop [[nuclear bomb]]s before effects of radiation were realised.&lt;ref&gt;p.65, Bellamy&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical density of troops in the area of combat is not reflective of the average value for any given [[Command (military formation)|command]] because dispersion of troops tends to follow [[terrain]] and [[military tactics|tactical]] considerations of the combat planning, and actual location of troops tends to be in clusters of [[position (military)|positions]].&lt;ref&gt;p.191, Hughes&lt;/ref&gt; Low troop density is a particular problem as a period of vulnerability during [[air assault]], [[air landing]], [[amphibious assault]] and to some extent [[airborne assault]] operations,&lt;ref&gt;p.32, McCall &amp; Corder&lt;/ref&gt; as well as during pre-combat concentration of troops in the [[staging area]] prior to their movement to the battle area, denying them [[operational mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;p.64, National Research Council&lt;/ref&gt;
