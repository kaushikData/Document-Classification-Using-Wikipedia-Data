Adaptive Physical Education (APE) is a physical education program that accommodates the needs of students with disabilities, that may include or be a combination of mobility or physical impairments, sensory impairments, intellectual disabilities, emotional or behavioural disorders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health and Physical Education: Rationale - The Australian Curriculum v7.5|url = http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/health-and-physical-education/rationale|website = www.australiancurriculum.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Greenwood Dictionary of Education (2nd Edition)|last = Collins|first = J.W.|publisher = Praeger|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Westport, CT|pages = |url = http://www.ebrary.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au|last2 = O'Brien|first2 = N.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical education is important for the health and wellbeing of everyone, regardless of disabilities or not. APE programs are vital in maintaining and enhancing the quality of life for people with disabilities.

Australia’s physical education curriculum for adaptive students is currently the same as students without disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Australian education institutions are required by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] and the [https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education Disability Standards for Education 2005] to instruct physical education to students with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Adaptive physical education evolved from medical treatments that were designed to cope with disabilities. In 1838, [[Perkins School for the Blind|Perkins School]] located in Boston, Massachusetts, an educational institute for visually impaired students, began introducing physical education programs for their students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Adapted Physical Education and Sport|last = Winnick|first = J.P.|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2011|isbn = 9780736089180|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s, the [[Ohio School for the Deaf|Ohio school for the Deaf]] instituted organised sports into the school for their students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Pehr Henrik Ling]], who founded the [http://www.gih.se/in-english/ Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences] in 1813 in Stockholm, Sweden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gih.se/in-english/|title = GIH The Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences: In English|date = |accessdate = |website = GIH The Swedish School of Sports and Health Sciences|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed medical gymnastic programs for people with disabilities in 1884.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Legislation ==
The legislation for the APE in Australia is as follows:
* [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] provides protection against any person that is discriminated against because of a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.humanrights.gov.au/dda-guide-whats-it-all-about|title = D.D.A guide: What's it all about|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Human Rights Commission|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education Disability Standards for Education 2005] defines the responsibilities of educational institutions for students with disabilities. It also ensures that students with disabilities have access and are engaging in education on the same basis as students without disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://education.gov.au/disability-standards-education|title = Disability Standards for Education|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Government Department of Education and Training|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impairments and Disabilities ==

=== Mobility or Physical Impairments ===

==== Cerebral Palsy ====
* Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affects a person's motor control areas in the brain that hinders their ability to move. It can affect one or more body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cerebralpalsy.org.au/what-is-cerebral-palsy/|title = What is cerebral palsy?|date = |accessdate = |website = Cerebral Palsy Alliance|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Brain Injury.jpg|thumb|Brain Injury]] --&gt;

==== Brain Injuries ====
* Brain injuries are injuries that diminish or impair physical, cognitive, social, behaviour or emotional functions of a person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Spinal Cord Disabilities ====
* Spinal cord disabilities are damage to the vertebrae or nerves of the spinal column resulting from disease or injury. Spinal cord injuries are generally associated with a degree of [[paralysis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Muscular, Joint, &amp; Central nervous system (CNS) Disabilities ====
* Muscular, joint, and CNS disabilities are generally progressive and degenerative diseases. They can cause atrophied muscles, reduce motor skills, shorten range of motion and hinder the ability to perform physical activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
** [[Muscular dystrophy]] is a genetically inherited disease characterised by a progressive spread of weakness through various muscle groups or motor neurones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mda.org.au/Disorders/Overview.asp|title = What are muscular dystrophies and neuromuscular conditions?|date = |accessdate = |website = Muscular Dystrophy Australia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory Impairments ===

==== Visual impairments ====
* Visual impairments as defined by the [[Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children]] (RIDBC) as a limitation to one or more functions of the eye or visual systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ridbc.org.au/blindness|title = Vision|date = |accessdate = |website = The Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deaf ====
* Deaf is severe or profound hearing loss that causes insufficient comprehension of auditory information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deafblind ====
* The [http://www.deafblind.org.au Australia Deafblind Council] (ADBC) defines deafblindness as an isolated sensory disability that results in a combination of loss to both vision and hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.deafblind.org.au|title = What is deafblindness?|date = |accessdate = |website = Australian Deafblind Council|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual Disabilities &amp; Emotional, Developmental and Behavioural Disorders ===
* Intellectual disabilities are defined, by the [http://aaidd.org American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD)], as a serious impediment of intellectual functioning and the ability to adapt behaviour in both social and practical skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aaidd.org/intellectual-disability/definition#.VeV4D85UTsk|title = Definition of Intellectual Disability|date = |accessdate = |website = American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]] is a genetic condition that causes developmental, intellectual and physical disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.downsyndromevictoria.org.au/DSAV/Information/About_Down_syndrome/What_is_Down_syndrome/DSAV/information/What_is_Down_syndrome.aspx?hkey=8593b017-ec7a-47f1-b949-e7e9801b4c39|title = What is Down Syndrome?|date = |accessdate = |website = Down Syndrome Victoria|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Emotional and behavioural disorders are generally labeled as having disruptive hyperactive, distracting, withdrawn and/or impetuous behaviour tendencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These emotional and behavioural disorders can hinder and negatively affect a student's educational capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
** [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s are developmental disabilities that affect how persons interact with their environment and the people around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.autismspectrum.org.au/content/what-autism|title = What is Autism|date = |accessdate = |website = Autism Spectrum|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disability Specific Guidelines for Instruction of APE ===
Impairments and disabilities for APE students can vary or may even coexist with more than one disability. A students physical capabilities in APE will depend on their impairment or disability. These impairments and/or disabilities need to be addressed in the design of the students APE curriculum by their teachers or instructors of APE to ensure that the student is receiving the most beneficial physical educational program.

=== Mobility Impairments ===
[[File:ParalympicsGB preparing for their 7-a-side game (9375546563).jpg|thumb|People with Cerebral Palsy competing in the Paralympic Games]]

==== Cerebral Palsy ====
* Students with cerebral palsy should carryout moderate aerobic activity for body composition and musculoskeletal functioning. Strength and flexibility training should be focused on maintaining a balance between flexor and extensor muscles. Motor coordination for students with cerebral palsy can be difficult, so balance and body coordination should be integrated into their APE program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Brain Injuries ====
* Students of APE that have sustained brain injuries will commonly display balance problems and weak muscle movement. These students need to maintain moderate aerobic activity for body composition and musculoskeletal functioning. Strength training should be integrated to improve muscle weakness and motor control skills may need to be relearned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Spinal Cord Disabilities ====
* Depending on the type of spinal cord disability that a student displays, will determine the type activities that are included in their APE program. Regardless of their spinal cord disability, these students need to engage in APE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Muscular, Joint, &amp; Central Nervous System (CNS) disabilities ====
* Students that have muscular, joint, or CNS disabilities need to engage in strength training and endurance activities for as long as capably possible, due to the progressive nature of these disabilities. The APE teacher should ensure that an adequate warm-up and cool-down focusing on flexibility are performed by the students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sensory Impairments ===

==== Visual impairments ====
* Students with visual impairments have the capabilities to perform all the same physical activities as students without these impairments. However, due to lack or loss of vision, adaptations to some physical activities will need to be made for these students. Depending on the extent of their impairment, APE teachers can introduce bright colours balls or use audial cues to direct the students in physical activities. APE programs for these students should include open sports where there are changing variables, and closed sports where the activity is consistent and predictable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deaf ====
* Students that are deaf have no limitations to their physical capabilities. However, communication skills will need to be adapted for their impairment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Deafblind ====
* Students that have deafblindness have the ability to perform same physical activities as students without deafblindness. However, due to their impairment, adaptations that are used for blind and deaf students will need to be implemented into their APE program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Intellectual Disabilities &amp; Emotional and Behavioural Disorders ===
Students with intellectual disabilities need to have APE programs that are appropriately designed and take into consideration their academic, physical, motor, social and emotional skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Students with emotional and behavioural disorders can create instructional dilemmas for APE teachers. Ideas for managing and instructing APE to these students are to have interpersonal communication, active listening, verbal mediation and conflict resolution schemes incorporated into the students physical education program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:JBLM hosts Special Olympics 140530-A-QM563-008.jpg|thumb|Down Syndrome students competing in Special Olympics]]

==== Down Syndrome ====
* Students with Down Syndrome that participate in APE need medical clearance due to the many medical problems they face. However they should still engage in aerobic activities, muscle strengthening, motor control skills, and balance building activities. Adapted equipment can be used to engage students in these activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Autism spectrum disorder ====
* Students that have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder do not necessarily need to be in an APE program. However, if it is decided that they need to participate in an APE program, the APE teacher needs to respond to the individual needs required by that student, which maybe one-on-one instruction. These students should engage in as much of the required PE curriculum as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3335">The '''Alien Flight Student Program''' is a program operated by the United States [[Transportation Security Administration]] to screen prospective flight student candidates who are not citizens of the United States, before they are allowed to undergo [[Pilot certification in the United States|pilot training]].  This program was created in response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], in recognition of the fact that the individuals who piloted the hijacked aircraft first learned to fly at US flight schools.

The mission of the program is to ensure that foreign students seeking training at flight schools regulated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) do not pose a threat to aviation or national security.  Section 612 of the Vision 100 – Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Public Law 108-176, December 12, 2003) prohibits flight schools regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from providing flight training to a foreign student unless the [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] first determines that the student does not pose a threat to aviation or national security. Vision 100 transferred responsibility for conducting security [[threat assessment]]s for foreign students seeking flight training from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. On September 20, 2004, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued an interim final rule establishing the Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP).

Persons seeking flight training must submit a request if they are not citizens or nationals of the U.S. and:

*They wish to receive flight training in the U.S. or its territories, regardless of whether training will lead to an FAA certificate or type rating; and/or
*They wish to receive flight training from an FAA-certificated facility, provider, or instructor that could lead to an FAA rating whether in the U.S. or abroad.

(NOTE-Certain exemptions to AFSP published in 2004 and 2005 are still in effect.)

The rule as written has a broad scope, and at first seemed to pilots to extend to required regular flight reviews as well proficiency training given to non-citizen private pilots. After consultation with the pilot community, the TSA issued clarifications restricting the scope of the program: for example, in small airplanes, it only applies to pilots undergoing training for an initial [[Pilot certification in the United States|certificate]], a multi-engine rating, or an [[Instrument Rating in the United States|instrument rating]][https://web.archive.org/web/20060614003215/http://aopa2.org/tsa_rule/].

Candidates log onto the [http://www.flightschoolcandidates.gov AFSP Candidate website] to submit their background information and flight training request(s). Once the application process is completed, the AFSP performs a security [[threat assessment]] to determine whether the Candidate poses a threat to aviation or national security.

== Biography ==
{{quotebox|align = left|width=21em|''[[Mohiniyattam]] is one of the eight Indian classical dance forms recognized by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]]. The term Mohiniyattam comes from the words "Mohini" (meaning a woman who enchants onlookers) and "attam" (meaning graceful and sensuous body movements). The word "Mohiniyattam" literally means "dance of the enchantress".''&lt;ref name="Mohiniyattam-2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mohiniyattam.de/en/mohiniyattam | title=Mohiniyattam | publisher=Mohiniyattam.de | date=2015 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Legacy ==
Moving to New Delhi, Shivaji founded the dance academy, ''Center for Mohiniyattom'', a dedicated facility for promoting the dance form. She is known to have contributed to the evolution of the dance tradition,&lt;ref name="Padmashri Bharati Shivaji" /&gt; by adding more languor to the already languorous discipline,&lt;ref name="Bound to Kerala by Mohiniyattam" /&gt; and by adapting it to other dance forms such as ballet; her Mohiniyattom adaptation of the [[Swan Lake]] of [[Tchaikovsky]], choreographed along with her daughter, Vijayalakshmi, is one such effort.&lt;ref name="The power of grace"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theacorn.com/news/2014-06-26/Community/The_power_of_grace.html | title=The power of grace | publisher=The Acorn | date=2015 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her productions include adaptations of ''Bhanusinger Padavali'' of [[Rabindranath Tagore]],&lt;ref name="A seeker’s odyssey"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/a-seekers-odyssey/article7109601.ece | title=A seeker’s odyssey | newspaper=The Hindu | date=16 April 2015 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chandrotsavam'' of the [[Manipravalam]], ''Somastuthi'' from the [[Rig Veda]], and the ''Devagita'', from [[Ashtapadi]].&lt;ref name="Classical Dancers of India" /&gt; She is known to have incorporated postures, movements and music from other Traditional art forms of Kerala such as [[Ottamthullal]], [[Kaikottikali]], [[Thayambaka]] and [[Krishnanattam]] into Mohiniyattom, a legacy from her tutelage under [[Kavalam Narayana Panicker]].&lt;ref name="Mohiniattam Style"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.kuchipudi.ru/mohini_e.htm | title=Mohiniattam Style | publisher=Kuchipudi | date=2015 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Shivaji published his first book, Art of ''Mohiniyattam'', co-authored by Avinash Pasricha.&lt;ref name="Art of Mohiniyattam" /&gt; The book documents her researches under Sangeet Natak Akademi fellowship and a subsequent senior fellowship from the Department of Culture under the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] and is a reference book on the subject.&lt;ref name="Padmashri Bharati Shivaji" /&gt; She published another book, ''Mohiniyattam'', co-written by her daughter, Vijayalakshmi, herself a noted Mohiniyattom performer, in 2003.&lt;ref name="Mohiniyattam" /&gt; The book deals with the history and evolution of the art form and comments about the styles and techniques, repertoire, music, costumes and jewellery associated with it.&lt;ref name="Mohiniyattam (Bharati Shivaji and Vijayalakshmi)" /&gt; She has performed on several stages in India&lt;ref name="BVB celebrates Munshi’s birthday"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bvb-celebrates-munshi-s-birthday/story-U3kKcpLyDKFSrabe3isAZJ.html | title=BVB celebrates Munshi’s birthday | newspaper=Hindustan Times | date=7 May 2013 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bharati Shivaji to perform today"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20021019/cth2.htm | title=Bharati Shivaji to perform today | publisher=Tribune | date=18 October 2002 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abroad&lt;ref name="Bollywood meets Holyrood"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/aug/22/artsfeatures.bollywood | title=Bollywood meets Holyrood | newspaper=Guardian | date=22 August 2002 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has taught many Indian and foreign students.&lt;ref name="Russian belle dons role of Radha in Kerala’s Mohiniattam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.southasiamail.com/news.php?id=98165 | title=Russian belle dons role of Radha in Kerala’s Mohiniattam | publisher=South Asia Mail | date=30 April 2008 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also continues her research by visiting temples and gives lecture-demonstrations on the dance form at conferences and seminars.&lt;ref name="A seeker’s odyssey" /&gt;

'''''Bli Sodot''''' ({{lang-he-n|בְּלִי
סוֹדוֹת}} lit. ''Without Secrets''), is an educational television show broadcast on ''[[Israeli Educational Television]]'' during the years 1983&amp;ndash;1986 and on reruns during the mid-1990s. The show was intended for lower grades of [[Elementary school|Elementary]], seeking to help with their reading. The show was incorporated as an integral part of the school curriculum and was even accompanied by 10 study booklets and five enrichment booklets, published by the Center for Educational Technology (CET).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.23tv.co.il/228-he/Tachi.aspx Bli Sodot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730021122/http://www.23tv.co.il/228-he/Tachi.aspx |date=July 30, 2010 }}, on [[Israeli Educational Television]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-of-its-kind educational television broadcasts intended to teach children to read and would visualize to the viewer the process of reading through songs and sketches led by some well-remembered characters such as Gashash Balash ("Probing Detective") and Itonish ("Newspaperman"). The show's hosts [[Hanny Nahmias]], [[Oshik Levi]], [[Nathan Nathanson]], and [[Hanan Goldblatt]], and several other actors who'd participated on the show such as [[Shula Hen]], [[Ofra Haza]], [[Galia Isay]], and [[Matti Sari]]. [[Plasticine]] [[Animation]] clips, introducing the characters  "Alphy" and "Betty", were also featured.

In the days of only one channel, the show received extremely high ratings among children and is considered  one of Israeli Educational Television's classics. Its popularity led to a follow up series called ''BeSod HaInyanim'' ({{lang-he|בסוד הענינים}}) between the years 1991-1992. First graders would watch ''Bli Sodot'' while second graders would watch the ''Besod Ha'inyanim'' follow-up.

The show remains an integral part of Israeli culture, with 39% of elementary schools still using it in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3785/is_200207/ai_n9108047/pg_4 'Spelling acquisition in two social groups: Mother-child interaction, maternal beliefs and child's spelling'] The two schools used a program of reading and writing instruction called "No Secrets" (in Hebrew, "Bli Sodot"), which is employed by approximately 39% of elementary schools in Israel (Ministry of Education, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* Gashash Balash ([[Hanan Goldblatt]])
* Itonaish ([[Nathan Nathanson]])
* Hameltzar HaMuzar lit. The strange waiter (Nathan Nathanson)
* Quiz guides (Hanan Goldblatt &amp;mdash; "Give a name" and "Bli Sodot quiz", and Hanny Nahmias &amp;mdash; "I have a question")
* Flower shop seller ([[Hanny Nahmias]])
* Sports broadcaster ([[Oshik Levi]])
* Professor Yavin (Hanan Goldblatt)
* Word shop seller ([[Hanny Nahmias]])
* Teacher ([[Oshik Levi]])

==Recurring themes==
Episodes of the show were usually constructed with a standardized structure, which included learning of two new letters with similar [[Niqqud]] (Hebrew [[orthography]]).

A standard episode was built with two sketches, one for each letter, where objects are presented to have the learned letter within them, and repetition of the syllable and examples on the use of the letter in the word. On top of the known sketches and characters there were also repeated segments on each chapter intended for memorization of the letter, and several of them became part of Israeli popular culture.

* Three squares with one syllable and another square with an extra syllable are positioned on both sides of Itonaish, and he must identify the one which doesn't fit, sometimes with the aid of his friends.
* Two shadows (usually of Hanny Nahmias and a male partner) that would repeat the words learned in the previous sketch while breaking the word into two syllables and repeating it twice. This segment is especially notable as it is one of the show's most recognized segments. Breaking a word into its syllabic component and repeating it with different tones is an identifying mark of the Bli Sodot show.
* Alphy's plasticine character creates the words learned in a previous sketch. Children read out the word, but in some cases the plasticine character moves to remove the niqqud, an act which leads the voices to call out ''"What is he/she doing? How can you read that? Ahh, X stays as X!"'' (where X is the learned word) This repetition is also considered an identifiable part of the show.
* At the end of an episode, the characters come out from the last/previous aired sketch and walk into the studio that sometimes still has stage props from the first sketch of the show.

A '''Bridge program''' is a formal partnership between two post-secondary [[university|institutions]] that provides students with advanced standing in a degree program at one institution as recognition of previous academic experience in a similar field of study at another institution. Typically, a bridge program student holds a two-year college degree, and is seeking advancement in their profession by obtaining a four-year or graduate degree.

This differs from Bridging Programs offered by [[Ontario colleges]] for newcomers to the country. For example, [[Humber College]] in Toronto offers Bridging Programs for Internationally-Trained Engineers and IT Professionals, who are recent immigrants to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridging Programs for Internationally Trained Professionals|url=http://newtocanada.humber.ca/bridging-programs.html||publisher=Humber College|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are short-term technical programs offered to professionals who already possess a minimum of a bachelor's degree. These programs "bridge" the gap between a newcomer's prior experience and their future employment in Canada.

Most bridge programs can be categorized into three types of agreements:&lt;ref&gt;Boggs &amp; Trick, 2009, p.5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bilateral''': An agreement outlined between two institutions and two specific programs of similar content. Students are permitted to use some of their initial credits toward the completion of another program at the partner institution. Example: Seneca/York Joint Degrees

'''Multilateral''': An agreement between one institution and several institutions that offer related programs of interest. The completion of one program will directly lead to a specific degree program. Example: The completion of any Ontario Public College Recreation and Leisure Services Diploma and entrance to [[Brock University]]’s Bachelor of Recreation and Leisure Studies

'''Concurrent''': A collaborative agreement between two institutions, whereby students will work toward two sets of qualifications (such as a diploma and a degree) at the same time, and on the same campus. Example: [[University of Guelph-Humber]].

==History of Bridge Programs in Ontario==
The College University Consortium Council (CUCC) was created in 1996 by the [[Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities]] as an advisory body to help devise direct transfer routes between post-secondary institutions for all Ontario students. Its mission statement specifies that the main objective of the council is to “facilitate, promote and coordinate joint education and training ventures that will: aid the transfer of students from sector to sector; facilitate the creation of joint programs between colleges and universities; and further the development of a more seamless continuum of post-secondary education in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the council is voluntary for all post-secondary institutions, but is highly encouraged. While the CUCC aims to help institutions create bridge programs, it still maintains that colleges and universities have full autonomy on the specifics of the agreements created.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, 2008, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first projects of the CUCC, was the development of a mutual agreement between Ontario colleges and universities. In 1999, Ontario colleges and universities signed the Ontario College-University Degree Completion Accord (Port Hope Accord), which solidified their commitment to create province-wide agreements to help college graduates enter university programs. This Accord was a monumental achievement, as it explicitly stated that a three year college diploma program should provide a student with a minimum of eleven transfer credits (equivalent to at least 2 years of study) toward a four year bachelor’s degree, and a two year diploma program should allow the student to earn six to eight university transfer credits toward a degree (equivalent to 1 or 1.5 years). These minimum requirements were chosen based on the average amount of transfer credits awarded in the past by Registrars’ Offices across Ontario Universities. Within five years of attaining signatures, forty new college-university agreements were made, providing more opportunities for students to attain a comprehensive education.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, 2008, p.2-5&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005 however, the Bob Rae Report declared that “nowhere near enough progress has been made” because student demand for transfer agreements still overpowered the actual number of diploma to degree programs available. The Report suggested that research must be done to link up related programming between institutions into collaborative degree programs, and create more academic pathways for students to achieve their career goals.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs &amp; Trick, 2009, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It also suggested the creation of core, generic courses offered at all institutions that could be instantly transferable in any Ontario diploma or degree program.&lt;ref&gt;Decock,McCloy,Liu,&amp; Hu, 2011, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario was established in the same year as an advisory body to the provincial government, commissioning research on student post-secondary experience and recommendations to improve higher education in Ontario.

To better serve students interested in researching bridge program pathways, the CUCC made information much more accessible by developing the [http://www.ontransfer.ca Ontario College-University Transfer Guide], an online resource that lists existing agreements between institutions that is searchable by program interest, as well as a detailed explanation of transfer credits granted in each agreement. This online guide will help to promote existing bridge programs in Ontario by providing students, guidance councillors, academic advisors, and parents a comprehensive source for all possible degree program pathways. As of October 2010, there were 514 agreements listed.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, 2010, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

In the attempt to make further progress in Ontario’s credit transfer policies, the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities established a new coordinating body in 2011 to replace the CUCC. The Ontario Council for Articulation and Transfer (ONCAT) aims to improve transfer pathways for students by focusing on creating multilateral agreements between institutions to maximize the number of transfer credits earned, and the number of students eligible to enrol in bridge programs. It also pledges to create consistency among programs of similar content in the province to help ease student mobility. ONCAT’s ultimate goal is to create a transfer model framework that grants all college diploma graduates the possibility to begin a degree program without repeating courses of similar content.

==Limitations to the Creation of Bridge Programs==

===Dualistic post-secondary system===
The Ontario college system was created in 1965 as a solution to the growing number of secondary school graduates who could not be sustained by the current post-secondary system. It was developed as a separate pathway from university, with different secondary school prerequisites, that would ultimately lead students to a distinct set of career choices.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Since the inception of the college system, post-secondary education in Ontario has preserved its separate yet parallel tracks, despite changing demands in the workforce. With the shift of the job market toward hiring employees with bachelor or graduate degrees for occupations that previously accepted college diplomas, it is becoming less and less likely for students to enroll in a diploma program if they cannot be guaranteed entry into a bachelor’s program upon completion of their courses.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Creating mutually beneficial bridge programs between colleges and universities may prove to be difficult, as both systems were created and have since progressed as completely separate entities with distinct policies and curriculum to meet the needs of their student body.

===Misconceptions===
Through a series of interviews with senior administrators at colleges and universities throughout Ontario, Danielle Renaud began a preliminary study in the year 2000 to discover the major barriers to collaborative programs between post-secondary institutions. A total of twenty-five colleges and eighteen universities were surveyed. The most commonly perceived obstacle to the creation of bridge programs mentioned by both college and university administrators was the existence of elitist attitudes by some university faculty. The college respondents regarded university faculty as “arrogant” and unapproachable, and did not feel confident that their efforts would be positively received. University respondents echoed this statement, admitting that faculty often viewed college programs as a “lesser education” and that this stereotypical mindset would be difficult to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; University faculty may be hesitant to approach the subject of collaborative agreements with college diploma programs because they do not view it as a relationship that will benefit the reputation of their own institution. They continue to view colleges in their traditional role as a preparation for the workplace, and feel as though they must protect the integrity of a university education by remaining a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many college faculty are also fearful of an impending union with universities, as they are concerned that they will be swallowed by the larger institution and lose their voice in the decision making process. They value their programming and presume that the universities will be unwilling to make compromises when it comes to creating program parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambiguity of Transfer Credit Process===
The ambiguity of the current transfer situation between colleges and universities does not promote the attainment of higher knowledge in a field of study, as many students feel discouraged to continue in their studies when their prior experience is not always fully recognized at the university level. Most current bridge programs were created out of individual efforts of faculty members in specific departments, separate from the institution as a whole. These idiosyncrasies make the transfer process sometimes difficult, as students must navigate inconsistent admissions policies that do not always work in their favour.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most universities will not tell students how many transfer credits they will receive until they have actually applied to the program. Without a uniform system to assess transfer credits, students have no way of predicting how many transfer credits they will receive at each university, or how their diploma program will prepare them for university studies.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disparity in Province-wide Curriculum===
One of the largest impediments to creating comprehensive bridge programs is the fact that there is no standardized curriculum between similar diploma and degree programs in the province. Without a specified standard of practice outlined for certain fields of study, it becomes almost impossible to guarantee the same amount of transfer credits at every Ontario institution, as it is likely that a student may not have completed a specific course that a student at another institution was required to take.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; University officials in Renaud’s study also stated that they did not feel comfortable accepting current college curriculum as an equivalent to the first two years of a bachelor's degree program. They were concerned with the attained education level of the faculty at college campuses, as not all colleges require instructors to possess a Doctorate Degree, or conduct a minimum amount of research.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Although this view can be attributed to the elitist attitudes already discussed above, it does call into question how ONCAT is prepared to roll out consistent transfer policies among institutions without attempting to define definitive credits and features in all fields of study. Colleges and universities may not be open to standardizing the curriculum in their programs, as it would mean that they would need to give up the autonomy they previously enjoyed, and possibly lose distinctive features in their curriculum that helped to recruit students to their specific program.

===Willingness to participate===
Although a formalized agreement would result in more transfer applicants, many university officials are less than keen to sign bridge program agreements with colleges, as it would mean a significant loss of tuition dollars. Without the formalized agreement, transfer students receive on average one year or less worth of credits toward a bachelor's degree. This structure ensures that the student will still likely be enrolled in a university program for at least three years. With the successful creation of province-wide post-secondary agreements, students would attend university for two years, significantly cutting tuition costs. This loss of funding, despite rising enrolment numbers, could result in disaster, as programs could become oversubscribed without adequate financial coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a valid concern that only those universities who are in need of more student applications, such as the small to mid-size universities, will be more willing to cooperate with college programs. Larger institutions that already receive an overwhelming number of high school applicants will be less likely to agree to the lengthy process of creating specialized programs when they can already fill their programs without the extra effort.

==Future direction==
Once again, Ontario is in the midst of an unprecedented increase in the number of post-secondary student applicants that is threatening to overpopulate the current structure of higher education in the province. It is projected that the number of students enrolled in Ontario post-secondary institutions may increase by 100,000 by the year 2021.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs &amp; Trick, 2009, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Much like the climate of 1965, Ontario needs to find another solution to accommodate the demands of these increasing numbers, and bridge programs may be the ideal way to streamline applicants. Bridge programs still meet the increased interest in a university degree, but provide alternate pathways for achieving this degree that will not exceed first year university enrolment allowances.

A more realistic transition from the dualistic post-secondary pathways that currently exist in Ontario, to a collaborative pathway would be to develop a completely new curriculum for the bridge program, rather than trying to fit together already existing diploma and degree programs that were never meant to be connected. Ad hoc committees based on subject discipline should be formed among college and university faculty across the province to share best practices, and develop an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 2009, p.147&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, college and university faculty can work together to create a comprehensive knowledge base that they both believe in, and neither will feel threatened that their existing program will be overshadowed or become obsolete. Having faculty work together to develop curriculum requirements will also hopefully help to abolish stereotypes and the elitist attitudes that were credited as the strongest inhibitor to the creation of bridge programs, and help to build a sense of congeniality among education professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, 2009, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the Ontario Council for Articulation and Transfer and the online Ontario College-University Transfer Guide was definitely a step in the right direction, however the existing agreements listed have a limited scope of program choice, and do not provide a list of guaranteed college credits that can be transferred. The province needs to move toward creating a universal transfer guide that allows students graduating from a diploma program the ability to transfer to any university with a similar degree program by meeting the same requirements for every institution, and receiving the same amount of transfer credits at each institution. This transfer guide should also be easily accessible by students so that they can make informed choices in their course planning and be informed of the number of transfer credits they can receive before they actually apply to an institution. To initiate a move toward universal transfer, the province can first focus on establishing a few core arts and science courses at the college level that would result in direct transfer to university credit at every Ontario university. College faculty can work in conjunction with university faculty to create course curriculum that is comparable to first year general arts and science credits (such as psychology, English, math, history etc.) that the majority of incoming university students are required to take, thus easing the transition process greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 2009, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Ontario should look to the successful practice of post-secondary transfer in other provinces, most notably British Columbia, but also Alberta and New Brunswick, as a framework from which to build a comprehensive transfer program. In these already well-established systems, students are able to transfer credit toward a bachelor's degree from any institution in the province, and know exactly how many transfer credits they will receive before they officially apply to another institution.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 2009, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; While Ontario has a long way to go before reaching this level of compatibility, it can definitely benefit from modeling the degree of government, administrative and faculty coordination evident within the post-secondary systems of the above- mentioned provinces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9095">[[File:Festival of Science in Samara.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Children mix chemicals in test tubes as part of a hands-on chemistry education program in [[Samara]], Russia.]]

'''Chemistry education''' (or '''chemical education''') is the study of the [[teaching]] and [[learning]] of [[chemistry]] in all schools, colleges and universities.  Topics in chemistry education might include understanding how students learn chemistry, how best to teach chemistry, and how to improve learning outcomes by changing [[teaching method]]s and appropriate training of chemistry instructors, within many modes, including classroom lecture, demonstrations, and laboratory activities.  There is a constant need to update the skills of teachers engaged in teaching chemistry, and so chemistry education speaks to this need.

== Theories of education ==
There are at least four different philosophical perspectives that describe how the work in chemistry education is carried out. The first is what one might call a ''practitioner’s perspective'', wherein the individuals who are responsible for teaching chemistry (teachers, instructors, professors) are the ones who ultimately define chemistry education by their actions.

A second perspective is defined by a self-identified group of ''chemical educators'', faculty members and instructors who, as opposed to declaring their primary interest in a typical area of laboratory research ([[organic chemistry|organic]], [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]], [[biochemistry]], etc.), take on an interest in contributing suggestions, essays, observations, and other descriptive reports of practice into the public domain, through journal publications, books, and presentations. Dr. Robert L. Lichter, then-Executive Director of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, speaking in a plenary session at the 16th Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (recent BCCE meetings: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070404104348/http://www.chem.iastate.edu/bcce/],[http://www.chem.purdue.edu/bcce]), posed the question “why do terms like ‘chemical educator’ even exist in higher education, when there is a perfectly respectable term for this activity, namely, ‘chemistry professor.’  One criticism of this view is that few professors bring any formal preparation in or background about education to their jobs, and so lack any professional perspective on the teaching and learning enterprise, particularly discoveries made about effective teaching and how students learn.

A third perspective is ''chemical education research'' (CER).  Following the example of [[physics education]] research (PER), CER tends to take the theories and methods developed in pre-college science education research, which generally takes place in Schools of Education, and applies them to understanding comparable problems in post-secondary settings (in addition to pre-college settings). Like science education researchers, CER practitioners tend to study the teaching practices of others as opposed to focusing on their own classroom practices. Chemical education research is typically carried out ''in situ'' using human subjects from secondary and post-secondary schools. Chemical education research utilizes both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. Quantitative methods typically involve collecting data that can then be analyzed using various statistical methods. Qualitative methods include interviews, observations, journaling, and other methods common to social science research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heady |first1=J.E. |first2=B.P. |last2=Coppola |first3=L.C. |last3=Titterington |chapter=3.

Finally, there is an emergent perspective called ''The [[Scholarship of Teaching and Learning]]'' (SoTL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coppola |first=B.P. |title=The Most Beautiful Theories… |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=84 |issue=12 |pages=1902–11 |year=2007 |doi=10.1021/ed084p1902 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed084p1902|bibcode=2007JChEd..84.1902C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there is debate on how to best define SoTL, one of the primary practices is for mainstream faculty members (organic, inorganic, biochemistry, etc.) to develop a more informed view of their practices, how to carry out research and reflection on their own teaching, and about what constitutes deep understanding in student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coppola |first1=B.P. |last2=Jacobs |first2=D. |chapter=Is the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning New to Chemistry? |editor1-last=Huber |editor1-first=M.T. |editor2-last=Morreale |editor2-first=S. |title=Disciplinary styles in the scholarship of teaching and learning: exploring common ground |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSudAAAAMAAJ |year=2002 |publisher=American Association for Higher Education |isbn=978-1-56377-052-4 |pages=197–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fear of chemistry classes==
[[File:Max Diukin IMG 9178.jpg|alt=An instructor and a student look at clouds of smoke and a bright flame produced on the edge of a table.|thumb|Demonstration in a chemistry class]]

Chemistry courses are required for many university students, especially for students who are studying science.  Some students find chemistry classes and lab work stressful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed077p514|title=Chemophobia in the College Classroom: Extent, Sources, and Student Characteristics|year=2000|last1=Eddy|first1=Roberta M.|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=77|issue=4|pages=514|bibcode=2000JChEd..77..514E}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This anxiety has been called ''chemophobia''.  Fears commonly center on academic performance, the difficulty of learning chemical equations, and fear of getting lab chemicals on the hands.  Women students were more anxious than men.  Previous exposure to learning chemistry was associated with lower anxiety.  See also [[chemophobia]] for aversion to chemical compounds rather than chemistry as a subject in education.

==Academic journals==
There are many journals where papers related to chemistry education can be found or published. Historically, the circulation of many of these journals was limited to the country of publication. Some concentrate on chemistry at different education levels (schools vs. universities) while others cover all education levels. Most of these journals carry a mixture of articles that range from reports on classroom and laboratory practices to educational research.

* [10:51–11:46]&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;He [Donald Trump] already has a record with the tribal nations that is very seriously flawed.&amp;nbsp;[...] he did try to engage in business with our sovereign nations and he tried to shortcut a lot of the policies and procedures.

It's part of the Constitution and he wanted to ignore that. You don't ignore that.&lt;/q&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
During a 2016 interview, Parker described a national restriction on gun possession for those previously charged with [[domestic violence]] as a "necessity" for protecting women.&lt;ref name="ParkerInterviewTYT" /&gt; She also censured [[Donald Trump]]'s [[List of nicknames used by Donald Trump|usage]] of "[[Pocahontas]]" as a nickname for [[Elizabeth Warren]] (who claims [[Cherokee]] and [[Lenape|Delaware]] heritage), which she described as "very insulting"; and Trump's past treatment of [[tribal nation]]s and [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|their sovereignty]] more generally.&lt;ref name="ParkerInterviewTYT" /&gt;

Parker is critical of the US government's current and historic treatment of indigenous populations, comparing [[Native American reservation]]s to "[[concentration camp]]s".&lt;ref name="Lane2018" /&gt;{{rp|211|quote=&lt;!--HTML entities to fix quote display error.--&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#39;Politics aside, the government has kept us [Natives] away on our reservations in these places that are much like concentration camps for many,&amp;#39; she switches between realities fluidly, &amp;#39;we [Americans] don&amp;#39;t know that because we haven&amp;#39;t identified it as such.&amp;#39; She repositions herself again, &amp;#39;we&amp;#39;ve just been told to be happy on the land we have but truly the government put us on these concentration camps. And yeah, it&amp;#39;s a part of our traditional lands,&amp;#39; she recognizes, &amp;#39;but in the mind of the government, "that&amp;#39;s your reservation, stay there!"&amp;nbsp;&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;}}

Regarding the [[traditional knowledge]] of indigenous peoples, especially [[traditional ecological knowledge]] and [[traditional medicine]], Parker supports rules and guidelines which preserve indigenous ways of life and respect the privacy of certain traditions and practices.&lt;ref name="TraditionalKnowledge"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www7.nau.edu/itep/main/tcc/Tribes/tdk_sguard|title=Traditional Knowledge: Safeguarding Indigenous Knowledge|last=Wall|first=Dennis|date=December 2013&lt;!--According to attached PDF; no publication day.--&gt;|department=Tribes &amp; Climate Change (Tribal Climate Change Profile)|website=[[Northern Arizona University]]|publisher=[[Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721181459/https://www7.nau.edu/itep/main/tcc/Tribes/tdk_sguard|archive-date=July 21, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also emphasizes the importance of viewing indigenous knowledge from an indigenous perspective, which may differ from "the Western-science approach" to these issues.&lt;ref name="TraditionalKnowledge" /&gt;

'''''E.O.S.: Earth Orbit Stations''''' is a [[space station]] [[construction and management simulation games|management simulation]] game developed by Karl Buiter,&lt;ref name="giantlist"/&gt; with [[Joe Ybarra]] as producer, for [[Electronic Arts]]. It was released for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple II]] in 1987.

==Gameplay==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

The game focuses on both the material and economic challenges of building a permanent, fully functioning space station in [[geocentric orbit]].

The game was set in 1996, and the player is given various selected scenarios to fulfill, from mundane tasks such as setting up a simple space station to developing and supplying a specified amount of high-grade, [[zero G]] [[pharmaceutical]]s to being the first to contact alien life. The game also is a cutthroat strategy game in multiplayer, as players compete over finite resources and resource management.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1987 gave the game a mixed review. While the single-player portion was praised, the review felt the game had too high a learning curve to be really suitable for multiplayer. The user interface was particularly bothersome, described as "a textbook case of how ''not'' to design a window/menu/graphics interface." The documentation was similarly described as poorly organized and cryptic.&lt;ref name = "CGW"&gt;{{citation | date = October 1987 | last = Williams | first = Gregg | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Earth Orbit Stations  | pages = 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games the magazine gave the title two-plus stars of five, calling it "An interesting failure ... the logistics just are not that much fun".&lt;ref name="brooks199211"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=100 | title=Strategy &amp; Wargames: The Future (2000-....) | work=Computer Gaming World | date= November 1992 | accessdate=4 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M.

[[Image:Lycéens kati.jpg|thumb|300px|A school in [[Kati]], [[Mali]].]]
Public '''education in [[Mali]]''' is, in principle, provided free of charge and is compulsory for nine years between the ages of 7 and 16.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Mali.pdf Mali country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; The system encompasses six years of [[primary education]] beginning at age seven, followed by six years of [[secondary education]], generally divided into two three-year cycles.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; 

Mali’s primary school enrollment rate is low, in large part because families are unable to cover the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and other fees required to attend public school.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; 

==Primary education==
[[File:Écolier.jpg|thumb|300px|A maths lesson.]]

In the 2000–01 school year, primary school enrollment was estimated to include only 61 percent of the appropriate age-group (71 percent of males and 51 percent of females).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; The primary school completion rate is also low: only 36 percent of students in 2003 (and lower for females).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; The majority of students reportedly leave school by age 12.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; The secondary school enrollment rate in the late 1990s was 15 percent (20 percent for males and 10 percent for females).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Government expenditures on education in 2000 constituted about 15.6 percent of total government expenditures and about 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; According to Malian government estimates for the 2003–04 school year, Mali had 318 pre-primary institutions with 971 teachers and 35,000 students; 8,714 general primary and secondary institutions with 36,064 teachers and 1,650,803 students; and 37,635 students in tertiary institutions.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; The education system is plagued by a lack of schools in rural areas, as well as shortages of teachers and materials.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Secondary education==
Increased spending on primary education, especially for children in rural areas and girls, has had the unintended effect of overtaxing the secondary school system.  At the end of their primary schooling, students may take entrance exams for secondary school admissions, called the ''diplôme d’étude fondamentale'' (Fundamental Studies Diploma or DEF).  In 2008 more than 80,000 students passed these exams, yet around 17,000—40% of whom were girls—were denied placement in secondary schools.&lt;ref name=irin0209&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=82801 MALI: Students left behind in race for education MDG].  IRIN/United Nations.  6 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;   While the government contends these students should be placed in limited places based on their diploma, their age, and their academic history, some Malians contend that gender discrimination plays a role in denying spots to girls.&lt;ref name=irin0209 /&gt;  

The government has stressed primary education funding, hoping to reach universal primary education by 2015 in line with the international [[Millennium Development Goals]], but the Basic Education Minister of Mali says that this has overtaxed the secondary school system.&lt;ref name=irin0209 /&gt;  The government reported that from 2002 to 2007, the percentage of girls enrolled in primary school increased from 56 percent to 68 percent and boys from 78 percent to 88 percent.&lt;ref name=irin0209 /&gt; 

At the same time the government estimates 35 percent of primary school students in the 2010 graduating class will not meet Secondary School requirements.&lt;ref name=irin0209 /&gt;  The government plans to invest in an expanded system of both Secondary academic vocational education to meet the demand.

Students in Mali pay no tuition fees, but private secondary and vocational schooling may charge $600 a year (in Bamako, 2008), in a nation where the average yearly salary was $500 in 2007 according to the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=irin0209 /&gt;

==Literacy==
According to [[United States]] government estimates, the adult [[literacy]] rate (defined as those over age 15 who can read and write) was 46.4 percent for the total population in 2003 (53.5 percent for males and 39.6 percent for females).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; According to [[United Nations]] sources the literacy rate is lower - 27–30 percent overall and as low as 12 percent for females, among the lowest rates in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Higher education==
One of the oldest universities in the world — [[Sankore Madrasah|Sankore]] in [[Timbuktu]] — dates to the 15th century.

The [[University of Bamako]], also known as the University of Mali, is a 1990s aggregation of older institutions of higher education in the [[Bamako]] area. Its main campus is in the neighborhood of Badalabougou. 

The University includes five Faculties and two institutes: 
* The Science and Technology faculty (Faculté des sciences et techniques or FAST), 
* The Medical faculty (Faculté de Médecine, de Pharmacie et d’Odento-Stamologie or FMPOS), 
* The Humanities, Arts, and Social Science faculty (Faculté des Lettres, Langues, Arts et Sciences Humaines or FLASH), 
* The Law and Public Service faculty (Faculté des Sciences Juridiques et Politiques FSJP), 
* The Science of Economy and Management Faculty ("Faculté des Sciences Economiques et de Gestion" or FSEG, 
* The Institute of Management ( "Institut Universitaire de Management" or IUG), 
* The Higher Institute for Training and Applied Research ("Institut Supérieur de Formation et de Recherche Appliquée" or ISFRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ml.refer.org/u-bamako/index.php University of Bamako]. retrieved 2009-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
Public education is directed and funded from the national level.&lt;ref name=ministry&gt;[http://www.education.gov.ml/ Ministry of Education]. Retrieved 2009-02-10&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry has two Ministerial level officers, each heading one independent arm of the Ministry. The ''Ministre de L’Education de Base, de L’Alphabétisation et des Langues Nationales'' (Ministry of Basic Education, Literacy, and National Languages) is responsible for Primary education, literacy programs outside the schools, and the promotion and standardisation of "National Languages", such as Bambara and Tamcheq, other than the official language, French.&lt;ref name=ministry /&gt;

The ''Ministre des Enseignements Secondaire, supérieur et de la Recherche scientifique'' (Ministry of Secondary and Superior Education, and Scientific Research) is tasked with government Secondary schools, university, and an array of vocational, technical, and research centres.&lt;ref name=ministry /&gt; As of 2008, the Minister of Basic Education, Literacy, and National Languages was  Sidibe Aminata Diallo&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.ml/spip.php?rubrique1 Ministre de L’Education de Base, de L’Alphabétisation et des Langues Nationales].Retrieved 2009-02-10&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minister of Secondary and Superior Education, and Scientific Research was Amadou Toure&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.ml/spip.php?rubrique21 Ministre des Enseignements Secondaire, supérieur et de la Recherche scientifique].Retrieved 2009-02-10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Binmore''' (1860 &amp;ndash; 24 August 1917) was an [[educationist]] from Montreal whose [[notability]] comes from her career and her important personal firsts in education.

Binmore received her first higher education at the McGill Normal School from 1875 to 1878 this being the only public institution to offer instruction to English-speaking women of Montreal. She obtained three teaching diplomas during her time there and began a lifelong teaching career.

Education opportunities expanded for her in 1884 when [[McGill University|McGill College]] opened their arts faculty to women. She was part of their third class of women and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1890. Other graduates in that class included [[Maude Abbott]] and [[Carrie Matilda Derick]]. She earned her [[Master of Arts]] from McGill in 1894; sharing the honour of being the first woman to do so with one other lady. She received further post graduate education from [[Harvard University]]. This work was not recognized with a further degree as Harvard was not awarding degrees to women at that time.

Binmore is credited with being an implementer in Montreal of [[Sloyd|Educational Sloyd]] which was a leading edge manual educational innovation in the latter half of the nineteenth century. She held a number of important posts including the president of the Teachers’ Association of Montreal. She was the first woman to hold this post. She served on the executive of the Provincial Association of Protestant Teachers for a time. She was a longtime member of the Alumnae Society of McGill University and held important positions there including president and treasurer.

'''Elsie Fogerty''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[LRAM]], (16 December 1865, London – 4 July 1945, [[Leamington Spa|Leamington]], Warwickshire) was an English teacher who bravely departed from the customary practice of “voice and diction” also called elocution.  At that time “Voice and Diction” focused entirely on the mouth and nasal cavity to produce speech sounds.  Fogerty’s technique ended up focusing on the entire body and voice to produce speech.  At first, she used just the lungs to resonate the sound, but soon included the whole body, because she discovered that posture and movement also effected speech. It ultimately became known as the “Body and Voice” technique.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;  And, it can be rightly said, she ‘taught the stage to speak.’ 

She was founder and principal of the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in London from 1906 to 1942.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Early years==
The daughter of engineer and architect [[Joseph Fogerty]] FRIBA (d. 1899) of Dublin, and his wife, Hannah Cochrane (d. 1910), of Limerick, Fogerty was born in [[Sydenham]], south London on 16 December 1865.&lt;ref&gt;3. Michael Sanderson, 'Fogerty, Elsie', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004–2009)&lt;/ref&gt; 

An only child, she was privately educated and in 1883 trained at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]] under [[Coquelin aine]] and [[Louis-Arsène Delaunay]], and with [[Hermann Vezin]] in London.  Fogerty went on to teach English and Elocution at the [[Crystal Palace School|Crystal Palace School of Art and Literature]] from 1889, [[Roedean School]] from 1908 to 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Elsie Fogerty, Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; and was tutor of diction at [[Francis Robert Benson|Sir Frank Benson]]'s London School of Acting.
&lt;ref&gt;'A Historical Dictionary of British Women', Cathy Hartley (Routledge; 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central School of Speech and Drama==
Fogerty began teaching Saturday speech classes at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in the 1890s. Following their success, in 1906 she founded the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] then known as the Central School of Speech-Training and Dramatic Arts at the Hall.  By 1908 she had worked out a three year training course from speech trainer and drama teachers.&lt;ref&gt;'A Historical Dictionary of British Women', Cathy Hartley (Routledge, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 the school was one of three educational establishments approved by the [[University of London]] to grant diplomas in dramatic art.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie Fogerty, Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Fogerty gave university extension lectures at the Albert Hall, and for many years took evening classes for [[London County Council]] teachers.

The School remained at the Royal Albert Hall until 1957, when it moved to its current site in [[Swiss Cottage]], north London.

Many of Fogerty's pupils had successes in the Poetry Reading Competition at [[Oxford]] before the [[Second World War]] and many alumni went on to become teachers in speech and the management of theatres.

Whilst at the Royal Albert Hall Elsie Fogerty trained notable actors including:
* [[Rodney Ackland]]
* Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]
* Iris Baker
* [[William Fox (actor)|William Fox]]
* Sir [[John Gielgud]]
* [[John Laurie]]
* [[Alison Leggatt]]
* Ruth Lodge
* Sir [[Laurence Olivier]]

* [[Ann Todd]]
* [[Marda Vanne]]&lt;ref&gt;''Elsie Fogerty Archive'', THM/324 – Theatre &amp; Performance Special Collections, V&amp;A, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public figures and actors consulted Fogerty on special difficulties connected with the speech side of their work including poet [[Laurence Binyon]], [[Elizabeth Bergner]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[T S Eliot]], various pillars of Church and State, and [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]], who became Patron of the School.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie Fogerty Archive, THM/324 – Theatre &amp; Performance Special Collections, V&amp;A, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speech Clinic, St Thomas' Hospital==
Fogerty was a pioneer in the cure of stammering and in 1912 opened a speech clinic at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London, of which she became superintendent, and consequently one of the very first speech therapists.&lt;ref&gt;Elsie Fogerty, Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Fogerty was made [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for services to speech training and dramatic arts in the King's [[1934 Birthday Honours]].

==Drama Profession==
Elsie Fogerty worked to secure the first recognition of drama as a diploma subject in an English university – the [[University of London]], where she was a member of the advisory committee for the Diploma in Dramatic Art. She was a member of the Council of the [[British Drama League]] from its foundation until her death, and was a keen supporter for the establishment of the [[Royal National Theatre]], London.

'''Friendship Armstrong Academy''' is a public [[Charter schools in the United States|charter school]] located in the [[Truxton Circle, Washington, D.C.|Truxton Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]] Historically a [[black school]], it is housed in the former '''Armstrong Manual Training School''', also known as the '''Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School'''.

==History==
The building was designed by local architect [[Waddy B. Wood]] in 1902. The [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] building was one of two segregated manual training schools constructed for the city's African-American youth.&lt;ref name="pdfhost.focus.nps.gov"&gt;{{NRHP url|id=96000893}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named for [[Samuel C. Armstrong]].&lt;ref name="wdchumanities.org"&gt;http://wdchumanities.org/bigreadexhibit/exhibits/show/dcsegregatedschools/ward-5/armstrong&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated by [[Booker T. Washington]], on October 24, 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP6inVxTPpAC&amp;pg=PA554&amp;lpg=PA554&amp;dq=Armstrong+Manual+Training+School&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4_6XnXAyqo&amp;sig=jLYdQE767V0bAP1fB1lQg99JQMU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=msGyTtrgDqG90AHCncGyBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Armstrong%20Manual%20Training%20School&amp;f=false| chapter=A Dedication Speech at Armstrong Manual Training School| title= The Booker T.

A '''geometry template''' is a piece of clear plastic with cut-out shapes for use in [[mathematics]] and other subjects in [[primary school]] through [[secondary school]].  It also has various measurements on its sides to be used like a [[ruler]]. In Australia, popular brands include Mathomat and MathAid.  

==Brands==
===Mathomat and Mathaid===
Mathomat is a trademark used for a plastic stencil developed in Australia by Craig Young in 1969, who originally worked as an engineering tradesperson in the [[Government Aircraft Factories]] (GAF) in Melbourne before retraining and working as head of mathematics in a secondary school in Melbourne. Young designed Mathomat to address what he perceived as limitations of traditional mathematics drawing sets in classrooms, mainly caused by students losing parts of the sets. The Mathomat stencil has a large number of geometric shapes stencils combined with the functions of a [[Technical drawing tool|technical drawing set]] (rulers, set squares, protractor and circles stencils to replace a compass). 

The template made use [[polycarbonate]] – a new type of thermoplastic polymer when Mathomat first came out – which was strong and transparent enough to allow for a large number of stencil shapes to be included in its design without breaking or tearing. The first template was exhibited in 1970 at a mathematics conference in Melbourne along with a series of popular mathematics teaching lesson plan; it became an immediate success with a large number of schools specifying it as a required students purchase. As of 2017, the stencil is widely specified in Australian schools, chiefly for students at early secondary school level. The manufacturing of Mathomat was taken over in 1989 by the W&amp;G drawing instrument company, which had a factory in Melbourne for manufacture of technical drawing instruments. Young also developed MathAid, which was initially produced by him when he was living in [[Ringwood, Victoria]]. He later sold the company.

W&amp;G published a series of teacher resource books for Mathomat authored by various teachers and academics who were interested in Mathomat as a teaching product.

[[File:Portrait of Georgios Nazos by Nikolaos Gyzis.jpg|thumb|Portrait of George Nazos by [[Nikolaos Gyzis]], 1880.]]
'''George Nazos''' ([[Greek Language|Greek]]: Γιώργος Νάζος Giórgios Názos) (1862 – 1934) was a [[Greece|Greek]] music teacher and director of the [[Athens Conservatoire|Athens Conservatory]]. He was from a well-known family from [[Tinos]] Island. He was recognized for his musical talent at a young age. In 1881 he went to [[Munich]], [[Germany]] to study piano and advanced theory, returning to Greece in 1886.

== Career ==
In 1891, Nazos was appointed musical director of the Athens Conservatory, which he reorganized by hiring foreign teachers. Specifically, he proceeded to Germanize the curriculum, perhaps influenced by his studies in Munich, and apply progressive educational methods, which led to the founding of the Conservatory's student orchestra, the first incarnation of what was to become the Athens State Orchestra upon nationalization. He also founded or was important to the founding of the Conservatory's drama, opera, [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]], and [[military bands|military band]] departments, and contributed to Greek legislation pertaining to music education. As a teacher, he taught in piano, voice, and music theory.

In his field, he dealt with scientific research and the collection of Greek traditional songs from the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] and [[Crete]]. This research work was published in Athens under the title of ''Peninta dimódi ásmata Peloponnisou kai Kritis'' (Fifty traditional songs from Peloponnesus and Crete).

Nazos was a dedicated professional musician, and his contribution to conservatories, schools, orchestras, and theatre was significant. Through 30 years of effort, he laid the foundations of Greek music education.

A '''higher diploma''' is an academic award in [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Oman]]. In Iraq, it's one year after bachelor's degree (i.e., NOT equivalent to a bachelor's degree). In Ireland it is a postgraduate qualification at the same level of the honours bachelor's degree. In the United Kingdom, the diploma is equivalent to higher tier (A*-C) [[GCSE]].

==Iraq==
A postgraduate university program is the 2-Terms Diploma ([[Arabic]]: دبلوم عالي )&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuffic.nl/en/library/country-module-iraq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; course. The first year is made up of higher coursework, and students write a thesis after the 2 terms. The entrance requirement for this programme is a pass mark (50-59%) for the bachelor's degree in the same discipline.

In terms of level, the Post graduate Diploma ([[Arabic]]: دبلوم عالي ) is comparable to a 1-year WO master’s degree in a similar specialization in the Netherlands.
In medical field high diploma is two years full time training and passing rank is 70%

==Libya==
The Higher Diploma AKA High Diploma&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aladel.gov.ly/main/modules/sections/item.php?itemid=246&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Arabic]]:  دبلوم عالي) in [[Libya]] is an award from a national institute of technology or engineering given to the students who fulfil the requirement of passing 120 to 140 academic credits, it was started in 1980s by ministry of higher education as a degree with emphasis on the practical studies that benefits the local market comparing to the "theoretical approach" was taken by the universities (Higher diploma is a degree in higher education). Importantly, the degree may equivalent to BSc, or three-years undergraduate degree, students with Higher Diploma may take additional academic courses (two full-time semesters) in order to get Bachelor degree, as clearly stated in the law of higher education in Libya.

Recently, the government has issued a law in which the institutes of higher education will change into Colleges of Higher Education and to change the degree that given by them to bachelor's degree, in order to meet the world standards.

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|Education in the United Kingdom}}
In the UK, the higher diploma is a level 2 qualification on the [[Regulated Qualifications Framework]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.getingofar.gov.uk/qualifications|title=Unsure of your qualification?|website=Get In Go Far|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the recently introduced 14- to 19-year-old Diploma system for the UK, which follows two levels, lower tier (Level 1) and higher tier (Level 2). To proceed to [[A-Level]]s in [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], and [[Wales]]; you have to have completed a specified amount of qualifications at-least equivalent to A*-C GCSE (Level 2).

The Diploma program usually consists of four major subjects: Maths, English, ICT, and a subject you want to study more in-depth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/QualificationsExplained/DG_070676&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Hadlow College offers Higher National Diploma at Level 5. This includes their HND Garden Design, which calls for an applicant to have gathered 48 UCAS tariff points.

==Hong Kong==
{{see also|Education in Hong Kong}}
A Higher Diploma is an academic award by an [[University]], [[College]], other Tertiary Institutions, or Post Secondary Institutions. The award is at the same level as an [[Associate Degree]] or [[Diploma]]/[[Advanced Diploma]] Qualifications Framework Level 4, but below the standard of a [[Bachelor's Degree]]. It's also above a lower level [[Academic certificate|Certificate]]; and lower level [[Diploma]]. 

Usually higher diplomas emphasis more on specialization and job training whereas associate degrees focus more on general, broader education. For example, there may be a higher diploma for "electrical engineering" but only an associate degree for "physical science".

==Ireland==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
{{see also|Third-level education in the Republic of Ireland#Further education}}
The Higher Diploma (''Ard-Dioplóma'' in [[Irish language|Irish]]) is an award from [[Quality and Qualifications Ireland]] which in 2012 took over responsibilities &lt;ref&gt;http://www.qqi.ie/Articles/Pages/About-Us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]] that replaces the [[graduate diploma]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The higher diploma is currently available in [[List of universities in the Republic of Ireland|universities in Ireland]] and has been awarded since June 2005; the standard of the award is broadly similar to the graduate diploma, and replaces reorientation-type courses. Professional-type graduate diplomas will be replaced by [[postgraduate diploma]]s.

The [[National University of Ireland]] also offers a broad selection of higher diplomas in its constituent universities and recognized colleges. Main disciples are arts, business, engineering and science. A higher diploma in education is offered by the [[University of Dublin]].

==Oman==
The Higher Diploma is an award equivalent to fourth or third year of bachelor's degree, it's a one-year course with 30 credit hours after achieving the diploma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2167">'''Jugend forscht''' (literal translation: “Youth researches”) is a German youth science competition. With more than 10,000 participants annually, it is the biggest youth science and technology competition in Europe. It was initiated in 1965 by [[Henri Nannen]], then editor-in-chief of the [[Stern (magazine)|Stern]] magazine.

Participants work on a self-chosen research project, hand in a written report about their work, and then present their results first at regional levels and later at a national contest to an expert jury, usually in the form of a [[poster session]], often including a practical demonstration. Contest juries often invite university or industry experts to referee some of the projects, especially at the national contest, due to a high level of specialization.

Participants can enter in one of seven subject groups:

* [[Biology]]
* [[Chemistry]]
* [[Geosciences]] and [[Astronomy]]
* [[Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]]
* [[Physics]]
* [[Technology]]
* Work environment

Participants must not be older than 21 years and can enter the competition either on their own or in teams of up to three. University students are only allowed to participate during their first year of study. Participants younger than 15 years compete in a separate contest called “Schüler experimentieren” (“Pupils experiment”).

Winners receive prizes donated by industrial sponsors. At the national level, one project in each of the subject groups is selected as the national winner each year. In addition, there is a special price for the best interdisciplinary project by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]], as well as additional special prizes for particularly distinguished projects by the [[President of Germany]] and the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]]. Some of the winning projects are nominated for the [[European Union Contest for Young Scientists]], and all winners are nominated for the [[Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes]].

'''Margaret Higgins Sanger''' (born '''Margaret Louise Higgins''', September 14, 1879{{snds}}September 6, 1966, also known as '''Margaret Sanger Slee''') was an American [[birth control]] activist, [[Sex education|sex educator]], writer, and nurse. Sanger popularized the term "birth control", opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, and established organizations that evolved into the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/protect-womens-health/|title=Political Attacks on Planned Parenthood Are a Threat to Women's Health|first=The|last=Editors|website=Scientific American|date=1 June 2012|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanger used her writings and speeches primarily to promote her way of thinking. She was prosecuted for her book ''Family Limitation'' under the [[Comstock Act]] in 1914. She was afraid of what would happen, so she fled to Britain until she knew it was safe to return to the US.&lt;ref name="Douglas 1970 57"&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Emily|title=Margaret Sanger: Pioneer of the Future|year=1970|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|location=Canada|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger's efforts contributed to several judicial cases that helped legalize contraception in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Hazel C.|date=January 1, 1938|title=Lobbying for Birth Control|jstor=2745054|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=2|issue=1|pages=48–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her connection with Planned Parenthood, Sanger is a frequent target of criticism by [[anti-abortion movements|opponents of abortion]]. However, Sanger drew a sharp distinction between birth control and abortion and was opposed to abortion through the bulk of her career. Sanger remains an admired figure in the American [[reproductive rights]] movement.{{sfn|Katz|2000}} She has been criticized for supporting [[eugenics]].&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/peopleevents/e_eugenics.html|title=People &amp; Events: Eugenics and Birth Control|publisher=PBS|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, which led to her arrest for distributing information on [[contraception]], after an undercover policewoman bought a copy of her pamphlet on family planning.&lt;ref name="Cox2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vicki Cox|title=Margaret Sanger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbQa8tnhr1EC&amp;pg=PA7|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0759-2|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequent trial and appeal generated controversy. Sanger felt that in order for women to have a more equal footing in society and to lead healthier lives, they needed to be able to determine when to bear children. She also wanted to prevent so-called [[unsafe abortion|back-alley abortions]],{{sfn|Cox|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vbQa8tnhr1EC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]|accessdate=2016-03-11}} which were common at the time because abortions were illegal in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/05/abortion-in-american-history/376851/|title=Abortion in American History|last=Pollitt|first=Katha|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that while abortion was sometimes justified it should generally be avoided, and she considered contraception the only practical way to avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/AmRad/familylimitations.pdf|title=Family Limitation|first=|publisher=|year=1917|isbn=|location=|page=5|pages=|quote="No one can doubt that there are times where an abortion is justifiable but they can become ''unnecessary when care is taken to prevent conception.'' This is the ''only'' cure for abortion."|via=|author=Sanger, Margaret|accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Sanger founded the [[American Birth Control League]], which later became the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]]. In New York City, she organized the first birth control clinic staffed by all-female doctors, as well as a clinic in [[Harlem]] with an all African-American advisory council,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nyu.edu/pages/projects/sanger/articles/harlem.php|title=Looking Uptown: Margaret Sanger and the Harlem Branch Birth Control Clinic|last=Wangui Muigai|first=|date=Spring 2010|work=The Newsletter|publisher=The Margaret Sanger Papers Project|issue=#54|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where African-American staff were later added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eIITCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;ots=pyZuUPw9iD&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20American%20staff&amp;f=false|title=Ballots, Babies, and Banners of Peace: American Jewish Women’s Activism, 1890–1940|last=Klapper|first=Melissa R.|date=August 22, 2014|publisher=NYU Press|year=|isbn=9781479850594|location=|pages=137–138|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, she formed the [[National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control]], which served as the focal point of her lobbying efforts to legalize contraception in the United States. From 1952 to 1959, Sanger served as president of the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]]. She died in 1966, and is widely regarded as a founder of the modern birth control movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Life ==

=== Early life ===

Sanger was born Margaret Louise Higgins in 1879 in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;History of the Corning-Painted Post Area, p.&amp;nbsp;240&lt;/ref&gt; to Michael Hennessey Higgins, an Irish-born stonemason and free-thinker, and Anne Purcell Higgins, a Catholic Irish-American. Michael Hennessey Higgins had emigrated to the United States at age 14 and joined the Army as a drummer at age 15, during the Civil War. After leaving the army, Michael studied medicine and [[phrenology]], but ultimately became a stonecutter, making stone angels, saints, and tombstones.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, Margaret, ''The Autobiography of Margaret Sanger'', Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael H. Higgins was a Catholic who became an [[atheist]] and an activist for women's suffrage and free public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/john_murphy/margaretsanger.html |title=Margaret Sanger |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}; Rosalind Rosenberg, ''Divided lives: American women in the twentieth century'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne was born in Ireland. Her parents brought the family to Canada during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Potato Famine]]. She married Michael in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 3, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Higgins went through 18 pregnancies (with 11 live births) in 22 years before dying at the age of 49. Sanger was the sixth of eleven surviving children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=James L. |last2=Cooper |first2= Sheila M. |title=The Roots of American Feminist Thought |publisher=Alvin and Bacon |year=1973 |page=219 |asin=B002VY8L0O }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent much of her youth assisting with household chores and caring for her younger siblings.

Supported by her two older sisters, Margaret Higgins attended [[Claverack College]] and Hudson River Institute, before enrolling in 1900 at White Plains Hospital as a nurse probationer. In 1902, she married the [[architect]] William Sanger and gave up her education.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, Margaret. ''Autobiography'' (New York: Norton, 1938), p. 13; Katz, Esther, et al., eds, ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger, Vol. 1: The "Woman Rebel" 1900–1928'' (Urbana: Illinois University Press, 2003), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Though she was plagued by a recurring active [[Tuberculosis|tubercular]] condition, Margaret Sanger bore three children, and the couple settled down to a quiet life in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester, New York]].

=== Social activism ===
{{American socialism|Activists}}
In 1911, after a fire destroyed their home in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]], the Sangers abandoned the suburbs for a new life in New York City. Margaret Sanger worked as a visiting nurse in the slums of the [[Lower East Side|East Side]], while her husband worked as an architect and a house painter. Already imbued with her husband's leftist politics, Margaret Sanger also threw herself into the radical politics and modernist values of pre-World War I [[Greenwich Village]] bohemia. She joined the Women's Committee of the New York Socialist party, took part in the labor actions of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (including the notable [[1912 Lawrence textile strike]] and the [[1913 Paterson silk strike]]) and became involved with local intellectuals, left-wing artists, socialists and social activists, including [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Mabel Dodge]] and [[Emma Goldman]].&lt;ref name=Chesler&gt;{{Cite book|title=Woman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America|last=Chesler|first=Ellen|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1992|isbn=978-0-8070-4439-1|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

Sanger's political interests, emerging feminism and nursing experience led her to write two series of columns on sex education entitled "What Every Mother Should Know" (1911–12) and "What Every Girl Should Know" (1912–13) for the socialist magazine ''[[New York Call]].'' By the standards of the day, Sanger's articles were extremely frank in their discussion of sexuality, and many ''New York Call'' readers were outraged by them. Other readers, however, praised the series for its candor.  One stated that the series contained "a purer morality than whole libraries full of hypocritical cant about modesty".&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{rp|65}} Both were published in book form in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dietrich|2010}}; {{harvnb|Engelman|2011|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Blanchard|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OnSLtku4YzwC&amp;pg=PA50 50]|accessdate=2016-03-11}}; {{harvnb|Coates|2008|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her work among working-class immigrant women, Sanger met women who underwent frequent childbirth, miscarriages and self-induced abortions for lack of information on how to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Access to contraceptive information was prohibited on grounds of obscenity by the 1873 federal [[Comstock law]] and a host of state laws. Seeking to help these women, Sanger visited public libraries, but was unable to find information on contraception.&lt;ref&gt;Endres, Kathleen L., ''Women's Periodicals in the United States: social and political issues'', p. 448; Endres cites Sanger, ''An Autobiography'', pp. 95–96. Endres cites Kennedy, p. 19, as pointing out that some materials on birth control were available in 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; These problems were epitomized in a story that Sanger would later recount in her speeches: while Sanger was working as a nurse, she was called to the apartment of a woman, "Sadie Sachs", who had become extremely ill due to a self-induced abortion. Afterward, Sadie  begged the attending doctor to tell her how she could prevent this from happening again, to which the doctor simply advised her to remain abstinent. A few months later, Sanger was called back to Sadie's apartment — only this time, Sadie" died shortly after Sanger arrived. She had attempted yet another self-induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Lader (1955), pp. 44–50.

This story – along with Sanger's 1904 rescue of her unwanted niece [[Olive Byrne]] from the snowbank in which she had been left—marks the beginning of Sanger's commitment to spare women from the pursuit of dangerous and illegal abortions.&lt;ref name=KVPsych /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jill Lepore, The Secret History of Wonder Woman, 2014, {{ISBN|0804173400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Composite story: ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1'', p. 185.

Given the connection between contraception and working-class empowerment, Sanger came to believe that only by liberating women from the risk of unwanted pregnancy would fundamental social change take place. She launched a campaign to challenge governmental censorship of contraceptive information through confrontational actions.

Sanger became estranged from her husband in 1913, and the couple's divorce was finalized in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 she married her second husband, James Noah H. Slee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Sanger: Pioneer of the Future pp. 178–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Sanger launched ''The Woman Rebel'', an eight-page monthly newsletter which promoted contraception using the slogan "[[No Gods, No Masters]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, pp. 1, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The slogan "No Gods, No Masters" originated in a flyer distributed by the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] in the [[1912 Lawrence textile strike]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, Margaret, ''The Autobiography of Margaret Sanger'', Mineola, New York: Dover Printing Publications Inc., 2004, pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger, collaborating with anarchist friends, popularized the term "birth control" as a more candid alternative to euphemisms such as "family limitation"; the term "birth control" was suggested in 1914 by a young friend called Otto Bobstei&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{rp|97}}&lt;ref&gt;Katz, ''The selected papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, Rachel.

&lt;br /&gt;Engelman cites facsimile edited by Alex Baskin, ''Woman Rebel'', New York: Archives of Social History, 1976. Facsimile of original.&lt;/ref&gt; In these early years of Sanger's activism, she viewed birth control as a free-speech issue, and when she started publishing ''The Woman Rebel'', one of her goals was to provoke a legal challenge to the [[Comstock laws|federal anti-obscenity laws]] which banned dissemination of information about contraception.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, ''Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger, Vol. 1''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCann"&gt;McCann 2010, pp. 750–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Though postal authorities suppressed five of its seven issues, Sanger continued publication, all the while preparing ''Family Limitation'', another challenge to anti-birth control laws. This 16-page pamphlet contained detailed and precise information and graphic descriptions of various contraceptive methods. In August 1914 Margaret Sanger was indicted for violating postal obscenity laws by sending ''The Woman Rebel'' through the postal system. Rather than stand trial, she fled the country.&lt;ref name="Douglas 1970 57"/&gt;

Margaret Sanger spent much of her 1914 exile in England, where contact with British [[neo-Malthusian]]s such as [[Charles Vickery Drysdale]] helped refine her socioeconomic justifications for birth control. She shared their concern that [[over-population]] led to poverty, famine and war.&lt;ref name=Baker268&gt;Baker, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; At the Fifth International Neo-Malthusian Conference in 1922, she was the first woman to chair a session.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; She organized the Sixth International Neo-Malthusian and Birth-Control Conference that took place in New York in 1925.&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{rp|225}}&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Over-population would remain a concern of hers for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name=Baker268 /&gt;

During her 1914 trip to England, she was also profoundly influenced by the liberation theories of [[Havelock Ellis]], under whose tutelage she sought not just to make sexual intercourse safer for women but more pleasurable.  Another notable person she met around this time was [[Marie Stopes]], who had run into Sanger after she had just given a talk on birth control at a [[Fabian Society]] meeting. Stopes showed Sanger her writings and sought her advice about a chapter on contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Greer, Germaine |title=Sex and Destiny |publisher=Secker and Warburg |year=1984 |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZdECgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT164|title=The Public Lives of Charlotte and Marie Stopes|first=Stephanie|last=Green|date=October 6, 2015|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1915, Margaret Sanger's estranged husband, William Sanger, gave a copy of ''Family Limitation'' to a representative of anti-vice politician [[Anthony Comstock]]. William Sanger was tried and convicted, spending thirty days in jail while attracting interest in birth control as an issue of civil liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Emily|title=Margaret Sanger: Pioneer of the Future|year=1970|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|location=Canada|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haight|first=Anne Lyon|title=Banned books: informal notes on some books banned for various reasons at various times and in various places|year=1935|publisher=R.R.

=== Birth control movement ===

[[File:1917 Edition of Family Limitations.jpg|thumb|right|This page from Sanger's ''Family Limitation'', 1917 edition, describes a [[cervical cap]]]]

Some countries in northwestern Europe had more liberal policies towards contraception than the United States at the time, and when Sanger visited a Dutch birth control clinic in 1915, she learned about [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]] and became convinced that they were a more effective means of contraception than the suppositories and [[douche]]s that she had been distributing back in the United States. Diaphragms were generally unavailable in the United States, so Sanger and others began importing them from Europe, in defiance of United States law.&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

On October 16, 1916, Sanger opened a family planning and birth control clinic at 46 Amboy Street in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville neighborhood]] of [[Brooklyn]], the first of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Selected Papers, vol 1'', p. 199. &lt;br /&gt;Baker, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days after the clinic opened, Sanger was arrested. Sanger's bail was set at $500 and she went back home. Sanger continued seeing some women in the clinic until the police came a second time. This time, Sanger and her sister, [[Ethel Byrne]], were arrested for breaking a New York state law that prohibited distribution of contraceptives. Sanger was also charged with running a public nuisance.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Sanger: Pioneer to the Future, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger and Byrne went to trial in January 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Byrne was convicted and sentenced to 30 days in a workhouse but went on a hunger strike. She was force-fed, the first woman hunger striker in the US to be so treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = First woman in US given English dose | newspaper = The Seattle Star | date = January 27, 1917 | page = 1 | url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87093407/1917-01-27/ed-1/seq-1/| accessdate = November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only when Sanger pledged that Byrne would never break the law was she pardoned after ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mrs. Byrne pardoned; pledged to obey law; | newspaper = New York Times | date = February 2, 1917 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/02/02/102316826.pdf | accessdate = November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger was convicted; the trial judge held that women did not have "the right to copulate with a feeling of security that there will be no resulting conception."&lt;ref name="new-yorker"&gt;{{cite web | work = [[The New Yorker]] |first = Jill | last = Lepore| authorlink = Jill Lepore | date = November 14, 2011 | accessdate = November 13, 2011 | title= Birthright: What's next for Planned Parenthood? | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/14/111114fa_fact_lepore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger was offered a more lenient sentence if she promised to not break the law again, but she replied: "I cannot respect the law as it exists today."&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;Cox, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; For this, she was sentenced to 30 days in a workhouse.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; An initial appeal was rejected, but in a subsequent court proceeding in 1918, the birth control movement won a victory when Judge [[Frederick E. Crane]] of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] issued a ruling which allowed doctors to prescribe contraception.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 101–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The publicity surrounding Sanger's arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States and earned the support of numerous donors, who would provide her with funding and support for future endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, 2010, p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1917, Sanger began publishing the monthly periodical ''[[Birth Control Review]]''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The first issue of ''Birth Control Review'' was published in February 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Birth Control League ===

[[File:Birth Control Review 1919.jpg|thumb|Sanger published the ''Birth Control Review'' from 1917 to 1929.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Caption at the bottom of this 1919 issue reads: "Must She Always Plead in Vain? 'You are a nurse—can you tell me? For the children's sake—help me!'"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After [[World War I]], Sanger shifted away from radical politics, and she founded the [[American Birth Control League]] (ABCL) in 1921 to enlarge her base of supporters to include the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Estelle B., ''The essential feminist reader'', Random House Digital, Inc., 2007, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding principles of the ABCL were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;"Birth control: What it is, How it works, What it will do", ''The Proceedings of the First American Birth Control Conference'', November 11, 12, 1921, pp. 207–8.
&lt;br /&gt;''The Birth Control Review'', Vol. V, No. 12, December 1921, Margaret Sanger (ed.), p. 18.
&lt;br /&gt;Sanger, ''Pivot of Civilization'', 2001 reprint edited by Michael W. Perry, p. 409.
&lt;br /&gt;These principles were adopted at the first meeting of the ABCL in late 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=We hold that children should be (1) Conceived in love; (2) Born of the mother's conscious desire; (3) And only begotten under conditions which render possible the heritage of health. Therefore we hold that every woman must possess the power and freedom to prevent conception except when these conditions can be satisfied.}}

After Sanger's appeal of her conviction for the Brownsville clinic secured a 1918 court ruling that exempted physicians from the law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptive information to women (provided it was prescribed for medical reason), she established the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB) in 1923 to exploit this loophole.&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, staffed entirely by female doctors and social workers.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, pp. 196–97.
&lt;br /&gt;''The Selected Papers, Vol 2'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The clinic received extensive funding from [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] and his family, who continued to make anonymous donations to Sanger's causes in subsequent decades.&lt;ref name="Rockefeller"&gt;Chesler, pp. 277, 293, 558.

In 1922, she traveled to China, Korea, and Japan. In China she observed that the primary method of family planning was female infanticide, and she later worked with [[Pearl Buck]] to establish a family planning clinic in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, pp. 64–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger visited Japan six times, working with Japanese feminist [[Kato Shidzue]] to promote birth control.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 275.

In 1928, conflict within the birth control movement leadership led Sanger to resign as the president of the ABCL and take full control of the CRB, renaming it the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau (BCCRB), marking the beginning of a schism that would last until 1938.&lt;ref&gt;McCann (1994), pp. 177–8.

Sanger invested a great deal of effort communicating with the general public. From 1916 onward, she frequently lectured (in churches, women's clubs, homes, and theaters) to workers, churchmen, liberals, socialists, scientists, and upper-class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Autobiography of Margaret Sanger |last= Sanger |first= Margaret |year= 1938 |publisher= W.

W. Norton |pages=361, 366–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote several books in the 1920s which had a nationwide impact in promoting the cause of birth control. Between 1920 and 1926, 567,000 copies of ''Woman and the New Race'' and ''The Pivot of Civilization'' were sold.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote two autobiographies designed to promote the cause. The first, ''My Fight for Birth Control'', was published in 1931 and the second, more promotional version, ''Margaret Sanger: An Autobiography'', was published in 1938.

During the 1920s, Sanger received hundreds of thousands of letters, many of them written in desperation by women begging for information on how to prevent unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Motherhood in Bondage," #6, Winter 1993/4 |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/articles/motherhood_in_bondage.php|accessdate=April 9, 2011|newspaper=Margaret Sanger Papers Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The number of letters is reported as "a quarter million", "over a million", or "hundreds of thousands" in various sources&lt;/ref&gt; Five hundred of these letters were compiled into the 1928 book, ''Motherhood in Bondage.''&lt;ref&gt;500 letters: Cohen, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Sanger | first=Margaret| title=Motherhood in bondage | year=2000 | publisher=Ohio State University Press | location=Columbus, Ohio | isbn=0-8142-0837-1 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work with the African-American community ===

Sanger worked with [[African Americans|African American]] leaders and professionals who saw a need for birth control in their communities. In 1929, [[James H. Hubert]], a black social worker and the leader of New York's [[Urban League]], asked Sanger to open a clinic in [[Harlem]].&lt;ref&gt;Hajo, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger secured funding from the [[Julius Rosenwald Fund]] and opened the clinic, staffed with black doctors, in 1930. The clinic was directed by a 15-member advisory board consisting of black doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. The clinic was publicized in the African-American press as well as in black churches, and it received the approval of [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], the co-founder of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] and the editor of its magazine, '' The Crisis.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duboishomesite.org/MSI%20DuBoisFinalPlanningRepSM7.09.pdf|title=Duboishomesite.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naacp.org/pages/naacp-history-w.e.b.-dubois|title=NAACP History: W.E.B.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1930, Sanger opened a family planning clinic in Harlem that sought to enlist support for contraceptive use and to bring the benefits of family planning to women who were denied access to their city's health and social services. Staffed by a black physician and a black social worker, the clinic was endorsed by ''[[The New York Amsterdam News|The Amsterdam News]]'' (the powerful local newspaper), the [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]], the [[Urban League]], and the black community's elder statesman, W. E. B. Du Bois.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger did not tolerate [[bigotry]] among her staff, nor would she tolerate any refusal to work within interracial projects.&lt;ref&gt;McCann (1994), pp. 150–4.

From 1939 to 1942 Sanger was an honorary delegate of the Birth Control Federation of America, which included a supervisory role—alongside [[Mary Lasker]] and [[Clarence Gamble]]—in the Negro Project, an effort to deliver birth control to poor black people.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, p. 175.

To emphasize the benefits of hiring black community leaders to act as spokesmen, she wrote to Gamble: &lt;blockquote&gt;We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal.

=== Planned Parenthood era ===
{{Main|Planned Parenthood}}

[[File:17-23 West 16th St.jpg|thumb|left|Sanger's Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau operated from [[Margaret Sanger Clinic|this New York building]] from 1930 to 1973]]

In 1929, Sanger formed the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control in order to lobby for legislation to overturn restrictions on contraception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/aboutms/organization_ncflbc.php "National Committee on Federal Legislation on Birth Control"]. NYU Margaret Sanger Papers Project&lt;/ref&gt; That effort failed to achieve success, so Sanger ordered a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] from Japan in 1932, in order to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the United States government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to [[United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries|a 1936 court decision]] which overturned an important provision of the Comstock laws which prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Melody, ''Abortion: a documentary and reference guide'', ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This court victory motivated the [[American Medical Association]] in 1937 to adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a key component of medical school curriculums.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |title='Biographical Note', Smith College, Margaret Sangers Papers |publisher=Asteria.fivecolleges.edu |date=September 6, 1966 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This 1936 contraception court victory was the culmination of Sanger's birth control efforts, and she took the opportunity, now in her late 50s, to move to Tucson, Arizona, intending to play a less critical role in the birth control movement. In spite of her original intentions, she remained active in the movement through the 1950s.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

In 1937, Sanger became chairman of the newly formed Birth Control Council of America, and attempted to resolve the schism between the ABCL and the BCCRB.&lt;ref&gt;NYU Margaret Sanger Papers Project [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/aboutms/organization_bcca.php "Birth Control Council of America"]&lt;/ref&gt; Her efforts were successful, and the two organizations merged in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/aboutms/organization_bcfa.php |title=MSPP &amp;#62; About &amp;#62; Birth Control Organizations &amp;#62; PPFA |author=The Margaret Sanger Papers |work=nyu.edu |year=2010 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Date of merger recorded as 1938 (not 1939) in: O'Conner, Karen, ''Gender and Women's Leadership: A Reference Handbook'', p. 743. O'Conner cites Gordon (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sanger continued in the role of president, she no longer wielded the same power as she had in the early years of the movement, and in 1942, more conservative forces within the organization changed the name to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a name Sanger objected to because she considered it too euphemistic.&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{rp|393}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/aboutms/organization_ppfa.php NYU Sanger project]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] in 1952, and soon became the world's largest non-governmental international women's health, family planning and birth control organization. Sanger was the organization's first president and served in that role until she was 80 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Lynne E., ''Encyclopedia of Women and American Politics'', p. 406.

=== Death ===

[[File:Margaret-Sanger-Square NYC.jpg|thumb|right|Margaret Sanger Square, at the intersection of [[Mott Street]] and [[Bleecker Street]] in Manhattan]]

Sanger died of [[congestive heart failure]] in 1966 in [[Tucson, Arizona]], aged 86, about a year after the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', which legalized birth control in the United States.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In 1965, the case had struck down one of the remaining contraception-related Comstock laws in Connecticut and Massachusetts. However, ''Griswold'' only applied to marital relationships. A later case, [[Eisenstadt v. Baird]] (1972), extended the ''Griswold'' holding to unmarried persons as well.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger is buried in [[Fishkill, New York]], next to her sister, Nan Higgins, and her second husband, Noah Slee.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; One of her surviving brothers was [[College Football Hall of Fame]] player and Pennsylvania State University Head Football coach [[Bob Higgins (American football)|Bob Higgins]].&lt;ref name=margaret_sanger_obit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19660906&amp;id=n8VOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ggEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7379,6408540|title=Margaret Sanger obituary|date=September 6, 1966|accessdate=July 27, 2014|publisher=''[[Toledo Blade]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==

=== Sexuality ===

While researching information on contraception, Sanger read treatises on sexuality including ''The Psychology of Sex'' by the English psychologist [[Havelock Ellis]] and was heavily influenced by it.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, Margaret, ''The Autobiography of Margaret Sanger'', Mineola, New York: Dover Publications Inc., 2004, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; While traveling in Europe in 1914, Sanger met Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by Ellis, Sanger adopted his view of sexuality as a powerful, liberating force.&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{rp|13–14}} This view provided another argument in favor of birth control, as it would enable women to fully enjoy sexual relations without fear of unwanted pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{rp|111–117}}&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger also believed that sexuality, along with birth control, should be discussed with more candor,&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{rp|13–14}} and praised Ellis for his efforts in this direction. She also blamed Christianity for the suppression of such discussion.&lt;ref name="hrc.utexas.edu" /&gt;

Sanger opposed excessive sexual indulgence. She wrote that  "every normal man and woman has the power to control and direct his sexual impulse. Men and women who have it in control and constantly use their brain cells thinking deeply, are never sensual."&lt;ref name="Sanger Impulses II"&gt;{{citation | last = Sanger | first = Margaret | title = What Every Girl Should Know: Sexual Impulses – Part {{serif|II}} | periodical = [[New York Call]] | via = [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/project/index.php The Margaret Sanger Papers Project] | date = December 29, 1912 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=304923.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bronski |first=Michael |title=A Queer History of the United States |publisher=Beacon Press |year=2011 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger said that birth control would elevate women away from a position of being an object of lust and elevate sex away from purely being for satisfying lust, saying that birth control "denies that sex should be reduced to the position of sensual lust, or that woman should permit herself to be the instrument of its satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, Margaret, ''The Pivot of Civilization'', Amherst, New York: Humanity Books, 2003, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger wrote that masturbation was dangerous. She stated:
"In my personal experience as a trained nurse while attending persons afflicted with various and often revolting diseases, no matter what their ailments, I never found any one so repulsive as the chronic masturbator. It would not be difficult to fill page upon page of heart-rending confessions made by young girls, whose lives were blighted by this pernicious habit, always begun so innocently."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=304922.xml Margaret Sanger, "What Every Girl Should Know: Sexual Impulse – Part I"], December 22, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that women had the ability to control their sexual impulses, and should utilize that control to avoid sex outside of relationships marked by "confidence and respect." She believed that exercising such control would lead to the "strongest and most sacred passion."&lt;ref&gt;Bronski, Michael, ''A Queer History of the United States'', Beacon Press, 2011.&lt;br /&gt;Quotes from Sanger, "What Every Girl should know: Sexual Impulses Part II", in ''New York Call'', December 29, 1912; also in the subsequent book ''What Every Girl Should Know'', pp. 40–48; reprinted in ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1'', pp. 41–5 (quotes on p. 45).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sanger was not opposed to homosexuality and praised Ellis for clarifying "the question of homosexuals...&amp;nbsp;making the thing a—not exactly a perverted thing, but a thing that a person is born with different kinds of eyes, different kinds of structures and so forth...&amp;nbsp;that he didn't make all homosexuals perverts—and I thought he helped clarify that to the medical profession and to the scientists of the world as perhaps one of the first ones to do that."&lt;ref name="hrc.utexas.edu"&gt;[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/sanger_margaret_t.html The Mike Wallace Interview, Guest: Margaret Sanger], 9/21/57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of speech ===

Sanger opposed censorship throughout her career. Sanger grew up in a home where orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]] was admired.&lt;ref name="new yorker"&gt;"The Child Who Was Mother to a Woman" from ''The New Yorker'', April 11, 1925, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years of her activism, Sanger viewed birth control primarily as a free-speech issue, rather than as a feminist issue, and when she started publishing ''The Woman Rebel'' in 1914, she did so with the express goal of provoking a legal challenge to the Comstock laws banning dissemination of information about contraception.&lt;ref name="McCann" /&gt; In New York, [[Emma Goldman]] introduced Sanger to members of the Free Speech League, such as [[Edward Bliss Foote]] and [[Theodore Schroeder]], and subsequently the League provided funding and advice to help Sanger with legal battles.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Janice Ruth (2008), ''The Struggle for Free Speech in the United States, 1872–1915: Edward Bliss Foote, Edward Bond Foote, and anti-Comstock operations'', Psychology Press, 2008, pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of her career, Sanger was arrested at least eight times for expressing her views during an era in which speaking publicly about contraception was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;"Every Child a Wanted Child", ''Time'', September 16, 1966, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous times in her career, local government officials prevented Sanger from speaking by shuttering a facility or threatening her hosts.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston in 1929, city officials under the leadership of [[James Michael Curley|James Curley]] threatened to arrest her if she spoke. In response she stood on stage, silent, with a gag over her mouth, while her speech was read by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Melody, Michael Edward (1999), ''Teaching America about sex: marriage guides and sex manuals from the late Victorians to Dr. Ruth'', NYU Press, 1999, p. 53 (citing [[Halberstam, David]], ''[[The Fifties (book)|The Fifties]]'', Villard. 1993, p. 285).
&lt;br /&gt;Davis, Tom, ''Sacred work: Planned Parenthood and its clergy alliances'' Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 213 (citing ''A Tradition of Choice'', Planned Parenthood, 1991, p. 18).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woman And The New Race.png|thumb|right|alt=An advertisement for a book entitled "Woman and the New Race". At the top is a photo of a woman, seated affectionately with her two sons.|Her 1920 book endorsed negative eugenics]]

=== Eugenics ===

After [[World War I]], Sanger increasingly appealed to the societal need to limit births by those least able to afford children. The affluent and educated already limited their child-bearing, while the poor and uneducated lacked access to contraception and information about birth control.&lt;ref name=kelves&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity|last=Kevles|first=Daniel J.|authorlink=Daniel Kevles|publisher=University of California Press|pages=90–96|year=1985|isbn=0-520-05763-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she found an area of overlap with [[eugenics|eugenicists]].&lt;ref name=kelves /&gt; She believed that they both sought to "assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit." They differed in that "eugenists imply or insist that a woman's first duty is to the state; we contend that her duty to herself is her duty to the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=143449.xml|title=The Public Papers of Margaret Sanger: Web Edition|date=|work=nyu.edu|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger was a proponent of negative eugenics, which aimed to improve human hereditary traits through social intervention by reducing the reproduction of those who were considered unfit.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

Sanger's view of eugenics was influenced by [[Havelock Ellis]] and other British eugenicists, who held that environmentally acquired traits were inherited by one's progeny.&lt;ref&gt;McCann (1994) p.104, Engelman (2011) p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, she rejected race and ethnicity as determining factors.&lt;ref&gt;McCann (1994) p.117, Engelman (2011) p.135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesler/&gt;{{rp|195–6}} Instead, she stressed limiting the number of births to live within one's economic ability to raise and support healthy children. This would lead to a betterment of society and the human race.&lt;ref&gt;McCann (1994) pp.13,16–21&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger's view put her at odds with leading American eugenicists, such as [[Charles Davenport]], who took a racist view of inherited traits. She continually rejected their approach.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman (2011) p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Morality of Birth Control", a 1921 speech, she divided society into three groups: the "educated and informed" class that regulated the size of their families, the "intelligent and responsible" who desired to control their families in spite of lacking the means or the knowledge, and the "irresponsible and reckless people" whose religious scruples "prevent their exercising control over their numbers." Sanger concludes, "There is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped."&lt;ref name="Morality of Birth Control Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/margaretsangermoralityofbirthcontrol.htm|title=American Rhetoric: Margaret Sanger – The Morality of Birth Control|work=americanrhetoric.com|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanger's eugenic policies included an exclusionary immigration policy, free access to birth control methods, and full [[family planning]] autonomy for the able-minded, as well as compulsory segregation or sterilization for the "profoundly retarded".&lt;ref name="Porter, Nicole S.; Bothne Nancy; Leonard, Jason 126"&gt;{{cite book | title=Public Policy Issues Research Trends | publisher=Nova Science |author1=Porter, Nicole S. |author2=Bothne Nancy |author3=Leonard, Jason | page=126 | editor=Evans, Sophie J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FimyKiZOXUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Sanger&amp;f=false | isbn=978-1-60021-873-6 | date=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HitlerEquation"&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/articles/sanger-hitler_equation.php "The Sanger-Hitler Equation"], ''Margaret Sanger Papers Project Newsletter'', #32, Winter 2002/3.

&lt;br /&gt;Sanger's quote from ''The Pivot of Civilization'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; In personal correspondence she expressed her sadness about the aggressive and lethal [[Nazi eugenics]] program; and donated to the American Council Against Nazi Propaganda.&lt;ref name="HitlerEquation" /&gt; In addition, Sanger believed the responsibility for birth control should remain with able-minded individual parents rather than the state, and that self-determining motherhood was the only unshakable foundation for racial betterment.&lt;ref name="Betterment"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanger|first=Margaret|title=Birth Control and Racial Betterment|journal=Birth Control Review|volume=3|issue=2|date=February 1919|pages=11–12|url=https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=143449.xml|accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanger Propaganda"&gt;{{citation | last = Sanger | first = Margaret | title = The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda | periodical = [[Birth Control Review]] | publisher = The New York Women's Publishing Company | via = [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/project/index.php The Margaret Sanger Papers Project] | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | year = 1921 | page = 5 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=238946.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion ===

During the years of her greatest influence she opposed abortion and sharply distinguished between birth control, which she saw as a fundamental right of women, and access to abortion, which she did not see as such a right.&lt;ref name="Lader"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lader|first=Lawrence|title=A Private Matter: RU486 and the Abortion Crisis|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=1995|isbn=9781573920124}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36–37}}&lt;ref name="Chesler"/&gt;{{rp|125}} Already in 1916 when she opened her first birth control clinic she was employing harsh rhetoric against abortion. Flyers she distributed to women exhorted them in all capitals: "Do not kill, do not take life, but prevent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanger|first=Margaret|title=My Fight for Birth Control|publisher=Farrar &amp; Rinehart|year=1931|asin=B0045FG280}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} Sanger's patients were told "that abortion was the wrong way – no matter how early it was performed it was taking life; that contraception was the better way, the safer way – it took a little time, a little trouble, but it was well worth while in the long run, because life had not yet begun."&lt;ref name="aut"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanger|first=Margaret|title=An Autobiography|publisher=W. W. Norton|year=1938|oclc=00700090}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|217}}  Sanger consistently distanced herself from any calls for legal access to abortion, arguing that legal access to contraceptives would remove the need for abortion.&lt;ref&gt;At this time several other prominent advocates for birth control, such as [[Lawrence Lader]], [[Frederick Taussig]], and [[William J. Robinson]], saw contraception and abortion as being inextricably linked, and were calling for legalization of abortion.

Sanger's writings are curated by two universities: [[New York University]]'s history department maintains the ''Margaret Sanger Papers Project'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/ |title= NYU Sanger Papers Project web site |publisher= Nyu.edu |date= February 7, 2007 |accessdate= March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Smith College]]'s [[Sophia Smith Collection]] maintains the ''Margaret Sanger Papers'' collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_main.html |title= Smith College collection web site |publisher= Asteria.fivecolleges.edu |accessdate= March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanger's story also features in several biographies, including [[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David Kennedy]]'s biography ''Birth Control in America: The Career of Margaret Sanger'' (1970), which won the [[Bancroft Prize]] and the [[John Gilmary Shea Prize]].

As a theater actress, one of Musto's most relevant works was ''[[Breaking the Code]]'' by [[Hugh Whitemore]], about the life of [[Alan Turing]].

Dr. '''Mark J. Kittleson''', Professor of Health Education at [[Southern Illinois University]] (SIU) has followed in the footsteps of his outstanding predecessors at SIU, [[Robert S. Gold|Robert Gold]] and [[David F. Duncan|David Duncan]], in becoming a leader in the development of PC-based and web-based applications in health education. In 1992, he established an email discussion group that came to be known as the Health Education Directory or HEDIR, which has been called the most significant development to impact health education in the past 20 years (McDermott, 1998). Under his leadership HEDIR has given rise to the HEDIR Award, which recognizes contributions to the applications of technology to health education.

Dr. Kittleson was the founder and first editor, in 1998, of the ''International Electronic Journal of Health Education'' and is author of a column in the ''American Journal of Health Behavior'', entitled "Electronic Notes," which is designed to improve understanding and utilization of technology for conducting research on health behavior.

He began his professional career in health education at the Maine Health Education Resource Center, where he worked with [[Charles Basch]] under the direction of [[William H. Zimmerli]]. He then returned to school at the [[University of Akron]], completing his Ph.D. there in 1986. He taught at [[Youngstown State University]] until 1989 when he joined the faculty of SIU.

Dr. Kittleson is the author of 15 books—some of the more recent have been ''Vital Statistics for the Public Health Educator'', 2nd edition (HEDIR Publishing, 2005), ''Mental Health: Dimensions of Self-Esteem and Emotional Well-Being'' (with N. Eburne and J. Donnelly) (Allyn and Bacon Publishers, 2000), and ''Using Excel to Run Statistics'' (HEDIR Publishing, 2005). He has also published more than eighty peer-reviewed articles in such journals as the ''Journal of Health Education'', the ''Journal of School Health'', the ''Journal of Family Practice'', the ''Southern Medical Journal'', ''AIDS Education and Prevention'', and the ''American Journal of Health Behavior''. Most of his publications focus on needs assessment of teachers, particularly with respect to HIV/AIDS information; and the impact of the Internet and other technology on research and research communication.

== Mobile Teaching Laboratories ==
[[File:Mobile Teaching Laboratory.jpg|thumbnail|A mobile teaching laboratory in rural Uganda, operated by [http://www.tasteforscience.org The African Science Truck Experience]. The vehicle contains practical science equipment which is transported between a number of schools.]]
A novel use of the mobile laboratory is in science education. In some cases, the mobile laboratory travels to schools, museums, and other community organizations, providing the schools with educational resources which they otherwise lack. The mobile laboratory coalition is a loose partnership of groups that provide such services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilelabcoalition.org Mobile Laboratory Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, students must also travel to the mobile lab, such as when the lab takes the form of a boat or a train.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nysunworks.org/?page_id=9 New York Science Barge]&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile laboratories have recently been gaining favor from the [[NIH|National Institutes of Health]], in the form of the particular mobile laboratories such as the [[Biobus]] and the Boston University MobileLab, as a way to develop knowledge and understanding regarding biotechnology and medicine amongst the United States population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/ncrr_reporter/fall2007/cover.asp NCRR article on mobile biology laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of mobile teaching labs exists outside the USA as well with examples,  in the UK and in African countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tasteforscience.org/ The African Science Truck Experience (TASTE)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK [[Institute of Physics]] is touring secondary schools with their Lab in a Lorry. This is a large articulated truck with three small laboratories. In these, pupils can learn about the use of Physics in Medicine, and do hands-on experiments with light and sound using good physics lab equipment. These are guided by local volunteers and an IoP scientist. Volunteers usually have an interest in general science, or come from a science background. The project has the backing of the [[British Science Association]], the [[STEMNET]] Ambassadors Scheme, and sponsors such as [[EDF Energy]].

[[File:일신여자고등학교 야경.jpg|thumb|410x410px|Picture about high school students in South Korea studying until late night]]
'''Night self-learning''' ({{lang-ko|야간자율학습}}; {{lang-zh|s=晚自习|t=晚自習}}) is a self-administered program available to students from some middle schools and most high schools in mainland China, Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;[https://udn.com/news/story/6885/2892526 學生也過勞 課輔、晚自習「朝7晚9」]&lt;/ref&gt;, South Korea and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.daejonilbo.com/news/newsitem.asp?pk_no=1305727|title=야간 자율학습|last=진|first=광호|date=2018-03-18|work=Daejeon News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=Night self-learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the zero hour class before the regular class (also called "morning self-learning" ({{lang-zh|s=早自习|t=早自習}})) and the night self-learning after the regular class. Since it is a self-learning program, it does not offer educational programs like supplementary classes or [[after-school program]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://v.media.daum.net/v/20090314120005151|title=중학교 강제 보충수업·자율학습·0교시 부활|last=장|first=호영|date=2009-03-14|work=Daum News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=Revival of compulsory supplementary class, self-learning, the zero class at the school}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Usually, the concept of "self-learning" is not to unilaterally accept learning in the course of the teacher's control according to the teacher's advance plans, as is the case with [[tradition]]al teaching activities, but instead learner feels the need to learn on its own and studies own poor’s subject after self-planning. It is used in the same term as "Independent learning" as it is opposed to "[[Other-Directed|Other-directed]] learning". Also, it is based on spontaneity, [[creativity]] and [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=511994&amp;cid=42126&amp;categoryId=42126|title=자율학습|date=|work=Naver encyclopedia|accessdate=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=Self-learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is used as a different concept in South Korea. Night self-learning is a strictly passive learning process, and it is enforced under the supervision of a teacher in South Korea. In South Korea, night self-learning for high school students begins at around 6 pm. on average when classes are completed and night self-learning is finished until 9 pm, 10 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.daejonilbo.com/news/newsitem.asp?pk_no=598086|title=새내기 교사의 별천지 같은 하루|last=박|first=정식|date=|work=Daejeon News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=Day of new teachers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2017/10/28/0200000000AKR20171028035900004.HTML?from=search|title=고교생 수면부족 심각…10명 중 4명 "하루 6시간 이하"|last=고|first=유선|date=2017-10-29|work=Yonhab News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko-KR|trans-title=High school students lack of sleep critical…less than 6 hours a day}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the school, students who want to study at night after regular night self-hours will be able to study for an additional hour. The average Korean high school students spend 10 hours 47 minutes studying, and it is believed that the impact of ‘the zero class’ and ‘night self-learning’ is significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2017/10/24/0200000000AKR20171024061300004.HTML?from=search|title=전국 고교 80% '야자'…8곳 중 1곳은 밤 11시 넘어 끝나|last=이|first=재영|date=2017-10-24|work=Yonhap News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko-KR|trans-title=80 percent of high schools nationwide are 'night self-learning'…One of the eight is finished after 11pm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emblem of the Ministry of Education (South Korea) (English).svg|thumb|Ministry of Education(South Korea)|330x330px]]
Because of the [[policy]] of ‘The Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development (MOHRD)’, the compulsory night self-study was prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/schooling/154089.html|title=교육부, 획일적 보충학습ㆍ야간자율학습 금지|last=이|first=성한|date=2006-09-04|work=|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=The Ministry of Education, prohibition about standardized supplementary classㆍnight self-learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the standardized self-learning continued. Some people argue that self-learning from early morning till late night is detrimental to the health of students and do not help them learn efficiently in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2018/03/15/0200000000AKR20180315035900033.HTML?from=search|title=[SNS돋보기] 초중고생 갈수록 뚱뚱해진다…"종일 앉아만 있으니"|last=홍|first=지인|date=2018-03-15|work=Yonhap News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko-KR|trans-title=High school students are getting fatter gradually.…"Sitting around all day"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, similar to the above [[education]] system, self-learning is also being conducted. The government's basic policy is to leave school at 4 p.m., but generally, middle and high school students stay at school from 8 pm to 9 pm. Accordingly, there was an opposite signature on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.viva100.com/main/view.php?key=20170525010009045|title=전근대적 ‘야간자율학습’ 폐지될까|last=박|first=민지|date=|website=Bridge economy|language=ko|trans-title=Premodern ‘Night self-learning’ will be banned|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and Development ==

=== Background ===

'''The night self-learning''' started in 1980 with the July 30 educational reform measures. The focus of the [[education reform]] was the [[Normalization (sociology)|normalization]] of school education and the elimination of excessive [[Private lesson|private tutoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=798260&amp;categoryId=42129&amp;cid=42129|title=한국교육의 발전|last=피|first=정만|date=|work=|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=Development of Korea education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[College entrance exam|the college entrance exam]] and overheating [[Private lesson|private tutoring]] were emerging as [[educational issues]] and general problems of society at that time. At the time, the [[Ministry of education|education authorities]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;said that over-heating private tutoring not only greatly hampered the normalization of school education, but also created a sense of crisis among the classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=524548&amp;cid=46615&amp;categoryId=46615|title=교육개혁|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=Reforms in education}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the private tutoring and supplementary classes were abolished after the educational reform measures, the school judged that the preparation for the college entrance exam was insufficient only with regular classes. It was an origin of the night self-learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 9, 1981|title=변형 보충수업 고교에 '자율학습' 바람|trans-title="Self-regulated Learning boom" at high schools|url=|journal=Dong-A News|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the education authorities continuously prohibited night self-learning from being directed against the normalization of education measures, but schools in the front line continued to violate the ban, making night free learning secretly. In the past, this had been repeated over and over again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=음성적으로 실시되는 '자율학습'|last=|first=|date=April 23, 1981|work=Dong-A News|access-date=|trans-title=Secretly, Self-learning at school}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as more and more schools implemented night self- learning, the educational authorities admitted that in principle, night self-learning should be done through the free participation of the students.

=== Development ===
Since the introduction of high school [[standardization]], high schools in most parts of the country have tried to nurture [[Reputation|prestigious]] schools. The school increased the night self-study to get more students into top [[University|universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=110&amp;oid=028&amp;aid=0000100800|title=지역 명문고 육성, 이대로 좋은가?|last=박|first=명섭|date=|work=The Hankyoreh|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=Nurturing prestigious high schools. Is it this good?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are persistent opinions about the abolition of night self-learning. Because they have thought the compulsory night self-learning system ignored the [[Human rights|human rights of students]] and the educational effects were also doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0000039429|title='0교시, 야간자율학습'-학생.학부모 반발|last=강|first=경국|date=|work=Newsis|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title='0 hour, night self-learning’- Students, parent's resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the Ministry of Education banned the uniform supplementary learning at high schools and the night self-learning after 10 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0001400972|title=획일적 보충학습ㆍ야간자율학습 금지|last=강|first=경국|date=|work=Yonhap News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=A uniform supplement is prohibited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present ==
In present, 1,900 out of 2,258 schools across the Korea are found to be implementing night self-learning. Although there are many schools that make students do night self-learning voluntarily, there are still high schools that force their students to do it compulsorily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/View/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0002370789|title=김병욱, '10개 중 8개' 자율적이지 않은 자율학습 지적|last=박|first=정훈|date=2017-10-24|website=Ohmynews|trans-title=‘8 out of 10’ the point out, not autonomous self-learning|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, night self-learning is gradually being abolished in the Greater [[Seoul]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=056&amp;aid=0010491700|title=경기도의회, 강제 야간자율학습 방지 조례 추진|last=임|first=명규|date=|work=KBS|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=Gyeonggi Province's parliament, Enforcement of the ordinance preventing forced night self-learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201612041117001&amp;code=620104|title=인천 중·고교 강제 방과후학교·야간자율학습 전면금지|last=박|first=준철|date=|work=The Kyunghyang Journal|access-date=2018-05-03|language=ko|trans-title=Full ban on night self-learning in Incheon’s high school}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect ==

=== Negative effects ===
Under the current system, high schools that have abolished night self-learning accept students to study in classrooms through application. However, students who have no place to study at night eventually study at school. Instead of reading in rooms and private educational institutes, students choose school because of the high financial burden. Some students are having dinner at [[convenience store]]s because there is no dinner offered when the night self-learning was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsis.com/view/?id=NISX20170209_0014694467&amp;cID=10803&amp;pID=10800|title='고교 자율학습 폐지·석식 중단'에 성남지역 학부모 '반발'|last=이|first=정하|date=2017-02-19|work=Newsis|access-date=|trans-title=School parents in Seongnam complain high school because of abolish night self-learning and stop dinner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.viva100.com/main/view.php?key=20180517010006133|title=경기교육감 선거에 ‘9시 등교, 석식·야자 폐지’ 효과 놓고 공방 치열|last=강|first=진|date=2018-05-18|work=Bridge economy|access-date=|trans-title=A heated battle over the effect of " abolition of 9 o'clock go to school, dinner "}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools and local governments should make sure that students who participate in night self-study receive a good dinner at school. These are the minimum considerations that an educator can give to students who want to study.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lecture.cfe.org/info/bbsDetail.php?cid=12033&amp;pn=4&amp;idx=45347|title=야간자율학습의 유용성(有用性)|last=이|first=명호|date=2016-07-25|website=대학시장경제강좌|trans-title=The usefulness of night self-study|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the only problem. Private education costs are rising as more student flock to nearby private educational institutes. Furthermore, if all students had similar quality education and private education cost was reduced due to night self-learning, the private education portion increased by the night self-learning abolition, changing the quality of education for each student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.ebs.co.kr/ebsnews/allView/10656579/N|title=교사 71% "야간자율학습 강제 폐지 반대"|last=이|first=동현|date=2017-03-27|work=EBS News|access-date=|trans-title=71 % of teachers against abolition of night self-learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, innovation schools in [[Busan]] have strengthened public education by freely implementing night free learning. Due to that, the number of under-grade students has declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=[사설] 야간자율학습 폐지가 가져온 학력 신장 효과|last=디지털뉴스부|first=|date=2015-12-01|work=The Kookje Daily News|access-date=|trans-title=The Educational Effects of the Abolition of Night Self Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive effects ===
Of course, there are positive effects as well. Unconditioned night self-learning is really [[Passion (emotion)|passionate]] about studying and involves students who try to get into college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.knnews.co.kr/news/articleView.php?idxno=1139329|title="새로운 야간자율학습, 학생·학교에 달렸다"|last=이|first=학수|date=2015-02-10|work=Gyeong-nam news|access-date=|trans-title=" New night self-learning for students and schools "}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the [[Academy|academic]] atmosphere in classrooms that enforce night self-learning is created. Or, students who want to do physical education or other self-improvement can study or attend private educational institutes. Ultimately, it is meaningful that the great cause of [[human rights]] for students has been fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.post.naver.com/viewer/postView.nhn?volumeNo=4558216&amp;memberNo=21959512|title=경기도 모든 학교 2017년부터 야자 폐지|last=이|first=영주|date=2016-06-12|work=Yonhap News|access-date=|trans-title=All schools in Gyeonggi-do will abolish night self-learning in 2017.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of people now support the abolition of night self-learning.  Unlike regular classes, where all students have to be guided manually, night self-learning is a time when students can self-led their studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there are many people who oppose it. The main reason for this is rising [[private education]] costs, followed by a rise in [[juvenile delinquency]] and a decrease in learning time. Therefore, a policy to reduce private education expenses is necessary to increase the effectiveness of the abolition of night self-learning. In addition, various programs within the school should be developed and operated considering students ' [[career path]] or aptitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=277&amp;aid=0003908937|title=전남 도민·학부모 55%, "고등학교 야간자율학습 폐지해야"|last=노|first=해섭|date=|work=|access-date=|trans-title=55 % of parents in Jeollanam-do, " High school night self-learning should be abolished "}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NCSU Insect Museum''' is the center for research and training in insect [[systematics]] and [[biodiversity informatics]] at [[North Carolina State University]]. The Museum's collections hold more than 1.5 million specimens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insectmuseum.org/index.php|title=Insect Museum main page|publisher=NCSU Insect Museum|accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with major emphases on the insects of North Carolina and on the [[Auchenorrhyncha]] and [[Aphididae]] ([[Hemiptera]]) of the world. A smaller but historically important part of the collection (especially for bees of the eastern USA) is dedicated to [[Hymenoptera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dcbch2k9_1175qdmq66dt&amp;amp;invite=CJ_rkugD||last1=Deans |first1=AR |last2=Ernst |first2=AF |year=2009 |title=Past, present, and future of the NCSU Insect Museum. |publisher=Entomological Collections Network annual meeting, December 2009|accessdate=2010-05-10|via=Google Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Deitz (1983a&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Deitz, L. L.|year=1983|title= Featured institution - North Carolina State University at Raleigh|journal= Association of Systematics Collections Newsletter|volume= 11|pages= 65–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1983b&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Deitz, L. L.|year=1983|title=North Carolina State University Insect Collection|journal= Tymbal, Auchenorrhyncha Newsletter (Commonwealth Institute of Entomology, London)|volume= 2|pages= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) provides the most comprehensive reviews of the history of the NCSU Insect Museum. Insect reference collections started growing soon after the foundation of NC State University in 1889, with each individual collection being cared for by one curator. These multiple independent collections across campus were then collated into a single resource in 1952, then referred to as the Entomology Museum. This effort was organized by [[Zeno Payne Metcalf|Zeno P. Metcalf]], an Auchenorrhyncha [[systematist]] who served as the Insect Museum's first director.

This museum has since been referred to as the NCSU Insect Museum, and it continues to serve as a resource for entomologists who need to identify specimens, for researchers attempting to understand more about species distributions through time, for students learning insect taxonomy, and as a repository for vouchers that reference entomological research.

From 1999 to 2005, Haavisto worked for the [[United Nations]] in various tasks. He led the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) research groups in [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Liberia]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Sudan]]. He also coordinated the UN investigation in the effects of [[depleted uranium]] in Kosovo, [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/du/docu/d010105e.htm|title=UNEP samples from depleted uranium sites in Kosovo now being analyzed in five laboratories|date=5 January 2001|publisher=[[NATO]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haavisto also represented the UNEP in the investigations in the [[Baia Mare]] mining accident in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=81&amp;ArticleID=1178&amp;l=en|title=UNEP-led Balkans Task Force scientists begin sampling of Danube river in wake of Romania cyanide spill|date=15 February 1999|publisher=[[UNEP]]|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he was appointed as the special representative of the [[European Union]] in [[Sudan]] where he participated in the [[Darfur]] peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/node/186236|title=Sudan: EU Special Representative Pekka Haavisto hopeful about peace in Darfur|date=28 September 2005|publisher=[[ReliefWeb]]|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 and 2011 Haavisto was re-elected to the parliament from the electoral district of [[Helsinki (electoral district)|Helsinki]].

===Presidential election 2012===
[[File:Pekka Haavisto on nuclear power.ogv|thumb|right|Pekka Haavisto speaking about nuclear power at a public meeting in 2012.]]In 2011, Haavisto was nominated as the Green League candidate for the [[Finnish presidential election, 2012|Finnish presidential election of 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vihreat.fi/node/4|title=The Greens of Finland, Presidential elections candidate|publisher=[[Green League]]|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first round of the election on 22 January 2012, he finished second with 18.8 percent of the votes. In the run-off on 5 February, he garnered more than one million votes (37.4 percent), yet still losing to the [[National Coalition Party]] candidate, former Finance Minister [[Sauli Niinistö]].&lt;ref name=2012-first-round&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2012/01/presidential_elections_niinisto_haavisto_headed_for_second_round_3195175.html|title=Presidential elections: Niinistö, Haavisto headed for second round|date=22 January 2012|publisher=[[YLE|Finnish Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Haavisto was the first openly gay candidate and the first male candidate to have served in [[siviilipalvelus|non-military service]] instead of the regular [[Conscription in Finland|military service]] to make it to the second round of presidential elections in Finland.

===Presidential election 2018===
In February 2017, Haavisto announced that he would reprise his candidacy in the 2018 [[Finnish presidential election, 2018|presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/art-2000005084134.html |title=Vihreiden Pekka Haavisto lähtee presidenttikisaan – "Pitää katsoa eteenpäin seuraavaan sataan vuoteen" |publisher=Helsingin sanomat |date=11 February 2017 |accessdate=11 February 2017 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision came after Haavisto had been approached multiple times by the Green League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1461984476887 |title=Vuoden 2018 presidenttipeli vielä auki – he saattavat havitella paikkaa |publisher=Helsingin sanomat |date=1 May 2016 |accessdate=1 May 2016 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the election, Haavisto placed second with 12.4 percent of the votes, while president Niinistö went on to secure his second term with a majority of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/TPV-2018_1/fi/ehdtulos_kokomaa.html |title=Presidentinvaali 2018, 1. vaali: Ehdokkaiden äänet|publisher=Ministry of Justice|date=28 January 2018 |accessdate=29 January 2018 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return as chairman===
In October 2018, the chairman of the Green League [[Touko Aalto]] announced that he is resigning from his post, citing depression and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greens chair Touko Aalto steps down: "I need more time for recovery"|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/greens_chair_touko_aalto_steps_down_i_need_more_time_for_recovery_/10473177|accessdate=5 November 2018|publisher=Yle|date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision prompted an immediate leadership election, with the goal to elect a temporary chairman to lead the party into the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2019|2019 parliamentary elections]] and until the next party convention. As many members of the party called for more prominent and experience politicians to take part in the election, Haavisto announced his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pekka Haavisto asettuu ehdolle vihreiden puheenjohtajaksi – kuvailee viiden kuukauden tynkäpestiä ”ei ihan helpoimmaksi hommaksi”|url=https://www.hs.fi/politiikka/art-2000005885184.html|accessdate=5 November 2018|publisher=Yle|date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 2018, he defeated MP [[Outi Alanko-Kahiluoto]] in a leadership election and was thus chosen to lead the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pekka Haavisto valittiin vihreiden johtoon murskaäänin 40–1 – puolueella on Touko Aallon uupumisen myötä ”peiliin katsomisen paikka”|url=https://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/04112018/art-2000005887795.html|accessdate=5 November 2018|publisher=Yle|date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pieter Burman''' (23 October 1713&amp;nbsp;– 24 June 1778), also known as '''Peter''' or '''Pieter Burmann''' ({{lang-la|Petrus Burmannus}}) and distinguished from [[Pieter Burman the Elder|his uncle]] as {{nowrap|"'''the Younger'''"}} (''{{lang|la|Secundus}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Junior}}''), was a Dutch [[philology|philologist]].

{{anchor|Biography|History}}

==Life==
Born at [[Amsterdam]], he was brought up by his uncle in [[university of Leiden|Leiden]], and afterwards studied [[law]] and philology under [[Carl Andreas Duker|CA Duker]] and [[Arnold von Drakenborch]] at [[Utrecht University|Utrecht]]. In 1735 he was appointed professor of eloquence and history at [[Franeker]], with which the chair of [[poetry]] was combined in 1741. In the following year he left Franeker for Amsterdam to become professor of [[history]] and philology at the Athenaeum. He was subsequently professor of poetry (1744), general librarian (1752), and inspector of the gymnasium (1753). In 1777 he retired, and died on 24 June 1778 at Santhorst, near [[Wassenaar]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Burmann, Pieter "the Younger" |display=Burmann, Pieter |volume=4|page=846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He resembled his more famous uncle in the manner and direction of his studies, and in his violent disposition, which involved him in quarrels with contemporaries, notably Saxe and [[Christian Adolph Klotz]]. He was a man of extensive learning, and had a great talent for Latin poetry. His most valuable works are:
*''Anthologia Veterum Latinorum Epigrammatum et Poematum'' (1759–1763)
*''Aristophanis comoediae Novem'' (1760)
*''Rhetorica''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He completed the editions of [[Vergil]] (1767){{sfnp|Burman|1746}} and [[Claudian]] (1760), which had been left unfinished by his uncle, and commenced an edition of [[Propertius]], one of his best works, which was only half printed at the time of his death. It was completed by L. van Santen and published in 1780.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The '''Pilar Barbosa Education Program''' is a program in [[Puerto Rico]] created as a means to provide [[professional development]] training opportunities for public school practitioners and educators in that city. The program serves as a catalyst for long term educational realignment using the graduates as agents of sustainable reform in the public school system.

==The program==

On July 27, 1997, the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]] approved law #53, authored by Sen. [[Kenneth McClintock]], a Barbosa protégé, which created "The [[Pilar Barbosa]] Program of Educational Interns". The program was later renamed "The Pilar Barbosa Educational Internship Program."

Program participants are K-12 public school teachers and administrators from Puerto Rico. Every summer, 25 participants go to [[Washington, D.C.]] to take part in a myriad of activities including workshops, tours, lectures and group assignments that focus on U.S. education trends and policies in the context of Puerto Rico, integration of technology in the curriculum, innovative curriculum design, and [[educational leadership]].

Close to 300 public school educators have participated in the program since its inception. [[The Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars]] successfully administered the Pilar Barbosa Education Internship Program in Washington, D.C. the summers of 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005-2009. The Washington Center provides an integrated academic and [[work experience]] to prepare participants for lives of leadership, professional achievement, and [[civic engagement]].

==Goals and themes==
The Pilar Barbosa Internship Program is designed within the context of four basic themes: ''Leadership in Education'', ''Federal Education Policies in the Context of Puerto Rico'', ''21st Century Teaching'' and ''Integration of Technology in the Classroom''.

Leadership in education allows participants to look into education trends and how they may impact K-12 [[education in Puerto Rico]]. Federal education policies in the context of Puerto Rico focuses primarily on [[No Child Left Behind]] and other federal education issues. 21st century teaching looks particularly into various models on innovative teaching in math and science, and strategies for curriculum integration. Finally, models for utilizing technology in the classroom demonstrate practical uses of multimedia in K-12 teaching.

The Pilar Barbosa Education Internship Program delivers on these themes using a series of seminars, orientations, panels, workshops and visits to educational facilities, through which participants broaden their perspectives about innovating education in Puerto Rico.

:''"Canadian Spelling Bee" redirects here. The [[Spelling Bee of Canada]] is a separate, unaffiliated and non-sanctioned competition.''
The '''Postmedia Canspell National Spelling Bee''', formerly called the '''Canwest Canspell National Spelling Bee''', was a [[spelling bee]] held annually in Canada since 2005. The bee is affiliated with the United States-based [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] and uses similar rules and word lists, adapted to best suit Canadian usage and spelling. It is organized by the [[Postmedia Network]], though it was previously organized by now bankrupt [[Canwest Global Communications]], parent company of 9 of the regional sponsors. Canwest Canspell ended in 2012.

==Competition==

As of 2011, regional finals are held in 21 Canadian cities from [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]].

The winner in each of the regional finals participated in the national final in [[Ottawa]] each April from 2005 to 2010. From 2005 to 2009, the regional winners also qualified for the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] in Washington D.C. whether they won the nationals or not. In 2010, because of the economic downturn and Canwest's bankruptcy, only the winner of the nationals participated in the SNSB. From 2011 onwards, the top 3 spellers, including the national champion, will compete in the SNSB.

The name of the competition was changed subtly in 2009 from "CanWest CanSpell" to "Canwest Canspell", in line with Canwest's elimination of [[CamelCase]] spelling from its corporate brand.

In late 2010, the competition was renamed the '''Postmedia Canspell Spelling Bee''' as a result of Canwest's bankruptcy in October 2009, where Canwest's assets were sold to [[Shaw Communications]] and the [[Postmedia Network]].

==Media and the Bee==

When Canwest sponsored the bee, it enjoyed significant coverage from Canwest-owned media outlets. A documentary on the event was produced in 2005, a [[live television|live broadcast]] was aired in 2007, and edited versions of the finals were broadcast in 2006 and 2008. These broadcasts were all aired on the [[Global Television Network]]. Live [[webcast]]s are also featured each year. In 2011, CBC became the new broadcast partner and created a special one-hour primetime feature on the Canadian final called "Spelling Night in Canada". It usually takes place in the last week of March.

All Postmedia daily newspapers participate in the spelling bee, with the exception of ''[[The Province]]'' in [[Vancouver]], as the company also owns the sponsoring ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''. Postmedia's ''[[National Post]]'', based in the Toronto area, serves as sponsor for that market. Uniquely, the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] competition was co-sponsored by the ''National Post'' and a Canwest-owned TV station, [[CHCH-TV]], and not a local paper such as ''[[The Hamilton Spectator]]''.  Hamilton does not have a local sponsor beyond 2009, after which CHCH was sold from Canwest to [[Channel Zero Inc.]]  Hamilton spellers compete at the Toronto National Post spelling bee.

Other newspaper sponsors include the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'', ''[[The Telegram]]'' in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], ''[[The Chronicle Herald]]'' in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], ''[[The Chronicle-Journal]]'' in [[Thunder Bay]], and ''[[Charlottetown Guardian|The Guardian]]'' in [[Charlottetown]] and [[Kamloops Daily News|The Daily News]] in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]].

The [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] brand of [[General Motors]] was the presenting sponsor for 2005 and 2006. Saturn withdrew in 2007 and was replaced by [[Canada Post]]. Other national sponsors have included [[Air Canada]], [[AIC Limited]], [[Oxford University Press]], the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]], and the [[Lord Elgin Hotel]]. The current national sponsors are Egg Farmers of Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24543">The '''Rev. Dr. Robert Vernon Lee, III''' is a humanitarian, Episcopal priest and is chairman and CEO of [[Jacksonville, Florida]]-based nonprofit [[FreshMinistries]] and its international arm, [[Be The Change International]].  Dr. Lee is responsible for the creation of a number of unique and successful global initiatives and partnerships addressing issues of poverty worldwide.  In the United States, efforts began with programs vital to the restoration of core-city Jacksonville.  He has also spearheaded partnerships in [[Africa]] designed to combat [[HIV/AIDS]] and to address the United Nations [[Millennium Development Goals]], uniquely addressing all goals at once.&lt;ref name="jacksonville1"&gt;{{cite web|author=JEFF BRUMLEYThe Times-Union |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/111804/met_17219126.shtml |title=Dream led to FreshMinistries |publisher=Jacksonville.com |date=2004-11-18 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dr. Robert Vernon Lee, III, was born January 14, 1951 in [[El Paso, Texas]] to Colonel Robert V. Lee, Jr. and Cynthia Warren Lee. He is a renowned Episcopal Priest, Humanitarian, and Founder/CEO and Chairman of [[FreshMinistries]] and [[Be The Change International]].

He earned his bachelor's degree from [[Vanderbilt University]] and continued graduate studies in journalism at the [[University of Georgia]]. Upon accepting his calling into the ministry, he earned a master’s of divinity from [[Yale University]] and a doctorate of theology from [[New York Theological Seminary]].

After serving as rector of [[Church of Our Saviour (Jacksonville, Florida)|Church of Our Saviour]] in Jacksonville, Florida, Dr. Lee was called to establish a new kind of ministry. Having created the concept for [[FreshMinistries]] in 1988 and incorporating it into a working [[501(c)(3)]] in 1989, Dr. Lee elevated the organization to a full-time ministry in 1994.
 
It was his dream to bring his ministry out of the church and into the community to serve all faiths and races. His interfaith, interracial outreach unites people in need and the people who have resources to share with the less fortunate. Dr. Lee’s mission for FreshMinistries and its partners is to utilize all available resources as tools to empower individuals in need with opportunities to improve their lives and those of their families. These opportunities, provided through the many programs of FreshMinistries, work through education, economic redevelopment, health initiatives and housing in communities throughout the world.

Currently serving as a non-stipendiary [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] for Outreach and Ecumenism in the Diocese of Florida, he's also served parishes in [[Connecticut]] and [[Florida]].

He has served as the Chairman of the Interfaith Sub-Committee of the 2005 Super Bowl Host Committee in Jacksonville and as a director for: St. Mary’s Outreach Ministry in Jacksonville, the Samaritan Center, Dignity-U-Wear, Christian Healing Ministries, and the Florida Council of Churches.
 
By appointment of Governor [[Jeb Bush]], Dr. Lee currently serves as a member of the Governor’s Faith-based Advisory Board for the state of Florida.

As a mayoral appointee he also serves on the Mayor’s Faith-based and Community Advisory Board for the city of Jacksonville. Dr. Lee is also the first head of a not-for-profit organization to serve as a Director on the Board of the Jacksonville Regional Chamber of Commerce.

He also serves on the board of directors for the Jacksonville Interfaith Council, [[Habitat for Humanity]] of Jacksonville (HabiJax), and the Jacksonville Urban League. He is also a member of the [[Compass Rose Society]], an organization of the [[Anglican Communion]] serving the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].
 
By appointment of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], Dr. Lee has also been inducted into the [[Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].
 
Dr. Lee was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] and continues to serve under President [[Barack Obama]] as a key member of the inaugural [[President's Council On Financial Literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/financial-institution/fin-education/council/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109064107/http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/financial-institution/fin-education/council/ |date=January 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently resides in Jacksonville, Florida with his wife, Mirte de Boer Lee, and his two children, Robert V. Lee IV and Rebecca A. Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/98/138/ |title=Building hope. Changing lives - The Rev. Dr. Robert V. Lee III |publisher=FreshMinistries |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Partnerships==
Dr. Lee is responsible for creating several important and unique partnerships to extend the [[FreshMinistries]] vision globally.

===Siyafundisa===
FreshMinistries' track record of positively affecting poverty-related problems and administering grants led to a 5-year, $10 million [[USAID]] grant in 2004 for HIV/AIDS education in [[South Africa]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Namibia]].  Dr. Lee helped initiate a partnership between FreshMinistries and the Church of the Province of Southern Africa to utilize the Anglican Church's presence and existing infrastructure to administer peer-based HIV/AIDS prevention programs.&lt;ref name="jacksonville1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/94/253/ |title=Building hope.

===Global Action Partnership===
In 2009, The [[Anglican Communion]] approached Dr. Lee about bringing worldwide the 6-Point Community Initiative, a holistic approach to community improvement that has been successful in Jacksonville, FL.  Dr. Lee began talks with Hellen Wangusa, Anglican Observer at the [[United Nations]]; and [[Olara Otunnu]], president of the [[LBL Foundation for Children]], winner of the German Africa Prize in 2002 and the [[Sydney Peace Prize]] in 2005, and 2011 [[Uganda]] presidential candidate, about creating a Global Action Partnership (GAP) that would address all of the United Nation’s [[Millennium Development Goals]] at once, the first program of its kind.  In November 2009, GAP was signed into existence in [[New York City]].
 
The creation of GAP was given a boost within the [[Anglican]] community by receiving the approval and support of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], The Most Reverend [[Dr. Rowan Williams]], at a dinner during the Episcopal Church's General Convention in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethechangeinternational.org/home/news/138-global-action-partnership-created |title=Global Action Partnership created |publisher=Be The Change International |date=2009-12-29 |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723072519/http://www.bethechangeinternational.org/home/news/138-global-action-partnership-created |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bethechangeinternational1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethechangeinternational.org/home/news/136-btci-announces-global-action-partnership |title=BTCI announces Global Action Partnership |publisher=Be The Change International |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723072542/http://www.bethechangeinternational.org/home/news/136-btci-announces-global-action-partnership |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]===
In the wake of Haiti's devastating earthquake in 2010, [[FreshMinistries]]/Be The Change International (BTCI) was asked by the US Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate a major aid and relief operation there.  When Dr. Lee visited [[Hait]]i soon after, he saw that Haiti wasn't in need of just immediate aid, but also long-term, holistic improvement to positively effect every aspect of Haitian society.  Soon, the concept for "'''Tomorrow's Haiti'''" was on paper and partners began to sign up.

“'''Tomorrow’s Haiti'''” will create initiatives in Haiti that will simultaneously address education, economic development, health, safety, safe shelter and clean water, and family foundations.  The program will be the first of its kind, addressing all of the UN’s [[Millennium Development Goals]] at once, modeled on FreshMinistries’ successful HIV/AIDS education program in South Africa, "Siyafundisa", in which it partnered with the [[Episcopal Diocese]] in [[South Africa]], as well as FreshMinistries/BTCI’s thriving holistic approach to creating long-term sustainable change in inner-city Jacksonville.

Currently, the program is using the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] churches and 254 schools within BAEH’s network as community centers from which to distribute relief aid to the Haitian people and introduce the community to the “Tomorrow’s Haiti” empowerment plan.

By starting with education – including vocational and life skills training for young adults, as well as HIV/AIDS health curriculum introduced into the BAEH schools – “Tomorrow’s Haiti” will empower Haiti’s people to lift themselves up.  From there, “Tomorrow’s Haiti” will become a holistic initiative, based on UNICEF’s Child-Friendly City model, which will address the needs stated by word leaders and the Haitian Prime Minister during the United Nations Haiti Donors Conference in 2010.

So far, BTCI as signed memorandums of understanding with: The Rt. Rev. Jean-Zache Duracin, Bishop of [[Episcopal Diocese of Haiti]]; and The Honorable [[Jacques-Edouard Alexis]], former Haitian Prime Minister and National Director of Centre National de Recherche et de Formation (CENAREF).

To date, BTCI’s emergency relief effort has shipped to the Haitian people many supplies, including three ambulances (one of which was delivered to the Haitian government), emergency aid, food, water, water purification systems, clothing, school supplies, large generators, and 147 large tents to serve as temporary schools and shelter.  BTCI plans to ship more than 100 additional large tents to serve as schools and shelter, as well as medical equipment such as surgical beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethechangeinternational.org/home/news/141-btci-enters-agreement |title=BTCI enters agreement with Bishop of Episcopal Diocese in Haiti and former Prime Minister of Haiti to rebuild the country |publisher=Be The Change International |date=2010-07-02 |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723072628/http://www.bethechangeinternational.org/home/news/141-btci-enters-agreement |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revitalization in Jacksonville==
As the chairman of FreshMinistries, Dr. Lee is responsible for a number of initiatives that have dramatically affected the urban core of Jacksonville in positive ways.&lt;ref name="jacksonville1"/&gt;

Former Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney said, "FreshMinistries is one of the best things going on in Jacksonville.  They're living proof of the power of the spirit in our political and economic life."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freshministries.org/news-scans/1999-05-02-a%20fresh-start.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Dr. Lee was named a "Change Agent" by the ''[[Florida Times-Union]]'' for creating FreshMinistries, "helping people start businesses, revitalize their neighborhoods and get out of debt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Times |first=The |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/032706/bus_21457607.shtml |title=More change agents |publisher=Jacksonville.com |date=2006-03-27 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===6-Point Community Initiative===
Dr. Lee created the concept of a holistic model for community revitalization that simultaneously addresses all areas of needed improvement at once.  For Jacksonville’s Eastside, these areas are education, affordable housing, economic development, family strengthening, safety and health.
The initiative works in a number of ways, including focusing on partnerships with local, state and national organizations and government agencies.  At times, FreshMinistries becomes the lead agency in managing a project.  Other times, it is a partner with other agencies working toward similar goals.  Notable partners include former Florida Governor [[Jeb Bush]], Jacksonville Mayor [[John Peyton (U.S. politician)|John Peyton]], [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] School Superintendent Ed Pratt-Dannals, and Jacksonville Sheriff [[John Rutherford (sheriff)|John Rutherford]].

A unique aspect of the initiative is that it works toward developing other programs, initiatives and improvements that will be self-sufficient and community-owned, constantly customizing and updating the needs based on what the community says it needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/71/87/ |title=Building hope. Changing lives - How We Work |publisher=FreshMinistries |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dr. Lee:

"If a community doesn’t want to help itself, you can’t force the help upon them.  We know that only when a community champions its own cause and takes ownership of the potential improvements can this be truly successful."

"Small grassroots efforts are more effective in working with individual communities than large-scale efforts because they are able to customize and personalize their approaches and adapt quickly to changing needs."&lt;ref name="bethechangeinternational1"/&gt;

===Crime rate drop in Jacksonville's Eastside===
In late 2009, Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office Officer Stephen Gallagher announced at a community meeting on the Eastside that violent crime in the area was down 34 percent and property crime was down 32 percent from 2008.  Gallagher credited the Eastside Neighborhood Association, an initiative of FreshMinistries, as an “extremely important” part of the drop in crime.

Also responsible for the drop in crime were neighborhood cleanups and several neighborhood anti-crime walks organized by FreshMinistries to include Jacksonville Sheriff John Rutherford, local council persons, area patrol officers and neighborhood leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/226/139/ |title=Building hope.

===Recognition by Jacksonville Sheriff's Office===
In August 2008, Dr. Lee and FreshMinistries Communities Empowering Youth (CEY) director, Michelle Hughes, were awarded for their work in the community by the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office (JSO).  This recognition, according to JSO, was for their neighborhood anti-crime walks, CEY’s efforts in assisting the [[Police Athletic League]] (PAL), and the rest of FreshMinistries’ initiatives that focus on community improvement and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/226/237/ |title=Building hope.

===FreshMinistries formally recognized by U.S. Treasury===
In September 2005, the [[U.S. Treasury]] awarded the [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] Award for Excellence in Financial Education to FreshMinistries for its Individual Development Account (IDA) Partnership and its work in providing financial education to Jacksonville, FL communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/js2952.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111233058/http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/js2952.htm |date=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacksonville chosen for Financial Access Pilot===
In April 2008, Jacksonville, FL was chosen as one of eight cities in the U.S. to participate in a new pilot program to “increase financial education and bank and credit union accounts for Americans currently outside of the financial mainstream.”  The pilot was recommended by several members of the President’s Council on Financial Literacy, including Dr. Lee.

Jacksonville Mayor [[John Peyton (U.S. politician)|John Peyton]] said, "We're honored to have Jacksonville chosen to participate in this worthwhile new initiative. Our existing efforts, under the leadership of FreshMinistries, recognized in 2005 by the U.S. Treasury for Excellence in Financial Literacy … will be able to reach more low-to-moderate income families and help them save for the future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp954.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106025640/http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp954.htm |date=January 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacksonville Hospitality Institute===
The Jacksonville Hospitality Institute (JHI), a FreshMinistries initiative, is a 9-week free [[hospitality]] training program for underemployed and unemployed adults.  The program includes hands-on training, life skills training and job placement assistance via partnerships with local hotels.  The program is generally considered life-changing for most of its students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/interact/blog/freshministries/2009-12-02/jhi_grad_embodies_building_hope_changing_lives |title=JHI grad embodies 'Building hope.

===Beaver Street Enterprise Center===
The [[Beaver Street Enterprise Center]] (BSEC), a FreshMinistries initiative, is a full-service core-city small business incubator, the only one of its kind in Florida.  In 2008, the incubator’s clients created 366 new jobs in Jacksonville and generated $16.5 million in taxable revenues.  Its tenants have won a number of awards for their success.  One of its graduates, A. Harold &amp; Associates, grew to 38 employees and $6.2 million in revenues while at BSEC.  Florida Governor [[Charlie Crist]] visited the incubator in September 2007, calling BSEC “an excellent model for other communities to follow.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/100107/ner_204538181.shtml|title=Governor praises work of Beaver Street Enterprise Center - Jacksonville.com|work=jacksonville.com|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/220/237/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/75/251/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida State College at Jacksonville===
Dr. Lee was responsible for spearheading a partnership between FreshMinistries and [[Florida State College at Jacksonville]] (FSCJ) to create a tuition-free, accelerated [[welding]] training program for Eastside neighborhood adults who are unemployed and underemployed.  The program's first cycle has successfully trained 25 adults, with all graduates of the program guaranteed jobs through Atlantic Marine as they become available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/219/290/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/236/237/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klutho building restoration===
In 1998, the City of Jacksonville asked FreshMinistries to take over the restoration of an important historical landmark, The Klutho Apartment Building, designed by [[Henry John Klutho]], as part of a city-wide effort to revitalize economic growth in the [[Springfield, Jacksonville, Florida|Springfield]] neighborhood.  The building now houses nonprofits and small businesses that are also working to restore Springfield.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freshministries.org/content/view/76/94/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/071999/bus_1h10real.html|title=Klutho restoration on tap soon - Jacksonville.com|author=Earl Daniels|work=jacksonville.com|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/091499/met_2b1Kluth.html|title=Klutho could key Springfield rebirth - Jacksonville.com|author=Gordon Jackson|work=jacksonville.com|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/051599/bus_1C1kluth.html|title=Klutho-designed apartment building to be restored - Jacksonville.com|author=Nicole Ostrow|work=jacksonville.com|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation New Hope===
In 1999, FreshMinistries launched an initiative, called Operation New Hope, to train "forgotten" adults (those with troubled backgrounds) in Jacksonville in the construction industry, leading to employment opportunities. Aside from restoring individuals the program also restored neighborhoods and provided low-income housing opportunities for core city residents.  Operation New Hope is now no longer affiliated with FreshMinistries, having become its own separate, sustainable entity, and has since expanded its reach and operations in Jacksonville to include the re-entry and training of recently incarcerated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/080702/neR_10096631.shtml|title=Operation New Hope gave desperate man new chance - Jacksonville.com|author=The Times-Union|work=jacksonville.com|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freshministries.org/news-scans/1999-06-26-freshministries-launches-new-hope.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sermon to President George W. Bush==
In 2000, Dr. Lee delivered a sermon to President George W. Bush during his visit to Jacksonville, FL.  In the sermon he charged President Bush and world leaders to establish justice through compassion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freshministries.org/news-scans/2000-11-10-Bush-hears-sermon.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Birklehof School''' ({{lang-de|Schule Birklehof}}) is a [[progressive education]]al [[boarding school]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|grammar school]] with a holistic approach located in [[Hinterzarten]] in the [[High Black Forest]] in [[Germany]], approximately 25&amp;nbsp;km from [[Freiburg]]. It is a private coeducational secondary school (German: [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]). Currently, the school has approximately 230 students, 170 of whom are boarders who live on campus. The school was established by educator [[Kurt Hahn]] in 1932 and from the beginning accepted girls and boys. Under the Nazi regime, Hahn was forced to emigrate to [[Scotland]] where he founded [[Gordonstoun School]] as well as later [[Outward Bound]], [[Round Square]] and the [[United World Colleges]].

== Location ==
The school is in the postal district of [[Hinterzarten]], although much of the building lies on the territory of neighbouring [[Breitnau]]. The building ''Studio 1'' lies on the boundary and is thus used occasionally for joint council meetings between the two municipalities which, accourding to municipal rules, must take place on their own soil..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breitnau: Feuerwehr und Abwasser|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=Badische Zeitung|url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/breitnau/feuerwehr-und-abwasser--48033673.html|format=|accessdate=2017-06-27|last=Dieter Maurer|date=2011-07-30|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breitnau: Gemeinsame Ratssitzung: ÜBRIGENS: Zum Beschluss über die Grenze|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=Badische Zeitung|url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/breitnau/uebrigens-zum-beschluss-ueber-die-grenze--123853275.html|format=|accessdate=2017-06-27|last=Eva Korinth|date=2016-07-01|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational philosophy ==
The school stands in the tradition of [[progressive education]] reform, or "reform pedagogy" as it is called in Germany. This movement originated in the 1920s. Among other things, Birklehof prides itself in giving students real responsibility in the running of the school. Student representatives have voting rights on all educational matters in general conferences.

== History ==
Birklehof was founded in 1932 by German educator [[Kurt Hahn]]. The old Birklehof is a grade-listed farmhouse dating back to 1550. In the early 1920s, a villa was built on the Birklehof estate by a German industrialist. The estate was then given to Hahn for his school. Hahn, after being driven from Germany by the Nazis, went on to found [[Gordonstoun]] in Scotland in 1934 and [[Atlantic College]] in 1962. It is also a sister school to the more famous [[Schule Schloss Salem|Schloss Salem]], founded by Hahn in 1920. In 1946, it was reopened by its then head, German philosopher [[Georg Picht]].

== Developments ==
In 2009, the newest building project was completed with the inauguration of the rebuilt Neubirkle boarding house. This state-of-art eco building will be home to 19 boarders and two teachers' families. It also boasts a flat for a boarding house assistant.
In the academic year 2010—11, the school will launch a new third middle-school stream. In addition to Foreign Languages or Sciences, students of Years 8 to 10 will be able to choose a musical specialisation. This will include aspects of drama, film making, fine arts and music. It follows an integrated, project-based approach.
Furthermore, the school is in the process of switching to 8 instead of 9 years of grammar school, which will be implemented fully in 2012.

== Boarding Houses ==
Birklehof school currently has ten boarding houses. Reflecting its educational philosophy, all houses (with the exception of the Neuer Hirschen West and Neuer Hirschen Ost) have integrated teaching rooms and teachers' flats as well as students' bedrooms. With the exception of the coeducational Unterhaus (Years 5-7) they are all single-sex houses, supervised by a resident houseparent.

'''Socratic questioning''' (or '''Socratic [[maieutics]]''')&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Brunschwig, Geoffrey Ernest Richard Lloyd (eds), [https://books.google.com/books?id=AXl9j4n2iP4C&amp;dq= ''A Guide to Greek Thought: Major Figures and Trends''], Harvard University Press, 2003, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; was named after [[Socrates]], who was a philosopher in c. 470 BCE–c. 399 BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Socrates Biography|url=https://www.biography.com/people/socrates-9488126|website=The Biography.com website|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Socrates utilized an educational method that focused on discovering answers by asking questions from his students. Socrates believed that "the disciplined practice of thoughtful questioning enables the scholar/student to examine ideas and be able to determine the validity of those ideas" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Socratic Questioning|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/socratic/second.html|website=Starting Point - Teaching Entry Level Geoscience|publisher=Carleton College|accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Plato]], a student of Socrates, described this rigorous method of teaching to explain that the teacher assumes an ignorant mindset in order to compel the student to assume the highest level of knowledge &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Socratic Questioning|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/socratic/second.html|website=Starting Point - Teaching Entry Level Geoscience|publisher=Carleton College|accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, a student has the ability to acknowledge contradictions, recreate inaccurate or unfinished ideas and critically determine necessary thought.  

Socratic questioning is a form of disciplined [[question]]ing that can be used to pursue [[thought]] in many directions and for many purposes, including: to explore complex ideas, to get to the [[truth]] of things, to open up issues and problems, to uncover assumptions, to analyze concepts, to distinguish what we know from what we do not know, to follow out [[logical consequence]]s of thought or to control discussions. Socratic questioning is based on the foundation that thinking has structured logic, and allows underlying thoughts to be questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul|first1=Richard|last2=Binker|first2=A.J.|title=Critical Thinking: What Every Person Needs To Survive in a Rapidly Changing World|date=1990|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking|isbn=0-944583-08-3|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to distinguishing Socratic questioning from questioning ''per se'' is that Socratic questioning is systematic, disciplined, deep and usually focuses on fundamental concepts, principles, theories, issues or problems.

Socratic questioning is referred to in [[teaching]], and has gained currency as a concept in [[education]], particularly in the past two decades.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Teachers, students, or anyone interested in probing thinking at a deep level can construct Socratic questions and engage in these questions.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, R. and Elder, L. (2006). ''The Art of Socratic Questioning''. Dillon Beach, CA: Foundation for Critical Thinking.&lt;/ref&gt; Socratic questioning and its variants have also been extensively used in psychotherapy.

== Pedagogy ==
When teachers use Socratic questioning in teaching, their purpose may be to probe student thinking, to determine the extent of student knowledge on a given topic, issue or subject, to model Socratic questioning for students or to help students analyze a concept or line of reasoning. It is suggested that students should learn the discipline of Socratic questioning so that they begin to use it in reasoning through complex issues, in understanding and assessing the thinking of others and in following-out the implications of what they and others think. In fact, Socrates himself thought that questioning was the only defensible form of teaching.

In teaching, teachers can use Socratic questioning for at least two purposes:
* To deeply probe student thinking, to help students begin to distinguish what they know or understand from what they do not know or understand (and to help them develop intellectual humility in the process).
* To foster students' abilities to ask Socratic questions, to help students acquire the powerful tools of Socratic dialogue, so that they can use these tools in everyday life (in questioning themselves and others). To this end, teachers can model the questioning strategies they want students to emulate and employ. Moreover, teachers need to directly teach students how to construct and ask deep questions. Beyond that, students need practice to improve their questioning abilities.

Socratic questioning illuminates the importance of questioning in learning. This includes differentiating between systematic and fragmented thinking, while forcing individuals to understand the root of their knowledge and ideas. Educators who support the use of Socratic Questioning in educational settings argue that it helps students become active and independent learners. Examples of Socratic questions that are used for students in educational settings: &lt;ref&gt;'[https://web.archive.org/web/20101024112450/http://osiriseducational.co.uk/outstandingteaching/news/questions-questions-questions/ Outstanding Teaching]'.

== Socratic questioning and critical thinking ==

The art of Socratic questioning is intimately connected with [[critical thinking]] because the art of questioning is important to excellence of thought. Socrates argued for the necessity of probing individual knowledge, and acknowledging what one may not know or understand. Critical thinking has the goal of reflective thinking that focuses on what should be believed or done about a topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ennis|first1=Robert|title=Developing Minds: A Resource Book for Teaching Thinking, 3rd Edition|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socratic questioning adds another level of thought to critical thinking, by focusing on extracting depth, interest and assessing the truth or plausibility of thought. Socrates argued that a lack of knowledge is not bad, but students must strive to make known what they don't know through the means of a form of critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sofos|first1=Manolis|title=Critical Thinking: A Historical Overview|journal=Thinking for Career Practical Approach|issue=2|pages=1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking and Socratic questioning both seek meaning and truth. Critical thinking provides the rational tools to monitor, assess, and perhaps reconstitute or re-direct our thinking and action. This is what educational reformer [[John Dewey]] described as ''reflective inquiry'': "in which the thinker turns a subject over in the mind, giving it serious and consecutive consideration."&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holden|first1=James|title=Inquiry and the Literary Text: Constructing Discussions in the English Classroom. Classroom Practices in Teaching English.|journal=Classroom Practices in Teaching English|date=2002|volume=32|page=9|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED471390.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socratic questioning is an explicit focus on framing self-directed, disciplined questions to achieve that goal.

The technique of questioning or leading discussion is spontaneous, exploratory, and issue-specific.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Aswegen|first=EJ|last2=Brink|first2=HIL|last3=Steyn|first3=PJN|date=November 2011|title=Application and evaluation of a combination of socratic and learning through discussion techniques|url=|journal=Curtionis|volume=24|issue=4|pages=68–77|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Socratic educator listens to the viewpoints of the student and considers the alternative points of view.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is necessary to teach students to sift through all the information, form a connection to prior knowledge, and transform the data to new knowledge in a thoughtful way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It has been proposed in different studies that the "level of thinking that occurs is influenced by the level of questions asked".&lt;ref name="Yang 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Ya-Ting|last2=Newby|first2=Timothy|last3=Bill|first3=Robert|title=Using Socratic Questioning to Promote Critical Thinking Skills Through Asynchronous Discussion Forums in Distance Learning Environments|journal=The American Journal of Distance Education|date=January 7, 2010|volume=19|issue=3|page=164|doi=10.1207/s15389286ajde1903_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, utilizing the knowledge that students don't know stimulates their ability to ask more complex questions. This requires educators to create active learning environments that promote and value the role of critical thinking, mobilizing their ability to form complex thoughts and questions.&lt;ref name="Yang 2010" /&gt;

== Psychology ==
Socratic questioning has also been used in [[psychotherapy]], most notably as a [[cognitive restructuring]] technique in [[classical Adlerian psychotherapy]], [[logotherapy]], [[rational emotive behavior therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], and [[logic-based therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Gavin I. |last2=Egan |first2=Sarah J. |date=December 2015 |title=The Socratic method in cognitive behavioural therapy: a narrative review |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=863–879 |doi=10.1007/s10608-015-9707-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose is to help uncover the assumptions and evidence that underpin people's thoughts in respect of problems. A set of Socratic questions in cognitive therapy aim to deal with automatic thoughts that distress the patient:&lt;ref name="Beck1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith S. Beck|title=Cognitive Therapy: Basics and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHVIpQMZf-EC&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=25 May 2011|year=1995|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-0-89862-847-0|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Revealing the issue: 'What evidence supports this idea? And what evidence is against its being true?'
# Conceiving reasonable alternatives: 'What might be another explanation or viewpoint of the situation? Why else did it happen?' 
# Examining various potential consequences: 'What are worst, best, bearable and most realistic outcomes?' 
# Evaluate those consequences: 'What's the effect of thinking or believing this? What could be the effect of thinking differently and no longer holding onto this belief?' 
# [[Distancing (psychology)|Distancing]]: 'Imagine a specific friend/family member in the same situation or if they viewed the situation this way, what would I tell them?'

Careful use of Socratic questioning enables a therapist to challenge recurring or isolated instances of a person's illogical thinking while maintaining an open position that respects the internal logic to even the most seemingly illogical thoughts.

'''The Colleges of William &amp; Mary''' was the name of a short-lived educational system in [[Virginia]]. It included The [[College of William &amp; Mary]], the [[Richmond Professional Institute]], the [[Old Dominion University|Norfolk Division of the College of William &amp; Mary]], [[Christopher Newport University|Christopher Newport College]], and [[Richard Bland College]].&lt;ref name="CoWMAH"&gt;{{cite book|last=Godson|title=The College of William and Mary: A History|year=1993|publisher=King and Queen Press|isbn=0-9615670-4-X|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
In 1960, The College of William &amp; Mary ("The College") had two branch campuses, the [[Richmond Professional Institute]] (RPI), which it had operated since 1925, and the [[Old Dominion University|Norfolk Division of the College of William &amp; Mary]], which it had operated since 1930.

The [[General Assembly of Virginia]] passed H.B. 466 creating The Colleges of William &amp; Mary ("The Colleges") on March 3, 1960, and it took effect immediately.&lt;ref name=acts&gt;{{cite book|title=Index of Acts of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia|year=1972|publisher=Commonwealth of Virginia|location=Richmond}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of The College, [[Alvin Duke Chandler]], was chosen to be the administrative chancellor of the new system, with [[Davis Young Paschall]] replacing him as president.

==Operation==
As chancellor, however, Chandler attempted to manage the day-to-day operations of all five branches of The Colleges and, by doing so, began to alienate the presidents who served under him. The presidents of The College, RPI, and the Norfolk Division were originally to have more autonomy under the new system than they had had in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Luther|title=With Chandler Appointment Area College System Begun|newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot|date=29 May 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chandler did not allow that to happen. For example, Chandler required Lewis Webb, president of the Norfolk Division, to seek his approval in matters of hiring faculty and staff, granting leaves of absence, reviewing scholarly publications, and budget requests.&lt;ref name="CoWMAH"/&gt; Chandler also referred to the five college system as his "empire,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Alexander C.|title=The Chancellors of William and Mary|newspaper=Daily Press|date=30 May 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting his idea of his role at the top. He also maintained an office on the campus of The College, saying that he could not see how "the college chancellor possibly could conduct business away from the campus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Office Slated for Chandler in Ewell Hall|newspaper=Daily Press|date=7 July 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Norfolk Division was granted accreditation in its own right from the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] as a four-year college in December 1961 and was renamed the [[Old Dominion University|Norfolk College of the Colleges of William &amp; Mary]].&lt;ref name="CoWMAH"/&gt; RPI had been accredited in its own right since 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institution Details|url=http://sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=78480|publisher=Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As four-year schools with their own accreditation, the presidents of each began to resent the level of influence Chandler had in their day-to-day affairs and began to look for ways to change it.&lt;ref name="CoWMAH"/&gt;

==Dissolution==
The [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] decided to split the system into three parts, with The College, RPI, and the Norfolk College each having their own [[Board of Visitors|Boards of Visitors]] and with [[Richard Bland College]] and [[Christopher Newport University|Christopher Newport College]] remaining under the control of the Board of Visitors of The College of William &amp; Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNair|first=Sandy|title=W&amp;M Reorganization Bill is Set for Senate Passage; Governor's Approval Seen|hdl=10288/3670|newspaper=The Flat Hat|date=9 February 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill for the dissolution of the system was introduced by [[Virginia House of Delegates|Delegate]] Russell Carneal of Williamburg at the urging of some of the members of the Board of Visitors.&lt;ref name="CoWMAH"/&gt; However, other members of the Board of Visitors were opposed; there had been a vote of the Board against the dissolution of the system in December 1961.&lt;ref name="Mol"&gt;{{cite news|last=Molineux|first=Will|title=Chandler Appointed College Coordinator|newspaper=Daily Press|date=20 May 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dissolution became official with the passage of H.B. 156, signed into law by Governor [[Albertis Harrison]] on February 16, 1962.&lt;ref name="acts"/&gt; It specified that the system would be abolished as of July 1, 1962.

Upon its independence, the Norfolk College became Old Dominion College, now known as [[Old Dominion University]]. RPI remained an independent state school until 1968, when it merged with the [[Medical College of Virginia]] to form [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. Christopher Newport College remained an extension of The College until becoming independent in 1977, and became [[Christopher Newport University]] in 1992. Richard Bland College remains a junior college affiliated with The College.

After the dissolution of the system, Alvin Duke Chandler served as the coordinator for Christopher Newport College and Richard Bland College;&lt;ref name="Mol"/&gt; however, he resigned this position after only four months. He then became [[Chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary|chancellor]] of the College of William &amp; Mary, an honorary position that dates back to the founding of the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/chancellor/postcolonial/index.php|title=Post-Colonial Era Chancellors|publisher=The College of William &amp; Mary|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Topo''' is a [[robot]] designed in the 1980s by [[Androbot]] Inc., for the consumer and education markets. It was programmable via [[Apple II]] and there was also a user made program for the [[Windows 9x]] operating systems{{cn|date=May 2016}}. The programming language allows the robot to perform a set of geometric movements, to move about a room and perform tasks. It was like a servant robot, although it did not truly meet the requirements of a robot, as it had no sensors to use to receive input and then make decisions accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallrobot.com/topoii.html Topo: The world's first personal robots, from Androbot.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/tom-frisina-president-of-androbot-inc-holds-a-topos-model-news-photo/635239835 Picture], ''Tom Frisina, president of Androbot Inc., holds a Topos model personal robot. He sits in front of a background showing the surface of the moon, with the earth hanging in the sky above. The robot is designed to perform everyday tasks around the house.'', March 05, 1983, Credit: Corbis, Getty Images&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/news-photo/tom-frisina-president-of-androbot-inc-holds-a-sensor-for-a-news-photo/635239729 Picture], ''Tom Frisina, president of Androbot Inc., holds a sensor for a Topos model personal robot. The robot is designed to perform everyday tasks around the house.'', March 05, 1983, Credit: Corbis, Getty Images&lt;/ref&gt;

The robots were sold commercially starting in early 1983, and were intended to be inexpensive, lacking a complicated [[Robotic end effector|manipulating device]]. Units were beige molded plastic with two drive wheels as "feet" and stood about 36 inches tall. Arms on Topo 1 and 2 would fold out, but Topo 3 lacked arms altogether.  Operation was based on one of two [[programming language]]s, either [[Apple BASIC]], a modified version of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] language, or a version of [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]].

Communication was via a radio or infrared transmitter attached to a personal computer. Topo 2 and 3 used an infrared transmitter, and could be controlled by a four way pad on the top of their head that also served as the infrared receiver.

In its final versions, Topo abilities included a text-to-speech processor, so that users could program their robots to wander around the house and "speak" to humans. However, a fourth model was made but it never went into production (a Topo IV sheet was mailed during the final days of Androbot). It was more like the [[Brains On Board|B.O.B.]] (Brains On Board, an unreleased robot that was produced after the Topo series) robot than a Topo.

ANDROBOT 

Has Nolan Bushnell done it 
again? We'll just have to 
wait and see. If— in a few 
years — personal robots 
are as common as video 
games, then the man who 
founded Atari and Chuck E. 
Cheese Pizza Time The- 
atres can claim to have 
been at the forefront of yet 
another hi-tech craze. 

Androbot, Inc. is Bushnell's 
latest venture, and he has 
high hopes for this small, 
aggressive Silicon Valley 
company. Androbot's first 
commercial products are 
B.O.B. and TOPO, person- 



al robots for your home. 
B.O.B. operates entirely on 
his own, while TOPO re- 
quires a home computer to 
control him. 

B.O.B. (an acronym for 
"brains on board") features 
three megabyte processing 
capability and three Intel 
8088 16-bit microproces- 
sors. Five built-in ultrasonic 
sensors allow B.O.B. to lo- 
cate and measure objects in 
his immediate vicinity, and 
this information is logged 
in his memory so that he 
can move about at will with- 
out running into things. 
Infra-red sensors enable 
him to differentiate between 
humans and inanimate 
objects (based on their 
temperature), so that — 
supposedly— BOB. can 
treat people like people and 
objects like objects. (In 
other words, he knows better 
than to walk up to your 
television set and strike up a 
conversation.) 

TOPO is similar to B.O.B , 
but he has no brains of his 
own — he needs the help of 
a home computer to control 
him. A remote radio link will 
allow TOPO to receive 
commands from your home 
computer up to 90 feet 
away. 

Both robots stand three 
feet tall and move about on 
two motor-driven wheels. 
They are completely stable 
even when they aren't 
moving, because of a revo- 
lutionary drive assembly 
called Andromotion (TM). 
B.O.B. will sell forS2495. 
and TOPO will sell for S995. 

A wde range of accesso- 
ries will be available for 
B.O.B., allowing him to 



perform many common 
household tasks. He can 
carry things around in his 
Androwagon, for example, 
or dispense cold bever- 
ages from his optional 
AndroFridge. And an 
AndroSentry cartridge will 
enable him to patrol and 
safeguard your home. 

In addition to B.O.B. and 
TOPO, Androbot has 
announced plans to intro- 
duce F.R.E.D. (Friendly 
Robotic Educational 
Device) and AndroMan. 
F.R.E.D. stands 12 inches 
tall and can walk, talk, and 
draw pictures on com- 
mand. He has a 45 word 
vocabulary, but his real 
interest is sketching. Put a 
pen in his drawing pen 
attachment, and F.R.E.D. 
will duplicate any pattern 
you create on your com- 
puter screen by dragging 
the pen across your floor or 
tabletop. With a little plan- 
ning and patience, you 
could even teach him to do 
it on paper. 

AndroMan is designed to 
play games with you on 
your Atari 2600. While you 
control the action on the TV 
screen, AndroMan will be 
playing the same game "in 
real life," moving over a 
GameScape that you set 
up on the floor complete 
with real objects that corre- 
spond to images on the 
screen. 

Androbot has not 
announced specific prices 
or shipping dates for 
F.R.E.D. and AndroMan.

'''Rosalind Mary Owens''' (born 12 November 1944), known as '''Tuppy Owens''', is an English sex therapist, consultant, campaigner, writer and former adult model.&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt;&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18669012.html|title=BBC under fire for porn star's Viagra love-making|date=19 August 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tuppy Owens was born in [[Cambridge]]. She gained a degree in [[zoology]] from [[Exeter University]], and then worked in [[ecology]] in [[Africa]] and [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt; She settled in [[London]], and worked as a scientific administrator at the [[Natural Environment Research Council]].&lt;ref name=observer19720924/&gt; Then, in the late 1960s, she established a sex education book publishing company, for which she wrote and published ''The Sex Maniac’s Diary''&lt;ref name=paulharris/&gt; successfully between 1972 and 1995, and which she operated as a thriving business from her [[Mayfair]] flat&lt;ref name=observer19720924/&gt; — for example, the 1975 ''Sex Maniac's Diary'' was launched in August 1974 with a reception at the Bristol Hotel in London which was reported on the following day in the [[Financial Times]].&lt;ref name=ft19740822/&gt;

==Work==

From 1974, Tuppy Owens also began lecturing on the subject of sex.&lt;ref name=es19740409/&gt;  In 1975, she appeared in the Dutch pornographic film ''Sensations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/display.php?vId=UK13009|title=Sensations (1975) on Video Blue|website=Pre-Certification Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984, the ''Sex Maniac's Diary'' was published as ''The Safer Sex Maniac's Diary'' and provided the first visual instructions to the public on how to put a [[condom]] on securely; it also reviewed condoms and offered [[Safe sex|safer sex]] advice, all at the beginning of the outbreak of [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=thediary/&gt;

In 1979, Owens started the Outsiders Club for socially and physically disabled people to find partners. She was helped by Nigel Verbeek, who had recently lost his sight. Both worked voluntarily, which Tuppy continues to do today. Outsiders is a warm and friendly club providing peer support to members, a beautiful online Clubhouse, and lovely monthly lunches around the country.

In order to ensure that she answered the members' questions with accuracy, Owens trained as a [[sex therapist]] at [[St George's Hospital Medical School]] in London, where she gained a diploma in Human Sexuality in 1986.&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt; She was also subsequently awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Institute of Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt; In 2009, Owens was named one of the Family Planning Association‘s 80 most influential achievers in the field of family planning.

For disabled men and women who want to learn what pleasures their bodies are capable of enjoying, and how to please a partner, Owens set up the TLC Trust website, where they can find responsible, safe sexual services.

In 1981, Owens appeared in the English pornographic film ''Lady Victoria's Training'', which was produced by Mike Freeman/Videx and featured Simon Linsday Honey, who went on to work as a porn producer and actor in 1990's under the pseudonym [[Ben Dover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/display.php?vId=UK09550|title=Lady Victoria's Training (1981) on Videx|website=Pre-Certification Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"/&gt;

In the 1990s, after more than 30 years living in London, Tuppy Owens moved away from that city. Since then, she has lived in a croft in the north of Scotland.&lt;ref name=highladnews20060608/&gt;

In 2005, Tuppy Owens founded the Sexual Health and Disability Alliance (SHADA)&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt; to bring together health professionals interested in sex and disability. In November 2009, a conference with the title "Disability: Sex, Relationships and Pleasure" was held by SHADA with the [[Royal Society of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=rsm20091113/&gt; Tuppy produced the Sexual Respect Tool Kit, and started the sexual advocacy service, ASAP. Tuppy also answers the Sex and Disability Helpline. Her book "Supporting Disabled People with their Sexual Lives" was published by [[Jessica Kingsley Publishers|Jessica Kingsley]] on 19 November 2014.

Tuppy Owens remains active in running Outsiders.&lt;ref name=realist136/&gt; At the same time, she also advises the promoter of the Sexual Freedom Ball to fund Outsiders, and the organisers of the fundraiser, The [[Erotic Awards]],&lt;ref name=thetimes1085069/&gt; now called The Sexual Services and Entertainment Awards. 

Owens is now the chair of the Sexual Freedom Coalition.&lt;ref name=marieclaire200903/&gt; Back in the 90s Owens worked campaigning with Prostitution Pride, parades through London, which were funded by Arcadia events in North London.

Owens has been working with the Bath Institute of Medical Engineering in the hope that they will be able to create sex toys that can be used by disabled people who, without them, cannot masturbate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owens|first1=Tuppy|title=Supporting disabled residents to enjoy masturbation and sexual services|url=http://shadainternational.com/all-impairments/pioneers/|website=Shada International|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens will be the editor of a forthcoming website, The School of Sex for Disabled People, which is being created by sexually experienced disabled people and those who provide them with sexual services. She is currently writing her autobiography.

==Award==
Owens has won the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award from the European Lifestyles Awards. She is also a Winner of the Innovation Award of Sexual Health and Human Rights UNESCO 2015.
She was a finalist (Lifetime Achievement) in the Directory of Social Change Awards 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: 2015 Social Change Awards Ceremony|url=https://www.dsc.org.uk/content/2015-social-change-awards-ceremony/|website=Directory of Social Change|accessdate=11 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universidad Católica de Santo Tomás de Villanueva''' (''St. Thomas of Villanova Catholic University'') was a private [[Roman Catholic]] [[university]] founded on August 15, 1946, in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. It was founded by American [[Augustinians]] with assistance from European Augustinians and named after [[Thomas of Villanova|Saint Thomas of Villanova]]. In 1957, it was declared a [[pontifical university]]. In 1961, the Augustinians were expelled from Cuba and the university was confiscated by the Cuban government.

Former members of its faculty later helped found [[Biscayne College]], now [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|St. Thomas University]], in [[Miami Gardens]], [[Florida]].

In 2007, a group of Catholic university students presented a petition to the Cuban government asking for the Universidad Católica de Santo Tomás de Villanueva to reopen.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Activists Seek Independent Cuba Colleges" by Will Weissert, November 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and geography==
WBS was founded by a group of private individuals. It was incorporated as Whiteplains British School Ltd under the Companies and Allied Matters Act 1990 on 2 May 2007. ''People Monthly'' magazine reports that Whiteplains British School 'was born from a desire by few Nigerians in Diaspora to offer an excellent school whose program is designed to provide Nigerians and other nationals living in [[Nigeria]] with a certificate that is recognised throughout the world.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Whiteplains British School...A Place for Growing Minds|author=Egwu, Ngozi|publisher=''People Monthly'' Magazine|location=Abuja|year=March 2008 |issue=11|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WBS has two campuses. While the first campus is a [[primary school]] and administrative block located at Plot 528 [[Cadastral]] Zone B4, Jabi, the second campus, which harbours the [[secondary school]] and the advanced studies department, is seated on a [[land mass]] of 4.5 hectares in Daki Bui, Jabi, [[Abuja]]. Whiteplains British School has a close affiliation with a number of partner foreign universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peoplemonthlyonline.ng/top-10-secondary-schools-abuja/|title=The Top 10 Secondary Schools in Abuja|author=Oyinlola, Adeyemi|date=11 February 2016|publisher=People Monthly Online|website=www.peoplemonthlyonline.ng/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WiRED International''' is a 501(c)(3)non-profit, volunteer-driven organization that has been delivering medical and health information to war-affected and underserved regions since 1997. WiRED International’s goal is to address the severe global inequality of health knowledge.

WiRED International provides health information to underdeveloped areas by delivering programs, equipment and coordinated health education. Over the years, the organization has opened facilities in 15 countries, while NGOs, medical schools and hospitals in many additional countries have adopted its programs for community health education. The organization serves remote regions and, when appropriate, supplies laptops, projectors, solar equipment and complete health education libraries.

All WiRED International’s resources online and on portable media are cost-free to users.

WiRED International’s educational programs are technology-based. Starting in the 1990s, the organization stored programs on floppy disks and CD-ROMS and today relies on the Internet and flash drives. With this technology, people can put hundreds of training programs in their pockets, to take beyond the grid. These programs can be run on portable laptops and projectors for group presentations.

In 2009, the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health awarded WiRED International its Organizational Public Health Hero Award. WiRED earned the award “for its achievements in using information technology to provide up-to-date health education and medical information in developing, post-conflict, and isolated regions of the world.”

== History ==
San Francisco State University professor, Gary Selnow, Ph.D., founded WiRED International in 1997 while on a Fulbright Fellowship as a visiting professor at the [[University of Zagreb]] in Croatia right after the [[Yugoslav War]]. Selnow said, “UNICEF had donated computers to a high school in [[Vukovar]], Croatia, but they were sitting in boxes. We connected them to the Internet.”

Within two years, after formally registering as an NGO, WiRED International had established technology-based programs in six of the former Yugoslav countries. The U.S. Department of State engaged WiRED International’s services in Bosnia and then in Kosovo, where the organization’s volunteers set up community-access Internet centers to help people find family members who fled during the conflict with Serbia. Dr. Selnow noted that physicians made up “the largest group visiting the centers in Kosovo.”

As a small and flexible organization, WiRED International can respond quickly to community needs. While most of its work deals with health education, occasionally the organization comes across circumstances that merit special attention. One example took place in Kosovo in 1999, where a number of children had been unable to receive adequate treatment for life-threatening illnesses because of a war-damaged health care system.

Selnow was traveling by van from [[Pristina|Prishtina]] (Priština), Kosovo, to [[Skopje]], Macedonia, which, at the time, had the nearest operational airport. In the van was a five-year-old boy and a nurse. The nurse explained that [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] was funding the boy’s travel to France for heart surgery, but that budgets couldn’t pay for his parents to go along. “Will you go with him?” Selnow asked. “No, I’ll drop him off and someone from the hospital will meet him at [[de Gaulle Airport]].”

“So, this boy will undergo open-heart surgery without anyone to hold his hand and tell him in his Albanian language that he’ll be fine?” The nurse said, “That’s how it is, I’m sorry.”

Soon afterwards, WiRED International set up a program it called “Video Visit,” where a computer in [[Prishtina]] (Priština), where the parents remained, and a computer in the host country, where the children were being treated, could connect via the Internet. The connections allowed the parents and the children to speak on a regular basis and stay in touch during the children’s often extended treatments. WiRED International’s Video Visit wasn’t set up in time for the boy in the van, but it operated for many other children set off in the months that followed.

WiRED International’s mission became focused on medical and health education as a result of the clear needs evident in Kosovo. A year later, with a National Institutes of Health developmental grant, WiRED began HIV/AIDS education programs across Kenya and then in Sierra Leone. The work expanded to all medical and health concerns, and today through partnerships, WiRED programs are in several African countries and in parts of China, Central and South America, the Middle East, Melanesia and Eurasia.
 
In spring 2003 the State Department asked Selnow to travel to Baghdad with a representative of its U.S. Global Technology Corps to explore how WiRED could most effectively deliver medical training programs to Iraqi doctors. In June 2003, after reviewing field conditions and talking with U.S officials, Iraqi physicians and medical educators, WiRED launched the first technology-based medical training program in the country, starting with the opening of a facility in Iraq’s Medical City Center. Within 18 months the organization had set up 39 centers around Iraq. Several years later WiRED launched the country’s first telemedicine program. Technical problems with satellite availability in the war zone made that program difficult, and it never fully matured. WiRED’s work in Iraq ended in 2010, as the U.S. commitment was winding down.
 
In 2011, as WiRED’s ground programs expanded elsewhere, it began development of its own educational training materials. The program evolved, in 2013, into the Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Education Programs. This resource supplies medical and health education modules via the Internet and portable storage media. It allows partners or any interested NGO to store training modules on thumb drives and laptops and sync them to acquire updates. The result has been a broad distribution of health education programs, even in the most remote areas.
 
In 2014, WiRED has evolved into a health education hub operating in remote and resource-starved regions globally. WiRED collects intellectual content from physicians, nurses and medical educators from around the world. WiRED packages and translates it, when appropriate, and distributes it widely. This clearinghouse model has enabled many medical professionals to contribute to the program, and it has provided a source of health content for people in places isolated and often ignored.

== WiRED International’s Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Information ==
In 2011, WiRED International launched a virtual [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net Center] which draws intellectual content and resources from regions of abundance, processes it for new audiences and distributes that information to regions of scarcity. This project is funded in large part by [http://philanthropy.medtronic.com/ Medtronic Philanthropy].

The WiRED International e-library of more than 300 medical and health education modules enables physicians and nurses, patients, health workers and communities to address the prevention and treatment of both infectious and non-communicable disease in developing areas of the world. The more than 300 topics as diverse as maternal health and hand washing, rheumatic heart disease and Ebola, clean water strategies and home caregiver training.

In 2014 WiRED International expanded the global reach of its programs by creating a “Filling Station.” This is a tool that provides file synchronization (or syncing), whereby a person’s computer can upload data from a master file in an automatic process that adds new or changed material. Thus, the Filling Station allows instant updating of the entire community health education (CHE) e-library from any Internet access point in the world.

With these interactive training programs, communities and medical professionals alike can educate themselves through the material released on this website and also distributed on portable media for communities off the grid.

These training modules are developed by WiRED International’s team of physicians, medical editors, imagers and technicians along with a host of other medical experts. The team continually updates the existing material and creates new modules to provide a rich source of health information.

== Rapid Response Modules ==

When a community health crisis occurs, WiRED International speeds the creation of a rapid response module and translates it into appropriate languages. Examples include: 
* [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/mod-ebola.html Ebola] (translated into [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/58-fr/story.html French])

'''Writing Excuses''' is a podcast hosted by authors [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]], [[Brandon Sanderson]], [[Mary Robinette Kowal]] and web cartoonist [[Howard Tayler]].

Promoted as "fifteen minutes long, because you're in a hurry, and we're not that smart",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writingexcuses.com |title=Writing Excuses |publisher=Writing Excuses |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the four hosts and guests discuss different topics involved in the creation and production of genre writing and webcomics. As of 2017, authors [[Wesley Chu]], [[Piper J. Drake]] and  [[Mary Anne Mohanraj]] were added as secondary hosts, each having 1 show a month alongside different configurations of the primary hosts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.writingexcuses.com/2017/01/01/12-1-variations-on-first-person/|title=12.1: Variations on First Person|last=Tayler|first=Howard|date=2017-01-01|website=Writing Excuses|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Writing Excuses began in 2008 with three hosts &amp;ndash; Sanderson, Tayler, and Wells &amp;ndash; accompanied by Brandon's brother, Jordan Sanderson, who serves as producer. The show aims to cover a single writing-related topic in each podcast, in a format short enough to be listened to on a morning commute or during a lunch break. Adherence to a fifteen minute limit is not absolute, and ''Writing Excuses'' frequently runs to about 20 minutes.

The single topic is discussed in a back-and-forth by the hosts for roughly fifteen minutes. Given the authors' backgrounds in fantasy and science fiction there is a strong emphasis in those genres, but ''Writing Excuses'' covers a wide variety of topics intended to apply to fiction and creative arts generally. Halfway through the podcast the hosts introduce a book of the week, either a favorite of the hosts or one of their own works. Writing Excuses has been sponsored by [[Audible.com|Audible]] since October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/10/25/writing-excuses-season-3-episode-22-idea-to-story/ |title=Season 3 Episode 22: Idea to Story |publisher=Writing Excuses |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On numerous occasions, often at conventions, the hosts invite guest authors and industry professionals on board for podcast episodes.

After making a number of guest appearances, Mary Robinette Kowal joined the permanent cast as a new host at the beginning of season 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/06/05/writing-excuses-6-1-can-creativity-be-taught/ |title=6.1: Can Creativity be Taught? |publisher=Writing Excuses |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wesley Chu]], [[Piper J. Drake]], and  [[Mary Anne Mohanraj]] were added as secondary hosts at the beginning of series 12&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==''Shadows Beneath'' anthology==
''Shadows Beneath'', an anthology of four stories written by the members of ''Writing Excuses'', was published in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Shadows Beneath: The Writing Excuses Anthology | authorlink1 = Dan Wells (author) | first1 = Dan | last1 = Wells | authorlink2 = Howard Tayler | first2 = Howard | last2 = Tayler | authorlink3 = Mary Robinette Kowal | first3 = Mary Robinette | last3 = Kowal | authorlink4 = Brandon Sanderson | first4 = Brandon | last4 = Sanderson | asin = B00LDOM8A2 | publisher = Dragonsteel Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthology's bonus material is intended to show some of the processes of story creation. The stories were brainstormed on the podcast and the first drafts later critiqued; transcripts of the podcasts, along with the first drafts of the stories, are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://brandonsanderson.com/shadows-beneath/ | title = Shadows Beneath | website = brandonsanderson.com | first = Brandon | last = Sanderson | date = June 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories are:
