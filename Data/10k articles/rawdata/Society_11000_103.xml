      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="946">'''Agbassa''' is the name of one of two [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]] clans in [[Warri]], [[Nigeria]], the other being [[Okere-Urhobo]]. The name Agbassa is of British origin derives from its original name, Agbarha, which is still in use.  There are approximately seven communities that make up the Agbassa Warri kingdom: Otovwodo, Igbudu, Edjeba, Ogunu, Okurode (Okurode Urhobo), Oteghele, and Ukpokiti.

In Agbassa, the Iyerin festival is celebrated annually, as well as Esemor and Iniemor. Another festival, known as Idju, is celebrated every two years throughout all the communities of Agbassa, as well as Okere-Urhobo. This festival is known as Agbassa Juju, and it centers around the worship of the Owurhie, a Warri deity.

'''Alexander Dubin''' (June 10, 1891 – February 11, 1945) was an American [[lyricist]]. He is best known for his collaborations with the composer [[Harry Warren]].

==Life==
Al Dubin came from a Russian Jewish family that emigrated to the United States from Switzerland when he was two years old.&lt;ref name=songwriters&gt;{{cite web |author=Songwriters Hall of Fame |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C68 |title=Songwriters Hall of Fame: Al Dubin |accessdate=2013-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193735/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C68 |archive-date=2013-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in Philadelphia. Between ages of thirteen and sixteen, Dubin played hookey from school in order to travel into [[New York City]] to see [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical shows. At age 14 he began writing special material for a vaudeville entertainer on 28th Street between 5th and Broadway in New York City, otherwise known as [[Tin Pan Alley]].&lt;ref name=Dubin&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubin |first=Patricia McGuire|year=1983|title=Lullaby of Broadway: Life and Times of Al Dubin – One of America's Great Lyricists|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=0-8065-0871-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubin was accepted and enrolled at [[Perkiomen School|Perkiomen Seminary]] in September 1909,&lt;ref name="songwriters"/&gt; but was expelled in 1911, after writing their [[Alma Mater (song)]]. After leaving Perkiomen, Dubin got himself a job as a singing waiter at a Philadelphia restaurant. He continued to write lyrics and tried selling them to area publishing firms. During this time, Dubin met composer [[Joe Burke (composer)|Joe Burke]]. Together they wrote the song "Oh, You, Mister Moon" (1911), which was published by M. Witmark &amp; Sons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dubin|Dubin (1983)]] p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Dubin was drafted at Camp Upton in Yaphank, Long Island, and served as a private in the 305th Field Artillery of the 77th Division, known as New York's own. During his service, he wrote the song "They Didn’t Think We'd Do it, But We Did" with composer Fred Rath and published by the 77th Division. On his first weekend pass, Dubin went to see a show at the [[Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle)|Majestic Theater]] in [[New York City]]. There he met Broadway singer Helen McClay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/the-avenue-hes-takin-you-to-6348999|title=The Avenue He's Takin' You To|first=Ronald|last=Mangravite|date=27 February 2003|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married on March 19, 1921, at the Church of St. Elizabeth in New York City, after Dubin converted to the Catholic faith and McClay was granted an annulment of her first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dubin|Dubin (1983)]] p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The year they married, Dubin was accepted in [[ASCAP]] in 1921.

Known for his larger-than-life persona, Dubin struggled with alcohol and drugs,&lt;ref name="songwriters"/&gt; and fell on hard times in the 1940s. Estranged from his wife, Dubin struggled to find work both in Hollywood and New York. The last show Dubin was contracted to work on was ''Laffing Room Only'', with composer [[Burton Lane]]. Dubin provided only a title for this production, "Feudin' and a Fightin'", for which he received 25 percent credit.&lt;ref name="Dubin 1983 p. 169"&gt;[[#Dubin|Dubin (1983)]] p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubin spent the remainder of the last few years of his life at the Empire Hotel,&lt;ref name="Dubin 1983 p. 169"/&gt; alone and in ill-health. On February 8, 1945, he collapsed on the street after having taken a large quantity of doctor-prescribed barbiturates. He was admitted to the Roosevelt Hospital for barbiturate poisoning and pneumonia,&lt;ref name="songwriters"/&gt; and later died on February 11, 1945. Famed newspaper personality [[Walter Winchell]] made the announcement of his death on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dubin|Dubin (1983)]] p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

On his passing, Dubin was interred in the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].

==Career==
Dubin sold his first set of lyrics for two songs "Prairie Rose" and "Sunray", in 1909 to the Whitmark Music Publishing Firm.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dubin|Dubin (1983)]] p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Dubin met the composer [[Harry Warren]], who was to become his future collaborator at [[Warner Bros.]] studio in [[Hollywood]]. The first song they collaborated on was titled, "Too Many Kisses in the Summer Bring Too Many Tears in the Fall". But it was another song written with [[Joseph Meyer (songwriter)|Joseph Meyer]] that same year that became Dubin's first big hit, "[[A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and You]]".

Warner Bros. purchased the publishing firms of Witmark, Remick and Harms, and since Dubin was under contract to Harms, Warner Bros. inherited his services. In 1929 Dubin wrote "[[Tiptoe through the Tulips]]" with composer [[Joe Burke (composer)|Joe Burke]] for the film ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]''.

In 1932, Dubin teamed officially with composer Harry Warren&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/172741/Al-Dubin |title=Al Dubin (American Lyricist) |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the movie musical ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', starring [[Ruby Keeler]], [[Dick Powell]], [[Warner Baxter]] and [[Bebe Daniels]], with dance routines sequenced by legendary choreographer [[Busby Berkeley]]. The songwriting team of Warren and Dubin contributed four songs: "[[42nd Street (song)|42nd Street]]", "[[You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me]]", "Young and Healthy" and "[[Shuffle Off to Buffalo]]".

Between 1932 and 1939,&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Dubin and Warren wrote 60 hit songs for several Warner Bros. movie musicals, including ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'', ''[[Footlight Parade]]'' starring [[James Cagney]], ''[[Roman Scandals]]'' starring [[Eddie Cantor]], ''[[Dames]]'', ''[[Go Into Your Dance]]'' and ''[[Wonder Bar]]'', both starring [[Al Jolson]]. The song "[[Lullaby of Broadway (song)|Lullaby of Broadway]]", written by Warren and Dubin for the musical film, ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', won the 1936 [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts |first=David|year=2006|title=British Hit Singles &amp; Albums (19th ed.)|publisher=London: Guinness World Records Limited|page=134|isbn=1-904994-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1980, producer [[David Merrick]] and director [[Gower Champion]] adapted the 1933 film ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' into a [[42nd Street (musical)|Broadway musical]] that won The [[Tony Award for Best Musical]] in 1981. The book for the show was written by [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]] and [[Mark Bramble]] and featured a [[Sheet music|score]] that incorporated Warren and Dubin songs from various movie musicals including ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', ''[[Dames]]'', ''[[Go Into Your Dance]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'' and ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]''.

Dubin was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="songwriters"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2130">[[Image:MancalaWari.JPG|thumb|right|Equipment and initial setup of the Ayoayo game]]
'''Ayoayo''' is a traditional [[mancala]] played by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] people in [[Nigeria]]. It is very close to  the [[Oware]] game that spread to the [[Americas]] with the [[atlantic slave trade]]. Among modern mancalas, which are most often derived from Warri, the [[Kalah]] is a notable one that has essentially the same rules as Ayoayo.

There are games with identical rules also in other areas of Africa. One such game is the [[Endodoi]], played by the [[Maasai people]] of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]].

==Rules==
The Ayoayo board is composed of two roles of six holes each, and 48 seeds are used; at the beginning, 4 seeds are placed in each hole. These are exactly the same equipment and setup as those of [[Warri]] and many other 2-row mancalas such as [[Layli Goobalay]]. Each player owns one of the rows.

At his or her turn, the player takes all seeds from one of his holes and [[Mancala#General gameplay|relay sow]]s them counterclockwise; during each individual sowing, the starting hole is skipped (i.e., no seeds are dropped there even if more than 12 seeds are to be sown). When the last seed is sown in an empty hole, and if this hole belongs to the player in turn, he or she will capture any seed in the opposing hole.

When one of the players cannot move anymore, the game is over. The opponent captures all the seeds that are left on the board and the winner is the player who captured most seeds.

Notice that if a player ends his or her turn with no seeds left in his or her row, the opponent ''must'' (if it is possible) choose his move in such a way to bring one or more seeds into the other's row. This scheme is found in many mancalas and sometimes referred to as "feeding" the opponent (i.e., save the opponent from starving).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnpratt.com/items/mancala/ayoayo.html Ayoayo rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cambodian Canadians''', also known as '''Khmer Canadians''', are [[Canadians]] of [[Cambodia]]n ethnic origin or ancestry. According to the 2016 national census, there were 38,490 Canadian Cambodians,&lt;ref name=2016Census/&gt; making them one of the smallest minority groups of Asian ancestry in the country.

Aside from [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Canadian French]] and [[Canadian English|English]], many Cambodian Canadians also speak [[Standard French]], due to France's colonization and historical influence on Cambodia, when French was designated as an official language. [[Theravada Buddhism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]] are the two major religions among Cambodian Canadians.

== History ==
During the [[Khmer Rouge]] genocide of 1975-1979, Cambodians of many ethnic backgrounds escaped to refugee camps in the neighboring countries of [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]].  Due to the mass number of refugees, many Cambodians migrated to Canada, USA, France and Australia. In 1981, there were 13,000 Cambodian-Canadian Refugees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/cambodia/society/cambodia_society_migration_and_refuge~1.html|title=Cambodia  Migration and Refugees - Flags, Maps, Economy, History, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System|website=www.photius.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most of the population settling into major cities such as [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Quebec City]]. The [[Jane and Finch]] neighbourhood of Toronto has a notably large Cambodian population, in which they make up about 4% of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CT&amp;Code1=2578&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=M3N2M9&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;A1=All&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom=&amp;TABID=2|title=2011 National Household Survey Profile - Census tract|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last=Canada|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, the number of Cambodians in Canada had risen to 38,490.&lt;ref name=2016Census/&gt;

== Religion ==
[[Khmer people#cite note-CIACB-0|Cambodians]] are formally known as [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]], but follow a mix of a cultural adaptation of Buddhism and ancient religious views and principles. Ever since [[Cambodia]] was under [[French Indochina|French colonization]], the number of [[Christian]] followers among Cambodian populations has also increased, leading to several Cambodian-Christian establishments throughout Ontario. Buddhist followers however pray throughout the year, with the celebration of [[Khmer New Year]] lasting three days centered around the 13th of April.

The religious festival of [[Pchum Ben]], also known as Ancestor's Day, is the remembrance of the deceased. On this day is when Cambodians pay their respects to deceased relatives and ancestors. On Ancestor's day, people would offer food to the monks, who would then give their blessings to the people and their ancestors. The significance of food to this festival correlates with the belief that the ghosts of their ancestors will receive it.

== Organizations ==
In 1979, members of the Cambodian-Canadian community established the CCAO (Cambodian-Canadian Association of Ontario), alongside other notable community organizations such as the Khmer Buddhist Group.

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

'''Caste''' is a form of [[social stratification]] characterized by [[endogamy]], hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, status in a hierarchy, customary social interaction, and exclusion.{{Sfn|Scott|Marshall|2005|p=66}}{{Sfn|Winthrop|1991|pp=27–30}} It is an extreme evolution of a system of legally-entrenched social classes, also endogamous and hereditary, such as that of feudal Europe.  Although caste systems exist in various regions, its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today;{{Sfn|Béteille|2002|p=66}} it is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India.  In biology, the term is applied to role stratification in [[eusocial]] animals like ants and termites, though the analogy is imperfect as these also involve extremely stratified [[queen ant|reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Wilson |first= E. O. |year= 1979 |title= The Evolution of Caste Systems in Social Insects |journal= Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume= 123 |number=4 |pages= 204–210 |jstor= 986579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origins of the term 'caste' are attributed to the Spanish and Portuguese ''[[casta]]'', which, according to the [[John Minsheu]]'s Spanish dictionary (1599), means "race, lineage, or breed".&lt;ref name=oed-caste&gt;{{Cite OED|caste|id=28546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Spanish colonized the [[New World]], they used the word to mean a "clan or lineage". It was, however, the Portuguese who first employed ''casta'' in the primary modern sense of the English word ‘caste’ when they applied it to the thousands of endogamous, hereditary Indian social groups they encountered upon their arrival in India in 1498&lt;ref name=oed-caste/&gt;&lt;ref name=pitt-rivers&gt;{{citation|last=Pitt-Rivers|first=Julian|editor=T O Beidelman|title=The translation of culture essays to E.E.

The use of the spelling "caste", with this latter meaning, is first attested in English in 1613.&lt;ref name=oed-caste/&gt;

{{Main|Caste system in India}}
{{commons category|Castes in India}}
Modern India's caste system is based on the social groupings called ''[[jāti]]'' and the  theoretical ''[[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]''. The system of ''varnas'' appears in Hindu texts dating back to 1000 BCE and envisages the society divided into four classes: [[Brahmins]] (scholars and priests), [[Kshatriya]]s (warriors and nobles), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, merchants, and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (laborers/service providers). The texts do not mention any separate, untouchable category in ''[[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' classification. Scholars believe that the system of ''varnas'' was a theoretical classification envisioned by the Brahmins, but never truly operational in society. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''jātis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations. The ''jātis'' have been endogamous groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status. In many instances, as in Bengal, historically the kings and rulers had been called upon, when required, to mediate on the ranks of ''jātis'', which might number in thousands all over the subcontinent and vary by region. In practice, the ''jātis'' may or may not fit into the ''varna'' classes and many prominent ''jatis'', for example the Jats and Yadavs, straddled two varnas i.e. Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, and the ''varna'' status of ''jātis'' itself was subject to articulation over time.

Starting with the British colonial Census of 1901 led by [[Herbert Hope Risley]], all the ''jātis'' were grouped under the theoretical ''varnas'' categories.&lt;ref name=dirks&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7191.html|author=Nicholas B. Dirks|title=Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of New India|year=2001|isbn=978-0-691-08895-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Lloyd Rudolph]], Risley believed that ''varna'', however ancient, could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and "[he] meant to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vnsnma5nW4C |title=The Modernity of Tradition: Political Development in India |first=Lloyd I. |last=Rudolph |authorlink=Lloyd I.

The classical authors scarcely speak of anything other than the ''varnas'', as it provided a convenient shorthand; but a problem arises when even Indologists sometimes confuse the two.&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{citation |author=Dumont, Louis |title=Homo hierarchicus: the caste system and its implications |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1980 |pages=66–67 |isbn=0-226-16963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon independence from Britain, the Indian Constitution listed 1,108 castes across the country as Scheduled Castes in 1950, for positive discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule3a.htm |title=The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 |publisher=Lawmin.nic.in |date= |access-date=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Untouchable communities are sometimes called ''[[Scheduled Castes]]'', ''[[Dalit]]'' or ''[[Harijan]]'' in contemporary literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scaling Caste Walls With Capitalism’s Ladders in India|publisher=The New York Times|author=Lydia Polgreen|date=21 December 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/world/asia/indias-boom-creates-openings-for-untouchables.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Dalits were 16.2% of India's population.&lt;ref name=censtat01&gt;{{cite web|title=Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes population: Census 2001|year=2004|publisher=Government of India|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/scst.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 15 million bonded child workers are from the lowest castes.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unicef.org/pon95/chil0016.html Children pay high price for cheap labour]".

The socio-economic limitations of the caste system are reduced due to urbanization and [[affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in [[endogamy]] and [[Family patrimony|patrimony]], and thrives in the politics of democracy, where caste provides ready made constituencies to politicians. The globalization and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. The co-existence of the middle-class and traditional members in the CPCC has created [[intersectionality]] between caste and class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Natrajan|first1=Balmurli|title=Caste, class, and community in india: An ethnographic approach|journal=Ethnology|date=2005|volume=4|issue=3|pages=227–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilization of people and policy development. It is not politics that gets caste-ridden; it is caste that gets politicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Ronojoy.|title=The persistence of caste in indian politics|journal=Pacific Affairs|date=2012|volume=85|issue=2|pages=363–369|doi=10.5509/2012852363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of the modern social pressures on the country, India is experiencing a change in their social sphere dynamic as well as economically in the caste system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rag S.|title=FROM CASTE TO CLASS IN INDIAN SOCIETY|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|date=1980|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1-14|}} &lt;/ref&gt; While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has helped the younger generation of Indians to have more control over their marriages through the use of dating apps. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Gandhi|first1=Divya.|title= Running in the family|magazine=The Hindu|date=April 2, 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Hypergamy is still a common practice in India and Hindu culture. Men can marry a lower caste or a woman of an equal one. If the girl marries up, then her children will take the status of their father. If the girl marries down, her entire family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. Geographical factors also determine the loosening of the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to experience exogamous marriages, due to a lack of people within the same caste. Women in North India have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Berreman|first1=Gerald D.|title=Village Exogamy in Northernmost India|date=1962|volume=18|issue=1|pages=55-58|}} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Caste system in Nepal}}
The [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles that of the Indian ''jāti'' system with numerous ''jāti'' divisions with a ''varna'' system superimposed for a rough equivalence. But since the culture and the society is different some of the things are different. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] period.  Jayasthiti Malla (1382–1395) categorized Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–1575). The Hindu social code was later set up in Gorkha by Ram Shah (1603–1636).

Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the British/Kandyan period Kadayimpoth – Boundary books as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy.

[[Bali]]nese caste structure has been described in early 20th-century European literature to be based on three categories – triwangsa (thrice born) or the nobility, ''dwijāti'' (twice born) in contrast to ''ekajāti'' (once born) the low folks. Four statuses were identified in these sociological studies, spelled a bit differently from the caste categories for India:&lt;ref name=boon&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anthropological Romance of Bali 1597-1972: Dynamic Perspectives in Marriage and Caste, Politics and Religion|author=James Boon|year=1977|isbn=0-521-21398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brahmin]]as – [[priest]]
*Satrias – [[knight]]hood
*Wesias – commerce
*Sudras – servitude

The Brahmana caste was further subdivided by these Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five: Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher-caste Brahmana men with lower-caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to ''castas'' in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.&lt;ref name=boon/&gt;

During the period of [[Yuan Dynasty]], ruler [[Kublai Khan]] enforced a ''Four Class System'', which was a legal caste system. The order of four classes of people was maintained by the information of the descending order were:-

* [[Semu]] people
* [[Han Chinese|Han]] people (in the northern areas of China)
* Southerners (people of the former Southern [[Song dynasty]])

There is also significant controversy over the [[social classes of Tibet]], especially with regards to the [[serfdom in Tibet controversy]].

===Japan===
{{Main|Edo society}}
[[File:Samurai and servant.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[samurai]] of importance and servant.]]

In Japan's history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merit, were rigid and highly formalized in a system called ''mibunsei'' (身分制). At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles ([[kuge]]), together with the Shōgun and daimyō. Below them, the population was divided into [[Four occupations|four classes]]: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only samurai were allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants, craftsman or merchant who he felt were disrespectful. Merchants were the lowest caste because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, peasants were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' among others. As in Europe, the castes and sub-classes were of the same race, religion and culture.

Howell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L. Howell|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24085-5|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vos and Wagatsuma observe that Japanese society had a systematic and extensive caste system. They discuss how alleged caste impurity and alleged racial inferiority, concepts often  assumed to be different, are superficial terms, and are due to identical inner psychological processes, which expressed themselves in Japan and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=gdvhw&gt;{{cite book|title=Japan's invisible race: caste in culture and personality|author=George De Vos and Hiroshi Wagatsuma|publisher=University of California Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0-520-00306-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogamy was common because marriage across caste lines was socially unacceptable.&lt;ref name=gdvhw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese Fashion: A Cultural History|author=Toby Slade|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-252-3|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japan]] had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracized, historically referred to by the insulting term ''Eta'', now called ''[[Burakumin]]''. While modern law has officially abolished the class hierarchy, there are reports of discrimination against the [[Buraku]] or [[Burakumin]] underclasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF39.htm |title=Class, Ethnicity and Nationality: Japan Finds Plenty of Space for Discrimination |publisher=Hrdc.net |date=2001-06-18 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burakumin are regarded as "ostracised".&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Korea-History-Goban Game in Seoul Korea 1904 (LOC).jpg|thumbnail|A typical Yangban family scene from 1904.  The Yoon family had an enduring presence in Korean politics from the 1800s until the 1970s.]]

The [[baekjeong]] (백정) were an "untouchable" outcaste of Korea. The meaning today is that of butcher. It originates in the [[Goryeo-Khitan Wars|Khitan invasion of Korea]] in the 11th century. The defeated [[Khitans]] who surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion.  They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads.  Over time, their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society.

In 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian [[Joseon dynasty]], Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the [[Yangban]], which literally means "two classes". It was composed of scholars (''munban'') and warriors (''muban''). Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the ''jung-in'' (중인-中人: literally "middle people". This was a small class of specialized professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the ''sangmin'' (상민-常民: literally 'commoner'), farmers working their own fields. Korea also had a [[serf]] population known as the ''nobi''.

The opening of Korea to foreign Christian missionary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the ''baekjeong''. However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and even so protests erupted when missionaries tried to integrate ''baekjeong'' into worship, with non-''baekjeong'' finding this attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Around the same time, the ''baekjeong'' began to resist open social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=In Search of Human Rights: The Paekchŏng Movement in Colonial Korea|title=Colonial Modernity in Korea|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|editor=Gi-Wook Shin and Michael Robinson|year=1999|pages=326|isbn=0-674-00594-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on social and economic injustices affecting them, hoping to create an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by upper class, authorities, and "commoners", and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Korean Paekjŏng under Japanese rule: the quest for equality and human rights|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|year=2003|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Gabo reform]] of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.&lt;ref name="proper"&gt;Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California. ''Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894–1910''&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Koreans by then had surnames and even [[bongwan]], although still substantial number of [[cheonmin]], mostly consisted of [[serfs]] and slaves, and [[Untouchability|untouchables]] did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''inmin'' ("people") and later, ''kungmin'' ("citizen").&lt;ref name="proper"/&gt;

====North Korea====

The [[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]] reported that "Every North Korean citizen is assigned a heredity-based class and socio-political rank over which the individual exercises no control but which determines all aspects of his or her life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=06 Jun 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9313174/North-Korea-caste-system-underpins-human-rights-abuses.html |title=North Korea caste system 'underpins human rights abuses' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarded as ''Songbun'', [[Barbara Demick]] describes this "class structure" as an updating of the hereditary "caste system", combining Confucianism and Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Demick, ''Nothing to Envy: Love, Life and Death in North Korea'', Fourth Estate, London, 2010, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that a bad family background is called "tainted blood", and that by law this "tainted blood" lasts for three generations.&lt;ref&gt;Demick, pp. 28, 197, 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Social classes of Tibet}}

Heidi Fjeld has put forth the argument that pre-1950s Tibetan society was functionally a caste system, in contrast to previous scholars who defined the Tibetan social class system as similar to European feudal serfdom, as well as non-scholarly western accounts which seek to romanticize a supposedly 'egalitarian' ancient Tibetan society.

[[Yezidi]] society is hierarchical. The secular leader is a hereditary [[emir]] or prince, whereas a chief [[sheikh]] heads the religious hierarchy.

In other cases, such as the ''Nupe'' of Nigeria, the ''Beni Amer'' of East Africa, and the ''Tira'' of Sudan, the exclusionary principle has been driven by evolving social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Caste and government in primitive society|author=SF Nadel|journal=Journal of Anthropological Society|volume=8|pages=9–22|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Africa===
[[File:GriotFête.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Griot]], who have been described as an endogamous caste of West Africa who specialize in oral story telling and culture preservation. They have been also referred to as the bard caste.]]
Among the Igbo of [[Nigeria]] – especially [[Enugu State|Enugu]], [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Abia State|Abia]], [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]], [[Edo State|Edo]] and [[Delta state|Delta]] states of the country – Obinna finds Osu caste system has been and continues to be a major social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracized, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=Obinna1/&gt;

The ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the "Osus" people as "owned by deities" and outcasts.

The Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africankingdoms.com|title=AFRICAN KINGDOMS - Kingdoms of Ancient African History|website=www.africankingdoms.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|pages=37–54|doi=10.2307/1158641|jstor=1158641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.

Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.

As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.&lt;ref name=tamari1&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=221–250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Africa===
Ethel M. Albert in 1960 claimed that the societies in [[Central Africa]] were caste-like social stratification systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Socio-Political Organization and Receptivity to Change: Some Differences between Ruanda and Urundi|author=Ethel M. Albert|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|volume=16|number= 1|date= Spring 1960|pages=46–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] can be best described as castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Premise of Inequality in Ruanda: A Study of Political Relations in a Central African Kingdom|author= Jacques J. Maquet|year=1962|pages=135–171|publisher=Oxford University Press, London|isbn=978-0-19-823168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tutsi]], noted Maquet, considered themselves as superior, with the more numerous [[Hutu]] and the least numerous [[Twa]] regarded, by birth, as respectively, second and third in the hierarchy of Rwandese society. These groups were largely endogamous, exclusionary and with limited mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Power in Ruanda|author=Helen Codere|journal=Anthropologica|volume=4|number=1|year=1962|pages=45–85|jstor=25604523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]] and [[Konso people|Konso]]. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=LA CASTE EN AFRIQUE? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M.

''Africa'' 69(4), pp. 485–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Kingdom of Kafa|Kafa]], there were also traditionally groups labeled as castes. "Based on research done before the Derg regime, these studies generally presume the existence of a social hierarchy similar to the caste system. At the top of this hierarchy were the Kafa, followed by occupational groups including blacksmiths (Qemmo), weavers (Shammano), bards (Shatto), potters, and tanners (Manno). In this hierarchy, the Manjo were commonly referred to as hunters, given the lowest status equal only to slaves."&lt;ref&gt;p. 299. Sayuri Yoshida. "Why did the Manjo convert to Protestant?

The [[Borana Oromo]] of southern [[Ethiopia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] also have a class system, wherein the Wata, an acculturated hunter-gatherer group, represent the lowest class. Though the Wata today speak the [[Oromo language]], they have traditions of having previously spoken another language before adopting Oromo.&lt;ref name="Westermann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diedrich Westermann|first=Edwin William Smith, Cyril Daryll Forde|title=Africa|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditionally nomadic [[Somali people]] are divided into clans, wherein the [[Rahanweyn]] agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the [[Madhiban]] were traditionally sometimes treated as outcasts.&lt;ref&gt;I.

==Europe==

===Basque country===
For centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded [[Cagot]]s who lived primarily in the Basque region of France and Spain as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the churches they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, and receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The last untouchable in Europe|author=Sean Thomas|date=28 July 2008|publisher=The Independent, United Kingdom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-last-untouchable-in-europe-878705.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anders Hansson|title=Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA15|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10596-6|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In July 2013, the UK government announced its intention to amend the [[Equality Act 2010]] to "introduce legislation on caste, including any necessary exceptions to the caste provisions, within the framework of domestic discrimination law".&lt;ref&gt;Government Equalities Office, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225658/130726-Caste-Discrimination.pdf Caste legislation introduction – programme and timetable], accessed 2 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Section 9(5) of the Equality Act 2010 provides that "a [[Minister (government)|Minister]] may by [[Statutory order|order]] amend the statutory definition of race to include caste and may provide for exceptions in the Act to apply or not to apply to caste".

From September 2013 to February 2014, [[Meena Dhanda]] led a project on "Caste in Britain" for the UK [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/research-report-91-caste-britain-socio-legal-review|title=Research report 91: Caste in Britain: Socio-legal Review {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=www.equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In view of [[W. Lloyd Warner]] relationship between Blacks and Whites in USA historically showed many features of caste like residential segregation, marriage restrictions. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/217391&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination based upon socio-economic factors are historically prevalent within the country. 

According to Gerald D. Berreman, in the two systems, there are rigid rules of avoidance and certain types of contacts are defined as contaminating. In India, there are complex religious features which make up the system, whereas in the United States race and color are the basis of differentiation. The caste system in India and in the United States has higher groups which desire to retain their position for themselves and thus perpetuate the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berreman|first=Gerald|date=September 1960|title=Caste in India and the United States|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2773155?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=66|pages=120-127|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the increased immigration to the United States, many Indian Americans have created a similar system. A survey commissioned by Equality Labs finds that caste discrimination is playing out in the United States as well. 2/3 of the members of the lowest caste, called Dalits, said that they have faced workplace discrimination due to their caste. 41% have experienced discrimination in education because of it in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Subramanian Shankar Feed Subramanian Shankar, and University of Hawaii.“Does America Have a Caste System?” CityLab, The Atlantic Monthly Group, 26 Jan. 2018, www.citylab.com/equity/2018/01/does-america-have-a-caste-system/551591/.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dame Catherine Alice Healy''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|DNZM}} (born 1955/1956) is a New Zealand [[sex workers' rights]] activist, [[Field research#Fieldwork and Sociology|field researcher]] and former prostitute working for decriminalisation of prostitution and generally for the improvement of the sex work profession. She is the national coordinator and a founding member of the [[New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective]] (NZPC).&lt;ref name="Radio New Zealand"&gt;{{cite news | title = Prostitutes Collective disputes trafficking claim | url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/79083/prostitutes-collective-disputes-trafficking-claim | newspaper = [[Radio New Zealand]] | date = 4 July 2011 | accessdate = 14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Healy grew up near [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Eastbourne]], with three siblings and "liberal-minded" parents.&lt;ref name="Stuff"/&gt;

==Career==
She was employed as a primary school teacher, though in an interview by [[Joseph Romanos]] for ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'', Healy said, to increase her earnings for the purpose of travelling, she then worked in a [[massage parlor]].&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news |title= The Wellingtonian interview: Catherine Healy|last= Romanos |first= Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Romanos |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/archive/the-wellingtonian/3501279/The-Wellingtonian-interview-Catherine-Healy|newspaper= [[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|date= |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, Healy worked in [[brothel]]s and massage parlors.

Healy and her fellow members of the NZPC initiated a campaign for decriminalisation of prostitution. Prostitution was finally decriminalised in New Zealand in 2003 after the implementation of the [[Prostitution Reform Act 2003]]; Healy was in the public gallery to witness the final vote.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Anderson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/04/new-zealand-former-sex-worker-becomes-a-dame-in-queens-birthday-honours |title=New Zealand former sex worker becomes a dame in Queen's birthday honours |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2010, she was invited by the [[Oxford Union]] at the [[University of Oxford]] to debate whether prostitution should be decriminalised. She became the second New Zealander after [[David Lange]] to be invited to debate at the university. At the university, she argued for decriminalisation of prostitution and won the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Kiwi debater convinces Oxford Union on prostitution|author= |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/3371975/Kiwi-debater-convinces-Oxford-Union-on-prostitution |newspaper= [[Stuff.co.nz]]|date= 25 February 2010|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= NZ prostitutes' advocate speaks at Oxford debate | author = |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10628396 |newspaper= [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date= 25 February 2010|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healy has membership of various boards and committees. She has been invited as a speaker at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] and acts as an advisory on issues and policy formulations related to prostitution. The Prostitution Law Review Committee, a committee established by the [[New Zealand government]], had Healy as one of its members. She has worked as a [[Field research#Fieldwork and Sociology|field researcher]] and has been involved with multiple research undertakings. She also works as a consultant for prostitutes of all genders, brothel owners and other persons involved in prostitution.&lt;ref name="University of Otago"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.otago.ac.nz/anzals/keynotespeakers.html | title = Catherine Healy - New Zealand Prostitutes Collective | publisher = [[University of Otago]] | accessdate = 14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Gillian Abel and Lisa Fitzgerald, Healy has co-edited the book ''[[Taking the Crime Out of Sex Work: New Zealand Sex Workers' Fight for Decriminalisation]]''.&lt;ref name="University of Otago"/&gt; The book argues decriminalisation has resulted in better working conditions for prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Decriminalisation of sex industry positive move|author= |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1005/S00110.htm|newspaper= Scoop|date= |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in Eastbourne.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;

==Honours==
Healy was awarded the [[New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/lists/qb2018-dnzm |title=Queen's Birthday honours 2018 – citations for Dames Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit |date=4 June 2018 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2018 Birthday Honours (New Zealand)|2018 Queen's Birthday Honours]], she was appointed a [[Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit]], for services to the rights of sex workers.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/queens-birthday-honours-list-2018 |title=Queen's Birthday honours list 2018 |date=4 June 2018 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corporate Knights''' ('''CK''') is a media, research and financial information products company based in Toronto, Canada, focused on promoting an economic system where prices fully incorporate social, economic and ecological costs and benefits, and market participants are clearly aware of the consequences of their actions. The company calls such a system "clean capitalism". Founded in 2002, Corporate Knights has a media and research division, which includes the award-winning business and society magazine '''''Corporate Knights''''', and a research division which produces corporate rankings, research reports and financial product ratings based on corporate sustainability performance. Its best-known rankings include the Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada and [[the Global 100]] Most Sustainable Corporations. In June 2013, ''Corporate Knights'' was named "Magazine of the Year" by [[Canada's National Magazine Awards]] Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.magazine-awards.com/2013/06/13/get-to-know-corporate-knights-canadas-magazine-of-the-year/|title=Get to know Corporate Knights: Canada's Magazine of the Year - Magazine Awards|work=Magazine Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its two divisions, Corporate Knights Inc. spearheaded the creation in 2012 of the '''Council for Clean Capitalism''',&lt;ref&gt;http://cleancapitalism.com&lt;/ref&gt; a multi-industry group of leading Canadian companies dedicated to advocating economic and social policy changes that reward responsible corporate behaviour and remove barriers to clean capitalism. The council's 10 members include [[Telus]], [[Vancity]], and [[Teck Resources]].

==History==

Corporate Knights Inc. was co-founded in 2002 by Toby A. A. Heaps and Paul Fengler. Fengler was an International Relations and Russian Language graduate, and Heaps majored in Economics and International Development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgilldaily.com/view.php?aid=792 The McGill Daily - McGill Alumni Launch Business Ethics Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517231631/http://www.mcgilldaily.com/view.php?aid=792 |date=2006-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair created the magazine as a "halfway house between [[Adbusters]] and [[Forbes]]", according to Heaps.

The magazine was first published in the wake of the accounting scandals at [[Enron]] and [[WorldCom]] with the objective of holding companies more accountable while recognizing that "power is where the money is, and if you want to make social change, it's through business." Heaps has made clear since the magazine was founded that there's no pretending that corporations are saints. "There are no Mother Teresas here. But these are the best we've got."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20021016.MEETHI%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3D%2522corporate%2Bknights%2522&amp;ord=2785550&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true The Globe and Mail - Glossy offers new spin on business ethics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, two of the magazine's major goals has been to publicize positive business practices and rank the sustainability performance of companies.

CK has expanded both its reach and research over the past decade.{{When|date=June 2016}}

===CK Media===

''Corporate Knights'' magazine is a business and society publication focused on how companies, markets and governments are advancing social and environmental sustainability worldwide. Calling itself "the magazine for clean capitalism", it highlights and analyses trends around sustainable corporate practices and investment products. In 2012, an overhaul of the magazine's content and design was conducted. On June 6, 2013, the National Magazine Awards Foundation named ''Corporate Knights'' "Magazine of the Year". The publication was also nominated for having Best Feature Package and Best Artistic Package in 2012.

There are approximately 139,850 copies of ''Corporate Knights'' magazine distributed quarterly through the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and Canadian newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. The magazine is also direct-mailed to corporate and political decision makers worldwide. Its largest presence is in North America and Europe. A digital version was launched in spring 2012 through iTunes in partnership with e-publisher PixelMags,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pixelmags.com&lt;/ref&gt; and another 10,000 digital copies are distributed through the Globe and Mail's Globe2Go e-paper delivery service.

CK Media also produces an e-newsletter and is active on social media. In 2013, the magazine launched a mobile app called CK Ranker&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ckranker.com&lt;/ref&gt; that lets any company rank its sustainability performance and compare itself against industry peers. The magazine published its November (Winter 2013) issue on paper made from 60 per cent wheat straw, a first in North America, part of a partnership with Prairie Paper Ventures, a company co-founded by actor Woody Harrelson, who appears on the issue's cover.

===Research===

The Corporate Knights research division produces corporate rankings, research reports and financial product ratings based on corporate sustainability performance. A significant portion of this research is used in the rankings and reports published in ''Corporate Knights'' magazine.

''Corporate Knights'' magazine issues annual rankings, special reports and annual awards for companies. Some of which are listed below (date indicates the year each began):

*2002 – Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada (annual ranking);
*2003 – Sustainable MBA Ranking (ran as Knight Schools Ranking 2003 to 2012)

'''Annual Rankings'''

*The Global 100

In 2005, CK started the first annual list of [[the Global 100]] Most Sustainable Corporations. This annual ranking is a comprehensive data driven analysis of the world's largest public firms. It has been recognized as a leader in transparency and industry best practices for sustainability rankings, according to SustainAbility's Rate the Raters project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainability.com/projects/rate-the-raters#projtab-6|title=Rate the Raters – Projects - SustainAbility|work=sustainability.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global 100 seeks to mainstream sustainability in the business community to demonstrate that large, successful companies in a range of industries can be fiscally responsible, financially successful and focused on sustainability.

*50 Best Corporate Citizens in Canada

Since 2001, CK has published the annual list of Canada's top corporate citizens.  Companies are transparently ranked on their relative carbon, water, waste and energy impacts as well as citizenship indicators including pension fund quality, board diversity, ratio of CEO-pay to lowest paid worker, and tax dollar generation, as well as sector specific indicators such as renewable energy investments (for financial companies) and respect for human rights (for resource extraction companies).

*Cleantech Ranking

Corporate Knights began publishing a special report on the cleantech sector in 2006, when it created its Cleantech 10 and Next 10 lists of established and up-and-coming Canadian clean technology companies. A Cleantech 10 list of U.S. companies was also created in 2012 in partnership with the [[Cleantech Group]]. In 2013 the magazine shifted gears by focusing its coverage on the Cleantech Group's Cleantech 100 list of global cleantech leaders, part of an effort to better represent its North American (and global) readership.

*Global Green MBA Survey

The magazine created its annual sustainability ranking of Canadian MBA schools in 2003. Called Knight Schools, the special section periodically ranked engineering and other professional schools over the years. In 2013, a decision was made to expand the ranking beyond Canada.

'''Awards of Distinction'''

*Greenest Prime Minister

This was a one-of award.  In 2006, Corporate Knights solicited the input of prominent Canadians, including [[Elizabeth May]], [[Maude Barlow]], [[Sheila Copps]] and Monte Hummel, to rank the environmental impact of Canadian Prime Ministers.

Selected as having accomplished the most to improve Canada's environment, [[Brian Mulroney]] was honoured at an [[Earth Day#Earth Week|Earth Week]] Gala dinner in [[Ottawa]] as the 'Greenest PM in Canadian History'. The event brought together former Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]], television host [[Ben Mulroney]], US Ambassador [[David Wilkins]] and other dignitaries to recognize Mulroney's positive environmental impact. His government established the [[Acid Rain]] Accord, the [[Canadian Environmental Protection Act]], the [[Canadian Environmental Assessment Act]], the [[Great Lakes]] Action Plan, and the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] and ratified the [[Montreal Protocol]].

Canadian comedian [[Rick Mercer]] provided commentary throughout the evening, which was broadcast live on national television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canuckpolitics.com/2006/04/20/the-greenest-prime-minister/|title=The Greenest Prime Minister|work=Canuck Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060420/mulroney_green_cp_060419/20060420?hub=TopStories |title=CTV News - Top Stories - Breaking News - Top News Headlines |work=ctv.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023075138/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060420/mulroney_green_cp_060419/20060420?hub=TopStories |archivedate=2007-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/04/20/mulroney060420.html CBC News - Mulroney honoured for environmental record&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate Knights also undertakes initiatives to influence public policy, including a 2006 $100 billion carbon pricing plan for Canada to reach its [[Kyoto agreement|Kyoto]] target,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070301.ENVIRO01/TPStory/?query=%22corporate+knights%22 The Globe and Mail - Opposition MPs mull carbon-tax proposal &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; convening the first Energy Ministers' meeting on building a transcanadian grid for transporting green electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20070420.RPOWER20%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3D%2522green%2Bpower%2Bcorridor%2522&amp;ord=3365057&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true The Globe and Mail - Ministers call for national grid &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Option 13 initiative to make trade implications a central consideration of the Copenhagen meeting in November–December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122826696217574539|title=We Need a Global Carbon Tax|author=Ralph Nader and ToHeaps|date=3 December 2008|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 CK helped put together a working group to explore a Green Power Corridor summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporateknights.com/in-the-press/72-press-releases/252-green-power-corridor-summit-in-ottawa-official-transcript.html Corporate Knights- Green Power Corridor Summit in Ottawa] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730133601/http://www.corporateknights.com/in-the-press/72-press-releases/252-green-power-corridor-summit-in-ottawa-official-transcript.html |date=2012-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Option13 was a 2008 initiative intended to promote three choices for 2013 in the face of [[climate change]].  [[Ralph Nader]] and CK's Toby Heaps published an article about it in the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122826696217574539|title=We Need a Global Carbon Tax|author=Ralph Nader and ToHeaps|date=3 December 2008|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prioritizing Global Reporting Initiative Indicators'''

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) created the G3 sustainability reporting guidelines as well as 14 sector-specific supplements.  GRI identified these barriers to sustainable investing that must be overcome:

*1. Lack of prioritization: When investors calculate [[Return on investment|ROI]] there are hundreds of indicators not deemed financially significant and if there's limited disclosure anyhow, investors naturally shy from the challenge.
*2. Data doubts: Consensus on ESG factors is hard to come by and even when it is approached there can be uncertainty about sources, limitations and characteristics of available data.
*3. Lack of guidance on how to integrate ESG metrics into standard valuation models: There isn't yet a default model of using ESG data once it is collected and ratified by the investor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emc.com/about/sustainability/gri-index.htm EMC- GRI Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090256/http://www.emc.com/about/sustainability/gri-index.htm |date=2012-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

G3.1 is GRI's most recent iteration of its Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting/latest-guidelines/g3-1-guidelines/Pages/default.aspx Global Reporting- G3.1 Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609151956/https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting/latest-guidelines/g3-1-guidelines/Pages/default.aspx |date=2012-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24924">Certain associates of the former [[President of the Philippines|Philippine president]] and dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] have benefited from their friendship with Marcos - whether in terms of legal assistance,  political favours, or facilitation of business monopolies, during the latter's administration.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salonga2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lustre20160225"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/123667-marcos-cronies-compromise |title=Search for Marcos' wealth: Compromising with cronies |last=Lustre |first=Philip M. , Jr. |date=2016-02-25 |work=Rappler |access-date=2018-05-26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies20160507"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/07/10bn-dollar-question-marcos-millions-nick-davies |title=The $10bn question: what happened to the Marcos millions? |last=Davies |first=Nick |date=2016-05-07 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2018-05-26 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos critics, and the local and international press began referring to these individuals as "'''cronies'''" during the latter days of the Marcos dictatorship,&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt; and the Philippine government - especially the [[Presidential Commission on Good Governance|Presidential Commission on Good Governance (PCGG)]] - continued using the term after the ouster of the Marcoses in 1986.&lt;ref name="Salonga2000"/&gt;

These "[[cronies]]" were awarded government commissions, projects and funds, many of which were later investigated for corruption, misuse of funds, and disregard for the Philippine constitution. Marcos' cronies were given strategic positions both in the government and in private sectors, in order for the Marcoses to seize control of the major industries of the country.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salonga2000"/&gt;

==Individuals regarded as cronies==
=== Juan Ponce Enrile ===
{{Main|Juan Ponce Enrile}}
Enrile served the Marcos Administration under many positions. He was Commissioner of Customs in 1965, then rose to Secretary of Defense in 1970. He resigned a year later to run unsuccessfully for the senate, but he was quickly reinstated in 1972. The Marcos administration also fabricated an ambush of Enrile’s car, claiming it was done by militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/284836/true-or-false-was-1972-enrile-ambush-faked|title=True or false: Was 1972 Enrile ambush faked?|last=Research|first=Inquirer|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This staged act served as justification for the declaration of martial law. Enrile later admitted to the plot, revealing in a 1985 interview that the attack on his car had been faked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/sunstar-cebu/20121001/281848640818193|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the majority of Martial Law, Enrile was in charge of all the armed forces, which were responsible for many human rights abuses and summary executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/why-not-ask-ramos-and-enrile-about-martial-law-abuses/247486/|title=Why not ask Ramos and Enrile about Martial Law ‘abuses’? - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrile was also involved with many cases of corruption, namely:

* involvement in the smuggle of goods during his appointment at the Bureau of Customs, particularly several shiploads of imported rice in La Union.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28428684|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Ricardo.|first=Manapat,|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=9719128704|location=New York|oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* with Marcos, gave concessions to politically-favored logging companies, such as to Juan Tuvera, the presidential assistant, and a nephew of Isabela governor Faustino Dy, a close Marcos associate. Publicly, Enrile made pronouncements against illegal logging, yet he allowed logging concessions to their associates. Alfonso Lim, another close associate of the Marcoses, was allowed 7 logging concessions with a total area of 600,000 hectares, a number far from the 100,000  hectare constitutional limit to any one family. Enrile also owns San Jose Lumber, which is a 95,777 hectare logging concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/540281/navigating-the-crimes-of-the-plunder-mastermind|title=Navigating the crimes of the plunder mastermind|last=INQUIRER.net|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* involvement with the [[Coco Levy Fund scam|Coconut Levy Fund scam]], which was originally a tax plan for coconut farmers which will give them opportunities to invest stocks and buy industry-related businesses for their benefit. However, Enrile, with Danding Cojuangco, allegedly used the earnings of the Fund for his own personal and business affairs.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28428684 |title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism |last=Ricardo. |first=Manapat, |date=1991 |publisher=Aletheia Publications |isbn=9719128704 |location=New York |oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cojuangco allegedly used the levy earnings to purchase [[San Miguel Corporation]], the biggest food and beverage conglomerate in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/rich-media/18846-2012-yearender-the-san-miguel-coco-levy-saga|title=2012 YEARENDER: The San Miguel-coco levy saga|work=Rappler|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine Commission on Good Government stated that nearly P9.8 billion was collected from farmers from 1971-1983. Current coconut levy assets amount to P93 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/158066-coco-levy-fund-scam-coconut-farmers-quezon|title=Coco levy fund scam: Gold for the corrupt, crumbs for farmers|work=Rappler|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antonio Floirendo, Sr ===
{{Main|Antonio Floirendo Sr.}}
Banana magnate Floirendo began his business career in [[Davao City]] in the 1940s, when he found it favorable to cultivate relationships with running politicians. He contributed to Marcos’ 1965 and 1969 presidential campaign funds, and it was in his Davao estate where Marcos launched his 1969 presidential campaign in southern Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/09/27/17/encounters-with-a-dictator|title=Encounters with a dictator|last=News|first=Gerry Lirio, ABS-CBN|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Marcos administration, Floirendo’s company Tagum Agricultural Development Company, Inc. (TADECO) leased 6,000 hectares of prime, fertile, government land and employed prison labor from the neighboring prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/24/magazine/creating-a-dynasty-in-the-philipines.html|title=CREATING A DYNASTY IN THE PHILIPINES [sic]|last=Kamm|first=Henry|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was formerly halted during the Macapagal Administration. It violated the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines and Philippine corporate law, which permitted only up to 1,024 land acquisition. Sen. Lorendo Tañada chaired a Blue Ribbon Committee investigation into the matter, which caused Floirendo to retreat the plan to wait for a more favorable political climate. His plan finally came into fruition after Marcos’ second term.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt;

Floirendo also served as a front for the Marcoses in purchasing international properties. With former [[First Lady or First Gentleman of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]], he purchased three condominium apartments in [[Olympic Tower]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-owns-tadeco/332278/|title=Marcos owns Tadeco - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He purchased two expensive units at the St. James Towers in Manhattan. He purchased a $1.35 million mansion in Makiki Heights in Hawaii. The mansion, known as the Helen Knudsen estate, sits directly across the Tantoco house where the Marcoses lived in exile. He purchased the $4.5 million Lindenmere estate in Long Island New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/01/nyregion/the-simple-4.5-million-marcos-house.html|title=The 'Simple' $4.5 Million Marcos House|last=Times|first=Constance L. Hays and Special To the New York|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a $2.5 million Beverly Hills property.&lt;ref name="Salonga2000"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44927743|title=Presidential plunder : the quest for the Marcos ill-gotten wealth|last=R.|first=Salonga, Jovito|date=2000|publisher=U.P. Center for Leadership, Citizenship and Democracy|isbn=9718567283|location=[Quezon City]|oclc=44927743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Floirendo escaped the Philippines a day before Ferdinand Marcos was exiled to Hawaii. In 1987, Floirendo turned over PHP 70 million in cash to the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]], as well as titles for the Lindenmere Estate, the Olympic Towers apartments, and the Makiki Heights Drive property. He admitted transferring amounts of $600,000, $2 million, and $4 million to George Hamilton, an American actor involved in the Marcos’ business ties and federal fraud and racketeering cases. They were supposedly loans from Imelda Marcos, who he alleges to have ordered him these transfers. He also admitted that the Marcos-tied corporations of Ancor, Calno, Kuodo and Camelton belonged to him.&lt;ref name="Salonga2000"/&gt;

=== Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco ===
{{Main|Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.}}
Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco kept close, familial ties with the Marcoses. Aside from business and political dealings, Cojuanco and Marcos are godfathers to each other’s children — Cojuangco to Marcos’ junior, nicknamed Bongbong, and Marcos to Cojuangco’s son which he named ‘[[Mark Cojuangco|Marcos]]’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/557373/ninong-danding-said-i-can-woo-npc-members-to-my-side-bongbong-marcos/story/|title=Ninong Danding said I can woo NPC members to my side—Bongbong Marcos|work=GMA News Online|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cojuangco, with Juan Ponce Enrile, were involved with the [[Coco Levy Fund scam|Coco Levy Fund Scam]], which taxed small farmers with the promise of shares in the coconut investment company (Cocofund). However, farmers benefitted nothing from this levy, as the middle-men did not return receipts that proved they paid the coconut levy and were entitled to equity in the company.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt;

Due to the sudden surge of the price of coconuts in the world market, this fund became extremely profitable, amounting to as much as $785 million total profits. These funds were channeled to the private financial interests of Marcos and cronies and was consolidated in the [[United Coconut Planters Bank]] (UCPB).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/70531/news/danding-cojuangco-and-the-coco-levy-funds/|title=Danding Cojuangco and the coco levy funds|website=GMA News Online|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the backing of the Marcos government and the wealth from the levy fund, Cojuangco was able to completely vertically integrate the coconut trade industry by controlling the financing through UCPB and by buying out Unicom, which was the entity in charge of manufacturing and trading of coconut and coconut by-products. Cojuangco’s wealth increased rapidly, and by the peak of martial law, the value of all the assets he controlled was $1.5 billion, or 25% of the GNP.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt;

Cojuangco then used the windfalls from the coconut levy fund and [[United Coconut Planters Bank]] to finance his purchase of the enormously profitable [[San Miguel Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/169233/aquino-urged-to-speak-up-on-coco-levy-fund-or-else|title=Aquino urged to speak up on coco levy fund, or else|last=Burgonio|first=Michael Lim Ubac, TJ|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marcos government gave favors to [[San Miguel Corporation|San Miguel Corporation (SMC)]]. When taxes for liquor and cigarettes were raised in January 1986, excise taxes on beer decreased. Beer is one of the main products of SMC. The tax cut gave SMC $40 million worth of savings that year.

=== Roberto Benedicto ===
{{Main|Roberto Benedicto}}
Roberto Benedicto was Marcos’ former classmate and fraternity brother at the [[University of the Philippines College of Law|UP Law School]].&lt;ref name="Marcos Graft Staggering"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-23/news/8601210600_1_jose-y-campos-eduardo-cojuangco-ferdinand-marcos|title=Marcos Graft Staggering|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Marcos was president, Benedicto became part of his small circle in [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañan]], one of the few with full access even to private quarters.

Under the Marcos administration, he served as Ambassador to Japan and Chief of the [[Philippine National Bank]], which was the largest state-owned bank at the time. He permitted huge loans for business of other cronies and associates. He used PNB to grant loans for his shipping company, Northern Lines, and his sugar business. His election as Japanese Ambassador allowed him to develop high-level contacts in Japan. Working with President Marcos, they ratified the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation between Japan and the Philippines, which gave Japan a “most-favored nation” status.&amp;nbsp; This agreement gave Japan undue advantage in using the country’s natural resources, which was the primary reason the Philippine Senate did not ratify the treaty for 13 years. Benedicto, understanding the business interests of the Japanese, arranged lucrative joint-venture operations between Japanese corporations and his own. His role as Ambassador also gave him control of the $550 million Japanese war reparations money.&lt;ref name="Marcos Graft Staggering"/&gt;

At the prime of his career, Benedicto’s empire consisted of 85 corporations, 106 sugar farms, 14 haciendas, other agricultural lands, 17 radio stations, 16 television stations, 2 telecommunications networks, 7 buildings, 10 vessels and 5 aircraft.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt; He also owned 14 hectares of real estate in Bacolod City, 13.5 billion shares in Oriental Petroleum, and membership shares in golf and country clubs estimated at $491,000.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt; Overseas, he owned a sugar mill in [[Venezuela]], a trading company in Madrid, bank deposits, mansions, and limousines in [[California]]. Marcos’ executive secretary estimated that in 1983, Benedicto’s net worth was $800 million.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt;

=== Lucio Tan ===
{{Main|Lucio Tan}}
[[Lucio Tan]] styles himself as a rags-to-riches self-made millionaire who worked his way up&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/sunday-life/2016/08/28/1617877/behind-many-great-success-stories-are-tales-struggle-and-adversity|title=Behind many great success stories are tales of struggle and adversity {{!}} Philstar.com|website=philstar.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; from sweeping and mopping floors to becoming one of the most influential people in Philippine history. However, a closer inspection at his history will reveal deep connections and cronyism to President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who was able to launch Tan’s immense wealth through sky-high tariff rates on imported cigarettes, under-the-table tax breaks, and government exemptions, all of which allowed Lucio Tan to have a “virtual monopoly for over 40 years in the Philippine Market”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/02/25/10/philip-morris-and-its-philippine-saga|title=Philip Morris and its Philippine saga|last=abs-cbnNEWS.com/Newsbreak|first=By Lala Rimando,|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fortune Tobacco Corpration|Fortune Tobacco Corp]], founded in 1966 (FTC), is the epicenter of Lucio Tan’s fortune. While it is unclear how much of the market FTC cornered in 1980, estimates range from 60% to 77%.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt; This outright dominance of the cigarette trade in just 14 short years can be attributed to the massive tariffs on imported cigarettes that Tan enjoyed. The nominal rate of protection for cigarettes was at 182% while the Effective Rate of Protection (ERP) was at a colossal rate of 18,758%. This, coupled with the fact that, according to Manapat, during the Martial Law years Lucio Tan regularly evaded taxes, as much as $50 million per year. In addition to this, Fortune Tobacco Corp lawyers were the brains behind the tax laws concerning cigarettes that allowed Tan to completely dominate the cigarette industry.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt;

Lucio Tan’s virtual monopoly on cigarettes afforded him all the advantages in the world, to the detriment of the consumers and buyers and therefore, made the cigarette industry a supplier-driven industry.

=== Geronimo Velasco ===
Velasco was the first chief of the Philippine Ministry of Energy, which was established by Marcos in 1979. The Ministry of Energy sought to remedy the skyrocketing oil and power rates brought by the 1973 global oil crisis, by building power plants from natural energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.doe.gov.ph/minister-geronimo-z-velasco|title=Minister Geronimo Z. Velasco  {{!}} DOE {{!}} Department of Energy Portal|website=www.doe.gov.ph|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his appointment, 20 power plants using hydroelectric, thermal, geothermal energy were completed. A major controversy in his career were the government-imposed levies and taxes on the retail price of gasoline. The gross price of regular gasoline per liter was Php 2.20. After taxes, it totaled to Php5.05, which is more than 50% of the retail cost.

During the government’s corruption probe during the Marcos regime, it was found that Velasco’s net worth was estimated to be around $50 million by 1986. He had several million-dollar real estate properties around the world, such as a $1.5 million mansion, a $675,000 condominium both in California, several houses around Metro-Manila, and a reported resort house on the Bataan peninsula only reachable by helicopter or boat. Apart from these properties, Velasco also chaired several government and private corporations, in many petroleum, coal mining, transportation, mineral exploration, and shipping businesses. During the probe, Velasco claimed that he earned his wealth before his appointment under the Marcos administration. However, probers discovered that his net worth was $5.4 million before he joined the government, and it ballooned to $50 million, which is an 825% increase in only 13 years.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt;

=== Roman "Jun" Cruz ===
Cruz served as Undersecretary of Finance from 1968-1970, but he is more well known for his bankrolling Imelda Marcos’ trips abroad using Philippine Air Lines funds, which he also managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asiatravel.com/philippines/airticket/airlinefactsheet/philippineairlines.html|title=Philippine Airlines|website=asiatravel.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his chairmanship, the airline was poorly managed and steadily lost venture. This is due to First Lady Imelda Marcos’ indiscriminate international trips,&lt;ref name="Marcos Graft Staggering"/&gt; Cruz’s mismanagement, misuse of funds, and his lack of experience.  In 1979, PAL lost $33 million, and by 1983, the airline had already lost $63 million. In order to minimize the losses, Cruz asked help from Malacañan. The government increased PAL’s capitalization from $127 million to $380 million, and $63 million from the National Development Corp. was given to PAL. Despite these additions of government money, PAL continued to suffer loses due to Cruz’s mismanagement and lack of experience.

Cruz also served as president and general manager of the Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/73215/sc-tells-pcgg-to-substantiate-alleged-marcos-links-in-multi-billion-graft-case/story/|title=SC tells PCGG to substantiate alleged Marcos links in multi-billion graft case|work=GMA News Online|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; GSIS was originally established for financial aid of low-salaried government employees, providing investments, pensions, and housing loans. In 1980, under Cruz’s administration, house loans were phased out. Instead, the GSIS funded Marcos-connected companies and Imelda-inspired projects. Of GSIS’ total budget of $1.3 billion, 65% or $843 million went into Imelda’s lucrative projects, such as luxury hotels made to impress delegates of the IMF-World Bank conference.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt;

=== Rodolfo Cuenca ===
{{Main|Rodolfo Cuenca}}
Cuenca was a college [[Dropping out|dropout]] who campaigned and raised funds for Marcos during the 1965 presidential elections and later became Marcos’ close friend and golf partner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer/20100927/285538016850027|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became the head of [[Philippine National Construction Corporation|Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines]] (CDCP) which built many of the country’s dams, highways, and bridges, including the [[San Juanico Bridge]], which was a major project that connected Leyte and Samar. CDCP also built many lucrative projects at the behest of the first lady Imelda Marcos, such as a land-reclamation project to create a 240-hectare while beach, a huge complex of native-style pavilions, all to impress foreign delegates of international events and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/excerpts-from-builder-bridges-rudy-cuenca-story-gene-gregorio|title=Excerpts from Builder of Bridges: The Rudy Cuenca Story|date=2016-12-29|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government probes have found documents that suggested Marcos received millions of dollars in kickbacks in government construction projects from Cuenca’s company. CDCP experienced remarkable growth and a sudden collapse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is due to great amounts of foreign loans, dependence on the government, purchases of heavy equipment even when unnecessary, and high debt to equity ratio. In 1978, CDCP accumulated a staggering $158 million debt, which steadily rose to $650 million by 1980.&lt;ref name="Manapat1999"/&gt;

== Alleged role in Marcos' "''techniques of plunder''"==
According to [[Jovito Salonga]] in his book "Presidential Plunder", which details Salonga's time as head of the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]], these cronies helped the Marcoses amass his wealth by aiding him in one or more of what Salonga called "''Marcos' Techniques of Plunder.''"&lt;ref name="Salonga2000"/&gt;

These techniques,&lt;ref name="Salonga2000"/&gt; Says salonga, were:
#. Creating monopolies and putting them under the control of cronies;
#. Awarding behest loans to cronies from Government banking or financing institutions;
#. Forced takeovers of various public or private enterprises, with a nominal amount as payment;
#. Direct raiding of the public treasury and Government Financing Institutions;
#. Issuance of Presidential Decrees or orders, enabling cronies to amass wealth;
#. Kickbacks and commissions from enterprises doing business in the Philippines;
#. Use of shell corporations and dummy companies to launder money overseas;
#. Skimming off of Foreign Aid and other forms of International Assistance; and
#. Hiding wealth in overseas bank accounts using pseudonyms or code names.

== In popular culture==
*In the film ''[[Citizen Jake]]'', the titular character's father, Senator Jacobo Herrera is explicitly referred to as a "Marcos crony" who had to leave the Philippines after the Marcoses were deposed in 1986, but had returned to the Philippines and successfully reestablished himself in Philippine politics.&lt;ref name="KristineJoyPatag20180502"&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2018/05/02/1811461/citizen-jake-gets-nationwide-release |title= 'Citizen Jake' gets nationwide release |website= Philstar.com |last=Patag |first= Kristine Joy |date= 2018-05-02 |access-date= 2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Daju people''' are a group of seven distinct ethnicities speaking related languages (see [[Daju languages]]) living on both sides of the [[Chad]]-[[Sudan]] border and in the [[Nuba Mountains]]. Separated by distance and speaking different languages, at present, they generally have little cultural affinity to each other.

The traditional area identified with the Daju are the Daju Hills in the southern portion of the [[Marrah Mountains]] located in the [[Darfur]] province of [[Sudan]]. As the Marrah Mountains are the only area in Darfur that has a temperate climate and thus could support large populations, a Daju state arose perhaps as early as the 12th century. Very little is known of this kingdom except for a list of kings and several mentions in Egyptian texts. The Daju appear to be the dominant group in Darfur from earliest times vying for control with their northern [[Marrah Mountains|Marrah Mountain]] rivals, the agricultural [[Fur people]].

==Origins==
The Daju, who known to Henri Barth as "Pharaoh's Folk", had migrated originally from the Nile valley in the aftermath of the invasion of Kingdom of [[Meroe]] by Izana, king of [[Axum]] around the middle of the fourth century A.D. Accounts refer their origins to Shendi, which means in their own language "ewe." First they settled in Wadi al-Malik (Wadi Howar) and Jebel Midob in B.C. 3000 then invaded the Nile valley and Egypt where they ruled under the name of Libyan Pharaohs. An Egyptian Pharaoh expelled them southwards where they established Nepta. Then they have been driven southwards again to Meroe until Izana drove them westwards to Wadi Howar and Kordofan in western Sudan and there they re-established their kingdom around Jebel Qadir in the Nuba Mountains. After several generations, they annexed the land now called Dar Fur and beyond. Historians attribute this later expansion to the war between the Daju kingdom and the Kingdom of [[Dongola]] in 1100 AD which led King Ahmed al-Daj to relocate his headquarters to Meri in [[Jebel Marra]] massif. Meanwhile, Semia, one of Daju capitals, was completely destroyed by the Amir from Dongola.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Robert S., Lobban, Richard A. &amp; Fluehr-Lobban, Carolyn (2013).

==History==
{{main|Daju kingdom|Dar Sila}}
The Daju empire is said to have spread its control as far east as [[Kurdufan]], west of the Nuba Mountains and as far west as [[Chad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientsudan.org/articles_ibrahim_musa_westernsudan.html Musa, Abraham; Ancient History of Western Sudan] US Military: Defense Language Institute, August 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;[http://orvillejenkins.com/profiles/daju.html Jenkins, Orville; The Daju Populations of Sudan and Chad]&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian historian [[Al-Maqrizi]], writing about 1400, described "Taju" as being a fairly powerful kingdom lying between [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] and the Nile kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;al-Maqrizi in Nehemiah Levztion and J. F. P. Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History'' (Cambridge, 1981, reprinted Princeton, NJ, 2000), pp 353-54.&lt;/ref&gt; The Daju people are said to have settled in a long belt stretching from [[South Kurdufan]] westward through [[Darfur]] and into [[Chad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/The-Nuba-A-People-s-Struggle-for,26576 Sudan Tribune: "The Nuba: A People’s Struggle for Political Niche and Equity in Sudan"] April 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, the Daju dynasty was conquered by the [[Sokoro language|Sokoro]]-speaking [[Tunjur people]] in the 14th century who moved from the west via the kingdoms of [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] and [[Ouaddai Empire|Wadai]]. The Daju were scattered with their king escaping westward with some of his people and establishing a small new kingdom in the Dar Sila Area in Chad, becoming the [[Dar Sila Daju]] people.

Other Daju moved eastward eventually settling in what is now South Kurdufan province near [[Muglad]] just north of [[Abyei]] and west of the Nuba Mountains. Records indicate that they consisted of two distinct Daju groups although it is uncertain if this migration displaced pre-existing non-Daju peoples or if one of the Daju groups was already indigenous to the area. There is one source that indicates that both the Ngok [[Dinka]] to the South and the [[Messiria]] to the North admit that the Daju were the indigenous people of Muglad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudaneseonline.com/earticle2006/mar14-33936.shtml Sudanese Online: "ABC REPORT REVISITTED: A REPLY TO ADAM B ELHIRAIKA,PhD By Charles K Deng"] March 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They were eventually displaced by the [[Messiria tribe|Messiria]] pushing down from the north and were forced south into [[Abyei]] where they were defeated and again dispersed by the Ngok [[Dinka]]. One group was driven westward (possibly the ancestors of the Njalgulgule people) and the other group, consisting of Dar Fur Daju, were driven east into the Nuba Hills settling near Lagowa where they developed their own distinct dialect of the [[Nyala language (Sudan)|Nyala language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occasionalwitness.com/content/nuba/01History01.htm#I] Ende, Nanne op't, History of the Nuba, part I&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the Tunjur introduced [[Islam]] to the region (which had previously been pagan) and gradually adopted [[Arabic]] as their administrative language. In 1596, control of Darfur passed into the hands of the hybrid [[Keira dynasty]] through intermarriage between the last sultan of the ruling Tunjur dynasty, Ahmad al-Maqur and its more populous vassals the [[Fur people]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndu.edu/CTNSP/docUploaded//HSCB%20Social%20Sci%20Macro%20-%20Dr%20Richard%20Lobban%20-%20Marrying%20Modeling%20with%20Empiricism%20-%20the%20case%20and%20context%20of%20Sudan.pdf Dr. Richard A Lobban, Professor of Anthropology, Rhode Island College.

==Geography==
As a result of their defeat at the hands of the Tunjur and then dominance by the Fur, the Daju were displaced from much of their territory and now exist in several distinct pockets in the Sudan and Chad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?rop3=102392&amp;rog3=SU Joshua Project Daju people] map of Daju settlement&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining Daju people exist in the following distinct groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/daju Ethnologue Entry on Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic, Western, Daju Languages] retrieved May 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Baygo people|Beygo]]''' numbering 850 (1978) living in [[Southern Darfur]] in the [[Sudan]] southeast of [[Nyala]] in the hills east of Kube. The [[Beigo|Beygo]] language is now extinct with most of the remaining population speaking Arabic
*'''[[Dar Daju Daju people|Dar Daju Daju]]''' numbering 34,000 (1993) and living in the [[Guéra Region]] of [[Chad]]. They speak the [[Daju Mongo language]].
*'''[[Dar Fur Daju people|Dar Fur Daju]]''' numbering 80,000 (2007) and living in [[Southern Darfur]] in the [[Sudan]] in the Daju Hills 40&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Nyala]]. They speak the [[Nyala language (Sudan)|Nyala language]]. Much of this population has fled to Chad as a result of the [[Darfur Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/opinion/19kristof.html New York Times: "The Face of Genocide"] November 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a small population of Dar Fur Daju near the city of Lagowa in the Nuba Hills.
*'''[[Dar Sila|Dar Sila Daju]]''' numbering 63,100 (2000) and living in southern [[Chad]] in the [[Ouaddaï Region|Ouaddai]] region. They speak the [[Sila language (Chad)|Sila language]].
*'''[[Ngulgule|Njalgulgule]]''' numbering 900 (1977) and living in one village in southern Sudan near the confluence of the Sopo River and Boro River. They speak the [[Njalgulgule language]]. They are likely a later out-migration resulting from the collapse of the Daju empire.

There are also two groups located in the [[Nuba Mountains]] and due to their sharp linguistic differential from each other as well as the other Daju languages, it is generally agreed that they come from a very early migration (perhaps 2,000 years ago) out of the Daju [[Urheimat]] in the [[Marrah Mountains]]. There they carved out their own small territory in the midst of the original inhabitants of the eastern Nuba Mountains, the [[Kordofanian]] tribes, as well as amongst later migrating tribal/linguistic groupings: the [[Nyima languages|Nyimang]] tribes, the [[Temein languages|Temein]] tribes, and the [[Kadugli language|Kadugli]] tribes. The migration of the [[Hill Nubian]] tribes in the Nuba Hills is generally seen as coming after the main Daju migration. The Nuba Mountains have generally been an area of "retreat" for persecuted groups seeking security hence the significant linguistic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenubian.net/settlement.php Thelwall, Robin; The Linguistic Settlement of the Nuba Mountains]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Logorik people|Logorik]]''' numbering 2,000 (1971) and living in the central Nuba Mountains. They speak the [[Liguri language]].
*'''[[Shatt people|Shatt]]''' number 15,000 (1984) and living in the Nuba Hills southeast{{Clarify|date=August 2015}} of the capital [[Kadugli]]. They speak the [[Shatt language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occasionalwitness.com/related/nuba/02Culture02settlement.htm by Thelwall, Robin; The Linguistic Settlement of the Nuba Mountains] 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customs/Religion==
The Daju are primarily grain farmers (mainly millet, sorghum, and corn). Secondarily, they hunt as well as gather (mainly honey, berries and wild fruits).&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; Women perform much of the daily work.  They plant and sow the crops, ground the grain, and cook the meals. They are also the primary house-builders. The typical Daju home is round with a cone roof although in the towns, houses are often rectangular. Community chores are shared. Traditionally, Daju women tattoo their eyelids, gums, and lips with acacia thorns.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

The Dar Sila Daju in Chad are arranged by male-led clans. Each clan has its own separate role in society. The Sultan is chosen from one of the clans and his advisors are drawn from other clans. The Sultanship primarily serves the role of religious leader but is also a symbol of tribal identity and unity.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

The Dar Daju Daju and the Dar Sila Daju are predominantly [[Muslim]] but they still practice many of their traditional religious customs  including the building of straw shrines to their traditional high god Kalge whom they equate with Allah of Islam.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

The Dar Fur Daju maintain their old and original religion. They celebrate the traditional grain harvest by pouring out water and beer beneath either a sacred tree or stone.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

This discussion of the '''dental amalgam controversy''' outlines the debate over whether [[dental amalgam]] (the mercury alloy in [[dental filling]]s) should be used. Supporters claim that it is safe, effective and long-lasting while critics argue that claims have been made since the 1840s that amalgam is unsafe because it may cause [[mercury poisoning]] and other [[toxin (alternative medicine)|toxicity]].&lt;ref name="AutoTB-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cda.org"/&gt;

Supporters of amalgam fillings point out that it is safe, durable,&lt;ref name="AutoTB-4"/&gt; relatively inexpensive, and easy to use.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-81"/&gt; On average, amalgam lasts twice as long as [[composite resin|resin composites]], takes less time to place, is tolerant of saliva or blood contamination during placement (unlike composites), and is often about 20-30% less expensive.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-6"/&gt; ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' has suggested that many who claim dental amalgam is not safe are "prospecting for disease" and using pseudoscience to scare patients into more lucrative treatment options.&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org" /&gt;

Those opposed to amalgam use suggest that modern composites are improving in strength.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-3"/&gt; In addition to their claims of possible health and ethical issues, opponents of dental amalgam fillings claim amalgam fillings contribute to mercury contamination of the environment. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account for as much as 5% of total waste water mercury emissions.&lt;ref name="WHOwaste" /&gt; The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system.&lt;ref name="WHOwaste" /&gt; In the United States, most dental practices are prohibited from disposing amalgam waste down the drain.&lt;ref name="EPA effluent guidelines"/&gt; Critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.&lt;ref name="unep.org"/&gt;

It is the position of the [[FDI World Dental Federation]]&lt;ref name="fdiworldental.org"/&gt; as well as numerous dental associations and dental public health agencies worldwide&lt;ref name="AutoTB-83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cda-adc.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ada.org.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britishhomeopathic.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dentist.ie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irishhealth.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adf.asso.fr"/&gt; that amalgam restorations are safe and effective. Numerous other organizations have also publicly declared the safety and effectiveness of amalgam. These include the [[Mayo clinic]],&lt;ref name="newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org"/&gt; the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA),&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt; [[Health Canada]],&lt;ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca"/&gt; [[Alzheimer's Association]],&lt;ref name="alz.org"/&gt; American Academy of Pediatrics,&lt;ref name="aappolicy.aappublications.org"/&gt; [[Autism Society of America]],&lt;ref name="autism-society.org"/&gt; [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]],&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; National Multiple Sclerosis Society,&lt;ref name="nationalmssociety.org"/&gt; New England Journal of Medicine,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; International Journal of Dentistry,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; [[National Council Against Health Fraud]],&lt;ref name="ncahf.org"/&gt; The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR,&lt;ref name="nidcr.nih.gov"/&gt; [[American Cancer Society]],&lt;ref name="Alternative Cancer Therapies 2009, pp.164-166"/&gt; [[Lupus Foundation of America]],&lt;ref name="lupus.org"/&gt; the [[American College of Medical Toxicology]],&lt;ref name="toxicfive"/&gt; the [[American Academy of Clinical Toxicology]],&lt;ref name="toxicfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American College of Medical Toxicology |author1-link = American College of Medical Toxicology |author2 = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |author2-link = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-medical-toxicology-and-the-american-academy-of-clinical-toxicology/ |accessdate = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Consumer Reports''&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org"/&gt; ''[[Prevention (magazine)|Prevention]],''&lt;ref name="AutoTB-7"/&gt; and [[WebMD]].&lt;ref name="webmd.com"/&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|Dental restoration}}

Dental amalgam has had a long history and global impact.&lt;ref name="cda.org" /&gt; It was first introduced in the Chinese materia medica of Su Kung in 659 A.D. during the Tang Dynasty.&lt;ref name="cda.org" /&gt; In Europe, Johannes Stockerus, a municipal physician in Ulm, Germany, recommended amalgam as a filling material as early as 1528.&lt;ref name="cda.org" /&gt; In 1818, Parisian physician Louis Nicolas Regnart added one-tenth by weight of mercury to the fusable metals used as fillings at the time to create a temporarily soft metal alloy at room temperature. Thus, amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal or metals, from the French word amalgame) was invented. This was further perfected in 1826, when Auguste Taveau of Paris used a silver paste made from mixing French silver-tin coins with mercury, which offered more plasticity and a quicker setting time.&lt;ref name="cda.org" /&gt; In Europe, prior to 1818, carious teeth were either filled with a melted metal, usually gold or silver (which would often lead to death of the nerve of the tooth from thermal trauma), or the tooth would be extracted.&lt;ref name="cda.org" /&gt;

=== Crawcour Family and the "Amalgam War" ===
{{POV section|date=June 2016}}
The Crawcours were a family of five Polish dentists who acquired "superficial knowledge" of dentistry in France before moving to England in the 1780s.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; They advertised extensively, proclaiming their skill, and claimed to be surgeon-dentists to European royalty.&lt;ref name="cda.org" /&gt; In 1833, two members of the Crawcour family invaded the growing [[United States of America]] with a cheap coin silver amalgam they called "royal mineral succedaneum". The Crawcours set up elegant dental "parlours" in New York City and competed with the ethical dentists and catered to the wealthy and influential residents of the city.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; The patients reclined on comfortable easy chairs and, unlike other dentists, their dentistry was painless since they did not remove any tooth decay, but rather thumbed a soft mixture of their impure amalgam material into cavities.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; As the Crawcours' business boomed, the conscientious practitioners, who were still working with gold and tin, lost patients. Later, as the brothers' fillings began to fall out, discolor the teeth, and cause tooth fracture because of the cheap amalgam's expansion, the public realized it had been cheated. With that, the brothers returned to Europe in 1834, leaving "a long trail of victimized patients and exasperated dentists".&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; However, the damage had been done: amalgam now had a bad reputation, despite the fact that, if used properly, it would later prove to be a safe and effective restorative material.

The so-called "Amalgam War" raged from 1840 to 1855, "broke up friendships and, even threatened to disrupt the profession."&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; In 1841, the American Society of Dental Surgeons, which had been founded the year before as the first national dental society in the United States, appointed a committee to study the amalgam problem. The committee reported that all filling materials in which mercury was an ingredient were, "hurtful both to the teeth and every part of the mouth, and that there was no tooth in which caries in it could be arrested, and the organ rendered serviceable by being filled, in which gold could not be employed."&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; Two years later, without any scientific testing of silver amalgam, their derogatory report resulted in the society's blanket statement that, "the use of amalgam constitutes malpractice."&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; On the other hand, Dr. Christopher S. Brewster of Paris thought that to condemn the use of amalgam in all cases merely because its use was abused by some "unprincipled quacks" was unwise. He felt that, "much good has been and may be done by a judicious use of this composition."&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt;  In 1844, Dr. Parmly, one of the founding members of the American Society of Dental Surgeons, stated that, "gold is the only substance known that can be permanently relied upon," and Dr. Townsend recommended, "removal of teeth that could not be saved by gold."&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; In 1844, the society's members were warned that they were to sign a pledge never to use amalgam or they would risk being expelled from the membership. Many members resigned, and by 1847 only five of New York's 200 dentists remained in the society, which Dr. Charles C. Allen said had "gold" for its motto.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; As more scientific evidence surfaced, the society rescinded the amalgam pledge. However, this came too late, and the organization folded in 1856.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt; At this time, the American Dental Association was formed and it condoned the use of dental amalgam.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-2" /&gt;

=== Further developments ===

In 1855, Dr. J. Foster Flagg, a professor of dental pathology in Philadelphia, experimented with new mixtures of amalgam. In 1861, he presented his findings to the Pennsylvania Association of Dental Surgeons and, in 1881, he published his book, Plastic and Plastic Fillings (Figure 4). (Amalgam fillings were often called "plastic fillings" at the time.) The inevitable result of this affair was that silver amalgam was proven to be, "an excellent filling material," and expanded dentistry's, "ability to save teeth." Around the same time, John and Charles Tomes in England conducted research on the expansion and contraction of the various amalgam products. During the American Civil War, the debate on the merits of amalgam continued. In dental meetings, with now decades of use and dental research came the recognition of the importance of good technique and proper mixture on long-term success. It was argued that, "the fault was not in the material but in the manipulation....Some men's amalgam is good universally, and some men's gold is bad universally; the difference lies in the preparation of the tooth and in the plug (filling)."&lt;ref name="Hoffmann-Axthelm"/&gt;

More controversy came in 1872, when an amalgam filling was reported as the cause of death of a Nebraska middle-aged man, resulting in a public outcry against the use of amalgam.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-20"/&gt; His physicians reported that the filling caused swelling of his mouth, throat and windpipe, completely hindering respiration. Given that the involved tooth was a lower second molar, it was later considered very likely that the patient died from Ludwig's Angina, which is a type of [[cellulitis]], rather than [[mercury poisoning]]. Another alleged case of "[[Hypersalivation|pytalism]]" causing headache, fever, rapid pulse, metallic taste, loss of appetite, and generalized malaise was reported in 1872 in a female patient following the insertion of eight amalgam fillings.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-21"/&gt; Later, however, another dentist examined the fillings and noted they had, in a short period of time, washed away, and that upon gentle pressure the metal crumbled away. He removed all the fillings with an explorer in three minutes; and concluded poor workmanship alone could have explained the patient's symptoms.

[[Alfred Stock]] was a German chemist who reported becoming very ill in the 1920s and traced his illness to his amalgam fillings and resulting mercury intoxication. He described his recovery after the fillings were removed and believed that amalgam fillings would come to be seen as a, "sin against humanity."&lt;ref name="AutoTB-22"/&gt; Stock had also previously been exposed to toxic levels of mercury vapor during the course of his work, due to his use of liquid mercury in some novel laboratory apparatus he invented.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-23"/&gt;

=== 1990s to present ===

In the 1990s, several governments evaluated the effects of dental amalgam and concluded that the most likely health effects would be due to hypersensitivity or allergy. Germany, Austria, and Canada recommended against placing amalgam in certain individuals such as pregnant women, children, those with renal dysfunction, and those with an allergy to metals. In 2004, the [[Life Sciences Research Office]] analyzed studies related to dental amalgam published after 1996 and concluded that mean urinary mercury concentration (μg of Hg/L in urine, HgU) was the most reliable estimate of mercury exposure.&lt;ref name="LSRO2004"/&gt;  It found that those with dental amalgam were unlikely to reach the levels where adverse effects are seen from occupational exposure (35 μg HgU). Some 95% of study participants had μg HgU below 4-5. Chewing gum, particularly for nicotine, along with more amalgam, seemed to pose the greatest risk of increasing exposure. One gum-chewer had 24.8 μg HgU. Studies have shown that the amount of mercury released during normal chewing is extremely low. It concluded that there was not enough evidence to support or refute many of the other claims such as increased risk of [[autoimmune disorders]], but stated that the broad and nonspecific illness attributed to dental amalgam is not supported by the data.&lt;ref name="LSRO2004"/&gt; Mutter in Germany, however, concludes that "removal of dental amalgam leads to permanent improvement of various chronic complaints in a relevant number of patients in various trials."&lt;ref name="Mutter2005"/&gt;

[[Hal Huggins]], a Colorado dentist (previous to having his license revoked), was a notable critic of dental amalgams and other dental therapies he believed to be harmful.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-24"/&gt; His views on amalgam toxicity were featured on ''[[60 Minutes]]''&lt;ref name="AutoTB-25"/&gt; and he was later criticized as a dentist, "prospecting for disease" and having only an "aura of science" by ''[[Consumer Reports]].''&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org" /&gt; In 1996, a Colorado state judge recommended that Huggins's [[medical license|dental license]] be revoked, for tricking chronically ill patients into thinking that the true cause of their illness was mercury. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported the judge's conclusion that Huggins, "diagnosed 'mercury toxicity' in all his patients, including some without amalgam fillings."&lt;ref name="time-toxic"/&gt; Huggins's license was subsequently revoked by the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners for [[gross negligence]] and the use of unnecessary and unproven procedures.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staudenmayer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-27"/&gt;

== Mercury exposure ==

According to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], all humans are exposed to some level of mercury.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Factors that determine whether health effects occur and their severity include the type of mercury concerned ([[methylmercury]] and [[ethylmercury]], commonly found in fish, being more serious than elemental mercury); the dose; the age or developmental stage of the person exposed (the foetus is most susceptible); the duration of exposure; and the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact).&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; The universal standard for examining [[mercury toxicity]] is usually discussed in terms of the amount of mercury in the bloodstream for short-term exposure or the amount of mercury excreted in the urine relative to creatine for long-term mercury exposure.&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org" /&gt; Elemental mercury (which is a component of amalgam) is absorbed very differently than methylmercury (which is found in fish).&lt;ref name="AutoTB-2"/&gt; The exposure to mercury from amalgam restorations depends on the number and size of restorations, composition, chewing habits, food texture, grinding, brushing of teeth, and many other physiological factors.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-2"/&gt;

The greatest degree of mercury exposure occurs during filling placement and removal. However, this is not the only time mercury vapors are released. When chewing for extended periods of time (more than 30 minutes) an increased level of mercury vapor is released. Vapor levels will return to normal approximately 90 minutes following chewing cessation. This contributes to a daily mercury exposure for those with amalgam filling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Dental Amalgam Mercury Controversy - Inorganic Mercury and the CNS; Genetic Linkage of Mercury and Antibiotic Resistances in Intestinal Bacteria|last = Lorscheider|first = F.|date = 1995|journal = Toxicology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one dental textbook, eating seafood once a week raises urine mercury levels to 5 to 20&amp;nbsp;µg/L, which is equivalent to two to eight times the level of exposure that comes from numerous amalgam fillings. Neither exposure has any known health effect.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-30" /&gt; Scientists agree that dental amalgam fillings release elemental mercury vapor, but studies report different amounts. Estimates range from 1-3 [[microgram]]s (µg) per day according to the FDA.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-31" /&gt; The effects of that amount of exposure are also disputed.&lt;ref name="LSRO2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mutter2005" /&gt;

Newer studies sometimes use mercury vapor analysis instead of the standard exposure test. Because this test was designed for factories and large enclosures, ''Consumer Reports'' has reported that this is not an accurate method of analysis for the mouth. It is less reliable, less consistent, and tends to greatly exaggerate the amount of mercury inhaled.&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org" /&gt; Moreover, it is argued this test additionally exaggerates the amount of mercury inhaled by assuming that all the mercury vapor released is inhaled. This assumption was reviewed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and not found to be valid. Their research review found that most of the mercury vapor released from amalgam fillings is mixed with saliva and swallowed, some part is exhaled, and the remaining fraction is inhaled.&lt;ref name="web.health.gov"/&gt; Of these amounts, it is important to note that the lungs absorb about 80% of inhaled mercury whereas only about 0.01% of swallowed mercury vapour is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name="web.health.gov" /&gt;

A study conducted by measuring the intraoral vapour levels over a 24-hour period in patients with at least nine amalgam restorations showed that the average daily dose of inhaled mercury vapour was 1.7 μg (range from 0.4 to 4.4 μg), which is approximately 1% of the threshold limit value of 300 to 500 μg/day established by the WHO, based on a maximum allowable environmental level of 50 μg/day in the workplace.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-2"/&gt; Critics point out that: (1) the workplace safety standards are based on allowable maxima in the workplace, not mercury [[Biomonitoring|body burden]]; (2) the workplace safety numbers are not applicable to continuous 24-hour exposure, but are limited to a normal work day and a 40-hour workweek;&lt;ref name="osha.gov"/&gt; and (3) the uptake/absorption numbers are averages and not worst-case patients (those most at risk).&lt;ref name="oem.bmj.com"/&gt;

A test that was done throughout the 1980s by some opposition groups and holistic dentists was the skin patch test for mercury allergies. As part of "prospecting for disease," ''Consumer Reports'' wrote that these groups had placed high doses of mercuric chloride on a skin patch which was guaranteed to produce irritation on the patient's skin and subsequent revenue for the person administering the test.&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org" /&gt;

The current recommendations for residential exposure (not including amalgam fillings already accounted for) are as follows: The [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|ATSDR]] Action Level for indoor mercury vapor in residential settings is 1&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the ATSDR MRL (Minimal Risk Level) for chronic exposure is 0.2&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="ATSDRActionLevel"/&gt; According to the ATSDR, the MRL(Minimal Risk Level) is an estimate of the level of daily exposure to a substance that is unlikely to cause adverse non-cancerous health effects. The Action Level is defined as an indoor air concentration of mercury that would prompt officials to consider implementing response actions. It is a recommendation and does not necessarily imply toxicity or health risks.&lt;ref name="ATSDRActionLevel" /&gt; Breathing air with a concentration of 0.2&amp;nbsp;µg mercury/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; would lead to an inhaled amount of approximately 4&amp;nbsp;µg/day (respiratory volume of 20m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day). About 80% of inhaled mercury vapor would be absorbed.&lt;ref name="WHOCICAD"/&gt;

A 2003 monograph on mercury toxicity from the WHO concluded that dental amalgam contributes significantly to mercury body burden in humans with amalgam fillings and that dental amalgam is the most common form of exposure to elemental mercury in the general population, constituting a potentially significant source of exposure to elemental mercury. Estimates of daily intake from amalgam restorations range from 1 to 12.5 μg/day, with the majority of dental amalgam holders being exposed to less than 5 μg mercury/day.&lt;ref name="WHOCICAD" /&gt; They also note that this will continue to decline as the number of amalgam restorations is declining.

== Health research ==

As public pressure demands more research on amalgam safety, an increasing number of studies with larger sample sizes are being conducted. Those who are not opposed to amalgam claim that, aside from rare and localized tissue irritation, recent evidence-based research has continued to demonstrate no ill effects from the minute amounts of mercury exposure from amalgam fillings.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Consumer Update: Dental Amalgams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-38"/&gt; A 2004 [[systematic review]] conducted by the [[Life Sciences Research Office]], whose clients include the FDA and NIH, concluded that, "the current data are insufficient to support an association between mercury release from dental amalgam and the various complaints that have been attributed to this restoration material."&lt;ref name="LSRO2004"/&gt; A systematic review in 2009 demonstrated that mercury released from amalgam restorations does not give rise to toxic effects on the nervous system of children.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-35"/&gt; More recently, a Cochrane Systematic review in 2014 found, "insufficient evidence to support or refute any adverse effects associated with amalgam or composite restorations."&lt;ref name="AutoTB-36"/&gt;

Those opposed to dental amalgam suggest that mercury from dental amalgam may lead to [[nephrotoxicity]], neurobehavioural changes, [[autoimmunity]], oxidative stress, [[autism]], skin and mucosa alterations, non-specific symptoms and complaints, [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="Mutter2005"/&gt;

=== Autoimmune disorders ===

Both those opposed and those not opposed to dental amalgam recognize that amalgam has been found to be a rare contributor to localized and temporary tissue irritation known as [[lichen planus|oral lichenoid lesions]].&lt;ref name="AutoTB-83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Consumer Update: Dental Amalgams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-39"/&gt; These mild, lichenoid reactions have also been reported in composite resin fillings.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-40"/&gt; Those opposed to amalgam believe that amalgam fillings are also associated with increased risk of other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, thyroiditis, and eczema.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-41"/&gt;

''Consumer Reports'' considered these alleged associations between amalgam and chronic disease made by some health practitioners as "prospecting for diseases".&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org"/&gt;  The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA) similarly has stated, "There is no scientific evidence to connect the development or worsening of MS with dental fillings containing mercury, and therefore no reason to have those fillings removed. Although poisoning with heavy metals-such as mercury, lead, or manganese can damage the nervous system and produce symptoms such as tremor and weakness, the damage is inflicted in a different way than occurs in MS and the process is also different."&lt;ref name="nationalmssociety.org" /&gt; The [[Lupus Foundation of America]] also states on their website, "At the present time, we do not have any scientific data that indicates that dental fillings may act as a trigger of lupus. In fact, it is highly unlikely that dental fillings aggravate or cause SLE."&lt;ref name="lupus.org" /&gt;

=== Dental staff impact ===

In 2006, a literature review was undertaken to evaluate the research on amalgam and its potential health effects on dentists and dental staff.&lt;ref name="Dental Personnel 2006"/&gt; It was reported that there is currently no conclusive epidemiological evidence regarding risks for adverse reproductive outcomes associated with mercury and dental professionals. It is mentioned that evidence to date fails to account for all confounding variables (such as alcohol consumption) and recommends more comprehensive and rigorous studies to adequately assess the hazards faced by dental personnel.&lt;ref name="Dental Personnel 2006" /&gt;

=== Removal of amalgam ===

The [[American College of Medical Toxicology]] and the [[American Academy of Clinical Toxicology]] say that research confirms that mercury from amalgams does not cause illness because the amount of mercury that they release is not enough to cause a health problem.&lt;ref name="toxicfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American College of Medical Toxicology |author1-link = American College of Medical Toxicology |author2 = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |author2-link = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-medical-toxicology-and-the-american-academy-of-clinical-toxicology/ |accessdate = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to some people wanting their existing amalgam removed for fear of mercury poisoning, these societies advise that the removal of fillings is likely to cause a greater exposure to mercury than leaving the fillings in place.&lt;ref name="toxicfive" /&gt; These societies warn that removal of amalgam fillings, in addition to being [[unnecessary health care]] and likely to cause more mercury exposure than leaving them in place, is also expensive.&lt;ref name="toxicfive" /&gt;

Far more mercury is released when amalgam fillings are removed than over their entire lifetime if left undisturbed. This led to some dentists who advocate removal of amalgam fillings (who may describe themselves as "[[holistic dentistry|holistic dentists]]") to develop special techniques to counter this, such as wearing breathing apparatus, using high-volume aspiration, and performing the procedure as quickly as possible. The impact of such techniques on the dose of mercury received during filling removal is unknown, and the techniques have been criticized as merely advertising gimmicks which enable such dentists to charge far more than a normal dentist would for the same procedure. Sources of mercury from the diet, and the potential harm of the composite resins (which mimic female sex hormones) {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} to replace the purportedly harmful amalgam fillings, are also ignored by these dentists.

''Consumer Reports'' has warned its readers on several occasions that, "if a dentist wants to remove your fillings because they contain mercury, watch your wallet."&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-45"/&gt;

=== Alternative materials ===

Alternative materials which may be suitable in some situations include composite resins, glass ionomer cements, porcelain and gold alloys.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-46"/&gt;
Most of these materials, with the notable exception of gold, have not been used as long as amalgam, and some are known to contain other potentially hazardous compounds. Teaching of amalgam techniques to dental students is declining in some schools in favor of composite resin,&lt;ref name="AutoTB-47"/&gt; and at least one school, University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, eliminated dental amalgam from the curriculum entirely in 2001.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-48"/&gt; This is largely a response to consumer pressure for white fillings for cosmetic reasons, and also because of the increasing longevity of modern resin composites. These alternative dental restorative materials are not free of potential health risks, such as allergenicity, inhalation of resin dust, cytotoxicity, and retinal damage from blue curing light.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-49"/&gt;

=== Chelation therapy ===

Anti-amalgam sources typically promote removal of amalgam fillings and substitution with other materials. [[Detoxification]] may also be advised, including fasting, restricted dieting to avoid mercury containing foods, and quasi-[[Chelation therapy|chelation therapies]], allegedly to remove accumulated mercury from the body.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-89"/&gt; The [[American College of Medical Toxicology]] and the [[American Academy of Clinical Toxicology]] recommend against chelation therapy and say that chelation therapy can artificially and temporarily elevate the levels of heavy metals in the urine (a practice referred to as "provoked" urine testing).&lt;ref name="toxicfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American College of Medical Toxicology |author1-link = American College of Medical Toxicology |author2 = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |author2-link = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-medical-toxicology-and-the-american-academy-of-clinical-toxicology/ |accessdate = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also mention that the chelating drugs may have significant side effects, including dehydration, hypocalcemia, kidney injury, liver enzyme elevations, hypotension, allergic reactions, and mineral deficiencies.&lt;ref name="toxicfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American College of Medical Toxicology |author1-link = American College of Medical Toxicology |author2 = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |author2-link = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-medical-toxicology-and-the-american-academy-of-clinical-toxicology/ |accessdate = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epidemiology ===

Better dental health overall coupled with increased demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite fillings (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, have resulted in a steady decline in dental amalgam use&lt;ref name="AutoTB-50"/&gt; in developed countries, though overall amalgam use continues to rise worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be used for many years to come.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-51"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-52"/&gt; Over a lifetime, dietary sources of mercury are far higher than would ever be received from the presence of amalgam fillings in the mouth. For example, due to pollution of the world's oceans with heavy metals, products such as [[cod liver oil]] may contain significant levels of mercury.

=== Prenatal ===

There is little evidence to suggest that amalgam fillings have any negative direct effects on pregnancy outcomes or on an infant post-pregnancy. A study, consisting of 72 pregnant women, was conducted to determine the effects of dental amalgam on babies in utero. Results indicated that although the amount of amalgam the mother had was directly related to the amount of mercury in the amniotic fluid, no negative effects on the fetus were found. A larger study, consisting of 5,585 women who had recently given birth, was used to determine if amalgam restorations during pregnancy had any effects on infant birthweight. Among the study group, 1,117 women had infants with low birth weights and 4,468 women had infants with normal birth weights. Approximately five percent of the women had one or more amalgam filling restorations during their pregnancy term. These women had little to no difference in infant birth weight compared to the women whom did not undergo amalgam restoration during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-2" /&gt;

=== Public awareness ===

A 2006 [[Zogby International]] poll of 2,590 US adults found that 72% of respondents were not aware that mercury was a main component of dental amalgam and 92% of respondents would prefer to be told about mercury in dental amalgam before receiving it as a filling.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-53"/&gt; A 1993 study published in FDA Consumer found that 50% of Americans believed fillings containing mercury caused health problems.&lt;ref name="bradbard1993"/&gt; Some dentists (including a member of the FDA's Dental Products Panel) suggest that there is an obligation to [[informed consent|inform]] patients that amalgam contains mercury.&lt;ref name="Chirba-Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-54"/&gt;

A prominent debate occurred in the late 20th century, with consumer and regulatory pressure to eliminate amalgam, "at an all-time high".&lt;ref name="dentaleconomics"/&gt; In a 2006 nationwide poll, 76% of Americans were unaware that mercury is the primary component in amalgam fillings,&lt;ref name="zogbypoll"/&gt; and this lack of [[informed consent]] was the most consistent issue raised in a recent [[United States|U.S.]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) panel on the issue by panel members.&lt;ref name="dentaleconomics" /&gt;

The broad lack of knowledge that existed among the public was also displayed when a December 1990 episode of the CBS news program "60 Minutes" covered mercury in amalgam. This resulted in a nationwide amalgam scare and additional research into mercury release from amalgam. The following month ''Consumer Reports'' published an article criticizing the content of the broadcast, stating that it contained a great deal of false information and that the ADA spokesperson on the program was ill-prepared to defend the claims.&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org"/&gt; For example, 60 Minutes reported that Germany was planning to pass legislation within the year to ban amalgam, but the institute of German Dentists said one month later that there was no such law pending. Also, one physiologist interviewed by ''Consumer Reports'' noted that the testimonials are mostly anecdotal, and both the reported symptoms and the rapid recovery time after the fillings are removed are physiologically inconsistent with that of mercury poisoning. ''Consumer Reports'' goes on to criticize how 60 Minutes failed to interview the many patients who had fillings or teeth removed only to have the symptoms stay the same or get worse.&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org" /&gt;

In 1991, the United States Food and Drug Administration concluded that, "none of the data presented show a direct hazard to humans from dental amalgams."&lt;ref name="AutoTB-55"/&gt;  In 2002, a class action lawsuit was initiated by patients who felt their amalgam fillings caused them harm. The lawsuit named the ADA, the New York Dental Association, and the Fifth District Dental Society for deceiving, "[the] public about health risks allegedly associated with dental amalgam." On February 18, 2003, the New York Supreme Court dismissed the two amalgam-related lawsuits against organized dentistry, stating the plaintiffs had, "failed to show a 'cognizable cause of action'."&lt;ref name="AutoTB-56"/&gt;

=== Research directions ===

The proper interpretation of the data is considered controversial only by those opposed to amalgam. The vast majority of past studies have concluded that amalgams are safe. However, although the vast majority of patients with amalgam fillings are exposed to levels too low to pose a risk to health, many patients (i.e. those in the upper 99.9 percentile) exhibit urine test results which are comparable to the maximum allowable legal limits for long-term work place (occupational) safety.&lt;ref name="osha.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oem.bmj.com" /&gt; Two recent randomized [[clinical trials]] in children&lt;ref name="ReferenceA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16622140 |year=2006 |last1=Derouen |first1=TA |last2=Martin |first2=MD |last3=Leroux |first3=BG |last4=Townes |first4=BD |last5=Woods |first5=JS |last6=Leitão |first6=J |last7=Castro-caldas |first7=A |last8=Luis |first8=H |last9=Bernardo |first9=M |last10=Rosenbaum |first10=Gail |last11=Martins |first11=Isabel P. |title=Neurobehavioral effects of dental amalgam in children: a randomized clinical trial |volume=295 |issue=15 |pages=1784–92 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.15.1784 |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed over a five-year period in children whose [[dental caries|caries]] were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In contrast, one study showed a trend of higher dental treatment need later in children with composite dental fillings, and thus claimed that amalgam fillings are more durable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; However, the other study (published in JAMA) cites increased mercury blood levels in children with amalgam fillings. The study states, "during follow-up [blood mercury levels were] 1.0 to 1.5 μg higher in the amalgam group than in the composite group." [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] considers high blood mercury levels to be harmful to the fetus and also states that, "exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages." Currently, EPA has set the "safe" mercury exposure level to be at 5.8 μg of mercury per one liter of blood.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-57"/&gt; While mercury fillings themselves do not increase mercury levels above "safe" levels, they have been shown to contribute to such increase. However, such studies were unable to find any negative neurobehavioral effects.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-60"/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[File:Amalgam separator.jpg|thumb|Amalgam separator]]
Environmental concerns over [[externality|external cost]]s exist as well.&lt;ref name="USregulation"/&gt; In the United States, dental amalgam is the largest source of mercury received by [[sewage treatment]] plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant [[Sewage sludge|sludge]], which is typically disposed of by [[Sewage sludge#Land application|land application]], [[landfill]]ing or [[Sewage sludge#Incineration|incineration]].&lt;ref name="EPA effluent guidelines"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/dental-effluent-guidelines |title=Dental Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-07-07 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several states, including [[New Jersey]],&lt;ref name="AutoTB-61"/&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref name="AutoTB-62"/&gt; and [[Michigan]],&lt;ref name="AutoTB-63"/&gt; have required the installation of dental amalgam separators prior to 2017.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-64"/&gt; EPA promulgated an [[effluent guidelines]] regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices nationwide are now required to use amalgam separators.&lt;ref name="EPA effluent guidelines"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2017-06-14).

The WHO reported in 2005 that in the United Kingdom mercury from amalgam accounted for 5% of total mercury emissions.&lt;ref name="WHOwaste" /&gt; In Canada, dental amalgam was estimated to contribute one-third of the mercury in sewer system waste, but it is believed amalgam separators in dental offices may dramatically decrease this burden on the public sewer system.&lt;ref name="WHOwaste"/&gt;

The 2005 WHO report stated that mercury from amalgam was approximately 1% of total global mercury emissions, and that one-third of the total mercury in most sewage systems was discharged from dental offices.&lt;ref name="WHOwaste"/&gt; Other studies have shown this to be a gross exaggeration or not reflective of developed countries. With respect to pollution in the United States, a study done in 1992 showed that batteries "accounted for 86 percent of discarded mercury and dental amalgam a mere 0.56 percent".&lt;ref name="AutoTB-65"/&gt; Mercury is an environmental contaminant and the WHO, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], and [[NIOSH]] have established specific occupational exposure limits. Mercury imposes health risks upon the surrounding population. In economics, this pollution is considered an [[external cost]] not factored into the private costs of using mercury-based products. Environmental risks from amalgam can be mitigated by amalgam separators and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] has issued standards regarding the proper handling and disposal of amalgam waste.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-66"/&gt; It should be noted, however, that mercury is a naturally occurring element that is present throughout the environment&lt;ref name="AutoTB-67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"/&gt; and the vast majority of the pollution (about 99%) comes from large-scale human industrial activity (such as coal-fired electricity generation, hydroelectric dams, and mining, which increase both airborne and waterborne mercury levels).&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-68"/&gt; Eventually, the airborne mercury finds its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it is consumed by aquatic life.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com" /&gt; Amalgam separators may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system, but they are not mandatory in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt; When mercury from these sources enters bodies of water, especially acidic bodies of water, it can be converted into the more toxic methylmercury.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-69"/&gt;

[[Cremation]] of bodies containing amalgam restorations results in near-complete emission of the mercury into the atmosphere, as the temperature in cremation is far greater than the boiling point of mercury. In countries with high cremation rates (such as the UK), mercury has become a great concern. Proposals to remedy the situation have ranged from removing amalgam-containing teeth prior to cremation to installing [[activated carbon]] adsorption or other post-combustion mercury capture technology in the flue gas stream. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, it is estimated that globally about 3.6 [[tonnes]] of mercury vapor was emitted into the air through cremation in 2010, or about 1% of total global emissions.&lt;ref name="unep.org" /&gt; Mercury emissions from cremation are growing in the US, both because cremation rates are increasing and because the number of teeth in the deceased are increasing due to better dental care.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Since amalgam restorations are very durable and relatively inexpensive, many of the older deceased have amalgam restorations.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} According to work done in Great Britain,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} mercury emissions from cremation are expected to increase until at least 2020.

== Organizational statements ==

=== American Dental Association (ADA) ===
The [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) has asserted that dental amalgam is safe and has held that, "the removal of amalgam restorations from the non-allergic patient for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the body, when such treatment is performed solely at the recommendation or suggestion of the dentist, is improper and unethical".&lt;ref name="AutoTB-70"/&gt; Under the comments of the American Dental Association before the FDA's Dental Products Panel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/DentalProductsPanel/ |title=Dental Products Panel |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/ |title=Medical Devices Advisory Committee |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ADA supports the 2009 FDA ruling on dental amalgam.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="name" /&gt; ADA states that "dental amalgam has an established record of safety and effectiveness, which the scientific community has extensively reviewed and affirmed."&lt;ref name="ADA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-73"/&gt; The ADA also supports the 2017 EPA wastewater regulation and is providing information and assistance to its members in implementation of amalgam separators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/amalgam-separators |title=Amalgam Separators and Waste Best Management |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-16 |publisher=American Dental Association |location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADA asserts the best scientific evidence supports the safety of dental amalgam.&lt;ref name="ADA statement"/&gt; Clinical studies have not established an occasional connection between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in the general population.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-74"/&gt;

=== Dental Material Commission ===
In 2002, Dr. Maths Berlin of The Dental Material Commission published an overview and assessment of the scientific literature published between November 1997 – 2002 for the Swedish Government on amalgam and its possible environmental and health risks.&lt;ref name="berlinreport"/&gt; A final report was submitted to the Swedish Government in 2003 and included his report as an annex to the full report. In the final report from 2003, Berlin states that the 1997 summary had found that "... no known epidemiological population study has demonstrated any adverse health effects in amalgam". 
He reports that researchers have been able to show effects of mercury at lower concentrations than before and states that "...the safety margin that it was thought existed with respect to mercury exposure from amalgam has been erased." He recommends eliminating amalgam in dentistry for medical and environmental reasons as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="berlinreport" /&gt;

=== Food and Drug Administration ===
After FDA's deliberations and review of hundreds of scientific studies relating to the safety of dental amalgam, the FDA concluded that "clinical studies have not established a causal link between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in adults and children age six and older."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The FDA concluded that individuals age six and older are not at risk of mercury-associated health effects from mercury vapor exposure that come from dental amalgam.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

In 2009, the FDA issued a final rule which classified dental amalgam as a "Class II" (moderate risk) device, placing it in the same category as composite resins and gold fillings.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-83"/&gt; In a press release announcing the reclassification, the agency again stated that "the levels [of mercury] released by dental amalgam fillings are not high enough to cause harm in patients."&lt;ref name="AutoTB-76"/&gt;

Also, in the FDA final regulation on dental amalgam in 2009, the FDA recommended the product labeling of dental amalgam. The suggested labeling included: a warning against the use of dental amalgam in patients with mercury allergy, a warning that dental professionals use appropriate ventilation when handling dental amalgam, and a statement discussion of scientific evidence on dental amalgam's risks and benefits in order to make informed decisions amongst patient and professional dentists.&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-77"/&gt;

== Regulation ==

The use of mercury in dental fillings is considered safe and effective in all countries practicing modern dentistry (see below). There are currently two countries, Norway and Sweden, that have introduced [[legislation]] to prohibit or restrict use of amalgam fillings; however, in both cases amalgam is part of a larger program of reducing mercury in the environment and includes the banning of mercury-based batteries, thermometers, light bulbs, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc. In many countries, unused dental amalgam after a treatment is subject to disposal protocols for environmental reasons. Over 100 countries are signatories to the United Nations "[[Minamata Convention on Mercury]]".&lt;ref name="Minamata"/&gt; Unlike mercury-based batteries, cosmetics, and medical devices (which will be banned by the year 2020), the treaty has not banned the use of dental amalgam, but allows phasing down amalgam use over a time period appropriate to domestic needs, an approach advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO).&lt;ref name="AutoTB-78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-79"/&gt;

=== International groups ===

[[FDI World Dental Federation]] recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. FDI is a federation of approximately 200 national dental associations and dental specialist groups representing over 1.5 million dentists. In collaboration with the WHO, they have produced an FDI position statement and WHO consensus statement on dental amalgam.&lt;ref name="fdiworldental.org" /&gt; Their position regarding the safety of dental amalgam is that, aside from rare allergic reactions and local side effects, "the small amount of mercury released from amalgam restorations, especially during placement and removal, has not been shown to cause any other adverse health effects." The paper goes on to say that there have been "no controlled studies published that show adverse systemic effects" from amalgam restorations and there is no evidence that removing amalgam restorations relieves any general symptoms. More recently, FDI has published a resolution confirming that their position on the safety and effectiveness of amalgam has not changed despite the phasing-down in some countries&lt;ref name="AutoTB-80"/&gt;

=== North America ===

In the United States, numerous respected professional and non-profit organizations consider amalgam use to be safe and effective and have publicly declared such.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-81"/&gt; In addition to the [[American Dental Association]],&lt;ref name="AutoTB-83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-82"/&gt; other American organizations, including the [[Mayo clinic]],&lt;ref name="newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org" /&gt; the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA),&lt;ref name="fda.gov" /&gt; [[Alzheimer's Association]],&lt;ref name="alz.org" /&gt; American Academy of Pediatrics,&lt;ref name="aappolicy.aappublications.org" /&gt; [[Autism Society of America]],&lt;ref name="autism-society.org" /&gt; [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]],&lt;ref name="epa.gov" /&gt; National Multiple Sclerosis Society,&lt;ref name="nationalmssociety.org" /&gt; New England Journal of Medicine,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; International Journal of Dentistry,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" /&gt; [[National Council Against Health Fraud]],&lt;ref name="ncahf.org" /&gt; The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR,&lt;ref name="nidcr.nih.gov" /&gt; [[American Cancer Society]],&lt;ref name="Alternative Cancer Therapies 2009, pp.164-166" /&gt; [[Lupus Foundation of America]],&lt;ref name="lupus.org" /&gt; ''Consumer Reports''&lt;ref name="consumerreports.org" /&gt; and [[WebMD]]&lt;ref name="webmd.com" /&gt; have all given formal, public statements declaring that amalgam fillings are safe based on the best scientific evidence.

On July 28, 2009, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) recategorized amalgam as a class II medical device, which critics claim indicates a change in their perception of safety. The ADA has indicated that this new regulation actually places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials, including composite and gold fillings.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-83"/&gt;

Despite the research regarding the safety of amalgam fillings, the state of California requires warning information given to patients for legal reasons (informed consent) as part of California's controversial and voter-driven [[Proposition 65]]. This warning also applied to resin fillings for a time, since they contain [[Bis-phenol A]] (BPA) a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity at high doses.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-84"/&gt;

In Canada, amalgam use is considered safe and effective. A 2005 position statement from the [[Canadian Dental Association]] (CDA) states that "current scientific evidence on the use of dental amalgam supports that amalgam is an effective and safe filling material that provides a long-lasting solution for a broad range of clinical situations. The CDA has established its position based on the current consensus of scientific and clinical experts and on recent extensive reviews of strong evidence by major North American and international organizations, which have satisfactorily countered any safety concerns."&lt;ref name="cda-adc.ca" /&gt; Amalgam use is regulated by [[Health Canada]] as are all medical treatments&lt;ref name="AutoTB-88"/&gt; and Health Canada has also stated that dental amalgam is not causing illness in the general population.&lt;ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca" /&gt; Not all organizations in Canada share this view. In a recent publication, the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors states that "... mercury is the most toxic non-radioactive material on earth, and since it is constantly being released from amalgam, its use should be abandoned.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-89"/&gt; They recommend a gradual detox and chelation therapy over several months to minimize the toxic effects of amalgam fillings.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-89"/&gt;

=== Australia ===
Australia recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. In 2012, the [[Australian Dental Association]] published a position paper on the safety of dental amalgam.&lt;ref name="ada.org.au" /&gt; Their position is that "Dental Amalgam has been used as a dental restorative material for more than 150 years. It has proved to be a durable, safe and effective material which has been the subject of extensive research over this time" and that "amalgam should continue to be available as a dental restorative material".&lt;ref name="AutoTB-90"/&gt;

=== Europe ===

[[Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks]] (SCENIHR) is a scientific committee within the European Commission. In a 2008 document of 74 pages, its research on the subject of amalgam safety concluded that "there is no scientific evidence for risks of adverse systemic effects exist [''sic''] and the current use of dental amalgam does not pose a risk of systemic disease."&lt;ref name="AutoTB-91"/&gt;

England and Scotland recognize the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. A policy statement from the [[British Dental Health Foundation]] states that they do not consider amalgams containing mercury a significant health risk.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-92"/&gt;

Ireland recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. The Irish Dental Association has published on their website: "Dental amalgam has been used on patients for over 150 years. All available world-wide research indicates that amalgam is not harmful to health.... No Government or reputable scientific, medical or dental body anywhere in the world accepts, on any published evidence, that dental amalgam is a hazard to health."&lt;ref name="dentist.ie" /&gt; The Irish Dental Association provides additional detail in a published patient information letter.&lt;ref name="irishhealth.com" /&gt;

France has publicly recognized the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. A position paper on the Association Dentaire Française website states that amalgam restorations have proven to have no biological or toxic effect.&lt;ref name="adf.asso.fr" /&gt; They also mention that no serious pathological fact has ever been observed and no general toxic action has been scientifically proven to date.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-94"/&gt; The most exposed subjects remain dentists in whom it did not identify occupational diseases related to mercury and other rare that any allergies. These amalgam allergies are about 40 times less than that of resin fillings&lt;ref name="AutoTB-94"/&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s in Norway, there was considerable and intense public debate on the use of dental amalgam.&lt;ref name="miljodirektoratet.no"/&gt; The Norwegian Dental Patients Association (Forbundet Tenner og Helse), made up of people who believe they suffered health effects from amalgam fillings, was a driving force in this debate.&lt;ref name="miljodirektoratet.no" /&gt; During this time, the media often featured interviews with people claiming that their health problems were caused by amalgam fillings, and who have regained their health after replacing their amalgam fillings with a different material. Some scientific studies also reported that patients have been restored to health after having had their amalgam fillings replaced. However, these studies were heavily disputed at the time and the Norwegian Board of Health still maintain there is no scientifically proven connection between dental amalgam and health problems.&lt;ref name="miljodirektoratet.no"/&gt;

In 1991, organized through the ministry of the environment, Norway began phasing out the use of most mercury-containing products (not limited to amalgam fillings but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc.).&lt;ref name="AutoTB-96"/&gt; The ban on the import, export, and use of most mercury-based products began on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-96"/&gt; The Norwegian officials stressed that this is not a decision based on using an unsafe health product, but rather that the "overall, long term goal is to eliminate the use and release of mercury to the environment".&lt;ref name="miljodirektoratet.no"/&gt; Despite the mercury ban, dental offices in Norway may apply for exemptions to use amalgam on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="miljodirektoratet.no"/&gt;

Similar to Norway, from 1995 to 2009 the Environment Ministry of the Government of Sweden gradually banned the import and use of all mercury-based products (not limited to amalgam fillings alone, but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, lightbulbs, analytical chemicals, cosmetics, etc.).&lt;ref name="AutoTB-100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoTB-101"/&gt; These mercury-based products were phased out for environmental reasons and precautionary health reasons.&lt;ref name="AutoTB-102"/&gt; Like Norway, there was considerable public pressure in the years leading up to the ban.&lt;ref name="miljodirektoratet.no" /&gt; Since the ban, the Government of Sweden continued to investigate ways of reducing mercury pollution.&lt;ref name="government.se"/&gt;  The Swedish Chemicals Agency state that they may grant exemptions on the use of amalgam on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="government.se" /&gt;

Following the Minimata Convention on Mercury, from July 2018 onwards, the EU Mercury Regulation prohibits the use of dental amalgam in children under 15 years old and pregnant or breastfeeding woman. Additional requirements include the use of pre-encapsulated mercury and ethical disposal of waste amalgam.&lt;ref name=Press_release_1344/&gt; The [[British Dental Association]] (BDA) has worked with the Council of European Dentists (CED) to prevent an immediate ban of amalgam until further research into practicalities has been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bda.org/amalgam|title=Dental amalgam|website=bda.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] will report to [[European Parliament]] by June 2020, and to the [[European Council]] by 2030 regarding the viability of ending dental amalgam use by 2030.&lt;ref name=Press_release_1344&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-1344_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Questions and answers: EU mercury policy and the ratification of the Minamata Convention|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mubarak Khan Lashari ''' or more popular as '''Darya Khan Lashari ''' ({{lang-sd|     دريا خان لاشاری }}), was a famous general of [[Samma Dynasty]] of [[Sindh]], a powerful statesman and regent at the court of Samma ruler [[Jam Feroz]] whose deeds of valour are sung all over [[Sindh]] to this day.&lt;br&gt; Darya Khan was adopted son of [[Jam Nizamuddin II]] who defeated the Argun army in the Battle of Jalwakhir near Bibi Nani in the [[Bolan Pass]].This victory made Darya Khan Lashari, the 'Dollah' (Hero) of Sindh.On his deathbed, Jam Nizamuddin,entrusted to Darya Khan the care of his kingdom,of his treasures,his family, and his son [[Jam Feroz]].&lt;br&gt;Darya Khan Lashari was killed while fighting bravely in the [[Battle of Fatehpur (1519)|Battle of Fatehpur]] when an arrow hit him in throat on 21 December 1521 A.D. and thus ended the  reign of Jam Feroz as an independent ruler.

==Early life==
Darya Khan Lasharie was adopted as son by Jam Nizamuddin. His real 
name was Qaboolo (or Qabool Muhammad ) He belongs to Baloch Tribe Lashari.  He rose to become Madarul-Muham (Prime Minister) and was titled as Mubarak Khan Lashari.

==Military Service==
In the days of Mongol, Sultan Hussain Mirza Baiqra, of Khurasan, on complaints of the merchants of Central Asia (Herat and Qandhar), that they were looted by Sir.dhis, the Sultan sent armed 
expedition to Sind border, which after initial raids returned to their country. A declaration of victory was issued in Herat in 892 A.H. (1487 A.D.). It states that the infidels (Sindhis) having come to know of Mongol movements,collected a large army and wanted to make a surprise attack but the Islamic forces (Mongols) came to know of it and made offensive attacks, killing many of these Hindus (forces of Jam Nizamuddin). As a result of this success declaration of victory was issued.

This may have been an attack on Sindh border without any results. Amir Zul Noon Arghoon, then was Herat's Naib at Qandhar. He seems to have despatched his son Shah Beg on this expedition.The latter captured the Sibi Fort from Jam Nizamuddin's agent Bahadur Khan and installed his brother Sultan Mohammad, who later on was defeated ard killed by Mubarak Khan Lashari (Darya Khan Lashari Dullah) near Jalwagir in Bolan Pass, close to Bibi Nani.

After this incident the Mongols did not turn up in Sindh during the life of Jam Nizamuddin. At that time, the Mongol troops had advanced as far as Chanduka, Sardecha and Kot Machhi, but after being expelled by Darya Khan Lashari, they never turned back ' during Jam Nizamuddin's lifetime.

Death of Jam Nizamuddin Samma after 48 years rule of Sind and was succeeded by his son Nasiruddin Abul Fatah Feroz Shah-II. At that time Jam Feroz had neglected the affairs of the state, refused the advice of Darya Khan Lashari, who had to retire to his Jagir in the village Ghaha (Kahan near Sehwan and these failures brought his defeat at the hands of Salahuduin who 
thus became the ruler of Sind. Feroz Shah along with his mother Madina Machhani went over to Ghaha to Darya Khan Lashari, who at the request of Madina agreed to help, collected troops from Sehwan, but got the first set-back at the hands of Haji, the Minister of Jam Salahuddin. As luck would have it the Minister's letter about the success of the initial battle addressed to Jam Salahuddin fell in the hands of Darya Khan Lashari, who had it replaced, conveying Salahuddin that the Minister's forces had been defeated and it was advisable for him to abandon Thatta. This was quickly done. Darya Khan Lashari then moved Feroz Shah to Thatta and installed him on 1st Shawwal, 918 A.H. (1512 A D. 12 October). Salahuddin then returned to Gujarat. He had remained in possession of Thatta for about eight months and must have collected a large sum of money from Thatta and organized another battle.

==Last days of Darya Khan Lashari ==
There are different versions about the last days of his life.

Tahiri states:&lt;br&gt; 
{{cquote|that the courtiers being jealous of his power and position persuaded Feroz Shah to crush him, but the latter finding himself incapable avoided any direct conflict; so they approached Feroz 's mother Madina Machhani advising her to invite the Mongols and Arghuns to free Sindh from the power of Darya Khan. According to this plan Madina invited Shah Beg from [[Qandahar]]. Shah Beg took Baghban-Sehwan route and encountered Darya Khan Lasharie  near 'Khan Wan' canal which he had himself built to irrigate the lands of village Sankorah (Sakro) and other areas (of Thatta and Sakro Talukas). Darya Khan Lasharie was killed while fighting bravely, when an arrow hit him in the throat. Feroz Shah kept aloof.&lt;ref&gt;Channa Mahboob Ali, Mehran, Vol.41, No. 4, 1964, pp. 131-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filipino Cubans''' are [[Cuba]]ns of [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ancestry. Filipinos have been settling in Cuba since the 16th century and they are one of the earliest Asian communities in the country.

==History of migration==
Filipinos and other Asian workers reached Cuba by sailing in the [[Manila-Acapulco galleons]] that crossed the Pacific Ocean regularly from the late 16th century until 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filipino-heritage-matters.tripod.com/id34.html : Filipinos &amp; Cuba - Filipino Heritage Matters]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manila]] was the jump-off point for all Spanish trade coming from [[East Asia]], while [[Havana]] was the take-off point for Spanish trading ships sailing from [[Latin America]] to [[Spain]]. Most of the Asians who landed in Cuba went on to work in "Nueva Filipinas" (New Philippines) which is now [[Pinar del Río]].

Most Filipinos who were brought by the Spaniards to Cuba worked in the tobacco plantations while there were others who were altar boys, catechism leaders, and church workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myworldofbaseball.com/wordpress/2010/02/27/cuban-update-las-tunas-and-pinar-del-rio/ : myworldofbaseball - Cuban Update - Las Tunas and Pinar del Rio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/2011/01/01/28747/national_liberation_day_of_cuba_on_january_1_2011.html : Cuba Headlines - National Liberation Day of Cuba on January 1, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Pinar del Río is famous for their cigars, which were brought over from the [[Philippines]] by the Spanish because it was much closer to Europe and easier to oversee. Afterwards, some Filipinos moved to Havana's big Barrio Chino or [[Chinatown]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pinar del Río|: Pinar del Río]]&lt;/ref&gt; Others jumped ship to [[Louisiana]]. Others also sailed back to Sinaloa and Jalisco in Mexico. Those with money went to [[Spain]] or back to Manila (and brought with them the "Escabeche a la Cubana" which is a favorite dish to all Filipinos which they almost always serve using fish). The rest intermarried with the Cuban population.

Over time, the Filipinos who stayed quickly lost their ties to the Philippines since many among the Filipinos were like the local Cubans. They can speak Spanish, they were Catholic, they have to pay taxes or tributos, and they were treated like slaves by their Spanish masters. Nonetheless, their children survive to this day. Filipino Cubans were generally called “Chinos Manila," as Manila was very famous among the Cuban population at that time.

==Notable people==
Important Filipino Cubans include the Azcarraga Fessner family, whose patriarch was [[Marcelo de Azcarraga y Palmero]], the first Prime Minister of Spain to be of Filipino descent, whose mother was a Filipina from the Lizarrabal and Palmero families.

"'''First Friday'''" is a name for various public events in some cities (particularly in the [[United States]]) that occur on the first [[Friday]] of every month.

These citywide events may take on many purposes, including art gallery openings, and social and political networking. American cities have promoted such events to bring people to historic areas perceived as dangerous, using the "[[safety in numbers]]" mentality to combat [[urban decay]].  In some cities this monthly event may occur on the first Saturday of each month instead of Friday or on "Third Thursdays".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=http://www.ait-themes.com|first1=AitThemes.com,|title=TAG :: Tacoma Art Group - 3rd Thursday Tacoma Art Mingle {{!}} 3rd Thursday Tacoma Art Mingle|url=http://www.tacomaartgroup.org/|website=www.tacomaartgroup.org|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://downtownjoplin.com/|website=Downtown Joplin Alliance|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third Thursday|url=http://downtownjoplin.com/thirdthursday/|website=Downtown Joplin Alliance|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Systems|first1=eZ|title=3rd Thursday Loop / Events / Home - Toledo|url=http://www.dotoledo.org/Events/3rd-Thursday-Loop3|website=www.dotoledo.org|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, these are "see and be seen" events that serve as a [[block party]] or social gathering open to the general public. Some of these events may be centered on political networking by Republicans and Democrats, but usually First Fridays are art and entertainment destinations. They may involve [[pub crawl]]ing, other retail establishments such as cafes and restaurants, and performances by [[fire twirling]] acts, [[Jazz music|jazz musicians]], [[belly dancing]], street musicians, or others.

"First Fridays" is also a nationally recognized networking event targeting African American professionals held on the first Friday of every month in various cities throughout North America. These events started in 1987 and provide urban professionals an opportunity to socially network, exchange and share ideas on professional, educational, political and social issues.

==Art gallery openings==
Some cities hold "gallery hops" and "art walks", in which a number of the town's [[art gallery|art galleries]], museums, or artists' studios, both commercial and [[non-profit]] [[501c3]] organizations, will open their doors on Friday evening. The idea is that galleries will attract people to the downtown and enrich the art community by pooling their openings together, sometimes, as in the case of [[art6]] and [[Artspace in Richmond, Virginia]] (when in [[Jackson Ward]] at 6 East Broad Street) into one monthly evening in a historically-located designated [[arts district]] .

Among the cities with art-oriented First Friday events are: [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Fridays {{!}} icaboston.org|url=https://www.icaboston.org/calendar/first-fridays|website=www.icaboston.org|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]],&lt;ref&gt;http://denverartwalk.squarespace.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First First Friday, 2016|url=http://www.westword.com/event/first-first-friday-2016-7461289|website=Westword|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2017's First Friday means new art|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/01/05/2017s-first-friday-means-new-art/96157550/|accessdate=6 January 2017|work=Knoxville News Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jay|title=Turn your 2017 New Year wishes into art at First Friday Las Vegas|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-tr-las-vegas-first-friday-20170102-story.html|website=latimes.com|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miami]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saati|first1=Briana|title=First Friday Art Walk Guide: All the Culture on Display at Downtown's Inaugural Event|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/first-friday-art-walk-guide-all-the-culture-on-display-at-downtowns-inaugural-event-6499202|website=Miami New Times|accessdate=6 January 2017|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]], [[Peoria (Illinois)]], [[Scranton]], [[Art Murmur|Oakland]], [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What To Do For First Friday In Philly This January|url=http://www.uwishunu.com/2017/01/celebrate-first-friday-philly-january-6/#sm.000nnbzwxvrrcxq114e2340gzulvn|website=Uwishunu - Philadelphia Blog About Things to Do, Events, Restaurants, Food, Nightlife and More|accessdate=6 January 2017|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Friday {{!}} Artspace|url=http://artspacenc.org/events/first-friday/|website=artspacenc.org|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Galleries on First Fridays in Richmond, VA|url=https://www.visitrichmondva.com/things-to-do/arts-culture/galleries-first-fridays/|website=www.visitrichmondva.com|accessdate=6 January 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], [[Tulsa]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York (PA)]], and [[Ypsilanti]].

One of the oldest First Friday's is located in Boston's [[SoWa|SoWa Arts District]] where more than 80 artists open their studios to the public every First Friday. The [[SoWa]] Arts District is located at Harrison Ave and Thayer Street in Boston's South End.  In 2015, [http://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-art-district/ USA Today's 10BEST] readers poll voted the [[SoWa]] as the second best arts district in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-art-district/|title=Best Art District Winners: 2015 10Best Readers' Choice Travel Awards|website=10Best|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social networking==
Some First Fridays promote arts and culture combined with social networking, like [http://www.typfirstfridays.com First Fridays] in [[Tucson, AZ]]. Other smaller-scale First Fridays serve as social gatherings for groups of friends or people new to an area and may involve no art.

They may also include the large First Friday events such as those in Phoenix, Arizona attracting up to 20,000 attendees to hundreds of spaces.

Various cities areas have First Fridays centered on politically conservative networking.  The pioneer of these events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zak|first=Dan|title=Off the clock and it's still party time on Capitol Hill with dueling happy hours|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/off-the-clock-and-its-still-party-time-on-capitol-hill-with-dueling-happy-hours/2011/06/03/AGkg4lJH_story.html|accessdate=May 31, 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=Jun 5, 2011|agency=Washington Post|location=[[Washington, DC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; began in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = It's First Friday |url = http://www.itsfirstfriday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but similar events have found success in Virginia, Nevada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = First Friday Nevada |url = http://www.firstfridaynevada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arizona.

In many cities, First Fridays events place an emphasis on [[African American]] [[social network|networking]] and business opportunities for [[African American]] professionals. First Friday is the top networking event for African American professionals and consistently attracts over 16,000 people each month across North America according to First Fridays United.

The First Fridays monthly events originated in 1987 as an outlet for African American professionals to mix, mingle and network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Dara|title=Public Discourse, Community Concerns, and Civic Engagement:  Exploring Black Social Networking Traditions on BlackPlanet.com|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=Dec 17, 2007|volume=13|issue=1|pages=319–320|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00398x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00398.x/pdf|accessdate=May 31, 2014|publisher=Wiley Online|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Adam|title=Why is First Fridays the best African American event in Nashville?|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/why-is-first-fridays-the-best-african-american-event-in-nashville/Content?oid=1188684|accessdate=May 31, 2014|newspaper=Nashville Scene|date=Jul 17, 2003|agency=Nashville Scene|location=[[Nashville, Tennessee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1980s it was common for an individual to be the only black professional working in their company.  First Fridays happy hours become a way for these professionals to meet in a social atmosphere while exchanging useful information.  The concept spread rapidly and First Fridays chapters now operate in 39 cities across North America and seven countries worldwide, including [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] [[London, England|London]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[New York City, New York|New York]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], Phoenix, [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[St Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Normandy, France|Normandy]], [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], [[Tokyo, Japan|Tokyo]], [[Toronto]], and Washington, D.C.

In 2002, several First Fridays operators created First Fridays United, which is a company founded to organize the existing First Fridays chapters in 30 cities into one group to share information, resources and solicit corporate sponsors and advertisers.  The organization sponsors a series of international events in addition to the monthly networking happy hours. Today, First Fridays reaches over 450,000 urban professionals through email, internet, and event marketing and has had numerous Fortune 1000 corporate clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = First Friday United: About Us |url = http://www.firstfridaysunited.com/aboutUs.php |accessdate = 27 February 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110203071224/http://firstfridaysunited.com/aboutUs.php |archivedate = Feb 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHAT IS FIRST FRIDAYS UNITED?|url=http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-first-fridays-united.html|website=www.experts123.com|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Freemasonry}}
[[File:Villa Blye, Masonic Temple, Masonic Lodge, Paola Malta.jpeg|thumb|Villa Blye, a masonic lodge in [[Paola, Malta|Paola]]]]

'''Freemasonry in Malta''' has a lengthy history dating from the eighteenth century. The main masonic influences (and external supervision) have been from the United Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland. Today Regular Freemasonry is under the jurisdiction of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta, formed in 2004. 

Another self-styled, irregular masonic body going by the name ‘Grand Lodge of Malta’ exists (whose members broke away from the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2009).

The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta is recognized internationally by a majority of the Regular masonic jurisdictions worldwide, whilst the Grand Lodge of Malta is recognized by only two jurisdictions worldwide, one of which is the Grand Orient de France, an irregular Grand Lodge that unlike Regular Freemasonry throughout the world, admits women as masons within its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/comment/blogs/58336/why_become_a_freemason#.V1oLTZBHmrV|title=Why become a freemason?|work=MaltaToday.com.mt|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The early years (1730–1800)==

===First lodge and early influences===
Freemasonry in [[Malta]] began in 1730 when "Parfait Harmonie", the first warranted lodge, was formed under the [[Marseilles]] ([[France]]) masonic jurisdiction. By 1741, freemasonry was established firmly in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;http://user.orbit.net.mt/fournier/a_freemasonry_trial_in_18th_cent.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Many knights of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]], and some of the Maltese nobility, were freemasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mha.org.au/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/33-malta-and-the-french-revolution&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Master [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]] was a freemason,&lt;ref&gt;Read the website of the [http://www.freewebs.com/masonicmalta/masonichistoryinmalta.htm Masonic Hall Company] of Malta.&lt;/ref&gt; and others (including Grand Master [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc|De Rohan]]) are reported also to have been freemasons, and influential in the spread of freemasonry in Malta.  The first Masonic lodges operated in Malta under French warrants generally obtained from Marseilles, but under the guidance of Count von Kollowrat, the  Scottish Lodge of St. John of Marseilles petitioned the Grand Lodge of the Moderns in England to obtain an English warrant on 30 June 1788. This lodge noted in its petition that the most important members of the Order of St. John ranked amongst its membership. The lodge obtained an English warrant as the Lodge of St. John of Secrecy and Harmony. This lodge ceased to function sometime before 1813.

===The French period===
After the 1798–1800 [[French occupation of Malta]], many French soldiers were incarcerated as prisoners of war. In 1811, they established a Masonic lodge named ''Les Amis en Captivite'' under a warrant from Marseilles. In that same year, the lodge was attacked by rioters, following exhortations from priests that the freemasons were responsible for the prevailing drought and disease stricken horses.

Following repatriation of the bulk of prisoners between April and August 1814, the lodge members were essentially non-French. On 6 October 1819, the lodge obtained a warrant from United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE). The lodge was permitted to work in Italian. In 1820, the British Governor on the island, [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], suspended the lodge by reason of infiltration by the ''[[carbonari]]'', an Italian secret society which purported to subvert Italian states. It nevertheless appears on the official list of UGLE up to 1824.

Although some evidence has been presented to suggest that [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was a Freemason, including a masonic apron said to have been his, and annotated with his name and masonic dates, now owned by Columbia Lodge No 2397 (London), there remains considerable uncertainty over the question. Several French sources cite similar accounts of his initiation into freemasonry in Malta in 1798 in a French Regimental Lodge, probably Army Philadelphe Lodge, but the earliest of these sources dates to some years after the events described, and there is no extant primary source, such as a Lodge minute book or attendance register. A number of masonic scholars have explored the available evidence, but none has felt able to form a definite opinion for or against the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Paper by J. E. S. Tuckett, presented at Quatuor Coronati Lodge, reproduced by the Grand Lodge of Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freemasonry during British rule (1800–1964)==
Malta came under effective British control in 1800, and was formally part of the British Empire from 1814 until 1964. During this time organised Freemasonry developed in Malta.

Early in 1815, a petition for the creation of the Lodge of St. John and St. Paul was submitted to the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] (UGLE). The lodge’s warrant was signed by the Grand Master, the Duke of Sussex, on 27 November 1815.&lt;ref name="FUMalta"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2011-04-24|url=http://www.freemasonry-universal.org/freemasonry/malta/freemasonry.html|title=Freemasonry Universal website}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lodge is the oldest English lodge that still meets on the island. From 1822 [[John Hookham Frere]] was a member of the Lodge, becoming its treasurer in 1823. He remained part of the organization until 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Cassar, Paul, [http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.09(1984-87)/MH.9(1984)1/orig03.pdf "Hookham Frere in Malta"], p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1890 there were five lodges under English (UGLE) jurisdiction, with a total of 409 masons. All of the English lodges in Malta were organised into a District Grand Lodge in 1849, and thereafter had a local [[Provincial Grand Master|District Grand Master]] and District officers. By 1900 the number of lodges had increased to seven, with a total of 584 members; by 1919 there were 1,484 freemasons in Malta under the UGLE constitution.

During the same period of British rule there were three other regular lodges consecrated in Malta, two by the Grand Lodge of Ireland, and one by the Grand Lodge of Scotland.

==British Freemasonry since independence (1964–present)==

===English Constitution===
On 21 September 1964, Malta gained independence. Following the withdrawal of British forces from the island, and the shutdown of the British naval base on 31 March 1979, a significant proportion of the active members returned to the [[United Kingdom]]. As a result, all but two of the English lodges were relocated to England; of the two lodges remaining in Malta, one was unable to survive and surrendered its warrant, leaving the Lodge of St. John and St. Paul No 349 (the oldest of the English lodges in Malta) still meeting on the island. In 1984, the English District Grand Lodge of Malta, having been relocated to England, was dissolved.&lt;ref name="FUMalta"/&gt; Following the dissolution, UGLE appointed a Grand Inspector, a senior officer of the Grand Lodge with responsibility for supervising English Freemasonry in Malta. A further two English lodges were subsequently consecrated, taking the total to three.

At the formation of the new Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2004, each local lodge had to decide to remain under its home jurisdiction or join the new Maltese constitution. One of the three UGLE lodges became a founding lodge of the new Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta, leaving two (Lodge of St John &amp; St Paul No 349, and De Rohan Installed Masters Lodge No 9670) still under English jurisdiction.

===Irish Constitution===
During the colonial period, there were two Lodges warranted in Malta by the [[Grand Lodge of Ireland]]: the Leinster Lodge No 387 founded in 1851, and the Abercorn Lodge No 273 founded in 1899. Later, following independence, the Grand Lodge of Ireland warranted two further lodges: the Fenici Lodge No 906 in 1991, and Hospitalliers Lodge No 931 in 2004.

On the formation of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2004, all of these Irish lodges became founding members of the new Grand Lodge. As a result there is no extant Irish Freemasonry in Malta today.

===Scottish Constitution===
There is just one lodge in Malta under the jurisdiction of the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]]. The Lodge of St. Andrew No 966 was founded in 1904, and has continued to operate since Maltese independence. It did not join in the formation of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2004, and still reports directly to the Grand Lodge of Scotland in Edinburgh.

==The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta (2004)==
On 5 September 2004, at a time of Maltese nationalist celebrations marking 40 years of Maltese independence, and 25 years since the closure of the British naval base, and in anticipation of the admission of Malta into the [[European Union]], three of the four Irish Constitution lodges met together and resolved to form themselves into the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta. 

This historic move was supported by one of the English (UGLE) lodges on the island, Count Roger of Normandy Lodge No 9285, and at a special meeting held on 30 June 2004 the lodge resolved to unite with the Irish lodges in the formation of the new Grand Lodge.  The fourth Irish Constitution lodge also decided to participate.
 
Following these events, the Grand Lodge of Ireland, in consultation with the United Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Lodge of Scotland, acceded to the petition of the five lodges. On 18 November 2004, with the Grand Master of Ireland presiding, these 5 lodges were instituted and consecrated by the Grand Lodge of Ireland into The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Malta (SGLoM).&lt;ref&gt;See page 4 of [http://www.irish-freemasons.org/GLN_pdf_Files/GLI_News_03_05.pdf.pdf this newsletter] published by the Grand Lodge of Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of having a Grand Lodge is that SGLoM has become the sovereign Masonic body for the Maltese islands, having inherent power and authority to form a Constitution as its fundamental law, and subject only to the Ancient Landmarks of Freemasonry to enact laws for its own government and that of its subordinate Lodges. The remaining lodges of other constitutions (two English and one Scottish) may continue to meet in Malta, but new lodges may be founded only by the SGLoM. For months, the representatives of the five founding lodges met and drafted a Book of Constitutions which was adopted at the constituting Grand Lodge Meeting on 18 November 2004.

The first Grand Master of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta was Joseph Cordina. In April 2005, a research lodge was consecrated named ''Ars Discendi'' (Art of Learning), and in November 2005 the lodge ''Flos Mundi'' (Flower of the World) was consecrated. This latter lodge was intended to attract Maltese and Italian brethren and works in the Italian language. A further new lodge was founded in 2010, named White Sea Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;See official [http://www.sglom.eu/subordinatelodges.aspx list of lodges] of Malta.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 the lodge ''Mare Nostrum'' was consecrated taking the number of subordinate lodges to nine.

The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta follows the English and Commonwealth pattern of Freemasonry (as opposed to the alternative [[Scottish Rite]], [[York Rite]], and [[Swedish Rite]] styles). This means that Malta recognises the three degrees of Craft Freemasonry (Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason), plus the Order of [[Holy Royal Arch|Royal Arch Freemasonry]], as collectively forming the whole of "pure ancient Freemasonry". As in England, Royal Arch Chapters may be formed in Malta (with the consent of the Grand Master) and each such Chapter must be attached to a warranted Lodge, and bear the same name and number as that lodge.&lt;ref&gt;These regulations are stated [http://sglom.eu/freemasons-in-malta/constitution/section-x-royal-arch-chapter here] in the Book of Constitutions of the SGLoM.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta is recognised by most regular Grand Lodges worldwide.

==The Grand Lodge of Malta (2009)==
On 16 December 2009 a significant number of Maltese Freemasons belonging to Abercorn Lodge, Mikiel Anton Vassalli Lodge, and Logga Fenici withdrew their membership from the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta and established a new Grand Lodge of Malta. They contended that the Constitution of the Sovereign Grand Lodge had been significantly amended so that the Grand Master had been granted absolute powers. They also proposed to establish a masonic Supreme Council to have jurisdiction over the Grand Lodge, a practice which is considered irregular by the majority of the world's established Grand Lodges, including the 'home constitutions', or Grand Lodges of England, Ireland, and Scotland.

The Grand Lodge of Malta (2009) has been recognized by the [[Grand Orient de France]], the [[Gran Loggia D'Italia]] and a number of other bodies practicing [[Continental Freemasonry]], considered irregular by the Grand Lodges of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The new Grand Lodge has not been recognised by any of the [[Regular Masonic jurisdiction]]s worldwide, all of which continue to recognise the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta (2004).

The Grand Lodge of Malta attracted newspaper headlines when Dr David Gatt (a Grand Chancellor of the body) was arrested by Maltese police and charged with a range of serious organised crime offences. He was acquitted in 2017 and all charges quashed&lt;ref&gt;See the case reports of the [http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/exclusive-david-gatt-formed-‘breakaway’-freemason-s-lodge-with-entrepreneurs Malta Today] newspaper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of '''human trafficking in Ecuador''' are generally women and children trafficked within the country from [[Geography of Ecuador|border and central highland areas]] to urban centers for commercial sexual exploitation, as well as for involuntary domestic servitude, forced begging, and forced labor in [[mining in Ecuador|mines]] and other [[hazardous work]]. [[Ecuador]] prohibits [[human trafficking]] in its penal code, and penalties are commensurate with other serious crimes. Despite robust law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking, conviction rates remain low. The Ecuadorian government has ensured trafficking victims' access to legal, medical, psychological, and shelter services, in large part through its partnership with a network of NGOs. The government has also undertaken advertising campaigns against human trafficking, particularly child labor and child sex tourism.  U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence==
Ecuador is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically [[forced prostitution]] and [[forced labor]]. The majority of trafficking victims are believed to be women and children trafficked within the country from [[Geography of Ecuador|border and central highland areas]] to urban centers for commercial sexual exploitation, as well as for involuntary domestic servitude, forced begging, and forced labor in [[mining in Ecuador|mines]] and other hazardous work. There have also been reports of Ecuadorian children being forced to engage in criminal activity, such as [[drug trafficking]] and robbery. Parents sometimes send their children to neighboring countries in order to earn money, and Ecuadorian children are found in conditions of forced labor in [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], and the [[Dominican Republic]], particularly as domestic servants, forced vendors, and beggars. Ecuadorian women are subjected to forced prostitution in Colombia, [[Peru]], Venezuela, and Western Europe. To a lesser extent, Ecuador is a destination country for Colombian, Peruvian, and Chinese women and girls in forced prostitution. [[Indigenous Ecuadorians]] are vulnerable to forced labor in domestic servitude. [[Child sex tourism]] occurs mostly in urban areas, and in tourist destinations, such as [[Tena, Ecuador|Tena]] and the [[Galapagos Islands]]. Ecuador is a transit country for Chinese nationals smuggled to destinations elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere; some of these migrants are trafficked.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Ecuador". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
Ecuador prohibits all forms of human trafficking in Article 190 of its penal code, amended in 2005; trafficking for the purpose of labor exploitation carries a punishment of six to nine years' imprisonment, and trafficking for sexual exploitation carries a penalty of eight to 12 years' imprisonment. Penalties for human trafficking may be increased, by aggravating circumstances, to a maximum of 35 years' imprisonment. Such penalties are commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Other statutes, such as Article 528.13, which prohibits the commercial sexual exploitation of children, are also used to prosecute human trafficking crimes.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Despite reports of trafficking-related corruption, particularly related to civil registry officials issuing false identity documents to children, no investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of potentially complicit officials took place last year. According to Ecuadorian police, brothel owners commonly use false identity documents to exploit children in prostitution, and to avoid criminal liability for immigration and trafficking violations in the event of a police raid.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Most cases of human trafficking investigated in Ecuador during 2009 involved forced prostitution, particularly of children. A growing number of investigations are related to labor exploitation of children and adults, but do not appear commensurate with the incidence of forced labor in the country, particularly the large number of children exploited for forced begging and forced domestic work. The government has provided police specializing in crimes against children with specific training on trafficking in persons. Ecuadorian authorities have formed partnerships with Colombian, Venezuelan, U.S., and Chinese officials to jointly investigate several trafficking cases.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Ecuadorian government has ensured trafficking victims' access to legal, medical, psychological, and shelter services, in large part through its partnership with a network of NGOs that received funding from the government and international organizations. Women and girls are eligible for shelter services, while the government provides boys and men with victim services on an ad hoc basis, though shelters for trafficking victims remain lacking in parts of the country. Foreign victims are eligible for the same services as Ecuadorian trafficking victims. In addition to these short-term services, the government provides victims with counseling, protection, job training, and educational training, and ensures that child victims received long-term care as needed. Through its Victim and Witness Protection Program, the Ecuadorian government operates specialized police units in the cities of [[Guayaquil]], [[Machala]], [[Portoviejo]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], and [[Quito]]. These units accompany other police authorities on brothel raids to coordinate immediate protective services toward identified trafficking victims, and assistance for victim witnesses during court proceedings. The government encourages victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. While Ecuadorian authorities have conducted raids on establishments to rescue children in prostitution, according to the U.S. government they did not demonstrate adequate efforts to identify adult trafficking victims among women exploited in brothels and other vulnerable populations. In 2009, police removed 33 children from commercial sexual exploitation and five from conditions of forced labor. Authorities did not penalize identified trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. The Ecuadorian government does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution, though foreign victims are not typically deported from the country. The government provides victim services to repatriated Ecuadorian trafficking victims. Ecuadorian authorities have developed trafficking in persons protocols for consular officers abroad and have begun training their diplomatic corps in these procedures.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Ecuadorian government has undertaken vigorous public awareness campaigns against child forced labor and prostitution. The government has forged partnerships with private telecommunications companies and a bank to combat child labor, in part through a network of schools for former child laborers. During December 2009, the government launched a national campaign against child begging and a radio soap opera series about the dangers of forced labor, which was broadcast on provincial radio stations in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Kichwa]], a local language. State-owned radio stations have also donated airtime to an NGO in the highlands to broadcast messages on how to identify and avoid human trafficking situations. The [[Ecuadorian Ministry of Tourism]] has launched a nationwide campaign to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of children in the tourism industry, and the government has continued a multimedia campaign in 20 departments to encourage citizens to identify and report trafficking cases. The government, however, has not taken steps to reduce demand for commercial sex acts purchased from adults or forced labor of adults.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

{{Inca civilization}}
The '''Inca Empire''' ({{lang-qu|Tawantinsuyu}}, {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"The Four Regions"{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=221}}), [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift|also known]] as the '''Incan Empire''' and the '''Inka Empire''', was the largest empire in [[pre-Columbian America]].&lt;ref name="SchwartzNichols2010"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Glenn M. |last1=Schwartz|first2=John J. |last2= Nichols|title=After Collapse: The Regeneration of Complex Societies|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=_gsFrnn9RzQC}}|date=15 August 2010|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0-8165-2936-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its political and administrative structure is considered by most scholars to have been the most developed in the [[Americas]] before Columbus' arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Burkholder and Lyman L. Johnson, ''Colonial Latin America'', 7th edition. New York: Oxford University Press 2010, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in [[Cusco]] in modern-day [[Peru]]. The [[History of the Incas|Inca civilization]] arose from the highlands of Peru sometime in the early 13th century. Its [[neo-Inca State|last stronghold]] was conquered by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in 1572.

From 1438 to 1533, the Incas incorporated a large portion of western [[South America]], centered on the [[Andes|Andean]] Mountains, using conquest and peaceful assimilation, among other methods. At its largest, the empire joined [[Peru]], large parts of modern [[Ecuador]], western and south central [[Bolivia]], northwest [[Argentina]], north and [[Incas in Central Chile|central Chile]] and a small part of southwest [[Colombia]] into a state comparable to the historical empires of [[Eurasia]]. Its official language was [[Quechua languages|Quechua]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.machupicchu-tours-peru.org/blog/quechua-language-incas&lt;/ref&gt; Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred ''[[Huaca]]s'', but the Inca leadership encouraged the [[solar deity|sun worship]] of [[Inti]] – their [[solar deity|sun god]] – and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of [[Pachamama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=inca|title=The Inca - All Empires|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Incas considered their king, the [[Sapa Inca]], to be the "son of the sun."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091110041802/http://www.nflc.org/Reach/7ca/enCAInca.htm "The Inca."] ''The National Foreign Language Center at the University of Maryland.'' 29 May 2007. Retrieved 10 Sept 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inca Empire was unique in that it lacked many features associated with civilization in the [[Old World]]. In the words of one scholar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=McEwan, Gordon F. | year=2006 | title=The Incas: New Perspectives | location=New York | publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote | The Incas lacked the use of wheeled vehicles. They lacked animals to ride and draft animals that could pull wagons and plows... [They] lacked the knowledge of iron and steel... Above all, they lacked a system of writing... Despite these supposed handicaps, the Incas were still able to construct one of the greatest imperial states in human history. | Gordon McEwan | The Incas: New Perspectives}} Notable features of the Inca Empire include its monumental architecture, especially stonework, extensive road network reaching all corners of the empire, finely-woven [[Textile|textiles]], use of knotted strings ({{lang|qu|[[quipu]]}}) for record keeping and communication, agricultural innovations in a difficult environment, and the organization and management fostered or imposed on its people and their labor.

The Incan economy has been described in contradictory ways by scholars:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=La Lone, Darrell E. | title=The Inca as a Nonmarket Economy: Supply on Command versus Supply and Demand | page=292 | url=https://www.academia.edu/885136/The_Inca_as_a_nonmarket_economy_Supply_on_command_versus_supply_and_demand | accessedate=10 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote | ... feudal, slave, socialist (here one may choose between socialist paradise or socialist tyranny) | Darrell E. La Lone | The Inca as a Nonmarket Economy: Supply on Command versus Supply and Demand}}
The Inca empire functioned largely without money and without markets. Instead, exchange of goods and services was based on reciprocity between individuals and among individuals, groups, and Inca rulers. "Taxes" consisted of a labour obligation of a person to the Empire. The Inca rulers (who theoretically owned all the means of production) reciprocated by granting access to land and goods and providing food and drink in celebratory feasts for their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Craig and von Hagen, Adrianna (2011), ''The Incas'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, pp. 48–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Inca referred to their empire as ''Tawantinsuyu'',{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=221}} "the four ''suyu''". In [[Quechua language|Quechua]], ''tawa'' is four and ''-ntin'' is a suffix naming a group, so that a ''tawantin'' is a quartet, a group of four things taken together, in this case representing the four ''suyu'' ("regions" or "provinces") whose corners met at the capital. The four ''suyu'' were: [[Chinchaysuyu]] (north), [[Antisuyu]] (east; the Amazon jungle), [[Qullasuyu]] (south) and [[Kuntisuyu]] (west). The name ''Tawantinsuyu'' was, therefore, a descriptive term indicating a union of provinces. The Spanish transliterated the name as ''Tahuatinsuyo'' or ''Tahuatinsuyu''.

The term ''Inka'' means "ruler" or "lord" in Quechua and was used to refer to the ruling class or the ruling family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Inca | encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary | year=2009 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/inca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Incas were a very small percentage of the total population of the empire, probably numbering only 15,000 to 40,000, but ruling a population of around 10 million people.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=93}} The Spanish adopted the term (transliterated as ''Inca'' in Spanish) as an ethnic term referring to all subjects of the empire rather than simply the ruling class. As such, the name ''Imperio inca'' ("Inca Empire") referred to the nation that they encountered and subsequently conquered.

==History==
===Antecedents===
The Inca Empire was the last chapter of thousands of years of [[Andean civilization]]. Andean civilization was one of five civilizations in the world deemed by scholars to be "pristine", that is indigenous and not derivative from other civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Gary and von Hagen, Adriana (2015), ''Encyclopedia of the Incas'', New York: Rowand &amp; Littlefield, p. 2. Some scholars cite 6 or 7 pristine civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inca Empire was preceded by two large-scale empires in the Andes: the [[Tiwanaku Empire|Tiwanaku]] (c. 300–1100 AD), based around [[Lake Titicaca]] and the [[Wari Empire|Wari]] or Huari (c. 600–1100 AD) centered near the present-day city of [[Ayacucho]]. The Wari occupied the Cuzco area for about 400 years. Thus, many of the characteristics of the Inca Empire derived from earlier multi-ethnic and expansive Andean cultures.&lt;ref&gt;McEwan, Gordon F. (2006), ''The Incas: New Perspectives'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Troll]] has argued that the development of the Inca state in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the [[staple food]] [[chuño]]. Chuño, which can be stored for long periods, is made of potato dried at the freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern [[Peru]]vian highlands. Such link between the Inca state and chuño may be questioned as potatoes and other crops such as maize can also be dried with only sunlight.&lt;ref name=Gade2016/&gt; Troll did also argue that [[llama]]s, the Inca's pack animal, can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region.&lt;ref name=Gade2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Gade |first=Daniel |date=2016 |title=Spell of the Urubamba: Anthropogeographical Essays on an Andean Valley in Space and Time |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319208480#aboutBook |chapter=Urubamba Verticality: Reflections on Crops and Diseases |location= |publisher= |page=86 |isbn=978-3-319-20849-7 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of llamas and [[alpaca]]s in Pre-Hispanic America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardoy |first=Jorge Henríque |date=1973 |title=Pre-Colombian Cities |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=fbQJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=llama+inca+expansion+colombia+limi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rirv1B3ECv&amp;sig=eNEgkUGhfN1RQ2uoR71F2WF52Xw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFtZvGvZTZAhVJHJAKHeZYA_MQ6AEIdDAP#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page=24 |isbn=978-0802703804 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between the Andean [[biome]]s of [[Puna grassland|puna]] and [[páramo]], [[pastoralism]] and the Inca state is a matter of research.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt; As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building.&lt;ref name=Gade1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gade |first1=Daniel W. |date=1996 |title=Carl Troll on Nature and Culture in the Andes (Carl Troll über die Natur und Kultur in den Anden)  |url= |journal=[[Erdkunde]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=301–316 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire he opposed [[environmental determinism]] arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

===Origin===
The Inca people were a [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] tribe in the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] area around the 12th century. Incan [[oral history]] tells an origin story of three caves. The center cave at Tampu T'uqu ''(Tambo Tocco)'' was named Qhapaq T'uqu ("principal niche", also spelled ''Capac Tocco''). The other caves were Maras T'uqu ''(Maras Tocco)'' and Sutiq T'uqu ''(Sutic Tocco)''.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=57}} Four brothers and four sisters stepped out of the middle cave. They were: [[Manco Capac|Ayar Manco]], [[Ayar Cachi]], Ayar Awqa ''(Ayar Auca)'' and Ayar Uchu; and [[Mama Ocllo]], [[Mama Raua]], Mama Huaco and Mama Qura ''(Mama Cora)''. Out of the side caves came the people who were to be the ancestors of all the Inca clans.

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Manco Capac, First Inca, 1 of 14 Portraits of Inca Kings - overall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manco Cápac]], First Inca, 1 of 14 Portraits of Inca Kings, Probably mid-18th century. Oil on canvas. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

Ayar Manco carried a magic staff made of the finest gold. Where this staff landed, the people would live. They traveled for a long time. On the way, Ayar Cachi boasted about his strength and power. His siblings tricked him into returning to the cave to get a sacred [[llama]]. When he went into the cave, they trapped him inside to get rid of him.

Ayar Uchu decided to stay on the top of the cave to look over the Inca people. The minute he proclaimed that, he turned to stone. They built a shrine around the stone and it became a sacred object. Ayar Auca grew tired of all this and decided to travel alone. Only Ayar Manco and his four sisters remained.

Finally, they reached Cusco. The staff sank into the ground. Before they arrived, Mama Ocllo had already borne Ayar Manco a child, [[Sinchi Roca]]. The people who were already living in Cusco fought hard to keep their land, but Mama Huaca was a good fighter. When the enemy attacked, she threw her [[bolas]] (several stones tied together that spun through the air when thrown) at a soldier (gualla) and killed him instantly. The other people became afraid and ran away.

After that, Ayar Manco became known as [[Manco Cápac]], the founder of the Inca. It is said that he and his sisters built the first Inca homes in the valley with their own hands. When the time came, Manco Cápac turned to stone like his brothers before him. His son, Sinchi Roca, became the second emperor of the Inca.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=69}}

===Kingdom of Cusco===
{{Main|Kingdom of Cusco}}

Under the leadership of Manco Cápac, the Inca formed the small city-state [[Kingdom of Cusco]] (Quechua ''Qusqu', Qosqo''). In 1438, they began a far-reaching expansion under the command of [[Sapa Inca]] (paramount leader) [[Pachacuti|Pachacuti-Cusi Yupanqui]], whose name literally meant "earth-shaker". The name of Pachacuti was given to him after he conquered the Tribe of [[Chancas]] (modern [[Apurímac Region|Apurímac]]). During his reign, he and his son Tupac Yupanqui brought much of the [[Andes]] mountains (roughly modern Peru and Ecuador) under Inca control.&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-31896-3"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Demarest |first1=Arthur Andrew |last2=Conrad |first2=Geoffrey W. |title=Religion and Empire: The Dynamics of Aztec and Inca Expansionism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1984 |pages=57–59 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IqecX148zLsC|page=57}} |isbn=0-521-31896-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reorganization and formation===
[[File:Capitulo-XXXVIII.jpg|thumb|The first image of the Inca in Europe, [[Pedro Cieza de León]], ''[[Cronica del Peru]]'', 1553]]

Pachacuti reorganized the kingdom of Cusco into the Tahuantinsuyu, which consisted of a central government with the Inca at its head and four provincial governments with strong leaders: Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE).&lt;ref&gt;The three laws of [[Tawantinsuyu]] are still referred to in Bolivia these days as the three laws of the Qullasuyu.&lt;/ref&gt; Pachacuti is thought to have built [[Machu Picchu]], either as a family home or summer retreat, although it may have been an agricultural station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Weatherford | first=J. McIver | authorlink=J. McIver Weatherford | title=Indian Givers: How the Indians of the Americas Transformed the World | year=1988 | publisher=Fawcett Columbine | location=New York |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=xrjz_PgrAdsC|page=60}} | isbn=0-449-90496-2 | pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pachacuti sent spies to regions he wanted in his empire and they brought to him reports on political organization, military strength and wealth. He then sent messages to their leaders extolling the benefits of joining his empire, offering them presents of luxury goods such as high quality textiles and promising that they would be materially richer as his subjects.

Most accepted the rule of the Inca as a ''[[List of French phrases used by English speakers#F|fait accompli]]'' and acquiesced peacefully. Refusal to accept Inca rule resulted in military conquest. Following conquest the local rulers were executed. The ruler's children were brought to Cusco to learn about Inca administration systems, then return to rule their native lands. This allowed the Inca to indoctrinate them into the Inca nobility and, with luck, marry their daughters into families at various corners of the empire.

===Expansion and consolidation===
[[File:Manqu Qhapaqwan Mama Uqllu.gif|thumb|left|Manco Cápac and Mama Ocllo, children of the [[Inti]]]]

Traditionally the son of the Inca ruler led the army. Pachacuti's son [[Túpac Inca Yupanqui]] began conquests to the north in 1463 and continued them as Inca ruler after Pachacuti's death in 1471. Túpac Inca's most important conquest was the Kingdom of [[Chimor]], the Inca's only serious rival for the Peruvian coast. Túpac Inca's empire stretched north into modern-day Ecuador and Colombia.

Túpac Inca's son [[Huayna Cápac]] added a small portion of land to the north in modern-day Ecuador and in parts of Peru. At its height, the Inca Empire included [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], most of what is now [[Ecuador]] and [[Incas in Central Chile|a large portion]] of what is today [[Chile]], north of the [[Maule River]]. The advance south halted after the [[Battle of the Maule]] where they met determined resistance from the [[Mapuche]]. The empire's push into the [[Amazon Basin]] near the [[Chinchipe River]] was stopped by the [[Shuar people|Shuar]] in 1527.&lt;ref name="Salazar1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernesto Salazar|title=An Indian federation in lowland Ecuador|url=http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0106_28Ecuador.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2013|year=1977|publisher=[[International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs]]|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire extended into corners of [[Argentina]] and [[Colombia]]. However, most of the southern portion of the Inca empire, the portion denominated as Qullasuyu, was located in the [[Altiplano]].

The Inca Empire was an amalgamation of languages, cultures and peoples. The components of the empire were not all uniformly loyal, nor were the local cultures all fully integrated. The Inca empire as a whole had an economy based on exchange and taxation of luxury goods and labour. The following quote describes a method of taxation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For as is well known to all, not a single village of the highlands or the plains failed to pay the tribute levied on it by those who were in charge of these matters. There were even provinces where, when the natives alleged that they were unable to pay their tribute, the Inca ordered that each inhabitant should be obliged to turn in every four months a large quill full of live lice, which was the Inca's way of teaching and accustoming them to pay tribute.&lt;ref name="StarnKirk2009"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Orin |last1=Starn|first2=Carlos Iván |last2=Kirk|first3=Carlos Iván |last3=Degregori|title=The Peru Reader: History, Culture, Politics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YyNo4Nsh_qQC}}|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8750-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inca Civil War and Spanish conquest===

Spanish [[conquistadors]] led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] and his brothers explored south from what is today [[Panama]], reaching Inca territory by 1526.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web

This approval was received as detailed in the following quote: "In July 1529 the [[Isabella of Portugal|queen of Spain]] signed a charter allowing Pizarro to conquer the Incas. Pizarro was named governor and captain of all conquests in Peru, or New Castile, as the Spanish now called the land."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Somervill |first=Barbara |title=Francisco Pizarro: Conqueror of the Incas |publisher=Compass Point Books |year=2005 |page=52 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=j-FusDo4ssoC|page=52}} |isbn=978-0-7565-1061-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When they returned to Peru in 1532, a [[Inca Civil War|war of succession]] between the sons of [[Sapa Inca]] Huayna Capac, [[Huáscar]] and [[Atahualpa]], and unrest among newly conquered territories weakened the empire. Perhaps more importantly, [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[typhus]] and [[measles]] had spread from Central America.

The forces led by Pizarro consisted of 168 men, one [[cannon]], and 27 horses. Conquistadors ported lances, [[arquebus]]es, steel armor and [[Rapier|long swords]]. In contrast, the Inca used weapons made out of wood, stone, copper and bronze, putting them at significant technological disadvantage. In addition, due to the absence of horses in the Americas, the Inca did not develop tactics to fight cavalry. However, the Inca were still effective warriors, being able to successfully [[Battle of the Maule|fight]] the [[Mapuche]], which later would [[Arauco War|strategically defeat]] the Spanish as they expanded [[Destruction of the Seven Cities|further south]].

The first engagement between the Inca and the Spanish was the [[Battle of Puná]], near present-day [[Guayaquil]], Ecuador, on the Pacific Coast; Pizarro then founded the city of [[Piura]] in July 1532. [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] was sent inland to explore the interior and returned with an invitation to meet the Inca, Atahualpa, who had defeated his brother in the civil war and was resting at [[Cajamarca]] with his army of 80,000 troops, that were at the moment armed only with hunting tools (knives and lassos for hunting llamas).

Pizarro and some of his men, most notably a friar named [[Vincente de Valverde]], met with the Inca, who had brought only a small retinue. The Inca offered them ceremonial [[chicha]] in a golden cup, which the Spanish rejected. The Spanish interpreter, Friar Vincente, read the "[[Requerimiento]]" that demanded that he and his empire accept the rule of King [[Charles I of Spain]] and convert to Christianity. Atahualpa dismissed the message and asked them to leave. After this, the Spanish began their [[Battle of Cajamarca|attack]] against the mostly unarmed Inca, captured Atahualpa as hostage, and forced the Inca to collaborate.

Atahualpa offered the Spaniards enough gold to fill the [[The Ransom Room|room he was imprisoned in]] and twice that amount of silver. The Inca fulfilled this ransom, but Pizarro deceived them, refusing to release the Inca afterwards. During Atahualpa's imprisonment Huáscar was assassinated elsewhere. The Spaniards maintained that this was at Atahualpa's orders; this was used as one of the charges against Atahualpa when the Spaniards finally executed him, in August 1533.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=79}}

Although "defeat" often implies an unwanted loss in battle, much of the Inca elite "actually welcomed the Spanish invaders as liberators and willingly settled down with them to share rule of Andean farmers and miners."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology, Disease, and Colonial Conquest|publisher=Brill Academic|year=2003|editor-last=Raudzens|editor-first=George|location=Boston|pages=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish installed Atahualpa's brother [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]] in power; for some time Manco cooperated with the Spanish while they fought to put down resistance in the north. Meanwhile, an associate of Pizarro, [[Diego de Almagro]], attempted to claim Cusco. Manco tried to use this intra-Spanish feud to his advantage, recapturing Cusco in 1536, but the Spanish retook the city afterwards. Manco Inca then retreated to the mountains of [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] and established the small [[Neo-Inca State]], where he and his successors ruled for another 36 years, sometimes raiding the Spanish or inciting revolts against them. In 1572 the last Inca stronghold was conquered and the last ruler, [[Túpac Amaru]], Manco's son, was captured and executed.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=31}} This ended resistance to the Spanish conquest under the political authority of the Inca state.

After the fall of the Inca Empire many aspects of Inca culture were systematically destroyed, including their sophisticated farming system, known as the [[vertical archipelago]] model of agriculture.{{sfn|Sanderson|1992|p=76}} Spanish colonial officials used the Inca [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] [[corvée]] labor system for colonial aims, sometimes brutally. One member of each family was forced to work in the gold and silver mines, the foremost of which was the titanic silver mine at [[Potosí]]. When a family member died, which would usually happen within a year or two, the family was required to send a replacement.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The effects of [[smallpox]] on the Inca empire were even more devastating. Beginning in [[Colombia]], smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient Inca road system. Smallpox was only the first epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/orlow-e.html Millersville University ''Silent Killers of the New World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103220859/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/orlow-e.html |date=3 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other diseases, including a probable [[Typhus]] outbreak in 1546, [[influenza]] and [[smallpox]] together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, [[diphtheria]] in 1614, and [[measles]] in 1618, all ravaged the Inca people.

==Society==
{{Main|Inca society|Inca education}}

===Population===
The number of people inhabiting Tawantinsuyu at its peak is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 4–37 million. Most population estimates are in the range of 6 to 14 million. In spite of the fact that the Inca kept excellent census records using their [[quipus]], knowledge of how to read them was lost as almost all fell into disuse and disintegrated over time or were destroyed by the Spaniards.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|pp=93–96. The 10 million population estimate in the info box is a mid-range estimate of the population.}}

===Language===
{{Main|Quechua languages}}
The main form of communication and record-keeping in the empire were quipus, [[ceramic art|ceramics]], textiles and various dialects of Quechua, the language the Incas imposed upon the peoples within the empire. While Quechua had been spoken in the Andean region, including central Peru, for several centuries prior to the expansion of the [[Inca civilization]], the dialect of Quechua the Incas imposed was an adaptation from the Kingdom of Cusco (an early form of "Southern Quechua" originally named Qhapaq Runasimi, or 'the great language of the people'), or what some historians define as the Cusco dialect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macalester.edu/linguistics/endangered/Quechua/Quechua.htm Quechua] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012083947/http://www.macalester.edu/linguistics/endangered/Quechua/Quechua.htm |date=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quechua.org.uk/Eng/Sounds/Quechua/QuechuaOriginsAndDiversity.htm|title=Origins And Diversity of Quechua|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language imposed by the Incas diverted from its original phonetics as some societies formed their own regional varieties. The diversity of Quechua at that point and even today does not come directly from the Incas, who were just a part of the reason for Quechua's diversity. The civilizations within the empire that had previously spoken Quechua kept their own variety distinct from the Quechua the Incas spread. Although these dialects of Quechua had a similar linguistic structure, they differed according to the region in which they were spoken.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Although many of the societies within the empire spoke or learned to speak Quechua, others continued to speak their original languages, such as [[Aymara language|Aymara]], which remains in use in contemporary Bolivia, where it is the primary indigenous language and in various regions surrounding Bolivia. The linguistic body of the Inca Empire was thus varied. The Inca's impact outlasted their empire, as the Spanish continued the use of Quechua.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The Incas were not known to develop a written form of communication; however, they visually recorded narratives through paintings on vases and cups ([[qiru]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Comparing chronicles and Andean visual texts. Issues for analysis.|url=http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chungara/v46n1/art06.pdf|journal=Chungara, Revista de Antropología Chilena|volume=46,  Nº 1, 2014|pages=91–113|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are usually accompanied by geometric patterns known as toqapu, which are also found in textiles. Researchers have speculated that toqapu patterns could have served as a form of written communication (e.g.: heraldry, or glyphs), however this remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Royal Tocapu in Guacan Poma: An Inca Heraldic?|url=http://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/boletindearqueologia/article/view/2020/1953|journal=Boletin de Arqueologia PUCP|volume=Nº 8, 2004|pages=305–323|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age and Defining Gender ===
The high infant mortality rates that plagued the Inca Empire caused newborn infants to solely be given the term ‘wawa’ when they were born. Most families did not invest very much into their child until they reached the age of two, or most of the times three years old. Once the child reached the age of three a ‘coming of age’ ceremony occurred. This ceremony was called the ''rutuchikuy'' ritual. For the Incas this ceremony indicated that the child had entered the stage of ‘ignorance’. During this ceremony the family would invite all relatives to their house for food and dance and then each member of the family would receive a lock of hair from the young child. After each family member had received a piece of the hair, the father would then shave the child’s head. According to Covey, this stage of life was categorized by a stage of “ignorance, inexperience, and lack of reason, a condition that the child would overcome with time.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Covey, R. Alan. “Inca Gender Relations: from household to empire.” Gender in cross-cultural perspective. Brettell, Caroline,, Sargent, Carolyn F., 1947- (Seventh edition ed.). Abingdon, Oxon. {{ISBN|9780415783866}}. [[OCLC]] 962171839.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Incan society in order to advance from the stage of ignorance to development the child must learn the roles around the family associated with their gender.

The next important ritual was to celebrate the maturity of child. Unlike the previous ritual ceremony, the celebration of maturity was to signify the child's sexual potency. In the western world this ceremony would be known as a celebration of puberty, however for the Incas it was called ''warachikuy'' for boys and ''qikuchikuy'' for girls. The ''warachikuy'' ceremony included dancing, fasting, tasks to show their strength, and family ceremonies. The boy would also be given new clothes and taught how to act as an unmarried man. On the other hand, the girls ceremony ''qikuchikuy'' signified the onset of menstruation, therefore the girl would go into the forest alone and not return until the bleeding had ended. In the forest she would fast, and upon arrival the girl would be given a new name, adult clothing, and advice. This 'folly' stage of life was important because this was the time the young adults could have sex without having to be a parent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Between the ages 20-30 the young adults were "ripe for serious thought and labor".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The young adults were able to hold on to their 'youthful status' during this age by living at home and helping out their home community. The young adults only reached their 'full potential' once they were married.

In the end, the male and female terms describe the individuals loss of sexual vitality and humanity. Specifically, the decrepitude stage signifies the loss of their mental well being and further physical dystrophy.

=== Marriage ===
In the Incan Empire, the age of marriage differed for men and women; men typically married at the age of 20, while women usually got married around 4 years earlier at the age of 16.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25371192|title=Incas : lords of gold and glory|date=1992|publisher=Time-Life Books|others=Time-Life Books.|isbn=0809498707|location=Alexandria, Va.|oclc=25371192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who were highly ranked in society could have multiple wives, but those lower in the ranks could only take a single wife.&lt;ref&gt;Gouda, F. (2008). Colonial Encounters, Body Politics, and Flows of Desire. Journal of Women's History, 20(3), 166–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Marriages were typically within classes and resembled a more business-like agreement. Once married, the women were expected to cook, collect food and watch over the children and livestock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Girls and mothers would also work around the house to keep it orderly to please the public inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard, K. (1997). Ancient Lives. New Moon, 4(4), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; These duties remained the same even after wives became pregnant and with the added responsibility of praying and making offerings to Kanopa, who was the god of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was typical for marriages to begin on a trial basis with both men and women having a say in the longevity of the marriage. If the man felt that it wouldn’t work out or if the woman wanted to return to her parent’s home the marriage would end. Once the marriage was final, the only way the two could be divorced was if they did not have a child together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marriage within the Empire was crucial for survival. A family was considered disadvantaged if there was not a married couple at the center because everyday life centered around the balance of male and female tasks&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46449340|title=The Incas|last=N.,|first=D'Altroy, Terence|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631176772|location=Malden, Mass.|oclc=46449340}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Gender Roles ===
In the eyes of the Inca, male and female roles were considered equal. The "indigenous cultures saw the two genders as complementary parts of a whole."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In other words, there was not a hierarchical structure in the domestic sphere for the Incas. Within the domestic sphere, women were known as the weavers. Women's everyday tasks included: spinning, watching the children, weaving cloth, cooking, brewing chichi, preparing fields for cultivation, planting seeds, bearing children, harvesting, weeding, hoeing, herding, and carrying water&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14165734|title=Moon, sun, and witches : gender ideologies and class in Inca and colonial Peru|last=Irene.|first=Silverblatt,|date=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691077266|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=14165734}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Men on the other hand, "weeded, plowed, participated in combat, helped in the harvest, carried firewood, built houses, herded llama and alpaca, and spun and wove when necessary"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. On looking Spaniards did not understand the complementary nature of men and women roles within the Inca culture and believed women were treated like slaves&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4933087|title=History of the Inca Empire : an account of the Indians' customs and their origin, together with a treatise on Inca legends, history, and social institutions|last=1580-1657.|first=Cobo, Bernabé,|date=1979|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Hamilton, Roland, 1936-|isbn=029273008X|location=Austin|oclc=4933087}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, Inca women did not view themselves as slaves, nor did they do their job for the man. The women completed their daily tasks for the improvement of her household and community, to ensure her family would survive&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Furthermore, women were allowed to own land and herds because inheritance was passed down from both the mother's and father's side of the family &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33405288|title=Daily life in the Inca empire|last=Andrew.|first=Malpass, Michael|date=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0313293902|location=Westport, Conn.|oclc=33405288}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Kinship within the Inca society followed a parallel line of descent. In other words, women ascended from women and men ascended from men. Due to the parallel descent, women had access to land and other necessities through her mother, and communities flourished because of the environmental social ties among women &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

==Religion==
{{See also|Religion in the Inca Empire|Inca mythology}}
[[File:Cabeza de Viracocha, Museo de América.jpg|thumb|Diorite Inca sculpture from Amarucancha]]

Inca myths were [[Oral tradition|transmitted orally]] until early Spanish colonists recorded them; however, some scholars claim that they were recorded on quipus, Andean knotted string records.&lt;ref name="Urton2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gary |last=Urton|title=Signs of the Inka Khipu: Binary Coding in the Andean Knotted-String Records|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=koUyPlsu_VIC}}|date=6 March 2009|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-77375-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inca believed in [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netside.net/~manomed/inca.htm THE INCAS OF PERU]&lt;/ref&gt; After death, the passage to the next world was fraught with difficulties. The spirit of the dead, ''camaquen,'' would need to follow a long road and during the trip the assistance of a black dog that could see in the dark was required. Most Incas imagined the after world to be like an earthly paradise with flower-covered fields and snow-capped mountains.

It was important to the Inca that they not die as a result of burning or that the body of the deceased not be incinerated. Burning would cause their vital force to disappear and threaten their passage to the after world. Those who obeyed the Inca moral code – ''ama suwa, ama llulla, ama quella'' (do not steal, do not lie, do not be lazy) – "went to live in the Sun's warmth while others spent their eternal days in the cold earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heartoftheinitiate.com/taxonomy/term/339|title=Inca moral code {{!}} Heart of the Initiate - Shamanic Retreats|website=www.heartoftheinitiate.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inca nobility practiced [[cranial deformation]].&lt;ref name="BurgerSalazar2004"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard L. |last1=Burger|first2=Lucy C. |last2=Salazar|title=Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mystery of the Incas|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bBHrWwtr_pYC|page=4}}|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09763-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wrapped tight cloth straps around the heads of newborns to shape their soft skulls into a more conical form, thus distinguishing the nobility from other social classes.

The Incas made [[human sacrifice]]s. As many as 4,000 servants, court officials, favorites and concubines were killed upon the death of the Inca [[Huayna Capac]] in 1527.&lt;ref name="Davies1981"&gt;{{cite book|first=Nigel |last=Davies|title=Human sacrifice: in history and today|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=vaGAAAAAMAAJ|page=261}}|date=February 1981|publisher=Morrow|isbn=978-0-688-03755-0|authorlink=Nigel Davies (historian)|pp= 261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Incas performed child sacrifices around important events, such as the death of the Sapa Inca or during a famine. These sacrifices were known as ''[[qhapaq hucha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reinhard | first = Johan | title = A 6,700 metros niños incas sacrificados quedaron congelados en el tiempo | journal = [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic, Spanish version]] | pages = 36–55 |date=November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deities===

The Incas were [[Polytheism|polytheists]] who worshipped many gods. These included:[[File:Viracocha.jpg|thumb|[[Viracocha]], is the great creator god in [[Inca mythology]]]]

*[[Viracocha]] (also Pachacamac) – Created all living things
*[[Apu Illapu]] – Rain God, prayed to when they need rain
*[[Ayar Cachi]] – Hot-tempered God, causes earthquakes
*[[Illapa]] – Goddess of lightning and thunder (also Yakumama water goddess)
*[[Inti]] – sun god and patron deity of the holy city of Cusco (home of the sun)
*[[Kuychi]] – Rainbow God, connected with fertility
*[[Mama Killa]] – Wife of Inti, called Moon Mother
*[[Mama Occlo]] – Wisdom to civilize the people, taught women to weave cloth and build houses
*[[Manco Cápac]] – known for his courage and sent to earth to become first king of the Incas. Taught people how to grow plants, make weapons, work together, share resources and worship the Gods
*[[Pachamama]] – The Goddess of earth and wife of Viracocha. People give her offerings of coca leaves and beer and pray to her for major agricultural occasions
*Quchamama – Goddess of the sea
*Sachamama – Means Mother Tree, goddess in the shape of a snake with two heads
*Yakumama – Means mother Water. Represented as a snake. When she came to earth she transformed into a great river (also Illapa).

The Inca Empire employed [[central planning]]. The Inca Empire traded with outside regions, although they did not operate a substantial internal [[market economy]].

==Government==
{{Main|Government of the Inca Empire}}

===Beliefs===
The Sapa Inca was conceptualized as divine and was effectively head of the state religion. The ''[[Willaq Umu]]'' (or Chief Priest) was second to the emperor. Local religious traditions continued and in some cases such as the Oracle at [[Pachacamac]] on the Peruvian coast, were officially venerated. Following Pachacuti, the Sapa Inca claimed descent from Inti, who placed a high value on imperial blood; by the end of the empire, it was common to [[incest]]uously wed brother and sister. He was "son of the sun," and his people the ''intip churin'', or "children of the sun," and both his right to rule and mission to conquer derived from his holy ancestor. The Sapa Inca also presided over ideologically important festivals, notably during the ''[[Inti Raymi]]'', or "Sunfest" attended by soldiers, mummified rulers, nobles, clerics and the general population of Cusco beginning on the June solstice and culminating nine days later with the ritual breaking of the earth using a foot plow by the Inca. Moreover, Cusco was considered cosmologically central, loaded as it was with ''huacas'' and radiating ''[[ceque]]'' lines and geographic center of the Four Quarters; [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]] called it "the navel of the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to American Archaeology: South America|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=J6pGAAAAMAAJ}}|year=1966|publisher=Prentice-Hall |last=Willey |first=Gordon R. |location=Englewood Cliffs|pp=173–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=86–89; 111; 154–155}}{{sfn|Moseley2001|pp= 81–85}}{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=138-139}}

===Organization of the empire===
[[File:Inca Chile1.1.JPG|thumb|The Inca Empire's southern border defined by the [[Maule River|Maule]] or [[Maipo River]] (scholars differ).&lt;ref name=Dillehay1988&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Dillehay | first1 = T. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = A. | authorlink1 = Tom Dillehay |editor-first1=Tom |editor-last1=Dillehay |editor-first2=Patricia |editor-last2=Netherly |chapter=La actividad prehispánica y su influencia en la Araucanía | title = La frontera del estado Inca |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=F9UuVyGcZ7MC}}|publisher=Editorial Abya Yala|isbn=978-9978-04-977-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inca troops never crossed the [[Bío Bío River]].{{sfn|Bengoa|2003|p=39}}]]

The Inca Empire was a [[federation|federalist system]] consisting of a central government with the Inca at its head and four quarters, or ''suyu'': [[Chinchay Suyu]] (NW), [[Anti Suyu]] (NE), [[Kunti Suyu]] (SW) and [[Qulla Suyu]] (SE). The four corners of these quarters met at the center, Cusco. These ''suyu'' were likely created around 1460 during the reign of Pachacuti before the empire reached its largest territorial extent. At the time the ''suyu'' were established they were roughly of equal size and only later changed their proportions as the empire expanded north and south along the Andes.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe in Steward, Ed., p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Cusco was likely not organized as a ''wamani'', or province. Rather, it was probably somewhat akin to a modern [[federal district]], like Washington, D.C. or Mexico City. The city sat at the center of the four ''suyu'' and served as the preeminent center of politics and religion. While Cusco was essentially governed by the Sapa Inca, his relatives and the royal ''panaqa'' lineages, each ''suyu'' was governed by an ''Apu'', a term of esteem used for men of high status and for venerated mountains. Both Cusco as a district and the four ''suyu'' as administrative regions were grouped into upper ''hanan'' and lower ''hurin'' divisions. As the Inca did not have written records, it is impossible to exhaustively list the constituent ''wamani''. However, colonial records allow us to reconstruct a partial list. There were likely more than 86 ''wamani'', with more than 48 in the highlands and more than 38 on the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe in Steward, ed., p. 185-192&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=42–43, 86–89}}{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=113-114}}

====Suyu====
[[File:Inca Empire South America.png|thumb|The four ''suyus'' or quarters of the empire.]]

The most populous ''suyu'' was Chinchaysuyu, which encompassed the former Chimu empire and much of the northern Andes. At its largest extent, it extended through much of modern Ecuador and into modern Colombia.

The largest ''suyu'' by area was Qullasuyu, named after the [[Aymara language|Aymara]]-speaking [[Qulla people]]. It encompassed the Bolivian [[Altiplano]] and much of the southern Andes, reaching Argentina and as far south as the [[Maipo River|Maipo]] or [[Maule river]] in [[Incas in Central Chile|Central Chile]].&lt;ref name=Dillehay1988/&gt; Historian [[José Bengoa]] singled out [[Quillota]] as likely being the foremost Inca settlement in Chile.{{sfn|Bengoa|2003|pp=37–38}}

The second smallest ''suyu'', Antisuyu, was northwest of Cusco in the high Andes. Its name is the root of the word "Andes."{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=87}}

Kuntisuyu was the smallest ''suyu'', located along the southern coast of modern Peru, extending into the highlands towards Cusco.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=87–88}}

===Laws===

The Inca state had no [[Judicial independence|separate judiciary]] or [[Code (law)|codified laws]]. Customs, expectations and traditional local power holders governed behavior. The state had legal force, such as through ''tokoyrikoq'' (lit. "he who sees all"), or inspectors. The highest such inspector, typically a blood relative to the Sapa Inca, acted independently of the conventional hierarchy, providing a point of view for the Sapa Inca free of bureaucratic influence.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=235–236}}

The Inca had three moral precepts that governed their behavior:

* ''Ama sua'': Do not steal
* ''Ama llulla'': Do not lie
* ''Ama quella'': Do not be lazy

===Administration===
[[File:José Bernardo de Tagle Inti.svg|thumb|[[Inti]], as represented by [[José Bernardo de Tagle]] of Peru]]

Colonial sources are not entirely clear or in agreement about Inca government structure, such as exact duties and functions of government positions. But the basic structure can be broadly described. The top was the ''Sapa Inca''. Below that may have been the ''Willaq Umu'', literally the "priest who recounts", the High Priest of the Sun.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=99}} However, beneath the ''Sapa Inca'' also sat the ''Inkap rantin'', who was a confidant and assistant to the ''Sapa Inca'', perhaps similar to a Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. Zuidema, Hierarchy and Space in Incaic Social Organization. Ethnohistory, Vol. 30, No. 2. (Spring, 1983), pp. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]], a "Council of the Realm" was composed of 16 nobles: 2 from ''hanan'' Cusco; 2 from ''hurin'' Cusco; 4 from Chinchaysuyu; 2 from Cuntisuyu; 4 from Collasuyu; and 2 from Antisuyu. This weighting of representation balanced the ''hanan'' and ''hurin'' divisions of the empire, both within Cusco and within the Quarters (''hanan suyukuna'' and ''hurin suyukuna'').{{sfn|Zuidema|1983|pp= 48}}

While provincial [[bureaucracy]] and government varied greatly, the basic organization was decimal. Taxpayers – male heads of household of a certain age range – were organized into [[corvée labor]] units (often doubling as military units) that formed the state's muscle as part of [[mit'a]] service. Each unit of more than 100 tax-payers were headed by a ''kuraka'', while smaller units were headed by a ''kamayuq'', a lower, non-hereditary status. However, while ''kuraka'' status was hereditary and typically served for life, the position of a ''kuraka'' in the hierarchy was subject to change based on the privileges of superiors in the hierarchy; a ''pachaka kuraka'' could be appointed to the position by a ''waranqa kuraka''. Furthermore, one ''kuraka'' in each decimal level could serve as the head of one of the nine groups at a lower level, so that a ''pachaka kuraka'' might also be a ''waranqa kuraka'', in effect directly responsible for one unit of 100 tax-payers and less directly responsible for nine other such units.{{sfn|Julien|1982|pp=121–127}}{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=233–234}}{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=114-115}}

==Arts and technology==

===Monumental architecture===

Architecture was the most important of the Incan arts, with textiles reflecting architectural motifs. The most notable example is [[Machu Picchu]], which was constructed by [[Inca engineers]]. The prime Inca structures were made of stone blocks that fit together so well that a knife could not be fitted through the stonework. These constructs have survived for centuries, with no use of mortar to sustain them.

This process was first used on a large scale by the [[Pukara|Pucara]] (ca. 300 BC–AD 300) peoples to the south in [[Lake Titicaca]] and later in the city of [[Tiwanaku]] (ca. AD 400–1100) in present-day Bolivia. The rocks were sculpted to fit together exactly by repeatedly lowering a rock onto another and carving away any sections on the lower rock where the dust was compressed. The tight fit and the concavity on the lower rocks made them extraordinarily stable, despite the ongoing challenge of earthquakes and volcanic activity.

===Measures, calendrics and mathematics===
[[File:Tupa-inca-tunic.png|thumb|Inca tunic]]
[[File:All-tocapu-sin-BV.png|thumb|[[Tokapu]]. Textiles worn by the Inca elite consisting of geometric figures enclosed by rectangles or squares. There is evidence that the designs were an [[Ideogram|ideographic]] language{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}]]
[[File:Inca. Quipu.jpg|thumb|Quipu, 15th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

Physical measures used by the Inca were based on human body parts. Units included fingers, the distance from thumb to forefinger, palms, [[cubit]]s and wingspans. The most basic distance unit was ''thatkiy'' or ''thatki'', or one pace. The next largest unit was reported by Cobo to be the ''topo'' or ''tupu'', measuring 6,000 ''thatkiy''s, or about {{convert|7.7|km|1|abbr=on}}; careful study has shown that a range of {{convert|4.0|to|6.3|km|1|abbr=on}} is likely. Next was the ''wamani'', composed of 30 ''topo''s (roughly {{convert|232|km||disp=or|abbr=on}}). To measure area, 25 by 50 wingspans were used, reckoned in ''topo''s (roughly {{convert|3,280|km2||disp=or|abbr=on}}). It seems likely that distance was often interpreted as one day's walk; the distance between ''tambo'' way-stations varies widely in terms of distance, but far less in terms of time to walk that distance.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=246–247}}{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=179-180}}

Inca [[calendar]]s were strongly tied to [[astronomy]]. Inca astronomers understood [[equinox]]es, [[solstice]]s and [[zenith]] passages, along with the [[Transit of Venus|Venus cycle]]. They could not, however, predict [[eclipse]]s. The Inca calendar was essentially [[lunisolar]], as two calendars were maintained in parallel, one [[solar calendar|solar]] and one [[lunar calendar|lunar]]. As 12 lunar months fall 11 days short of a full 365-day solar year, those in charge of the calendar had to adjust every winter solstice. Each lunar month was marked with festivals and rituals.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=150–154}} Apparently, the days of the week were not named and days were not grouped into weeks. Similarly, months were not grouped into seasons. Time during a day was not measured in hours or minutes, but in terms of how far the sun had travelled or in how long it had taken to perform a task.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=185-187}}

The sophistication of Inca administration, calendrics and engineering required facility with numbers. Numerical information was stored in the knots of ''[[quipu]]'' strings, allowing for compact storage of large numbers.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160102"&gt;{{cite news |last=Neuman |first=William |title=Untangling an Accounting Tool and an Ancient Incan Mystery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/world/americas/untangling-an-accounting-tool-and-an-ancient-incan-mystery.html |date=January 2, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=183-185}} These numbers were stored in [[base-10]] digits, the same base used by the Quechua language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/~pah1003/loe/Eng/SupplInfo/2008Heggarty.htm |title=Supplementary Information for: Heggarty 2008 |publisher=Arch.cam.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312203340/http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/~pah1003/loe/Eng/SupplInfo/2008Heggarty.htm |archivedate=12 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in administrative and military units.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=233–234}} These numbers, stored in ''quipu'', could be calculated on ''[[yupana]]s'', grids with squares of positionally varying mathematical values, perhaps functioning as an [[abacus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Inca_mathematics.html |title=Inca mathematics |publisher=History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculation was facilitated by moving piles of tokens, seeds or pebbles between compartments of the ''yupana''. It is likely that Inca mathematics at least allowed division of integers into integers or fractions and multiplication of integers and fractions.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=185}}

According to mid-17th-century Jesuit chronicler Bernabé Cobo,&lt;ref&gt;Cobo, B. (1983 [1653]). Obras del P. Bernabé Cobo. Vol. 1. Edited and preliminary study By Francisco Mateos. Biblioteca de Autores Españoles, vol. 91. Madrid: Ediciones Atlas.&lt;/ref&gt; the Inca designated officials to perform accounting-related tasks. These officials were called quipo camayos.

===Ceramics, precious metals and textiles===
[[File:Camelid Conopa, 1470-1532, 36.683.jpg|thumb|Camelid Conopa, 1470–1532, [[Brooklyn Museum]], Small stone figurines, or ''conopas'', of llamas and alpacas were the most common ritual effigies used in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia. These devotional objects were often buried in the animals' corrals to bring protection and prosperity to their owners and fertility to the herds. The cylindrical cavities in their backs were filled with offerings to the gods in the form of a mixture including animal fat, coca leaves, maize kernels and seashells. ]]

[[Ceramic art|Ceramics]] were painted using the polychrome technique portraying numerous motifs including animals, birds, waves, felines (popular in the [[Chavín culture|Chavin culture]]) and geometric patterns found in the [[Nazca]] style of ceramics. In a culture without a written language, ceramics portrayed the basic scenes of everyday life, including the smelting of metals, relationships and scenes of tribal warfare. The most distinctive Inca ceramic objects are the Cusco bottles or "aryballos".&lt;ref name="HerreraBerrin1997"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kathleen |last1=Berrin|title=The Spirit of Ancient Peru: Treasures from the Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RbNuQgAACAAJ}}|year=1997|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-01802-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these pieces are on display in Lima in the [[Larco Museum|Larco Archaeological Museum]] and the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History.

Almost all of the gold and silver work of the Incan empire was melted down by the conquistadors.

===Communication and medicine===
The Inca recorded information on assemblages of knotted strings, known as [[Quipu]], although they can no longer be decoded. Originally it was thought that Quipu were used only as mnemonic devices or to record numerical data. Quipus are also believed to record history and literature.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=183}}

The Inca made many discoveries in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somervill|first1=Barbara A.|title=Empire of the Inca|date=2005|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0816055602|pages=101–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; They performed successful [[Trepanation|skull surgery]], by cutting holes in the skull to alleviate fluid buildup and inflammation caused by head wounds. Many skull surgeries performed by Inca surgeons were successful. Survival rates were 80–90%, compared to about 30% before Inca times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/31466/title/Incan_skull_surgery|title=Incan skull surgery|work=Science News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coca===
[[File:Erythroxylum-coca-foliage2.jpg|thumb|[[Coca]] leaves]]

The Incas revered the [[coca]] plant as sacred/magical. Its leaves were used in moderate amounts to lessen hunger and pain during work, but were mostly used for religious and health purposes.&lt;ref name="Boca Raton"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cocaine's use: From the Incas to the U.S.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19850404&amp;id=0B1UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mIwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6387,881236|accessdate=2 February 2014|newspaper=Boca Raton News|date=4 April 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaniards took advantage of the effects of chewing coca leaves.&lt;ref name="Boca Raton" /&gt; The [[Chasqui]], messengers who ran throughout the empire to deliver messages, chewed coca leaves for extra energy. Coca leaves were also used as an [[Anesthetic|anaesthetic]] during surgeries.

===Weapons, armor and warfare===
[[File:MapvsInc.JPG|thumb|The [[Battle of the Maule]] between the Incas (right) and the [[Mapuche]]s (left)]]
The Inca army was the most powerful at that time, because they could turn an ordinary villager or farmer into a soldier. Every able bodied male Inca of fighting age had to take part in war in some capacity at least once and to prepare for warfare again when needed. By the time the empire reached its largest size, every section of the empire contributed in setting up an army for war.

The Incas had no iron or steel and their weapons were not much more effective than those of their opponents. They went into battle with drums beating and trumpets blowing. Their armor included:{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}
*Helmets made of wood, copper, bronze, cane, or animal skin; some were adorned with feathers
*Round or square shields made from wood or hide
*Cloth tunics padded with cotton and small wooden planks to protect the spine.

The Inca weaponry included:
*Bronze&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Inca_Warfare/|title=Inca Warfare|last=Cartwright|first=Mark|date=19 May 2016|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or bone-tipped spears
*Clubs with stone and spiked metal{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} heads
*Woolen slings and stones
*Stone or copper{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Inca_Warfare/|title=Inca Warfare|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; headed battle-axes
*[[Bolas]] (stones fastened to lengths of cord)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cartwright|first1=Mark|title=Inca Warfare|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Inca_Warfare/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roads allowed quick movement (on foot) for the Inca army and shelters called ''[[Tambo (Incan structure)|tambo]]'' and storage silos called [[qullqa]]s were built one day's travelling distance from each other, so that an army on campaign could always be fed and rested. This can be seen in names of ruins such as ''Ollantay Tambo'', or My Lord's Storehouse. These were set up so the Inca and his entourage would always have supplies (and possibly shelter) ready as they traveled.

===Flag===
{{See also|Wiphala|Rainbow flag#Andean indigenism}}

Chronicles and references from the 16th and 17th centuries support the idea of a banner. However, it represented the Inca (emperor), not the empire.

Francisco López de Jerez&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Jerez,''Verdadera relación de la conquista del Peru y provincia de Cusco, llamada la Nueva Castilla'', 1534.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in 1534:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;todos venían repartidos en sus escuadras con sus banderas y capitanes que los mandan, con tanto concierto como turcos.&lt;br/&gt;(...&amp;nbsp;all of them came distributed into squads, with their flags and captains commanding them, as well-ordered as Turks.) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chronicler Bernabé Cobo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The royal standard or banner was a small square flag, ten or twelve spans around, made of cotton or wool cloth, placed on the end of a long staff, stretched and stiff such that it did not wave in the air and on it each king painted his arms and emblems, for each one chose different ones, though the sign of the Incas was the rainbow and two parallel snakes along the width with the tassel as a crown, which each king used to add for a badge or blazon those preferred, like a lion, an eagle and other figures.

&lt;br&gt;(...&amp;nbsp;el guión o estandarte real era una banderilla cuadrada y pequeña, de diez o doce palmos de ruedo, hecha de lienzo de algodón o de lana, iba puesta en el remate de una asta larga, tendida y tiesa, sin que ondease al aire, y en ella pintaba cada rey sus armas y divisas, porque cada uno las escogía diferentes, aunque las generales de los Incas eran el arco celeste y dos culebras tendidas a lo largo paralelas con la borda que le servía de corona, a las cuales solía añadir por divisa y blasón cada rey las que le parecía, como un león, un águila y otras figuras.)&lt;br&gt;-&lt;small&gt;'''Bernabé Cobo, ''Historia del Nuevo Mundo''''' (1653)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Guaman Poma]]'s 1615 book, ''El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno'', shows numerous line drawings of Inca flags.&lt;ref&gt;Guaman Poma, ''El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno'', (1615/1616), pp. 256, 286, 344, 346, 400, 434, 1077, this pagination corresponds to the Det Kongelige Bibliotek search engine pagination of the book. Additionally Poma shows both well drafted European flags and coats of arms on pp. 373, 515, 558, 1077, 0. On pages 83, 167–171 Poma uses a European heraldic graphic convention, a shield, to place certain totems related to Inca leaders.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1847 book ''A History of the Conquest of Peru'', "[[William H. Prescott]] ... says that in the Inca army each company had its particular banner and that the imperial standard, high above all, displayed the glittering device of the rainbow, the armorial ensign of the Incas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Preble|first=George Henry|author2=Charles Edward Asnis|title=Origin and History of the American Flag and of the Naval and Yacht-Club Signals...|volume=1|year=1917|publisher=N. L. Brown |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erYTAAAAYAAJ|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1917 world flags book says the Inca "heir-apparent ... was entitled to display the royal standard of the rainbow in his military campaigns."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McCandless|first=Byron |title=Flags of the world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbSCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA356|year=1917|publisher=National Geographic Society|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times the [[rainbow flag]] has been wrongly associated with the Tawantinsuyu and displayed as a symbol of Inca heritage by some groups in Peru and Bolivia. The city of Cusco also flies the Rainbow Flag, but as an official flag of the city. The Peruvian president [[Alejandro Toledo]] (2001–2006) flew the Rainbow Flag in [[Lima]]'s presidential palace. However, according to Peruvian historiography, the Inca Empire never had a flag. Peruvian historian [[María Rostworowski]] said, "I bet my life, the Inca never had that flag, it never existed, no chronicler mentioned it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vidayestilo.terra.com.pe/bandera-gay-o-del-tahuantinsuyo,df4c7c1c09e4e210VgnVCM4000009bf154d0RCRD.html|title=¿Bandera gay o del Tahuantinsuyo?|date=19 April 2010|work=Terra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, to the Peruvian newspaper ''El Comercio'', the flag dates to the first decades of the 20th century,&lt;ref name="La Bandera del Tahuantisuyo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congreso.gob.pe/participa/documentos/boletin23062004.pdf|title=La Bandera del Tahuantisuyo|accessdate=12 June 2009|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru]] has determined that flag is a fake by citing the conclusion of National Academy of Peruvian History:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The official use of the wrongly called 'Tawantinsuyu flag' is a mistake. In the Pre-Hispanic Andean World there did not exist the concept of a flag, it did not belong to their historic context".&lt;ref name="La Bandera del Tahuantisuyo"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;'''National Academy of Peruvian History'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Adaptations to altitude==
[[File:Peru - Cusco Sacred Valley &amp; Incan Ruins 005 - Sacsaywamán (6948620856).jpg|thumb|[[Sacsayhuamán]], the Inca stronghold of [[Cusco]]]]
Incas were able to adapt to their high-altitude living through successful acclimatization, which is characterized by increasing oxygen supply to the blood tissues. For the native Inca living in the Andean highlands, this was achieved through the development of a larger lung capacity, and an increase in red blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentration, and capillary beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22367|pmid=24065360|title=Developmental Functional Adaptation to High Altitude: Review|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=25|issue=2|pages=151–68|year=2013|last1=Frisancho|first1=A. Roberto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other humans, the Incas had slower heart rates, almost one-third larger [[lung]] capacity, about 2 L (4 pints) more blood volume and double the amount of [[hemoglobin]], which transfers [[oxygen]] from the lungs to the rest of the body. While the [[Conquistadors]] may have been slightly taller, the Inca had the advantage of coping with the extraordinary altitude.

The '''Index of Industrial Production''' (IIP) is an [[Index (economics)|index]] for India which details out the growth of various sectors in an economy such as mineral mining, electricity and manufacturing. The all India IIP is a composite indicator that measures the short-term changes in the volume of production of a basket of industrial products during a given period with respect to that in a chosen base period. It is compiled and published monthly by the central statistical organisation (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation six weeks after the reference month ends. 

The level of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is an abstract number, the magnitude of which represents the status of production in the [[industrial sector]] for a given period of time as compared to a reference period of time. The base year was at one time fixed at 1993–94 so that year was assigned an index level of 100. The current base year is 2011-2012.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=161745&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Eight Core Industries comprise nearly 40.27% of the weight of items included in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). These are Electricity , steel, refinery products, crude oil, coal, cement, natural gas and fertilisers.

==The beginning==
The first official attempt to compute the IIP was made much earlier than even the recommendations on the subject at the international level. The Office of the Economic Advisor, [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Ministry of Commerce and Industry]] made the first attempt of compilation and release of IIP with base year 1937, covering 15 important industries, accounting for more than 90 percent of the total production of the selected industries. The all-India IIP is being released as a monthly series since 1950. With the inception of the Central Statistical Organization in 1951, the responsibility for compilation and publication of IIP was vested with this office.

==Successive revisions==

As the structure of the industrial sector changes over time, it became necessary to revise the base year of the IIP periodically to capture the changing composition of industrial production and emergence of new products and services so as to measure the real growth of industrial sector (UNSO recommends quinquennial revision of the base year of IIP). After 1937, the successive revised base years were 1946, 1951, 1956, 1960, 1970, 1980–81 and 1993–94. Initially it was covering 15 industries comprising three broad categories: mining, manufacturing and electricity. The scope of the index was restricted to mining and manufacturing sectors consisting of 20 industries with 35 items, when the base year was shifted to 1946 by Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry and it was called Interim Index of Industrial Production. This index was discontinued in April 1956 due to certain shortcomings and was replaced by the revised index with 1951 as the base year covering 88 items, broadly categorised as mining &amp; quarrying (2), manufacturing (17) and electricity (1) compiled by CSO. The items in this index were classified according to the [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] (ISIC) 1948 of all economic activities.

The index was revised in July 1962 to the base year 1956 as per the recommendations of a [[working group]] constituted by the CSO for the purpose and it had covered 201 items, classified according to the Standard Industrial and Occupational Classification of All Economic Activities published by the CSO in 1962. The index with 1960 as the base year was based on regular monthly series for 312 items and annual series for 436 items. Hence, though the published index was based on regular monthly series for 312 items, weights had been assigned for 436 items with a view to using the same set of weights for the regular monthly index as well as the annual index covering the additional items. However, the mineral index prepared by the IBM excluded gold, salt, petroleum and natural gas.

The next revised series of [[Index (economics)|index numbers]] with 1970 as the base year, had taken into account of the structural changes occurred in industrial activity of the country since 1960 and this index was released in March 1975 covering 352 items comprising mining (61), manufacturing (290) and electricity (1). The working group (set up in 1978) under the Chairmanship of the then [[Director-general|Director General]] of CSO, decided to shift the base to 1980–81, to reflect the changes that had taken place in the industrial structure and to accommodate the items from small-scale sector.

A notable feature of the revised 1980 index number series was the inclusion of 18 items from the SSI sector, for which the office of the Development Commissioner of Small-Scale Industries (DCSSI) could ensure regular supply of data. The production data for the small-scale sector were included only from the month of July 1984 onwards; prior to this the production data from the directorate general of technical development (DGTD) for large and medium industries alone had been utilised. For the period April 1981 to June 1984 in respect of these 18 items, average base year (1980–81) production as obtained from DGTD was utilized. From July 1984 onwards, combined average base year production both for DGTD and DCSSI products was utilised. The weights for these items were based on ASI 1980–1981 results and no separate weights for DGTD and DCSSI items were allocated in the 1980–81 series.

The next revision of IIP with 1993–94 as the base year containing 543 items (with the addition of 3 items for mining sector and 188 for the [[Secondary sector of industry|manufacturing sector]]) has come into existence on 27 May 1998 and ever since, the quick estimates of IIP are being released as per the norms set out for the IMF’s SDDS2, with a time lag of six weeks from the reference month. These quick estimates for a given month are revised twice in the subsequent months. To retain the distinctive character and enable the collection of data, the source agencies proposed clubbing of 478 items of the manufacturing sector into 285 item groups and thus making a total of 287 item groups together with one each of electricity and mining &amp; quarrying. The revised series has followed the National Industrial Classification NIC-1987. Another important feature of the latest series is the inclusion of unorganised manufacturing sector (That is, the same 18 SSI products) along with organised sector for the first time in the weighting diagram.

Recent revision of IIP released by CSO with 2004–05 as the base year comprises 682 items. As per chief statistician T C A Anant, this index shall give a better picture of growth in various sectors of the economy, because it is broader and includes technologically advanced goods such as cell phones and iPods. The previous base year (1993–94) was not usable as the list contained an array of outdated items such as typewriters and tape recorders.

[[Weighted mean|Weighted arithmetic mean]] of quantity relatives with weights being allotted to various items in proportion to [[value added]] by manufacture in the base year by using [[Price_index#Paasche_and_Laspeyres_price_indices|Laspeyres' formula]]:

&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\sum (W_{i}R_{i})}{\sum W_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the index, Ri is the production relative of the ith item for the month in question and Wi is the weight allotted to it.

'''Iranians in Spain''' do not form a very large population, but they have a history going back for over a millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|López García|Planet Contreras|2002|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenesson"&gt;{{harvnb|Kenesson|1992|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a part of the [[Iranian diaspora]].

==Migration history==
[[Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi|Razi]] wrote in the 10th century that some Iranians had already settled in Spain, and [[Ibn Battuta]] later claimed the Iranians of Spain preferred to live in [[Granada]] because of its similarity to their homeland.&lt;ref name="Kenesson" /&gt; However, the impetus for modern Iranian immigration to Spain came largely from the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], as a result of which some Iranians went to Spain as political refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jamshid|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LopezGarcia"&gt;{{harvnb|López García|Planet Contreras|2002|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
A 1992 survey found that 31.7% worked in administrative jobs, 18.2% were professionals or technicians, 25.7% worked in trade, and another 11% worked in agriculture. The vast majority were 25-54 years of age, and only one-fifth were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|López García|Planet Contreras|2002|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is actually a relatively large proportion of women compared to other [[Islam in Spain|Muslim migrant communities in Spain]], which may be attributed to the fact that most Iranians in Spain are political, rather than economic migrants.&lt;ref name="LopezGarcia" /&gt;

'''John Theodore Herrmann''' was a writer in the 1920s and 1930s and is alleged to have introduced [[Whittaker Chambers]] to [[Alger Hiss]].

==Biography==
Herrmann was born in [[Lansing, Michigan]] in 1900. He lived in [[Paris]] in the 1920s, as part of its famous expatriate American writers' circle, when he met his first wife, [[Josephine Herbst]] in 1924. Herbst enjoyed more success as a writer than Herrmann; the couple lived a few years in rural [[Pennsylvania]], and were friends with [[Katherine Anne Porter]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[William Carlos Williams]], and others.

Herrmann's first novel, ''What Happens'', was original published in Paris by [[Robert McAlmon]]'s Contact Editions press.  Copies were seized by U.S. Customs upon their arrival in the United States on the charge of violating the 1922 Tariff Act, which banned the import of obscene materials from foreign countries.  Herrmann fought the charge in a jury trial in New York City in October 1927 but ultimately lost.  Despite supporters such as [[Genevieve Taggard]], [[H.L. Mencken]], and Katharine Anne Porter, the jury responded with a negative verdict, and the judge ordered the seized copies destroyed.

After returning to Michigan in 1924, Herrmann wrote a manuscript about anti-German backlash during World War I but was unable to get it published. Researcher Sara Kosiba found the manuscript in the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin and arranged to have it published in 2018 under the title "Foreign Born."

In 1932, Herrmann's short novel, "The Big Short Trip," tied with [[Thomas Wolfe]] for the [[Scribner's Magazine]] short novel prize.

In 1934, he went to work with [[Harold Ware]] and his organization Farm Research, Inc., which worked with the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]]. Herrmann soon was a part of the [[Harold Ware|Ware group]], a secret apparatus of the [[CPUSA]] and [[Comintern]] in Washington, D.C., which supplied classified information to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intelligence. From early 1934 until the summer of 1935, Herrmann was a paid courier for the CPUSA, delivering material emanating from the secret cells of sympathetic government employees being cultivated by Hal Ware to [[New York City]]. Herrmann also was the person who introduced [[Whittaker Chambers]] to [[Alger Hiss]].&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Langer, "The Secret Drawer," [http://www.thenation.com ''The Nation''], May 30, 1994, p. 756&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Langer, ''Josephine Herbst'' (Boston: Little, Brown, 1984) {{ISBN|978-0-446-32853-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Herrmann divorced Herbst and married Ruth Tate.  He served in the [[United States Coast Guard]], enlisting in [[New Orleans]], in [[World War II]]. The couple fled the country and went to [[Mexico]], when the FBI's Hiss-investigations began. He was placed under surveillance and questioned many times in Mexico by the [[FBI]].

Herrmann applied in March 1949 to [[Mexico City College]] (MCC) as a speech and drama major but attended for only the Fall 1950 and Winter 1951 quarters. A photograph in the November 16, 1950, issue of MCC's student paper, the ''Collegian'', shows Earl Sennett speaking to twelve students in his "Studio Stages" drama group; among them are Frank Jeffries, Alice Hartman, and John Herrmann. During his time at MCC, Herrmann was also, according to James W. Grauerholz's 2002 investigation, in an apartment located at 122 Monterrey hours before [[William Burroughs]] shot and killed his wife [[Joan Vollmer Burroughs]].

He died near the [[Pacific Ocean]] in April 1959, at the ''Hotel Navidad'', in Barra de Navidad, [[Jalisco]], Mexico from a heart attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6531">Although Konda brings to one’s mind hair, which is its modern meaning in the [[Sinhala language]], Konda in medieval times signified a group of [[Karava]] nobles in [[Sri Lanka]]. Old timers referred to them as Konda Karáva another clan of the Karava similar to  the [[Sun Dynasty|Suriya]] clans Kurukulasuriya, Warnakulasuriya, Mihindukulasuriya, Bharathakulasuriya, Manukulasuriya, Arasakulasuriya and [[Kón Karáva]]s. Konda came to mean hair in [[Sri Lanka]] only after the 15th century [[Kotte]] period. Prior to that hair was referred to in the Sinhala language as kes, varalasa, dhammilla or muhulasa.

The name Konda has been preserved to date in Sri Lankan [[Karava]] family names such as Vira Konda Árachchige, Vadana Konda Árachchige, [[Patabendige|Vira Konda Patabendige]] and other such names. The Kurukula Charithaya (part I 235) reproduces a copper sannasa given by King Vijayabahu, probably Vijayabahu VI, to a Konda Perumal  at a time when Perumal denoted a prince. It also lists the Konda Kaurava family names: Konda Perumal Árachchigé from [[Koggala airport|Koggala]] and Kuru Vira Kaundan, Periya Kondan, Sina Kondan, Sella Kondan, Vira Kondan, Kuru VIra Kondan, Kondagé, Vira Kondagé, Maha Kondagé, Punchi Kondagé and Sella Kondagé from other parts of Sri Lanka.
The prevalence of the name Konda in various parts of South India suggests that a significant group of Kondas of considerable importance lived in mediaeval [[South India]]. Similar to the other South Indian [[Kshatriya]] clans the Kondas too may have claimed descent ultimately from the [[Mahabharata]] [[Kauravas]].

The name Konda had been widely used in the Pandya kingdom and the Sri Lankan chronicle [[Mahavamsa]] refers to Punkonda, Khuddakancha Kunda and Kanga Konda in connection with the 12th century [[Pandyan]] invasion by the General of Parákramabáhu the Great  (Mahavamsa 76.94, 76.140, 76.171 &amp; 76.184 ). [[Parantaka I]], the [[Chola]] King who defeated the joint Sri Lankan and Pandyan armies had assumed the victory title Dorai Eelam Kondai on that account and therefore it appears that Kondai meant conqueror.

[[Image:India Andhra Pradesh locator map (1956-2014).svg|thumb|right|Andhra Region]]

[[Aditya I|Chola Adithya]]’s victory over Kondai Mandalam shifted the balance of power between the Pallavas and Cholas and was the beginning of the Chola empire. The Pallavas and Cholas were Kshatriyas connected by intermarriage and both dynasties claimed connections to the Mahabharata kings. Konda  has also been used in place names such as [[Nagarjunakonda]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and  an inscription of  the Sri Lankan King Sahasamalla states that he had spent two years in a place called Gangaikondapattana in India (EZ II 225). And, two South Indian inscriptions by a Pandyan ruler named Kónerimel Kondán say that he had a camp at Gangakondapattana (Annual report on South Indian Epigraphy 125 ). The name Gangai in the above two inscriptions from the [[Ramnad]] district of India;  Chodaganga of the Mahavansa account of Sri Lanka’s Pandya invasion referred to above; the word Ganga in the names of Sri Lankan Rulers Chodaganga and Gangavasa Kalyanavati etc. point to the highly interconnected nature of mediaeval royal families in India and Sri Lanka.

The Kudumirissa inscription of Sri Lanka refers to a clan known as  Kaundinya gothra and the Galgané copper sannasa refers to Parákramabáhu sámi’s ancestry as “ Sakala dig vijayavaliya ransa Konda Parákramabáhu piriven sámi". Ulakkonda is a village in Gangapalatha, Udunuvara and Muthukeliyáva a hilly site in Ulakkonda, far removed from the pearl producing coast, brings to  mind the mutukuda (pearl umbrellas) and other insignia of the Karavas. Maluvawatta lies to the east of Ulakkonda and nearby is an ancient Bo tree with a legend that it was planted by a Brahmin in ancient times. As such Ulakkonda may well have been an abode of Konda nobles in the past (Sahithya 72).

Two Kaurálas in a village named Kondagama in Tumpané, have signed a deed in AD 1761 as witnesses (Gazetteer I 468), further documenting the Konda and Karáva linkage of the past. The Pattini cult in Sri Lankan history is associated with the Karavas brought back on king [[Gajabahu I]]’s  Indian invasion,  and as expected an old Pattini Devale is still there in the village known as Kondadeniya (Gazetteer II 528). The Rajavaliya narrates that a King named Edirimanasuriya ruled from a city in Sri Lanka known as Mundakondapola (Rajavaliya 234). Mundakondapola is situated 8 miles from [[Kurunegala]] on the [[Puttlam]] road, in the Hatara Korale, the old ‘Kuru country’ (parana Kuru Rata) of the Karavas.

An old Sinhala verse which sings the praise of a king from Murakondaya who was deified as Irual Bandára says that he was from the Suryawansa, the Kshatriya Solar dynasty (Ceylon the Portuguese Era I 142). A contemporary of this Edirimanasuriya was the Karava King of [[Jaffna Kingdom|Jaffna]], [[Ethirimanasingham]] (AD 1592 - 1615). Ethirimanasingham was a king of the [[Singhe Dynasty]] of Jaffna, from which the Karava families of Tisseveerasinghe, Puvirajasinghe, Puvimanasinghe and Philip descend (Singhe Dynasty of Jaffnapattanam 19). The [[Karava]] [[Patangatim]] Domingo Corea also known as Edirimanasuriya was appointed by king Dharmapala in the 16th century to rule this region. Therefore, King Edirimanasuriya of Mundakondapola too appears to have been a regional Karava King, a Konda Karáva, possibly from the Kshatriya Keerawella family of the Hatara Korale.

As such it appears that Konda in mediaeval India and Sri Lanka was a branch of  the interrelated South Indian Kshatriya families which were spread in the [[Chola]], [[Pandya]] and [[Pallava]] kingdoms and [[Sri Lanka]]. Over the centuries the Kondas have virtually been forgotten and traces of the Kondas remain only in a few place names and in Karáva family names.

'''Lezgins''' ({{lang-lez|лезгияр}}, ''lezgiyar'', [[Russian language|Russian]]: лезгины, ''lezginy''; Azerbaijani: "Ləzgilər"; also called ''Lezgins'', ''Lezgi'', ''Lezgis'', ''Lezgs'', ''Lezgin'') are a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] ethnic group native predominantly to southern [[Dagestan]] and northeastern [[Azerbaijan]] and who speak the [[Lezgian language]].

== Ethnonym ==
[[File:Lezgian people Leki.jpg|thumb|250px|Lezgian people]]
The origin of the ethnonym ''Lezgin'' requires further research. Nevertheless, most researchers attribute the derivation of ''Lezgi'' to be from the ancient ''Legi'' and early medieval ''Lakzi''.

Modern-day Lezgins speak [[Northeast Caucasian languages]] that have been spoken in the region before the introduction of [[Indo-European languages]]. They are closely related, both culturally and linguistically, to the [[Aghuls]] of southern [[Dagestan]] and, somewhat more distantly, to the [[Tsakhurs]], [[Rutuls]], and [[Tabasarans]] (the northern neighbors of the Lezgins). Also related, albeit more distantly, are the numerically small [[Jek people|Jek]], [[Kryts people|Kryts]], [[Laks (Caucasus)|Laks]], [[Shahdagh people|Shahdagh]], [[Budukh people|Budukh]], and [[Khinalug people|Khinalug]] peoples of northern [[Azerbaijan]]. These groups, together with the Lezgins, form the Samur branch of the indigenous [[Lezgic]] peoples.

Lezgins are believed to descend partly from people who inhabited the region of southern [[Dagestan]] in the Bronze Age. However, there is some DNA evidence of significant admixture during the last 4,000 years with a Central Asian population, as shown by genetic links to populations throughout Europe and Asia, with notable similarities to the [[Burusho people]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/02/14/science/100000002710810.mobile.html?_r=0 ''New York Times'', 2014, "Genetic Mixing" (February 13; interactive).] (Access: October 15 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Russian Revolution]], the Lezgins did not have a common self-designation as an ethnic group. They referred to themselves by village, region, religion, clan, or free society. Before the revolution, the Lezgins were called "Kyurintsy", "Akhtintsy", or "Lezgintsy" by the [[Russians]]. The ethnonym "Lezgin" itself is quite problematic. Prior to the Soviet period, the term "Lezgin" was used in different contexts. At times, it referred only to the people known today as Lezgins. At others, it referred variously to all of the peoples of southern Daghestan (Lezgin, [[Aghul people|Aghul]], [[Rutul people|Rutul]], [[Tabasaran people|Tabasaran]], and [[Tsakhur people|Tsakhur]]); all of the peoples of southern Daghestan and northern Azerbaijan ([[Kryts people|Kryts]] [[Jek people|Jek]], [[Khinalug people|Khinalug]], [[Budukh people|Budukh]], [[Shahdagh people|Shahdagh]]); all [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Nakh-Daghestani peoples]]; or all of the indigenous [[Muslim]] peoples of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian peoples]] ([[Caucasian Avars]], [[Dargwa people|Dargwa]], [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Laks]], [[Chechen people|Chechens]], and [[Ingush people|Ingush]]). In reading pre-Revolutionary works, one must be aware of these different possible meanings and the scope of the ethnonym "Lezgin".

==History==
[[File:Khanates.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[History of Iran|Iranian-ruled]] administrative division of the [[Derbent khanate]] included many of the Lezgins until its occupation and dissolution by the [[Imperial Russia|Russians]] as a result of the [[Russo-Persian Wars]] of the 19th century.]]
In the 4th century BC, the numerous tribes speaking [[Lezgic languages]] united in a union of 26 tribes, formed in the Eastern Caucasus state of [[Caucasian Albania]], which itself was incorporated in the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 513 BC.&lt;ref name="Chaumont"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Jacobs, "ACHAEMENID RULE IN Caucasus" in ''Encyclopædia Iranica''. January 9, 2006. Excerpt: "Achaemenid rule in the Caucasus region was established, at the latest, in the course of the Scythian campaign of [[Darius I]] in 513–512 BC. The Persian domination of the cis-Caucasian area (the northern side of the range) was brief, and archeological findings indicate that the Great Caucasus formed the northern border of the empire during most, if not all, of the Achaemenid period after Darius"&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of initially Persian but also Parthian rule Caucasian Albania was divided into several areas - Lakzi, Shirvan, etc.

The Lezgic speaking tribes participated in the [[battle of Gaugamela]] under the Persian banner against the invading Alexander the Great.&lt;ref name="Chaumont"&gt;Chaumont, M. L. [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a022.html  Albania] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310231608/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a022.html |date=2007-03-10}}.Encyclopaedia Iranica.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] rule, Iranian political and cultural influence increased in the whole region of their Caucasian Albanian province, therefore including where the Lezgic speaking tribes lived.&lt;ref name="ToumanoffIranica"&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]]. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arsacids-index The Arsacids]. ''Encyclopædia Iranica''. excerpt:"Whatever the sporadic suzerainty of Rome, the country was now a part—together with Iberia (East Georgia) and (Caucasian) Albania, where other Arsacid branched reigned—of a pan-Arsacid family federation. Culturally, the predominance of Hellenism, as under the Artaxiads, was now followed by a predominance of "Iranianism," and, symptomatically, instead of Greek, as before, Parthian became the language of the educated"&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the sporadic suzerainty of Rome of the region due to their wars with the Parthians, the country was now a part—together with Iberia (East Georgia) and (Caucasian) Albania, where other Arsacid branches reigned—of a [[Arsacid dynasty of Caucasian Albania|pan-Arsacid]] family federation.&lt;ref name="ToumanoffIranica"/&gt; Culturally, the predominance of Hellenism, as under the Artaxiads, was now followed by again a predominance of "Iranianism", and, symptomatically, instead of Greek, as before, [[Parthian language|Parthian]] became the language of the educated of the region.&lt;ref name="ToumanoffIranica"/&gt;  An incursion in this era was made by the [[Alans]] who between 134 and 136 attacked regions including where Lezgic tribes lived, but [[Vologases III of Parthia|Vologases]] persuaded them to withdraw, probably by paying them.

In 252–253, rule over the Lezgic tribes changed from Parthian to [[Sassanid]] Persian. Caucasian Albania became a [[vassal state]],&lt;ref&gt;Yarshater, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; now of the Sassanids, but retained its monarchy; the Albanian king had no real power and most civil, religious, and military authority lay with the Sassanid [[marzban]] (military governor) of the territory.&lt;ref name="Chaumont2"&gt;Nevertheless, "despite being one of the chief vassals of Sasanian ''[[Shahanshah]]'', the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sassanid [[marzban]] (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Empire obtained control over some of the southernmost Lezgin regions for a few years around 300 AD, but then the Sassanid Persians regained control and subsequently dominated the area for centuries until the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab invasions]].

Although Lezgins were first introduced to [[Islam]] perhaps as early as the 8th century, the Lezgins remained primarily animist until the 15th century, when [[Muslim]] influence became stronger, with [[Persian people|Persian]] traders coming in from the south, and the [[Golden Horde]] increasingly pressing from the north. In the early 16th century, the Persian [[Safavid Empire|Safavids]] consolidated their control over large parts of Dagestan for centuries onwards. As a result of the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590]], the Ottomans managed to wrest control of the region for a short period of time, until it was regained by the Safavids under king [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (r. 1588-1629).

A notable Lezgin from the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Iranian]] era was [[Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani]], who served as Safavid ''[[List of Safavid Viziers|grand vizier]]'' from 1716 to 1720, during the reign of king (''[[shah]]'') [[Sultan Husayn]] (1694–1722). By the early course of the 18th century, the Safavid Empire was in a state of heavy decline. In 1721, the Lezgins [[Sack of Shamakhi (1721)|sacked and looted]] the city of [[Shamakhi]], the provincial capital of [[Safavid Shirvan|Shirvan]]. The Lak Kazi Kumukh Khanate controlled a part of the Lezgins for a time in the 18th century after the disintegration of the [[Safavid Empire]]

In the first half of the 18th century, [[Afsharid dynasty|Persia]] was able to restore its full authority throughout the entire Caucasus under [[Nader Shah]]. After the death of Nader, he created the state into divided several smaller khanates. Some Lezgins were part of the [[Kuba Khanate]] in what is now Azerbaijan, while others fell under the jurisdiction of the [[Derbent Khanate]]. The main part of Lezgins united in "free society" (Magalim) ([[Akhtynsky District|Akhty para]], Alti-para, Kure, [[Dokuzparinsky District|Dokuz-para]]).

[[File:Globus illustrierte Zeitschrift für Länder und Völkerkunde, Volume 14 P. 138.jpg|thumb|Lezgins in the 1860s]]
In 1813, as a result of the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], the Russians gained control over southern Dagestan and most of what is the contemporary Azerbaijan Republic.&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=KTq2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA728&amp;dq=russo+persian+war+1804-1813&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QnOXVJXpCcz7UPevhPAK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=russo%20persian%20war%201804-1813&amp;f=false|title=Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond ...|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1828 [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and other area's where the Lezgins lived and removed Iran from the military equation.&lt;ref&gt;Aksan, Virginia. (2014). ''Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870: An Empire Besieged'' page 463. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1317884033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"/&gt; The Russian administration subsequently created the Kiurin Khanate, later to become the Kiurin district.
Many Lezgins in [[Dagestan]], however, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Great Caucasian War]] that started roughly during the same time the Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century were happening, and fought against the Russians alongside the [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avar]] [[Imam Shamil]], who for 25 years (1834–1859) defied Russian rule. It was not until after his defeat in 1859 that the Russians consolidated their rule over Dagestan and the Lezgins.

In 1930, Sheikh Mohammed Effendi Shtulskim organized an uprising against Soviet rule, which was suppressed after several months. In the 20th century, attempts were made to create a republic of Lezgistan (independent or as an autonomous region).

Some Lezgins were deported to Central Asia in the 1940s by Stalin's regime.

==Ethnonym==
Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], "Lezgin" was a term applied to all ethnic groups inhabiting the present-day Russian [[Republic of Dagestan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Ethnohistorical dictionary of the Russian and Soviet empires |last=Olson |first=James Stuart |authorlink= |author2=Pappas, Nicholas Charles |year=1994 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location= |isbn=0-313-27497-5 |page=438 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CquTz6ps5YgC&amp;pg=PA438 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the term was used more broadly for all ethnic groups speaking non-[[Nakh languages|Nakh]] [[Northeast Caucasian languages]], including [[Caucasian Avars]], [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Laks]], and many others (although the [[Vainakh peoples]], who were Northeast Caucasian language speakers were referred to as "Circassians").

== Historical concept ==
While ancient Greek historians, including Herodotus, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder, referred to ''Legoi'' people who inhabited [[Caucasian Albania]], Arab historians of the 9th and 10th centuries mention the kingdom of Lakz in present-day southern Dagestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A grammar of Lezgian |last=Haspelmath |first=Martin |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location= |isbn=3-11-013735-6 |page=17 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBC6fSMh6wYC&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Masoudi referred to inhabitants of this area as Lakzams (Lezgins),&lt;ref&gt;Yakut, IV, 364. According to al-Masoudi (Murudzh, II, 5)&lt;/ref&gt; who defended [[Shirvanshah|Shirvan]] against invaders from the north.&lt;ref&gt;VFMinorsky. History of Shirvan. M. 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The Lezgin ethnic group probably resulted from a merger of the Akhty, the Alty and Dokus Para federations, and some clans from among the Rutuls.

== Geography ==
[[File:Гербер Каспий 1728.jpg|250px|thumb|Lezgistan from map of the Caucasus by Johann Gustav Gaerber (1728)]]
The Lezgins inhabit a compact territory that straddles the border area of southern Daghestan and northern Azerbaijan. It lies, for the most part, in the southeastern portion of Daghestan in ([[Akhtynsky District]], [[Dokuzparinsky District]], [[Suleyman-Stalsky District]], [[Kurakhsky District]], [[Magaramkentsky District]], [[Khivsky District]], [[Derbentsky District]] and [[Rutulsky District]]) and contiguous northeastern [[Azerbaijan]] (in [[Quba Rayon|Kuba]], [[Qusar District|Qusar]], [[Qakh Rayon|Qakh]], [[Khachmaz Rayon|Khachmaz]], [[Oguz Rayon|Oguz]], [[Qabala Rayon|Qabala]], [[Shaki Rayon|Nukha]], and [[Ismailli Rayon|Ismailli]] districts).

The Lezgin territories are divided into two physiographic zones: a region of high, rugged mountains and the piedmont (foothills). Most of the Lezgin territory is in the mountainous zone, where a number of peaks (like Baba Dagh) reach over 3,500 meters in elevation. There are deep and isolated canyons and gorges formed by the tributaries of the [[Samur River|Samur]] and Gulgeri Chai rivers. In the mountainous zones the summers are very hot and dry, with drought conditions a constant threat. There are few trees in this region aside from those in the deep canyons and along the streams themselves. Drought-resistant shrubs and weeds dominate the natural flora. The winters here are frequently windy and brutally cold. In this zone the Lezgins engaged primarily in animal husbandry (mostly sheep and goats) and in craft industries.

In the extreme east of the Lezgin territory, where the mountains give way to the narrow coastal plain of the [[Caspian Sea]], and to the far south, in Azerbaijan, are the foothills. This region has relatively mild, very dry winters and hot, dry summers. Trees are few here also. In this region animal husbandry and artisanry were supplemented by some agriculture (along the alluvial deposits near the rivers).

==Culture==
The material culture significantly influence Azerbaijan, especially Lezgins living in Azerbaijan. The folk songs a central place belongs to the lyrical songs of the dance character with vivid instrumental sections; instrumental music itself is full melizmatika. Folk art is also presented dances, among which, in particular, the famous "Lezginka", common among the peoples of the Caucasus. There are more calm male dance Zarb makam as well as slow-flowing dances Akhty tea Perizat Khanum Useynel, Bahtavar.

First Lezgin theater originated in 1906 in the village of Akhty. In 1935, based on the semi-professional team was created Lezgin State Music and Drama Theatre named after S. Stalsky. In 1998, the State Lezgin theater was opened in Azerbaijan, located in Qusar.

===Languages===
{{Main article|Lezgian language}}
The [[Lezgian language]] belongs to the [[Lezgic languages|Lezgic branch]] of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language family]] (with [[Aghul language|Aghul]], [[Rutul language|Rutul]], [[Tsakhur language|Tsakhur]], [[Tabasaran language|Tabasaran]], [[Budukh language|Budukh]], [[Khinalug language|Khinalug]], [[Jek language|Jek]], Khaput, [[Kryts language|Kryts]], and [[Udi language|Udi]]).

The Lezgian language has three closely related (mutually intelligible) dialects: Kurin (also referred to as Gunei or Kurakh), Akhti, and Kuba. The Kurin dialect is the most widespread of the three and is spoken throughout most of the Lezgin territories in Daghestan, including the town of Kurakh, which, historically, was the most important cultural, political, and economic center in the Lezgin territory in Daghestan and is the former seat of the khanate of Kurin. The Akhti dialect is spoken in southeastern Daghestan. The [[Quba Rayon|Kuba]] dialect, the most Turkicized of the three, is widespread among the Lezgins of northern [[Azerbaijan]] (named for the town of Kuba, the cultural and economical focus of the region).

===Religions===
Today, the Lezgins are predominantly [[Sunni Muslim]]s, with a [[Shia]] minority living in Miskindja village in [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hahn|first1=Gordon M.|title=Russia's Islamic Threat|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300120776|pages=100, 217}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main type of settlement in Lezghins - the village ("hur"). With regard to social groups Lezgin village, it is divided into quarters. Distributed large geographically-related settlement (one quarter - one tukhum). Each village had a mosque, rural area - Kim, a gathering of residents (male part) at the village assembly to address the most important issues of public life of the village.

===Dance===
{{Main article|Lezgian dance}}
[[File:Lezgian people, dancing lezginka in Akhti village in Dagestanskaya Oblast. Beginingth of XX century.jpg|thumb|Lezgian people, dancing lezginka in Akhti village, 1900]]
Lezgian dance — Lezgi solo male and pair dance, common among many peoples of the Caucasus.
The dance uses a 2 image. The man moves in the way "eagle", alternates between a slow and rapid pace. The most spectacular movements are dance movements of men, when he is on his toes, throwing his hands in different directions. The woman moves in the form of "Swan", bewitching graceful posture and smooth hand movements. The woman increases the tempo of his dance after the man. Not surprisingly, the dance, common among all the Caucasian peoples, was named in accordance with the ancient totem of the Lezgins: the word "Lek" ({{lang-lez| лекь}}) means eagle.

==Population==
Lezgins live mainly in the Republic of [[Azerbaijan]] and in the [[Russian Federation]] (Dagestan). The total population is believed to be around 700,000, with 474,000 living in Russia. In Azerbaijan, the government census counts 180,300.&lt;ref name=azeristats&gt;[http://www.azstat.org/statinfo/demoqraphic/en/1_12en.xls The State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Population by ethnic groups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103234751/http://www.azstat.org/statinfo/demoqraphic/en/1_12en.xls |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lezgin national organizations mention 600,000 to 900,000, the disparity being that many Lezgins claim Azeri nationality to escape job and education discrimination in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;Minahan, p. 1084. "Lezgin national organizations estimate the actual Lezgin population in Azerbaijan at between 600,000 and 900,000, much higher than the official estimates. The disparity arises from the number of ethnic Lezgins registered as ethnic Azeris during the soviet period and continue to claim Azeri nationality to escape job and education discrimination in Azerbaijan."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the assimilationist policy of the Azeri government, the Lezgin population is undoubtedly greater than it appears.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Bruce Ware]], Enver Kisriew, E.F. Kisriew, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uND4Ya6nOkUC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=lezgins+population+official&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=lezgins%20population%20official&amp;f=false "Dagestan: Russian hegemony and Islamic resistance in the North Caucasus"] ,M.E. Sharpe, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Svante Cornell]] adds;

{{blockquote|Whereas officially the number of Lezgins registered as such in Azerbaijan is around 180,000, the Lezgins claim that the number of Lezgins registered as Azerbaijan is many times higher than this figure, some accounts showing over 700,000 Lezgins in Azerbaijan. These figures are denied by the Azerbaijani government, but in private many Azeris acknowledge the fact that the Lezgins—and for that matter the [[Talysh people|Talysh]] or the [[Kurds in Azerbaijan|Kurdish]]—population is far higher than the official figures.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornell|first1=Svante|title=Small Nations and Great Powers: A Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict in the Caucasus|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1135796693|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lezgins also live in [[Central Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;Yo'av Karny,"Highlanders: A Journey to the Caucasus in Quest of Memory",Macmillan, 2001. pp 112:"The last 1989 all Soviet census recorded 204,400 Lezgins in Daghestan and 171,395 Lezgins in Azerbaijan.  Both figures reflected a relative, almost identical decline
(5 percent) in Lezgin numbers in both "homelands".  Roughly 65,000 Lezgins were counted in other parts of the Soviet Union, mostly Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan"&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to [[Stalin]]'s deportation policies.

===Situation in Azerbaijan===
Lezgins are, "generally speaking", well integrated into the society of Azerbaijan. Mixed marriages are furthermore common. Lastly, Lezgins in Azerbaijan have a better level of education compared to their kin in Dagestan.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornell|first1=Svante|title=Small Nations and Great Powers: A Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict in the Caucasus|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1135796693|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 a Lezgin organization named Sadval was established to promote Lezgin rights. Sadval campaigned for the redrawing of the Russian–Azerbaijani border to allow for the creation of a single Lezgin state encompassing areas in [[Russia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] where Lezgins were compactly settled. In Azerbaijan a more moderate organization called Samur was formed, advocating more cultural autonomy for Lezgins in Azerbaijan.

Lezgins traditionally suffered from unemployment and a shortage of land. A major consequence of the outbreak of the war in [[First Chechen War|Chechnya]] in 1994 was the closure of the border between Russia and Azerbaijan: as a result the Lezgins were for the first time in their history separated by an international border restricting their movement.

The high tide of Lezgin mobilization in Azerbaijan appeared to have passed towards the end of the 1990s. Sadval was banned by the Azerbaijani authorities after official allegations that it was involved in a bombing of the [[1994 Baku Metro bombings|Baku underground]]. The end of the Karabakh war, and Lezgin resistance to forced conscription, deprived the movement of a key issue on which to mobilize. In 1998 Sadval split into ‘moderate’ and ‘radical’ wings, following which it appeared to lose much of its popularity on both sides of the Russian–Azerbaijani border.

However, Azerbaijani–Lezgin relations continued to be complicated by claims that Islamic fundamentalism enjoyed disproportionate popularity among Lezgins. In July 2000 Azerbaijani security forces arrested members of Lezgin and [[Caucasian Avar|Avar]] ethnicity of a group named the Warriors of Islam, which allegedly was planning an insurgency against the Azerbaijani state.

Lezgins expressed concern over underrepresentation in the Azerbaijani Parliament (Milli Meclis) after a shift away from proportional representation in the parliamentary elections of November 2005. Lezgins had been represented by two members of parliament in the previous parliament, but are now represented by only one.

Lezgin is taught as a foreign language in areas where many Lezgins are settled, but teaching resources are scarce. Lezgin textbooks come from Russia and are not adapted to local conditions. Although Lezgin newspapers are available, Lezgins have also expressed concern over the disappearance of their rich oral tradition. The only Lezgin television broadcasting available in Azerbaijan is that received over the border from Russia.

In March 2006 Azerbaijani media reported that Sadval had formed an 'underground' terrorist unit carrying out operations in Dagestan. Security forces across the border in Dagestan in Russia, responded sceptically to these reports.

=== Situation in Dagestan ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
According to reports Lezgins in Dagestan suffer disproportionately from unemployment, with unemployment rates in Lezgin-populated areas of southern Dagestan twice the republican average of 32 per cent. This may be one contributory factor to renewed calls from within the Sadval movement in January 2006 for a redrawing of the Russian-Azerbaijani border to incorporate Lezgin-populated areas of southern Dagestan within Azerbaijan.

In March 1999 another organization, the [[Federal Lezgin National Cultural Autonomy]], was established as an extraterritorial movement advocating cultural autonomy for Lezgins.

'''Lucienne Bloch''' (January 5, 1909&amp;nbsp;– March 13, 1999) was a Switzerland-born American artist.  She was best known for her [[murals]] and for her association with the Mexican artist [[Diego Rivera]], for whom she produced the only existing photographs of Rivera's mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', painted in 1933 and destroyed in January 1934 at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas, Jr.|first1=Robert McG.|authorlink1=Robert McG.

==Career==

===Background===

Bloch was born in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the youngest child of composer and photographer [[Ernest Bloch]].

A multi-talented artist, Lucienne attended the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris at 14, apprenticing with sculptor [[Antoine Bourdelle]] and painter [[Andre Lhote]]. Her close friend [[Beniamino Bufano]] also influenced her sculpture.

In 1917, the Bloch family emigrated to America.

===With Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo===

In 1929, she pioneered the design of glass sculpture for the [[Royal Leerdam Crystal]] Glass Factory in the Netherlands. When [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] saw her glass works and spoke with her in New York, he invited her to teach at his architectural school, [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin East]], where she worked with artist and muralist [[Santiago Martínez Delgado]] and other Taliesin fellows.

Then, in 1931, Bloch had met and began her apprenticeship with [[Diego Rivera]] on his frescoes in New York (1931, 1933) and Detroit (1932). She also formed a close friendship with Rivera's wife [[Frida Kahlo]], and they became each other's companion and confidant. In 1932 she accompanied Kahlo to Mexico when Kahlo's mother became ill. She was also with Kahlo in Detroit when Kahlo had her miscarriage.

[[Image:Lucienne Bloch and Stephen Pope Dimitroff (1985).jpg|thumb|right|Lucienne Bloch and Stephen Pope Dimitroff - 1985 [[Gualala, California|Gualala]]. (photo: [[Alexander Kaloian]])]]
A prolific photographer, Bloch contributed many photographs of Rivera and Kahlo to biographical works about them. She took the only existing photographs of Rivera's (controversially) destroyed mural, ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', in [[Rockefeller Center]] Plaza in [[New York City]]. She created five portfolios of photographs of Rivera and Kahlo, including photos of Kahlo's paintings in progress, and the artists in [[New York City]], [[Detroit]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="luciennebloch.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.luciennebloch.com/index.html|title = Lucienne Bloch {{!}} Old Stage Studios|website = www.luciennebloch.com|access-date = 2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apprentices there were:  Bloch, [[Stephen Pope Dimitroff]], [[Lou Block]], [[Arthur Niendorf]], [[Seymour Fogel]], [[Hideo Noda]], and [[Antonio Sanchez Flores]].

===With Stephen Pope Dimitroff===

On September 5, 1935, Lucienne married [[Stephen Pope Dimitroff]], one of Rivera's chief plasterers. Together they created [[fresco]] murals all over the United States.

From 1935 to 1939, Bloch was employed by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]/[[Federal Arts Project|FAP]] (Works Progress Administration/Federal Arts Project). As a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]/[[Federal Art Project|FAP]] artist, she completed murals for public buildings, including the House of Detention for Women in [[New York City]],  and the [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky]] post office.&lt;ref name="luciennebloch.com"/&gt; She also worked free-lance as a photographer for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.  For ''Life'' she record the desperate conditions of autoworkers during labor strikes and protests that occurred throughout the U.S. during the formation of automobile worker unions.

She and Dimitroff created nearly 50 murals across the United States for religious institutions, schools, hospitals, and businesses. Dimitroff died in 1996 on their farm in Gualala, California.

==Works==

===Art===

Bloch worked in many types of media: photography, fresco, woodblock cuts, lithographs, mosaics, egg tempera, watercolor, wood and glass sculpture, terra cotta, portraits in ink, gesso, and oil.

===Illustrated books===

She also illustrated numerous children's books, of which the Library of Congress lists:
* ''I Want to Fly'' by [[Anita Brenner]], (1943)
* ''Willie's Walk to Grandmama'', by [[Margaret Wise Brown]] and [[Rockbridge Campbell]] (1944)
* ''Keep Singing, Keep Humming: A Collection of Play and Story Songs'', by [[Margaret Bradford Boni]] (1946)
* ''Smart Little Boy and His Smart Little Kitty'', by [[Louise Woodcock]]'' (1947)
* ''Is it Hard?  Is it Easy?'' by [[Mary McBurney Green]] (1948)
* ''Everybody Eats'' by [[Mary McBurney Green]] (1950)
* ''Sandpipers'', [[Edith Thacher Hurd]] (1961)
* ''Starfish'', [[Edith Thacher Hurd]] (1962)

==Private life==

The '''Luo''' (also called '''Joluo''' or '''Jonagi'''/'''Onagi''', singular '''Jaluo''', '''Jaonagi''' or '''Joramogi'''/'''Nyikwaramogi''', meaning "Ramogi's heirs") are an ethnic group in western [[Kenya]], northern [[Uganda]], and in [[Mara Region]] in northern [[Tanzania]]. They are part of a larger group of ethno-linguistically related [[Luo peoples]] who inhabit an area ranging from [[South Sudan]], South-Western [[Ethiopia]], Northern and Eastern [[Uganda]], South-Western [[Kenya]] and North-Eastern [[Tanzania]].

The Luo are the fourth largest ethnic group (11%) in Kenya, after the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] (18%), the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] (14%) and the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] (12%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://statistics.knbs.or.ke/nada/index.php/catalog/55/study-description|title=2009 Kenya Population and Housing Census (2009 KPHC)|last=|first=|date=|website=|pages=397 and 398|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328232429/http://statistics.knbs.or.ke/nada/index.php/catalog/55/study-description|archive-date=2018-03-28|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Luo and the Kikuyu inherited the bulk of political power in the first years following Kenya's independence in 1963. The Luo population in Kenya was estimated to be 2,185,000 in 1994 and 3.4 million in 2010 according to Government census. However the figure was disputed by many Luos as not scientific since a significant portion of people previously considered as Luo were now counted as Suba people (of [[Suba people (Kenya)|Kenya]] and [[Suba people (Tanzania)|Tanzania]]). The [[Suba people (Kenya)|Subas]] eventually numbered 300,000 but most are completely assimilated Luos by culture, name, language and political orientation and have more or less the same outlook of life. This is a result of heavy intermarriage and interaction. The Luos also feel that their overall population has always been downscaled by successive Kenyan regime census in an attempt to mute the strong Luo political voice. Sample census conducted by experts estimate the total Kenyan Luo population to be currently at around 5 million. The '''Tanzanian''' Luo population was estimated at 1.1 million in 2001 and 1.9 million in 2010.&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=luo|title = Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth Edition|last = Gordon, Jr.|first = Raymond G.

The main Luo livelihoods are [[fishing]], farming and pastoral herding.  Outside [[Luoland]], the Luo comprise a significant fraction of East Africa's intellectual and skilled labour force in various professions. Others members work in eastern Africa as tenant fishermen, small-scale farmers, and urban workers.

They speak the [[Luo language|Dholuo language]], which belongs to the [[Western Nilotic]] branch of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] language family spoken by other Luo-speaking peoples, such as the [[Langi people|Lango]], [[Acholi]], [[Adhola people|Adhola]] and [[Alur people|Alur]] (all of Uganda and parts of South Sudan and Eastern Congo). The four waves of Luo migration were chiefly from the four Luo-speaking groups (Lwoo), especially Acholi and Padhola. [[Dholuo]], spoken in Kenya, is considered to be proper and standard Luo because it contains elements from all other Lwoo languages. It is estimated that Dholuo has 90% lexical similarity with Lep Alur ([[Alur language]]); 83% with Lep Achol ([[Acholi language]]); 81% with [[Lango language]], 93% with Dhopadhola (Padhola language), 74%  with [[Anuak language|Anuak]], and 69% with Jurchol ([[Luwo]]) and Dhi-Pari (Pari).

The Luo are the originators of a number of music styles, such as [[Benga music|Benga]], [[Ohangla music|Ohangla]], [[Dodo music|Dodo]], [[Nyatiti]], [[Orutu]] and [[Otenga]].

==History==
{{Main|Luo peoples}}

The Luo of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]], even though related to other Luo groups linguistically, are classified as the only 'river lake Nilotes' having migrated and lived along the [[Nile river]]. They are indigenous to the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] and have been for thousands of years. Their cradle of civilization was the city-state of [[Napata]] or present-day [[Karima, Sudan]] in the 'Koch' kingdom ([[Kingdom of Kush|Kush kingdom]]).
Arguably the first inhabitants of Sudan, they entered Kenya and Tanzania via [[Uganda]] from the Bahr al Gazzal or [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el-Ghazal]] region. The [[Luo peoples|Luo]] were the founders of the [[Shilluk Kingdom|Shilluk kingdom]] and descendants of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians who were directly linked to the Kingdom of Shilluk. In the land of Shilluk, the Luo clans of Kenya and Tanzania were called 'Ororo', while among the Dinka and Nuer they were called 'Liel'.  

===Pre-colonial times===
The present-day Kenya Luo traditionally consist of 27 tribes, each in turn composed of various clans and sub-clans&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = Ogot, Bethwell A.| title = History of the Southern Luo: Volume I, Migration and Settlement, (Series: Peoples of East Africa)|publisher = [[East African Publishing House]], Nairobi|year = 1967|page = assim}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Jo-" indicates "people of").

===Colonial times===
Early [[British Empire|British]] contact with the Luo was indirect and sporadic. Relations intensified only when the completion of the [[Uganda Railway]] had confirmed British intentions and largely removed the need for local alliances. In 1896 a [[punitive expedition]] was mounted in support of the Wanga ruler [[Rulers of Wanga|Mumia]] in Ugenya against the Umira Kager clan led by [[Gero (Luo leader)|Gero]]. Over 200 were quickly killed by a [[Maxim gun]]. 300 people in Uyoma resistance were killed by an expedition led by Sir Charles Horbley (Bwana Obila Muruayi) when they were confiscating Luo cattle to help feed the Coolies who were building the Uganda railway.

By 1900, the Luo chief Odera was providing 1,500 porters for a British expedition against the [[Nandi people|Nandi]].

In 1915, the [[British East Africa|Colonial Government]] sent ''Odera Akang'o'', the ''[[Luo dialect#Sample phrases|ruoth]]'' of Gem, to [[Kampala]], Uganda. He was impressed by the British settlement there and upon his return home he initiated a forced process of adopting western styles of "schooling, dress and hygiene". This resulted in the rapid education of the '''Luo''' in the English language and English ways.

The Luo generally were not dispossessed of their land by the British, avoiding the fate that befell the pastoral ethnic groups inhabiting the Kenyan "[[White Highlands]]". Many Luo played significant roles in the struggle for Kenyan independence, but the people were relatively uninvolved in the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] of the 1950s. Instead, some Luo used their education to advance the cause of independence peacefully. The lawyer [[C.M.G. Argwings-Kodhek]], for example, used his expertise to defend Mau Mau suspects in court, although they had attacked not only whites, but also the men of other ethnic groups.

===Independent Kenya===
Kenya became independent on 12 December 1963, prominent Luo leader, [[Oginga Odinga]], declined the presidency of Kenya, preferring to assume the vice presidency with [[Jomo Kenyatta]] as the head of government. Their administration represented the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) party. However, differences with Jomo Kenyatta caused Oginga to defect from the party and abandon the vice presidency in 1966. His departure caused the Luo to become politically marginalized under the Kenyatta and subsequently the Moi administrations.

In Tanzania, [[Mwalimu J.K. Nyerere]] had personally sought to work with Hellon Ang'iela Owino of [[Shirati]], Tanzania, as a trusted and vibrant political aide who was never ashamed of eloquently speaking his mind whenever needed. Mr. Owino was well known among the [[front bench]] politicians who exchanged fists with the then [[Oscar Kambona]] and Bhoke Munanka, whom he claimed were betraying Nyerere behind his agreed official prayers. Owino (1930s - 1988) was frequently sent many times by Nyerere (through Jaramogi Oginga A. Odinga) to mend relations with Kenya and was in particular the one who passed information (from Oginga, who was his African strategic security hub so as to calm down their badly torn relations caused by the Mau Mau war.

Many years of marginalization and disastrous economic management in Kenya, particularly under the KANU party's administration of the nascent state, had tragic consequences for the people of Kenya.  despite the economic potential of nearby [[Lake Victoria]]. Kenya continues to struggle with [[Poverty in Africa|poverty]] and AIDS today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/research/povertymaps/kenya/volume_index.htm Energy Old - Renewable Energy for Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713113111/http://www.worldbank.org/research/povertymaps/kenya/volume_index.htm |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 1,000 people were killed in [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis|Kenya's election violence]] amongst the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]],  Luo, and several other ethnic groups following the controversial [[Kenyan presidential election of 2007|December 2007 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.theage.com.au/un-chief-calls-on-kenya-rivals-to-stop-violence/20080131-1pcr.html UN chief calls on Kenya rivals to stop violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042825/http://news.theage.com.au/un-chief-calls-on-kenya-rivals-to-stop-violence/20080131-1pcr.html |date=2008-02-02 }}, [[The Age]], 31 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512118&amp;in_page_id=1811 As Kenya descends into anarchy, there's no sign of an end of the tribal bloodshed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220011848/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512118&amp;in_page_id=1811 |date=2008-02-20 }}, [[Daily Mail]], 4 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent Luo politician today is [[Raila Odinga]], the son of [[Oginga Odinga]] and former Prime Minister of the republic of Kenya. He is widely credited with enabling [[Mwai Kibaki]] to win the 2002 presidential election through the support of his [[Liberal Democratic Party (Kenya)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. Other prominent politicians include [[James Orengo]], Professor [[Anyang' Nyong'o]] whose daughter [[Lupita Nyong'o]] is a prominent [[Hollywood]] actress who has won the coveted [[Academy Awards]] and [[BET Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}} [[Peter Oloo-Aringo]], [[Dalmas Otieno]], [[Peter Ombija]] amongst others. Dr. [[PLO Lumumba]] who is the former [[Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission]] director is also a Luo. Prominent Luo doctors and scientists include the late Prof. David Peter Simon Wasawo, The first science professor in East and Central Africa and the first black East African to study and lecture science courses at Makerere university, Renown philosopher- [[Prof. Henry Odera Oruka]]Dr. [[Joseph Aluoch]] a chest physician, Professor [[Walter Jaoko]], a Tropical Diseases Specialist and leading HIV researcher, Professor [[George Magoha]], a consultant urologist and former Vice-Chancellor of University of Nairobi, Dr. [[Job Bodo]], an orthopeadic surgeon, [[Brian Jaoko Odongo]], a prominent environmental scientist, Prof Sam Odingo, who received the 2007 Nobel peace prize along with Al Gore of the USA for their work in climate change among others.

Another prominent member was [[Barack Obama Sr.]], whose son, [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama II]], was the 44th [[President of the United States]].

==Culture and customs==

===Rite of passage===
Traditionally the Luos practiced the removal of six lower teeth. The practise has fallen largely out of use with the evolution of Luo culture.

===Cuisine===
One of their favourite meals includes fish(rech) especially tilapia(ngege) and omena, usually accompanied with ugali (called ''kuon'' in Dholuo) and traditional vegetables like osuga. Many of the vegetables eaten by the Luo were shared after years of association with their Bantu neighbours, the Abaluhya and the Abagusii. Traditional Luo diet consisted of kuon made of sorghum or millet accompanied by fish, meat, or vegetable stews.

===Religious customs===
{{See also|African divination#Luo people}}
Like many ethnic communities in Uganda, including the Langi, Acholi, and Alur, the Luo do not practice the [[ritual]] [[circumcision]] of males as [[initiation]].

In 1907, Johanna Owalo formed the first African independent church in Kenya called ''Nomiya'' or "the mission I was given". Nomiya church is a mixture of Christian, Islam and traditional African religious doctrines. The church practices ''circumcision'' for male children at the age of 8 days and they pray facing north. The church currently has a following of 800,000 in the Nyanza region. Other local churches include ''Legio Maria, Roho'' and ''Fweny'' among others.

===Marriage customs===
Historically, couples were introduced to each other by matchmakers, but this is not common now. Like many other communities in Kenya, marriage practices among the Luo have been changing and some people are moving away from the traditional way of doing things. The Luo frequently marry outside their ethnic group. The traditional marriage ceremony takes place in two parts, both involving the payment of a [[bride price]] by the groom. The first ceremony, the [[Ayie]], involves a payment of money to the mother of the bride; the second stage involves giving cattle to her father. Often these two steps are carried out at the same time, and, as many modern Luos are Christians, a church ceremony often follows.

===Music===
{{See also|Music of Kenya#Luo|l1=Luo Section of Folk Music of Kenya}}
Traditionally, music was the most widely practiced art in the Luo community. At any time of day or night, music would be made. Music was not played for its own sake. Music was functional, being used for ceremonial, religious, political, or incidental purposes. Music was performed during funerals (''[[Tero buru]]''), to praise the departed, to console the bereaved, to keep people awake at night, and to express pain and agony. It was also used during cleansing and chasing away of spirits. Music was also played during ceremonies like beer parties (''[[Dudu (party)|Dudu]], [[ohangla dance]]''), welcoming back the warriors from a war, during a wrestling match (''[[Olengo]]''), during courtship, etc. Work songs also existed. These were performed both during communal work like building, weeding, etc. and individual work like pounding of cereals, or winnowing. Music was also used for ritual purposes like chasing away evil spirits ''(nyawawa)'', who visit the village at night, in rain making, and during divination and healing.

The Luo music was shaped by the total way of life, lifestyles, and life patterns of individuals of this community. Because of that, the music had characteristics which distinguished it from that of other communities. This can be seen, heard, and felt in their melodies, rhythms, mode of presentation and dancing styles, movements, and formations.

The melodies in Luo music were lyrical, with a lot of vocal ornamentations. These ornaments came out clearly, especially when the music carried an important message. Their rhythms were characterized by a lot of syncopation and acrusic beginning. These songs were usually presented in solo-response style, although some were solo performances. The most common forms of solo performances were chants. These chants were recitatives with irregular rhythms and phrases, which carried serious messages. Most of the Luo dances were introduced by these chants. One example is the dudu dance.

Another unique characteristic in the Luo music is the introduction of yet another chant at the middle of a musical performance. The singing stops, the pitch of the musical instruments go down and the dance becomes less vigorous as an individual takes up the performance is self-praise. This is referred to as '''''Pakruok'''''. There was also a unique kind of ululation, '''''Sigalagala''''', that marked the climax of the musical performance. Sigalagala was mainly done by women.

The dance styles in the Luo folk music were elegant and graceful. They involved either the movement of one leg in the opposite direction with the waist in step with the syncopated beats of the music or the shaking of the shoulders vigorously, usually to the tune of the [[nyatiti]], an eight-stringed instrument.

Adamson (1967) commented that Luos clad in their traditional costumes and ornaments deserve their reputation as the most picturesque people in Kenya. During most of their performances, the Luo wore costumes and decorated themselves not only to appear beautiful, but also to enhance their movements. These costumes included sisal skirts ('''''owalo'''''), beads ('''''Ombulu / [[tigo]]''''') worn around the neck and waist, and red or white clay worn by the ladies. The men's costumes included '''''[[kuodi]]''''' or '''''chieno''''', a skin worn from the shoulders or from the waist respectively to cover their nakedness, '''''Ligisa''''', the headgear, shield and spear, reed hats, and clubs, among others. All these costumes and ornaments were made from locally available materials.

The Luo were also rich in musical instruments which ranged from percussion (drums, clappers, metal rings, '''''ongeng'o or gara''''', shakers), strings (e.g., '''''nyatiti''''', a type of [[lyre]]; '''''[[orutu]]''''', a type of [[fiddle]]), wind ('''''tung (instrument)|tung'''''' a horn,'''''[[Asili]]''''', a [[flute]], '''''A bu-!''''', to a specific type of trumpet).

Currently the Luo are associated with the ''[[Benga music|benga]]'' style of music. It is a lively style in which songs in [[Dholuo]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], or English are sung to a lively guitar riff. It originated in the 1950s with Luo musicians trying to adapt their traditional dance rhythms to western instruments. The [[guitar]] (acoustic, later electric) replaced the [[nyatiti]] as the string instrument. ''Benga'' has become so popular that it is played by musicians of all ethnicities and is no longer considered a purely Luo style. It has become Kenya's characteristic pop sound.

Luo singer and nyatiti player [[Ayub Ogada]] received widespread exposure in 2005 when two of his songs were featured in [[Alberto Iglesias]]' Academy Award-nominated score for [[Fernando Mereilles]]' film adaptation of ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]''.

Other Luo musical greats in various genres are
[[Suzanna Owiyo]], [[Daniel Owino Misiani]],Thomas Wasonga, Amolo Kong'o, Ouma Omore Ogwang' Lelo, Ogoya Nengo, Olith Ratego, Hellen-Akoth Mtawali, [[Achieng' Abura]], Iddi Achieng', Hellon, Dan Chizi Aceda, Ricky Oyaro, JuaCali, Radikol - Kevin Okullo, Big Pin, [[George Ramogi]], Collella Mazee, [[Musa Juma]], John Junior, Osogo Winyo, [[Tony Nyadundo]], Jack Nyadundo, Nina Ogot, Steve Nyabwa, Osito Kalle, Odongo Mayaka, Poxy Presha, Shirati Jazz band, Dolla Kabarry, Ochieng' Kabaselleh, Limpopo International Band, [[Onyi Papa Jey]], Sal Davies, Atomy Sifa, Omollo K'Odingo, ((Lady Maureen)), Isaac Gem, Pete Odera, Juma Toto and Gabriel Omolo (Omolo Gaby).

In a nutshell, musical styles with Luo origin or dominance are [[Benga music|Benga]], [[Ohangla]], [[Dudu music|Dudu]], [[Nyatiti]], [[Otenga]], [[Afro-Fusion]], [[Afro-house]], [[South African jazz|Afro-jazz]], [[Kenyan Gospel]], [[Genge]] etc.


===Kinship, Family, and Inheritance===
Ocholla Ayayo writes in "Traditional Ideology and Ethics among the southern Luo":

"When the time of the inheritance comes the ideology of seniority is respected: the elder son receives the largest share, followed in the order of seniority. If it is the land to be divided, for instance, the land of the old grandfather's homestead, the senior son gets the middle piece, the second the land to the right hand side of the homestead, and the third son takes the land on the left hand side. After the father's death the senior son takes over the responsibilities of leadership. These groups when considered in terms of genealogy, are people of the same grandfather, and are known in Dholuo as Jokakwaro. They share sacrifices under the leadership of the senior brother. If the brother is dead the next brother in seniority takes the leadership of senior brother. The responsibility and prestige position of leadership is that it puts one into the primary position in harvesting, cultivation, as well as in eating specified parts of the animal killed, usually the best parts. It is the senior brother, who is leading in the group, who can first own the fishing boat. Since it is he who will be communicating with the ancestors of their father or grandfather, it is he who will conduct or lead the sacrifices of religiousity of the boat, as we have noted earlier. [...] The system of the allocation of land by the father while he is still alive is important since it will coincide with the system of inheritance of land. The principle of the division of the land in monogamous families is rather simple and straightforward. [...] The senior son takes the centre portion of all the land of the homestead up to and beyond the gate or to the buffer zone; the second son then has the remainder of the land to divide with the other brothers. If the land is divided among the elder sons after they are married, and take to live in their lands, it often happens that a youngest son remains in the village of the father to care for him in his old age. His inheritance is the last property, called Mondo and the remaining gardens of his mother. [...] In the case of a polygamous village, the land is divided along the same lines, except that within the village, the sons claim the area contiguous to the houses of their mother. Each wife and her children are regarded as if the group constituted was the son of a single woman.By that I mean the children of the senior wife, Mikayi, are given that portion of the total area which could have been given to the senior son in a monogamous family. The sons of Nyachira, the second wife, and the sons of Reru, the third wife, lay claim to those portions which would have fallen to the second and third sons of Mikayi in a monogamous village".&lt;ref&gt;Traditional ideology and ethics among the southern Luo - DiVA {{cite web |url=http://nai.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:280191/FULLTEXT01 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014150155/http://nai.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:280191/FULLTEXT01 |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Hebinck and Nelson Mango explain in detail the family and inheritance system of the Luo in their article "Land and embedded rights: An analysis of land conflicts in Luoland, Western Kenya."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/13060/ASC-075287668-1014-01.pdf?sequence=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019201253/https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/13060/ASC-075287668-1014-01.pdf?sequence=2 |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker MacDonald Shipton also writes extensively about kinship, family and inheritance among the Luo in his book "Mortgaging the Ancestors: Ideologies of Attachment in Africa":

"Outside the homestead enclosure, or (where there is no more enclosure) beyond and before its houses, Luo people have favored a layout of fields that in some ways reflects placements of houses within. The following pattern, as described in Gordon Wilson’s work from the 1950s, is still discernable in our times—not just in informants’ sketches of their ideals, but also in the allocations of real lands where space has allowed following suit. If there is more than one son in a monogamous homestead, the eldest takes land in front of or to the right of the entrance, and the second son takes land on the left. The third receives land to the right and center again, but farther from the father’s homestead. The fourth son, if there is one, goes to the left but farther from the paternal homestead than the second. Further sons alternate right and left. While elder sons might thus receive larger shares than the younger ones, the youngest takes over the personal garden (mondo) kept by the father for his own use—as if as a consolation prize".

{{infobox ethnonym||Mamprusi|Mampruli (Ŋmampulli?)|Mamprugu}}

'''Mamprusi''' (autonym '''''Mampruli''','' also ''Mampelle, Ŋmampulli)'' is a [[Gur language]] spoken in northern [[Ghana]] by the [[Mamprusi]] people. It is partially [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Dagbani language|Dagbani]]. The Mamprusi language is spoken in a broad belt across the northern parts of the [[Northern Region (Ghana)|Northern Region]] of Ghana, stretching west to east from Yizeesi to [[Nakpanduri]] and centred on the towns of [[Gambaga]]/[[Nalerigu]] and [[Walewale]]. In Mamprusi, one speaker is a ''Ŋmampuriga'', many (plural) are ''Ŋmampurisi'' and the land of the Mamprusi is ''Ŋmampurigu''.

The language belongs to the Gur family which is part of the [[Niger–Congo language family]], which covers most of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (Bendor-Samuel 1989). Within Gur it belongs to the Western [[Oti–Volta]] subgroup, and particularly its southeastern cluster of six to eight languages ([[Tony Naden|Naden]] 1988, 1989). Closely related and very similar languages spoken nearby are Dagbani, Nanun, [[Kamara language|Kamara]] and [[Hanga language|Hanga]] in the Northern Region, and [[Kusaal language|Kusaal]], [[Nabit language|Nabit]] and [[Talni language|Talni]] in the [[Upper East Region]]. Not quite so closely related are [[Farefare language|Farefare]], [[Wali language (Gur)|Waali]], [[Dagaari language|Dagaari]], [[Birifor language|Birifor]] and [[Safaliba language|Safalaba]] in the Upper East and [[Upper West Region|Upper West Regions]] and southwest of the Northern Region.

Comparatively little linguistic material on the language has been published; there is a brief sketch as an illustration of this subgroup of languages in Naden 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tony|first=[[Tony Naden|Naden]]|title=Gur Languages|publisher=Kegan Paul International ''for'' I.A.I. /W.A.L.S.|location=London|pages=12–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dakubu|first=Mary Esther Kropp [ed.]|title=The Languages of Ghana|date=1988|publisher=Kegan Paul International ''for'' I.A.I. /W.A.L.S|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of Mampruli proverbs has been published by R.P. Xavier Plissart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plissart|first=Xavier|title=Mampruli Proverbs|date=1983|publisher=Musée Royale de l'Afrique|location=Tervuren}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a translation of the New Testament is in print,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=n/a|first=n/a|title=Naawunni Kunni Palli (''God's New Volume'')|date=2001|publisher=GILLBT|location=Tamale}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sample of which can be read and heard online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matiu 1|url=http://www.bible.is/MAWWBT/Matt/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also beginning Mampruli lessons in which the spoken language can be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Mountain Mampruli Project|url=http://www.redmountainwriting.com/philanthropy/the_mampruli_project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==

There is comparatively little dialect variation. The western (Walewale to the [[White Volta]]) and Far Western (west of the White Volta, area known by those to the east as "Overseas") have some variant pronunciation standards. The far Eastern dialect known as Durili is most notable for pronouncing ''[r]'' and ''[l]'' where the rest of Mampruli pronounces ''[l]'' and ''[r]'' respectively, and for some characteristic intonation patterns.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

Mampruli has ten phonemic vowels: five short and five long vowels:

==Writing system==
Mampruli is written in a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]], but the [[literacy]] rate is fairly low.  The [[orthography]] currently used represents a number of [[allophone|allophonic]] distinctions. There is a description of the process of formulating the orthography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naden|first=Di / Tony|title=Community involvement in orthography design.|date=2003|publisher=Linguistics Dept., University of Ghana|location=Legon, Ghana|pages=218–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dakubu|first=, M.E.

|}

==Grammar==
Mampruli has a fairly conservative Oti-Volta grammatical system. The constituent order in Mampruli sentences is usually [[agent–verb–object]]. There is a simple, non-technical grammatical study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Sketch of Basic Grammar in Mampruli|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39755804/TN-MP-GrammarU.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;&lt;to be expanded&gt;&gt;

{{Ukrainian crisis}}
'''Media portrayals of the [[Ukrainian crisis]]''', including [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|2014 unrest]] and the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] following the [[Euromaidan]] movement, differed widely between [[Ukrainian media|Ukrainian]], western and [[Russian media]].&lt;ref name=MT140311/&gt; The Russian, the Ukrainian, and the Western media were all, to various degrees, accused of [[propaganda|propagandizing]], and of waging an [[information war]] during their coverage of the events.&lt;ref name=NYT140417/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dougherty/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackJohns/&gt;&lt;ref name=GN140411/&gt;&lt;ref name=GN140804/&gt;&lt;ref name=BoydBarrett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sakwa/&gt; Russian channels were repeatedly criticized for the use of misleading images, false narratives, misrepresentation, suppression,&lt;ref name=BBC150422/&gt; and fabricated news stories, such as a child's [[crucifixion]] and the death of a 10-year-old in shelling.&lt;ref name=AFP140714/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC150408/&gt; The [[BBC]] reported that Russian state television "appears to employ techniques of psychological conditioning designed to excite extreme emotions of aggression and hatred in the viewer",&lt;ref name=BBC150204/&gt; which, according to [[The Guardian]], is part of a coordinated "informational-psychological war operation".&lt;ref name=Guardian20150409/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Octavian Manea|title=Vasily Gatov: Deconstructing the Russian Infowar and mindset|url=http://www.stopfake.org/en/vasily-gatov-deconstructing-the-russian-infowar-and-mindset/|publisher=StopFake.org|date=15 September 2015 |accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regular theme in the Russian media was that the Ukrainian army, which has many Russian-speaking members, was committing "genocide" against Russian-speakers and that they strongly desired Russia to "protect" them against Kiev.&lt;ref name=FT141009/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYB140307/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reut141114/&gt; This presentation contradicted a poll showing that less than 20% of eastern residents wanted Russia's protection.&lt;ref name=EL150222/&gt; They supported Russia's denials of involvement in the Crimean crisis, until [[Vladimir Putin]] boasted about the key role of Russian soldiers, and continue denying its involvement in the [[war in Donbass]], despite evidence that Russia regularly shelled across the border.&lt;ref name=Time150320/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP161221/&gt;

==Media in Russia==
The [[Russian media]] consistently portrayed the crisis in Ukraine as having been instigated by the post-Yanukovych Ukrainian government,&lt;ref name="MT140311" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes140917" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPRaccuse" /&gt; and represented [[Euromaidan]] as being controlled by "ultranationalist", "fascist",&lt;ref name="Time140929" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GNAY140317" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYB140320/&gt; "[[neo-Nazi]]", and "[[anti-Semitic]]" groups,&lt;ref name="Atlantic140326" /&gt; with [[Right Sector]] a common theme.&lt;ref name=CEPA201608/&gt; The revolution was depicted as a violent "[[coup d'etat]]"&lt;ref name=CEPA201608/&gt; fomented by the West in order to overthrow an [[Second Azarov Government|elected government]].&lt;ref name="MT140311" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP140315" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FT140303" /&gt; Police brutality against Euromaidan supporters was omitted.&lt;ref name="Mash150429" /&gt; Portrayals by the Russia state media were generally close to those by the Russian government; they presented western countries, particularly the United States, as orchestrating events in Ukraine in order to harm Russia.&lt;ref name="Memo98-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CEPI150515" /&gt; Accusations of Russophobia were common in response to criticism of Russian actions.&lt;ref name=OSW56/&gt; The [[Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement]] was depicted as a weapon against the Kremlin, protesters as paid stooges of the United States, and the Vilnius summit as akin to the [[Munich Agreement]].&lt;ref name="BF131205" /&gt;
In addition to events in Ukraine, Russia has described other uprisings in eastern Europe which are unfavourable to the Kremlin's interests as being controlled by foreign powers and fascists. In a July 2009 open letter calling Russia "a revisionist power", [[Vaclav Havel]], [[Lech Walesa]], and other former leaders of central and eastern Europe criticised Russia for "[challenging] our claims to our own historical experiences" and "[asserting] a privileged position in determining our security choices."&lt;ref name=GW090715&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wyborcza.pl/1,86871,6825987,An_Open_Letter_to_the_Obama_Administration_from_Central.html |title= An Open Letter to the Obama Administration from Central and Eastern Europe |authors= [[Valdas Adamkus]], [[Martin Bútora]], [[Emil Constantinescu]], [[Pavol Demeš]], [[Luboš Dobrovský]], [[Mátyás Eörsi]], [[István Gyarmati]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Rastislav Káčer]], [[Sandra Kalniete]], [[Karel Schwarzenberg]], [[Michal Kováč]], [[Ivan Krastev]], [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], [[Mart Laar]], [[Kadri Liik]], [[János Martonyi]], [[Janusz Onyszkiewicz]], [[Adam Daniel Rotfeld]], [[Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga]], [[Alexandr Vondra]], [[Lech Wałęsa]] |publisher= [[Gazeta Wyborcza]] |date= 15 July 2009 }}

Following the parliamentary vote in which [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] was chosen as [[First Yatsenyuk Government|transitional Prime Minister]], [[RT (TV network)|''RT'']] described Ukrainian government officials as "coup-appointed".&lt;ref name=RFE140425/&gt; Continuing after the election of [[Petro Poroshenko]] as President, Russian news outlets regularly described the Ukrainian government as a "[[Military junta|junta]], "[[fascist]]", and "illegitimate".&lt;ref name=Forbes140917/&gt;&lt;ref name=IMR1411/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC140810/&gt; Kiselyov's two-hour Sunday show ''Vesti Nedeli'' "developed a near single-minded fixation on Ukraine" and presented the post-Maidan authorities as "fascist usurpers" who were "propped up" by NATO.&lt;ref name=NR140701/&gt; Ukraine was often portrayed as "irreparably dysfunctional", "artificial", "deeply divided", or as a [[failed state]].&lt;ref name=EL150222/&gt;&lt;ref name=IWPR150114/&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ150530/&gt; Russian state media claimed that Kiev authorities had allowed total [[anarchy]] to take root in Ukraine and that the country was under the control of "banderovtsy", followers of Ukrainian nationalist [[Stepan Bandera]].&lt;ref name=MT140311/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC140810/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ140502/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT140418/&gt; According to [[Boris Nemtsov]]'s report, ''[[Putin.

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', British historian [[Timothy Garton Ash]] said that Putin "used television to impose his own narrative of a socially conservative, proud Russia threatened by fascists in Kiev, an expansionist NATO and a decadent EU."&lt;ref name=GN150201/&gt; Joshua Yaffa of ''[[The New Republic]]'' reported a "propaganda onslaught unprecedented in the post-Soviet era, implying or inventing dark suspicions about Western motives in Ukraine while painting Russia's own meddling as a heroic answer to the call of justice."&lt;ref name=NR140701/&gt; In an interview with the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]], [[Peter Pomerantsev]] said, "The Kremlin has reinvented the conflict in Ukraine as a genocide against Russians. People believe that the fascists are coming to get them, because that's what they have seen on TV, or that the CIA is behind massacres in Ukraine."&lt;ref name=IWPR150114/&gt; Ingo Mannteufel of ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'' reported that "Kremlin-run media outlets have been hammering the Russian people and foreign audiences with messages that "fascist politicians and US intelligence agencies" have taken over neighboring Ukraine".&lt;ref name=DW150509/&gt; The Russian media has employed "Soviet language", referring to "traitors", "fascists", and "fifth columns".&lt;ref name=TNR140720/&gt; In an open letter to [[Vladimir Putin]], Ukrainian Jews, a mostly Russian-speaking community, said the Russian media had fabricated stories of forced Ukrainization, bans on the Russian language, and growth of anti-Semitism, and suggested that Putin had "confused Ukraine with Russia, where Jewish organizations have noticed growth in anti-Semitic tendencies last year."&lt;ref name=OLJ/&gt;

The Russian media focused particularly on [[Right Sector]], portraying the group as powerful, fascist, and neo-Nazi and saying that it was persecuting Russian-speakers and Jews.&lt;ref name=BBC140810/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP140314/&gt;&lt;ref name=FP140602/&gt; Writing for ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', Hanna Kozlowska stated that Russian propaganda tried to demonize the Ukraine government and build a case for the annexation of Crimea by depicting Right Sector as a powerful neo-Nazi group which might take control of Ukraine.&lt;ref name=FP140602/&gt; During the first half of 2014, Right Sector was the second-most mentioned political group in online Russian mass media.&lt;ref name=FP140602/&gt; The [[Associated Press]] and other international news organizations found no evidence that the group had committed hate crimes.&lt;ref name=AP140314/&gt; Right Sector and other far-right candidates had poor results in both the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2014|2014 Ukrainian presidential election]] and [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2014|parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref name=Forbes140529/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA141031/&gt; Josef Zissels, chairman of the Vaad Association of Jewish Organization and Communities of Ukraine, stated: "The failure of the ultranationalists reflects a reality which we have been trying to represent all the time despite Russian propaganda's attempt to portray Ukrainian society as intolerant."&lt;ref name=JTA140527/&gt; After the parliamentary election, Vyacheslav Likhachev of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress said that "Russian propaganda speaks of a 'Ukrainian Fascist junta,' but in reality there are more voters for the far-right in the European Union than in Ukraine."&lt;ref name=JTA141031/&gt; Jillian Kay Melchior of the ''[[National Review]]'' found the claims of discrimination against Russian-speakers "absurd," saying the Russian language was prevalent even in Kiev.&lt;ref name=NR140416/&gt;

During the [[Crimean crisis]], Russian media supported the Russian government's assertions that Russian troops were not involved.&lt;ref name=Time150320&gt;{{cite news|title=Putin's Confessions on Crimea Expose Kremlin Media|url=http://time.com/3752827/putin-media-kremlin-crimea-ukraine/|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian channels declared that Ukrainian nationalists from western Ukraine and Kiev were assaulting and killing Russians in Crimea; they claimed that a bus in [[Simferopol]] was carrying members of [[Right Sector]] who were attacking Crimean residents, although the footage showed a bus with Crimean license plates transporting men armed with Russian weapons, after roads to Crimea had been blocked by Russian soldiers.&lt;ref name=DB140303/&gt;&lt;ref name=France140304/&gt; ''Russia 24'' used footage of Maidan square in [[Kiev]] to support its claims of chaos in Simferopol, Crimea.&lt;ref name=France140304/&gt; Claims of violence and suppression against Russian-speakers in Ukraine were used as justification for the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014)|Russian military intervention]] in [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name=BBCdiverge/&gt; Russian media claimed that the western media ignored the apparent "violence", and that demonstrators in Crimea were protesting for democratic rights. In reference to this, Russian sources consistently refer to the events as the "Russian Spring", harking back to pro-democracy movements like the [[Prague Spring]] and [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name=RIAN140303/&gt; The annexation of Crimea was portrayed as the will of the people and a "reunification".&lt;ref name=PN150315/&gt; Pro-Russian protesters in eastern Ukraine, including those who were armed and had taken journalists hostage, were portrayed as peaceful "pro-federalization" activists.&lt;ref name=RFE140425/&gt;

At the same time some Russian media were promoting anti-western and pro-war views: Channel ''Rossiya 2'' aired a short simulation of a [[RT-2PM2 Topol-M|Topol-M]] rocket hitting [[London]] while channel ''5'' simulated a conventional invasion on [[Warsaw]], [[Berlin]] and Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From cold war to hot war|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21643220-russias-aggression-ukraine-part-broader-and-more-dangerous-confrontation|newspaper=The Economist|date=14 February 2015|issn=0013-0613|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-government groups in eastern and southern Ukraine have been consistently characterized as "local people bravely fighting for their rights", as "self-defence forces", and as "supporters of federalization".&lt;ref name=MT140311/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPRaccuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCpoles/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTdisinform/&gt; According to broadcasts by the [[Russia-1]] state television channel, "Kiev threatened the citizens of Donetsk with psychological attacks from the air. Periodically, military helicopters and planes circle menacingly over the towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk".&lt;ref name=MT140311/&gt; In addition, the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces|Ukrainian army]], which has launched various [[Donetsk People's Republic|offensives against militants]] in Donetsk Oblast, has been continually portrayed as having "low morale", and being "disorganized".&lt;ref name=BBCpoles/&gt; [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]], a television channel owned by Russian state oil company [[Gazprom]], reported that "Ukrainian troops refused to take orders from their commanders, and sided with pro-Russian militiamen".&lt;ref name=BBCpoles/&gt;

In July 2014, ''[[ITAR-TASS]], [[RIA Novosti]]'', and ''[[LifeNews]]'' reported that pro-Russian separatists had shot down a Ukrainian military plane over [[Torez]].&lt;ref name=Netmsov-Report/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mash150501/&gt; When news emerged about the [[MH17]] crash, Russian channels began promoting various theories, all of which suggested Ukraine was responsible.&lt;ref name=Mash150501/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP140722/&gt; They considered the crash to be part of a U.S. conspiracy against Russia.&lt;ref name=TNR140720/&gt;  Russian media claimed in late September that "hundreds of unmarked graves of civilians executed by Ukrainian army" were found and verified by OSCE monitors, a claim that was debunked by the [[OSCE]] and DPR officials.&lt;ref name=RFE141003/&gt;&lt;ref name=UT141002/&gt;&lt;ref name=INT140929/&gt; Other top stories, usually based on hearsay, with no accompanying evidence and illustrated by photos taken from unrelated incidents&lt;ref name=Guardian20150409/&gt; included a "three-year-old boy crucified by Ukrainian servicemen", "parcel of land and two Russian slaves for Ukrainian soldiers," a woman with five different names and stories, "Spanish air controller in Kiev", "satellite photo of Ukrainian fighter jet firing at Boeing", "Ukrainian fighter jet pilot confession" (spread in Russian media as a viable explanations for the [[MH17]] crash), [[Dmytro Yarosh]] winning the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2014|2014 Ukrainian presidential election]], and Yarosh threatening to set off a grenade in Parliament.&lt;ref name=RFE141212/&gt;&lt;ref name=UT141230/&gt;&lt;ref name=KP150106/&gt;&lt;ref name=RS150108/&gt; [[Rossiya Segodnya]]'s ''Ukraina.ru'' website claimed that Ukrainian president [[Petro Poroshenko]] had links with [[Lucifer]].

In March 2015, [[Russian News Agency "TASS"|TASS]] published a false report that the Carpatho-[[Rusyns]] had held a congress during which they decided to seek autonomy.&lt;ref name=SF150317/&gt;&lt;ref name=AJ150504/&gt; Russian state media were also criticized for their reporting on [[Odessa Oblast]], particularly claims of riots and persecution of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=KHRPG-Odessa/&gt; [[Russia-1]] presented Poroshenko's statement that Ukrainian would remain the only state language as a violation of the right to speak Russian freely, although a survey found that even Donbas and eastern oblasts preferred Russian to have the status of second official language in particular regions over "state language" status.&lt;ref name=LangApr2015/&gt; In April 2015, Russian media widely reported a death of a 10-year-old girl killed by Ukrainian artillery but Russian reporters on the site interviewed by the BBC admitted that "the girl never existed" and they were reporting this fake story because they "were instructed" to do so.&lt;ref name=BBC150408/&gt; Further fake news in Russian media included alleged "fascist attacks" on Greek population in Crimea (which Greek embassy denied) and "four American soldiers" raping two underage girls in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.interpretermag.com/kremlins-five-top-lies-last-week-about-ukraine/ | title=Kremlin's Five Top Lies Last Week about Ukraine | publisher=The Interpreter Magazine | date=2015-04-19 | accessdate=2015-04-20 | author=Paul Goble}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russialies.com/russias-top-160-lies-about-ukraine/ | title=Russia's top 160 lies about Ukraine | publisher=RussiaLies | accessdate=July 26, 2015| date=2015-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, [[Izvestiya]]  allegedly "disclosed" a letter from US Embassy to LGBT activists in Russia written in English with so many errors, that the US Departament of State republished it marking the errors in red with a dedication in Russian, suggesting that the authors ask for help while writing such letters next time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://photos.state.gov/libraries/russia/5/izvestiya/izvestiya-fake.pdf |title = Izvestiya Fake|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Departament of State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC reported that the Russian state media had a "tendency to focus on events in Ukraine to the almost complete exclusion of problems at home."&lt;ref name=BBC150428/&gt; In May 2015, Slovak monitoring group ''MEMO 98, Internews Ukraine'', and ''Yerevan Press Club of Armenia'' completed a report on Russian TV channels for the Civil Society Forum of the [[Eastern Partnership]]. MEMO 98's Rasťo Kužel observed that Russian media "diverted attention from important domestic issues and scared the population with the possibility of a war and the need of Russia to protect itself against an external enemy."&lt;ref name=Memo98-2015/&gt; In an interview for ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', [[OSCE]] observer Paul Picard stated: "We often see how Russian media outlets manipulate our statements. They say that we have not seen Russian troops crossing the borders. But that only applies to two border crossings. We have no idea what is going on at the others" (Russia having refused to allow the OSCE to expand its mission).&lt;ref name=DW150624/&gt;

Leaked emails of Kristina Potupchik, former [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]] spokeswoman, later employee of President Vladimir Putin's administration, revealed wide-scale monitoring of any critical articles in Russia opposition media, placing paid comments and [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]] by [[web brigades]] coordinated by Potupchik&lt;ref name=GVO141227/&gt; (according to earlier leaks she was involved in similar activities at least since 2012).&lt;ref name=Gazeta120209/&gt; For example, Potupchik reported to her supervisors about alleged irregularities in [[Alexei Navalny]]'s passport application form, attaching its scans to the email. As noted by ''The Insider'', she had no legal way to obtain these forms as they are considered sensitive documents, and a few days later [[LifeNews]] reported exactly these irregularities as part of campaign against Navalny.&lt;ref name=Theins141226/&gt; According to Alexander Sytnik, a former member of the Russian Institute for Strategic Research, his organisation was one of the channels for "illegal funding of pro-Russian analysts in Ukraine through third parties".&lt;ref name=EDM20015/&gt;

On a number of occasions, [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Dmitry Rogozin]] and [[Nikolai Patrushev]] have given examples of Western prejudice and hostility against Russia; one of these examples was an alleged statement by [[Madelaine Albright]] about Russia "controlling too much of Siberia's resources". As Russian independent media shortly found out, this phrase was never voiced by Albright, but instead by a former Russian security services officer [[Boris Ratnikov]], who in 2006 gave examples of what kind of "secret" information he was able to extract from Western leaders using experimental "remote mind control" research. Even though the origins of the claim were traced in 2007, Russian leaders repeatedly used it as if it were a real statement. Asked by a journalist about this particular statement, Putin replied that "I know this is what they think in their minds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/world/europe/putin-cites-claim-about-us-designs-on-siberia-traced-to-russian-mind-readers.html | title=Putin Cites Claim About U.S. Designs on Siberia Traced to Russian Mind Readers | publisher=New York Times | date=2014-12-18 | accessdate=June 26, 2015 | first=Robert | last=Mackey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/putting-words-in-albrights-mouth/193094.html | title=Putting Words in Albright's Mouth | publisher=The Moscow Times | date=2007-11-07 | accessdate=June 26, 2015 | author=Smolchenko, Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a linguistic analysis by Vasily Gatov, top Russian politicians started reusing classical language habits of Bolshevik leaders, such as self-questioning ("a question arises..."), [[metonymy]] ("some countries...") and expressions or anecdotes from criminal [[subculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russia's Stalinist Diplospeak|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/25/russia-s-stalinist-diplospeak.html|newspaper = The Daily Beast|date = 2015-07-25|accessdate = 2015-08-03|first = Vasily|last = Gatov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Alexandr Bastrykin, head of the [[Investigative Committee of Russia]], gave an interview in which he presented a version of events around the arrest of [[Nadia Savchenko]] that included her "voluntarily crossing the Russian border" and "living for 4 days in hotels" on the territory of Russia before she was arrested, and completely contradicted previous reports by [[Donetsk People's Republic]] militia of her being taken prisoner of war, including videos of her interrogation. In the same interview Bastrykin also accused [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] of taking part in the [[First Chechen War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natalia Kozlova|url=http://rg.ru/2015/09/08/bastrikin-site.html|script-title=ru:Кто управляет хаосом:: Александр Бастрыкин: нас не пугает информационное давление со стороны|trans-title=Who manages chaos:: Alexander Bastrykin: We're not scared of pressure from information outlets|language=ru|publisher=Russian Gazette.ru|date=8 September 2015|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, due to its surreal character was widely ridiculed in Ukrainian and Russian media, including a number of [[meme]]s portraying Yatseniuk as a Chechen warlord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Chilling side to Russia's claims about Yatsenyuk as Chechnya fighter|url = http://www.stopfake.org/en/the-chilling-side-to-russia-s-claims-about-yatsenyuk-as-chechnya-fighter/|accessdate = 2015-09-12|date = 2015-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accusations were based on testimonies from Mykola Karpyuk and Stanislav Klykh, Ukrainian citizens held in Russia since 2014, and forced using torture and extortion. Another Ukrainian citizen, Serhiy Litvinov, is also held in Russia and his forced testimonies were used by Russian media as a 'proof' of 'genocide of Russian nationals' as Litvinov was also charged with murdering twenty 'unidentified people' and a rape. By the end of 2014, most of the charges against him were dropped, leaving one robbery charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Halya Coynash|title=Arrest a Ukrainian – Russia's Investigative Committee will do the rest|url=http://khpg.org/index.php?id=1436827549|work=khpg.org|date=15 July 2015|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Cherkasov, the prosecution statement in Karpyuk and Klykh contains errors and inconsistencies suggesting that it was written based on the Russian Wikipedia article on [[Salman Raduyev]] instead of any actual evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ekhokavkaza.com/content/article/27325821.html|title = Самый правдивый человек на свете|date = 27 October 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Ekho Kavkaza|last = Cherkasov|first = Alexander|quote = Ukrainians, according to the prosecution, trained in "Raduyev camp" from Spring 1999 till May 2000.

Themes of Russia's "information war" include Russia having the right to a "[[sphere of influence]]" and "only laying claim to what is rightfully hers", its neighbors being "failed states", Europe "harming" its economy and security by building ties with them, "moral equality" between Putin and the West, "Western decadence" and threats to "traditional" ways of life, Europe being most harmed by sanctions, Putin's government being "legitimate" and "successful", and obscuring Russia's role in post-Soviet crises by presenting them as ethnic conflicts.&lt;ref name=Martens1506/&gt; Descriptions of the Ukrainian government as "illegitimate" or "self-appointed" and the country as "fascist" were common in Russian reports during much of the conflict, but had declined sharply by the end of 2015.&lt;ref name=Meduza151229/&gt; Ukraine was the main subject of negative reports until the Russian media shifted their attention to Turkey.&lt;ref name=Meduza151229/&gt;

According to war reporter and veteran of the [[First Chechen War]] [[Arkadiy Babchenko]], Russian mass media played a significant role in starting the [[war in Donbass]] stating that "this is the first war in history started exclusively by [[Goebbels]]-like propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openrussia.org/post/view/4225/|script-title=Аркадий Бабченко: «Если бы не российское телевидение, этой войны бы не было»|trans-title=Arkadiy Babchenko, "If it were not for Russian TV, this war would not have occurred"|language=ru|publisher=OpenRussia|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=24 April 2015|first=Arkadiy |last=Babchenko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stopfake.org/en/supporting-a-war-that-isn-t-russian-public-opinion-and-the-ukraine-conflict/ | title=Supporting a War that isn't: Russian Public Opinion and the Ukraine Conflict | publisher=StopFake.org | date=September 10, 2015 | accessdate=September 12, 2015 | author=Denis Volkov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in March 2014 for ''[[Gazeta.ru]]'', Yekaterina Bolotovskaya said the Russian media was presenting an "apocalyptic" image of Ukraine.&lt;ref name=BBC140312/&gt; After a Russian channel claimed Ukrainians had crucified a child in [[Slovyansk]], the former chief editor of [[Lenta.ru]], Galina Timchenko, said, "This is an egregious violation of professional ethics. Not only is there no proof anywhere -- this is not even being questioned."&lt;ref name=AFP140714/&gt; In March 2014, former economic minister Andrei Nechayev wrote, "Our propaganda on state channels is really running wild."&lt;ref name=AFP140303/&gt; In July 2014, Andrei Malgin wrote in ''[[The Moscow Times]]'': "I worked for Soviet newspapers during the terms of four Soviet leaders, from Leonid Brezhnev to Mikhail Gorbachev, and this is the first time the authorities have lied so brazenly and shamelessly. They have truly reached a new low."&lt;ref name=MT140730/&gt; [[Boris Nemtsov]] stated that Vladimir Putin and the directors of [[Channel One Russia]] and [[Rossiya Segodnya]] employed "Goebbels-style propaganda. If we are talking about the responsibility for spilling both Russian and Ukrainian blood, it lies not only with Putin, but also with such gentlemen as [[Konstantin Ernst]] or [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Kiselyov|Dmitry Kiselyov]]. They operate in accordance with the simple principles of [[Joseph Goebbels]]: Play on the emotions; the bigger the lie, the better; lies should be repeated many times."&lt;ref name=Newsweek150228/&gt; Russian hacker group [[Shaltay Boltay]] published leaked Kremlin documents telling journalists to justify the Crimean annexation, praise Vladimir Putin's development plans, and depict Ukraine as swarming with fascists.&lt;ref name=GVO140328/&gt; ''Delovoi Petersburg'' and a journalist interviewed by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that several "Ukrainian" news sites, such as the ''Kharkov News Agency'', were based in Russia.&lt;ref name=GVO141119/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel150601/&gt; The head of the [[Levada Center]], [[Lev Gudkov]], stated, "The successful propaganda campaign we are witnessing here surrounding the Ukraine crisis is unique and highly sophisticated, even compared to Soviet standards."&lt;ref name=Spiegel140530/&gt; Maksim Trudolyubov, writing in ''[[Vedomosti]]'', said "Today's state-run media in Russia is a continuation of the KGB but much smarter than previous incarnations. They use modern tools, misinformation, confusion, and conflicting signals to prevent any collective responses and actions of citizens."&lt;ref name=Vedo150206/&gt; In 2016 [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Kiselyov|Dmitry Kiselyov]] admitted using fake documents in his program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/pro-kremlin-tv-host-kiselyov-admits-using-fake-documents-in-his-show/569657.html|title=Pro-Kremlin TV Host Kiselyov Admits Using Fake Documents in His Show News|website=The Moscow Times|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''Sobesednik'', Dmitriy Bykov said "the language of today's propaganda has become full of artificial connections. If you're against Russia's covert war in Ukraine then you must be for gluttony, against the motherland, and for soulless American fast food, only protesting against war because you want foie gras."&lt;ref name=Sobes140812/&gt; In February 2015, Irina Prokhorova, leader of the opposition party [[Civic Platform (Russia)|Civic Platform]], commented that [[nationalism]] and "[[us vs. them]]" thinking had grown among Russian media, saying: "If I participate in some talk on television, they start accusing immediately, 'you're not patriotic, you're not a true citizen."&lt;ref name=CBC150204/&gt; Vladislav Inozemtsev wrote, "The rhetoric of aggression and arguments justifying the use of force have become part of Russia's standard informational milieu."&lt;ref name=MT150111/&gt; [[Maria Alekhina]] from [[Pussy Riot]]&lt;ref name=gua140719ma/&gt; and Max Skibinsky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://skibinsky.com/no-russian/ | title=No Russian | date=20 July 2014 | accessdate=22 July 2014 |first=Max |last= Skibinsky }}&lt;/ref&gt; also criticized the Russian media's style of reporting.

''[[Novaya Gazeta]], Slon.ru, Grani.ru'' and ''[[Ekho Moskvy]]'' published some criticism of Russia's policy in [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimea]] and then [[War in Donbass|Donbass]]. A number of them (such as Grani.ru) were [[Internet censorship in Russia|placed on Russia's Internet blacklist]] as a result. Journalists who wrote commentary critical of the Russian government's actions usually experienced [[ostracism]] and were accused of being traitors or fascists by the mainstream media. Some experienced violence.&lt;ref name=GN140805/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT140831/&gt; In March 2014, ''[[Vedomosti]]'' published an article by a Moscow university professor, [[Andrey Zubov]], who was subsequently fired, in which he compared Russia's military intervention in Crimea with Nazi Germany's [[Anschluss]].&lt;ref name=Vedo140301/&gt; Russian historians Alexandr Skobov and Andrey Piontkovski commented on the ideology of the self-declared [[Federal State of Novorossiya]] and concluded that its basic features ([[nationalism]], [[imperialism]]) bear strong similarities with 20th century [[fascism|fascist]] movements.&lt;ref name="skobov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grani.ru/opinion/skobov/m.231294.html |title=Реконструкция ада |trans-title=Reconstruction of hell |publisher=Grani.ru |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=21 July 2014 |first=Aleksandr |last=Skobov |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728052320/http://grani.ru/opinion/skobov/m.231294.html |deadurl=no |archivedate=28 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=53C8DE6037FB2|title=Июльские БУКи|publisher=Kasparov.info|date=18 July 2014|accessdate=21 July 2014|first=Andrei |last= Piontkovsky }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July, Skobov was assaulted by unknown perpetrators and received several stab wounds in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name=GSPB140728&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.spb.ru/1689725-0/ |title=Известный петербургский оппозиционер Александр Скобов госпитализирован после нападения неизвестных |work=Gazeta.Spb |date=28 July 2014 |accessdate=28 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811092334/http://www.gazeta.spb.ru/1689725-0/ |deadurl=no |archivedate=11 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting for [[Ekho Moskvy]] in July 2014, a Russian military expert, Vadim Lukashevich, ridiculed the [[MH17]] crash theories proposed by Russian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://echo.msk.ru/blog/lukashevich_v/1368480-echo/ | script-title=ru:Кто и как нам врет |language= Russian |trans-title=Who is lying to us and how | publisher=Echo Moskvy | date=9 July 2014 | accessdate=31 October 2014 |first=Vadim |last= Lukashevich }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roskomnadzor]] issued a warning to the radio station after two journalists, Sergei Loiko and Timur Olevskiy, discussed the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport|battle for Donetsk Airport]].&lt;ref name=AP141101/&gt; Vitaliy Portnikov, writing in ''Grani.ru'', mocked justifications of Russia's seizures of land.&lt;ref name=Grani140905/&gt; Alexander Podrabinek wrote that Putin had a history of using wars to increase and maintain his power and was now using a war with Ukraine to deflect opposition in Russia.&lt;ref name=Grani140916/&gt; In 2014, [[Boris Nemtsov]] wrote that the Kremlin demonstrated hypocrisy by advocating federalism for Ukraine, stating "Russia itself has not had any sort of federal state for a long time, since 2004", and said Putin sought to "punish" Ukraine in order to discourage a revolution against corruption from taking place in Russia.&lt;ref name=Nemtsov140901/&gt; In ''Profile.ru'', Georgy Kunadze stated that "If a country as similar to us as Ukraine will be able to overcome the post-Soviet syndrome and becomes a successful contemporary state, its example could prove infectious for Russia."&lt;ref name=Profil140915/&gt; In October 2014, Russian economic expert Stepan Demura criticized the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine (2014)|Russian invasion of Ukraine]] and [[2014 Crimean crisis]], saying they would harm the Russian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuromir.tv/bykov-u-nas-mnogo-tolko-vse-impotenty-stepan-demura/|publisher=Neuromir TV|date=9 October 2014|title=Быков у нас много, только все импотенты |trans-title=We have plenty of bulls, but all are impotent }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian politician [[Leonid Gozman]], commenting on [[Ekho Moskvy]]'s blog, said that the only way to save Russia from the generals covertly sending soldiers to die in Ukraine is to "give Ukraine advanced arms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://echo.msk.ru/blog/leonid_gozman/1491486-echo/ | title=Спасите наших солдат - дайте оружие Украине | publisher=Ekho Moskvy | date=2015-02-11 | accessdate=2015-02-15 | first=Leonid |last= Gozman |trans-title=Save our soldiers - give arms to Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2015 a Russian journalist Roman Saponkov published a video of separatist artillery shelling Ukrainian positions from [[Debaltseve]], laughing in the background about "what will RT say", "they must be using dummy ammunition, it's truce now". Russian media have widely reported that and, as result, [[Russia Today TV|RT]] and [[Russian News Agency "TASS"|TASS]] agencies who worked with Saponkov previously both publicly condemned his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tvrain.ru/teleshow/here_and_now/po_poligonu_rabotajut_kotla_to_netu_rt_i_tass_prokommentirovali_smeh_zhurnalistov_pri_obstrele_debaltseva-382034/ | title="По полигону работают, котла-то нету".

In April 2015 former Russian minister of finance [[Alexey Kudrin]] noted that the citizens are now victims of an information war started by the Russian government "against its own citizens", commenting on the process of pushing some independent media stations ([[TV Rain]], [[Tomsk]] TV-2) out of the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://meduza.io/news/2015/04/24/kudrin-zayavil-ob-informatsionnoy-voyne-gosudarstva-s-rossiyskimi-grazhdanami | title=Кудрин заявил об информационной войне государства с российскими гражданами | publisher=Meduza | date=2015-04-25 | accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015 a [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]] journalist, [[Konstantin Goldenzweig]], left his position after 12 years of work, apologizing publicly for "taking part in a collective [[propaganda]] madness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Корреспондент НТВ попросил прощения за участие в "пропагандистском безумии" и уволился с канала|url = http://aru.tv/novost/korrespondent-ntv-poprosil-proshcheniya-za-uchastie-v-propagandistskom-bezumii-i-uvolilsya-s|accessdate = 2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the war in Russia frequently face discrimination and coordinated hate campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-youth-antiwar-ukraine-persecution/27069023.html | title=Russian Youth Pays Price For Speaking Out Over Ukraine | publisher=Radio Free Europe | accessdate= 13 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the most extreme example being the [[assassination of Boris Nemtsov]], which his daughter Zhanna Nemtsova blamed on Putin and Russian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31842858 | title=Nemtsov daughter: Putin 'politically' to blame for murder | publisher=BBC | date=12 March 2015 | accessdate= 13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Vedomosti'', she stated that "Russian propaganda kills. It kills reason and common sense but it also kills human beings."&lt;ref name=GN150619/&gt; She said that Putin's "information machine" "employs criminal propaganda techniques to sow hatred, which in turn spawns violence and terror. Its modus operandi? To [[dehumanise]] the target."&lt;ref name=GN150619/&gt; In June 2015 Alexandr Byvshev, a poet whose anti-war works were banned as "extremist" earlier, was added to an official "list of terrorists and extremists" maintained by the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (''Rosfinmonitoring'') and a "spontaneous collective condemnation" campaign, described as Soviet-style by independent media, began in his village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Росфинмониторинг - Перечень террористов и экстремистов (действующие)|url = http://www.fedsfm.ru/documents/terrorists-catalog-portal-act|website = www.fedsfm.ru|accessdate = 2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Propaganda War: Opposition Sings Kremlin Tune on Ukraine|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/in-moscow-propaganda-war-even-opposition-is-singing-kremlin-tune-a-965487.html|newspaper = Spiegel Online|date = 2014-04-22|access-date = 2015-06-10|first = Christian|last = Neef|first2 = Matthias|last2 = Schepp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reactions===
The Russian media's portrayal of the unrest in Ukraine has received wide criticism from Asian, European, Ukrainian, and North American media and governments, with the coverage often described as "propaganda", and "filled with omissions and inaccuracies".&lt;ref name=CBCjlw/&gt;&lt;ref name=OLJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF141231/&gt;&lt;ref name=BII140718/&gt;&lt;ref name=politico140304/&gt;&lt;ref name=BT150404/&gt; The ''BBC'' reported on the use of misleading images, false narratives, misrepresentation and suppression.&lt;ref name=BBC150422/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to Russian reporting as a "[[disinformation]] campaign" by the Russian government and the ''[[Associated Press]]'' called it a "Kremlin-led [[smear campaign]]."&lt;ref name=AP140315/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTdisinform/&gt; Critics said the coverage aimed to [[discrediting tactic|discredit]] pro-democracy protesters and justify a Russian military intervention.&lt;ref name=AFP140303/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFERL140505/&gt; ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' wrote that Russian state TV "has no qualms about blatantly fabricating the news."&lt;ref name=Spiegel140530/&gt; Writing for ''[[Reuters]]'', Lucian Kim said "Lying – blatantly and repeatedly – is considered a legitimate weapon in the arsenal of hybrid warfare that Putin has unleashed in the struggle for Ukraine."&lt;ref name=Reut141114/&gt;

According to Luc Maffre and [[Peter Pomerantsev]], Russia's narrative has roots in Soviet [[disinformation|dezinformatsiya]] and [[active measures]].&lt;ref name=NEE161021/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politico150104/&gt; Some commentators believed that Russian state-controlled media attempted to sow confusion.&lt;ref name=Guardian20150409/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atlantic140909/&gt;&lt;ref name=JT150429/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFE150603/&gt; Casey Michel said that they were trying "to confuse and complicate, to muddle and muddy the facts on the ground, to create multiple realities to back manifold predispositions."&lt;ref name=Inter150626/&gt; [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] and Ben Nimmo called it "[[information warfare]]" designed to "confuse, befuddle and distract", "to provoke doubt, disagreement and, ultimately, paralysis."&lt;ref name=CEPA-P1/&gt; Some said that Russian state media were disseminating hatred.&lt;ref name=Econ150418/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP150408/&gt; Stephen Ennis of the ''BBC'' stated that Russian state TV "appears to employ techniques of psychological conditioning designed to excite extreme emotions of aggression and hatred in the viewer."&lt;ref name=BBC150204/&gt;

In July 2014, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported that "nearly all Russians derive their news and their sense of what is going on in the world" from Russian state channels, whose broadcasts were described as "feverish anti-Ukrainian, anti-American, and generally [[xenophobic]]" and "full of wild exaggeration about Ukrainian "fascists"."&lt;ref name=NY140717/&gt; According to Sergey Golunov, such portrayals are part of a long-term trend that started in the early 2000s:

{{quote|Most geopolitical textbooks that include conspiracy theories portray the United States as the primary conspirator against Russia and, accordingly, as a threat to Russia's existence, independence, and territorial integrity. Other conspirators cited include China, Germany, and Japan, as well as certain 'alliances' of states in international organisations and the Muslim world. Beyond risks to Russia's territorial integrity, some theories outline support for ethnic and/or religious separatist movements in and around Russia.

Many western and Ukrainian media outlets have accused Russian media of fabrications and misusing images and videos.&lt;ref name=KHPG140618/&gt;&lt;ref name=DB140303/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCnyt/&gt; Reporting for Watson.ch in Switzerland, [[:de:Jürg Vollmer|Jürg Vollmer]] wrote, "For months, Russian propaganda has spread numerous false reports, fake photos and videos of Ukraine."&lt;ref name=Watson140622/&gt; In March 2014, alumni and students at the [[Kyiv-Mohyla School of Journalism]] started a project to identify false reports, ''StopFake.org''.&lt;ref name=Time140708/&gt;&lt;ref name=StopFake/&gt;&lt;ref name=DW140605/&gt;&lt;ref name=Journuk140314/&gt; In April 2014, [[Russia-1]] presented a man by the name of Andrei Petkov as a pro-Russia activist who had been attacked by Ukrainians while [[NTV (Russia)]] called the same man Andrei Petkhov and said he was funding pro-Ukrainian extremists.&lt;ref name=BBC140411/&gt;&lt;ref name=PRG140412/&gt; Maria Tsypko appeared in various roles on Russian channels during the Ukrainian crisis.&lt;ref name=Time140708/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST150301/&gt; In May 2014, [[Russia-1]] used footage from a 2012 conflict in the Russian region of [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] in a report alleging Ukrainian abuses against Russians;&lt;ref name=Spiegel140530/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFERL140520/&gt; the deputy chief described it as an "accidental error" after a Ukrainian website, InfoResist.org, found the 2012 news report.&lt;ref name=MT140520/&gt; The ''Kyiv Post'' reported that a journalist from the same channel, Yevgeni Poddubny, was involved in a plot to [[Frameup|frame]] the Ukrainian army for the death of a Red Cross worker.&lt;ref name=KP141004/&gt; Russian media also presented images from military conflicts in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[South Ossetia]], and [[Syria]] as being from Ukraine.&lt;ref name=DW140605/&gt;&lt;ref name=SF/&gt; ''Telekrytyka'' said an analysis of [[Russia-1]]'s video of a gun battle in Crimea indicated it was staged.&lt;ref name=BBC140312/&gt; The same channel falsely presented a construction site as a "[[concentration camp]]"&lt;ref name=RFE140502/&gt; and a man critical of Euromaidan as a Ukrainian former diplomat, Andriy Veselovskyi.&lt;ref name=PRUA141124/&gt;

Multiple Russian news outlets have been criticized for producing unsubstantiated reports of atrocities. In June 2014, [[LifeNews]] aired footage which it said was evidence of Ukrainian forces using [[white phosphorus]] to attack a village named Semenyovka, near [[Sloviansk]]. [[Human Rights Watch]] analysts rejected the claim, saying that the footage was inconsistent with white phosphorus or an incendiary weapon.&lt;ref name=HRW140620/&gt; Other Russian news organizations aired footage of white phosphorus in [[Iraq]] to support their allegations against Ukraine.&lt;ref name=HRW140620/&gt; In July 2014, [[Channel One Russia]] stated that Ukrainian soldiers had crucified a three-year-old boy in Lenin Square in Sloviansk, although there is no such square in Sloviansk and the only witness to the alleged atrocity lied that she was a refugee from the town.&lt;ref name=spec140726/&gt; The same channel used a 1995 photo of a mass grave in [[Chechnya]] to depict Ukraine.&lt;ref name=RFERL141027/&gt; In August 2014, Russia's [[Zvezda (TV channel)|Zvezda]] channel was accused of editing footage of a failed rocket launch in [[Baikonur]], [[Kazakhstan]] to use in a report claiming Ukraine attacked civilians in [[Makiivka]].&lt;ref name=RFERL140822/&gt; In September 2014, the BBC reported that [[REN TV]] had used images of [[MH17]] plane crash victims to support its claims of atrocities by Ukrainian soldiers in eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref name=BBC140930/&gt; [[NTV (Russia)]]'s documentary ''13 Friends of the Junta'' (August 2014), which described anti-war activists and critics of Russia's policies in Ukraine as "traitors" and supporters of "fascists", also received criticism. ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' reported that footage of [[Andrei Makarevich]]'s concert in [[Sviatohirsk]] "was merged with images of the fighting that he supposedly endorsed. The program never mentions that the concert was for the benefit of Ukraine's internally displaced children."&lt;ref name=MT140826/&gt; ''[[Ukrayina (TV channel)|Ukrayina]]'' aired a documentary demonstrating how the NTV movie attributed actions of Russia-backed separatists to Ukrainian armed forces and used numerous other manipulations.&lt;ref name=Zombi/&gt; ''StopFake.org'' reported that [[Rossiya Segodnya]]'s Ukraina.ru mixed in images of the 2004 [[Beslan massacre]], in southern Russia, into their documentary on Ukrainian children.&lt;ref name=MT150113/&gt;

''BBC News'' found that Russian TV coverage of the [[2 May 2014 Odessa clashes]] was misleading, noting that it "either completely ignored or seriously misrepresented the street clashes that preceded the fatal fire, thus giving the impression that the attack by pro-Ukraine activists on Trade Union House was completely unprovoked", made it seem that all the victims were pro-Russians, used manipulated or questionable evidence to support claims that several people had been murdered, and failed to mention that some pro-Ukrainian activists had attempted to help dying people.&lt;ref name=BBC150507&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/monitoring/odessa-clashes-russian-tv-distorts-events |title=Russian TV's coverage of Odessa clashes |first= Stephen |last= Ennis |work= BBC News |date= 7 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Halya Coynash of the [[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]] said that the Russian state media's coverage disregarded the evidence and a [[United Nations]] report&lt;ref name=Odessadeaths/&gt; and she believed that "fascist" accusations were "an attempt to justify Ukraine's dismemberment."&lt;ref name=AJ140417/&gt;

Particular controversy erupted over English-language television channel [[RT (TV network)|''RT'']], which is owned by the Russian government.

In early March 2014, Shaun Walker of ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported, "Russian state television has gone out of its way to manufacture an image of the [[Euromaidan|protests]] as a uniquely sinister phenomenon; a far-right movement backed by the west with the ultimate goal of destabilising Russia. [...] On the ground in Crimea, what is particularly odd is that the most vociferous defenders of Russian bases against supposed fascists appear to hold far-right views themselves."&lt;ref name=GNSW140304/&gt; In August 2014, BBC News reported, "Russian state TV's coverage of the crisis has been consistently sensationalist, using a wide repertoire of propaganda techniques to incite revulsion and hostility towards the authorities in Kiev."&lt;ref name=BBC140810/&gt; The [[Institute of Modern Russia]] wrote, "Inside Russia, and in areas of eastern Ukraine where Russian television is popular, the Kremlin's political technologists have managed to create a parallel reality where "fascists" have taken power in Kiev, ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine are in mortal danger and the CIA is waging a war against Moscow."&lt;ref name=IMR1411/&gt; In March 2014, historian [[Timothy D.

Timothy D.

Gentile stated that "rather than being divided between Ukrainians and Russians, the Donbas is divided between people who believe in the concept of Ukrainian sovereign statehood and those who are nostalgic of the Soviet past."&lt;ref name=VU150210/&gt; Kim wrote, "As strenuously as the Kremlin propaganda machine raises the hobgoblin of Ukrainian nationalism, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia isn't about ethnicity or language — it's about the kind of country that people want to live in."&lt;ref name=Kim150302/&gt; Pierre Vaux, writing in [[Left Foot Forward]], criticized "the efforts of Kremlin propagandists to portray the Ukrainian government as waging a war on Russian speakers", stating that "large swathes of the government are Russian speakers. So are many of the military leaders in the east, including commanders of volunteer formations, such as [[Semen Semenchenko|Semyon Semyonchenko]]".&lt;ref name=LFF1503/&gt; In addition to [[Russophone]]s from Ukraine, about a hundred Russian citizens joined pro-Ukrainian forces, "[discrediting] incessant Kremlin propaganda that Russian speakers are being persecuted in Ukraine", according to the ''Kyiv Post''.&lt;ref name=KP150424/&gt;

Assertions that the West had broken an agreement against [[Enlargement of NATO|NATO enlargement]] were criticized by some commentators. Pavel Stroilov, who copied Kremlin documents, said that "if the idea of a broken promise is being used as [[casus belli]] in Ukraine, it is being used fraudulently."&lt;ref name=Spec140906/&gt; Citing a 1995 article from ''The New York Times'', [[Anne Applebaum]] said the suggestion that the EU and NATO had provoked Russia was "based on revisionist history promoted by the current Russian regime—and it is wrong. For the record: No treaties prohibiting NATO expansion were ever signed with Russia. No promises were broken."&lt;ref name=Slate141017/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT950810/&gt; In 2014 interviews with ''[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]'' and Germany's ''[[ZDF]]'', [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] also dismissed claims of a non-expansion pledge and said the idea that the West had deceived him was "a myth. The press had a hand in it."&lt;ref name=RBTH141016/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAZ141108/&gt; According to Ben Nimmo of the Central European Policy Institute, the Russian media was "distorting Western perceptions of the conflict. Claims that NATO promised not to expand into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) after German reunification, and that Russia's fear of that enlargement is justifiable, have entered the mainstream media, creating the impression that the West is to blame for Russia's direct assault on Ukraine."&lt;ref name=CEPI150515/&gt; Applebaum and French intellectual [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] rejected assertions that Russia had suffered "humiliation" and "encirclement".&lt;ref name=Slate141017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levy150209/&gt; In an article for the ''Guardian'', Christopher Clark and Kristina Spohr wrote that "misframing the past as a narrative of deceptions, betrayals and humiliations is a profoundly dangerous move" which undermined "the entire fabric of treaties and settlements that make up the post-cold war order."&lt;ref name=GN150524/&gt; Accused of trying to "encircle" Russia and deepening divisions by accepting new members, NATO said that the statement "ignores the facts of geography. Russia's land border is just over 20,000 kilometres long. Of that, 1,215 kilometres, or less than one-sixteenth, face current NATO members" and referred to the "[[Helsinki Final Act]] which says that every state has the right "to belong or not to belong to international organizations, to be or not to be a party to bilateral or multilateral treaties including the right to be or not to be a party to treaties of alliance." And by signing the NATO-Russia Founding Act, Russia agreed to respect states' "inherent right to choose the means to ensure their own security.""&lt;ref name=NATO/&gt;

[[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] and [[Peter Pomerantsev]] noted that Russia's portrayal borrowed from Soviet narratives and terminology. "By telling Russians that, as in 1941-45, they are fighting fascists, the Kremlin aims both to galvanize its own population but also to delegitimize any dissenters: to speak against the war is to betray Russia itself."&lt;ref name=CEPA201608/&gt; Accusations of "provocation" appeared frequently in Russian discourse, turning "the dynamics of the conflict [...] upside down: the attacker becomes the victim and the victim is accused of starting the conflict."&lt;ref name=CEPA201608/&gt;

[[Russia-1]]'s ''Crimea: The Road to the Homeland'', which aired in March 2015, was criticized for distorting a March 2014 incident in which a man named Oleg Gorshkov attempted to stop a truck from breaking through a Crimean checkpoint,&lt;ref name=BBC150316/&gt; for unsupported claims of an anti-Crimean "pogrom" in [[Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi]],&lt;ref name=KP150318/&gt; and for a "sycophantic" Putin interview.&lt;ref name=Slate150319/&gt; The same month, three Russian channels claimed that a 10-year-old girl had been killed by shelling in the Petrovsky region of Donetsk; BBC News said that the story had been "made up".&lt;ref name=BBC150408/&gt;

Writing for Lithuania's [[Delfi (web portal)|''Delfi'']], Viktoras Denisenko stated that "Some Russian propaganda narratives are identifiable and exposed, but quite a lot of them are stealthy and reach their audience and successfully make their way into mass perception where they become entrenched."&lt;ref name=Delfi150126/&gt; In April 2015, [[Lithuania]]'s Radio and Television Commission banned [[RTR-Planeta]] for three months, stating that it had violated the law against "war propaganda, hatred and inciting discord" and ignored repeated warnings.&lt;ref name=AP150408/&gt;&lt;ref name=EUOB150409/&gt; Some Ukrainians responded to Russian reporting with humour while others found it inappropriate.&lt;ref name=KHRPG-Odessa/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP150526/&gt;

In September 2015 [[Linas Antanas Linkevičius|Linas Linkevičius]] called for more response and debunking to claims of Russian media, adding that "a lie is not an alternative point of view", which is an argument frequently used by media presenting "Russian point of view".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = No freedom to lie|url = https://euobserver.com/opinion/130188|accessdate = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Centre for Eastern Studies]], "information campaigns using the stereotype of Russophobia are leading to a consolidation of political nationalism" in Russia; "attacking 'Russophobes' is a way of protecting Russian society itself from having any doubts about the Kremlin's policy", "mobilising them in the face of real or alleged threats", and "restoring psychological comfort" after a failure.&lt;ref name=OSW56/&gt;

==Media in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada==
Many in the Western media described Ukrainian society as deeply "divided".&lt;ref name=CBC131209/&gt; Most reported the [[Euromaidan]] as a protest movement against corruption and for democracy, with a minority presence of far-right groups,&lt;ref name=CBC140119/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCLem/&gt; though some suggested that they played the decisive role in armed confrontations.&lt;ref name=GN140305/&gt; Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yanukovych]]'s accumulation of wealth received coverage.&lt;ref name=PM140225/&gt; Moscow's claims of fascism and western conspiracies were often included for balance.&lt;ref name=Guardian20150409/&gt;

Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] was described variously as a "bully,"&lt;ref name=HP131217/&gt;&lt;ref name=FP140816/&gt; "imperialist,"&lt;ref name=GN140318/&gt;&lt;ref name=TA140723/&gt; and a "brilliant" and skilled leader.&lt;ref name=NR140718/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel131216/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT141220/&gt; As of December 2014, BBC News and Reuters take no position on whether Russia is a party to the armed conflict, saying simply that Russia is "accused" by "Ukraine and its Western allies."&lt;ref name=BBC141209/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reut141228/&gt; A few days after the [[OSCE]]'s Observer Mission wrote that it "continued to observe high numbers of dumper trucks transporting coal from the Luhansk region to the Russian Federation,"&lt;ref name=OSCE141224/&gt; ''[[Reuters]]'' reported on Russia's offer to sell coal to Ukraine, saying "months of fighting a pro-Russian uprising has disrupted coal supplies" but not mentioning the OSCE's observations.&lt;ref name=Reut141227/&gt; In 2015, the BBC and ''The Guardian'' continued to portray [[Odessa]] and [[Kharkiv]] as deeply divided,&lt;ref name=Divisions/&gt; despite polls showing that supporters of separatism or joining Russia were a small minority.&lt;ref name=ODKH/&gt; Western media avoided describing anti-Ukrainian foreign fighters as foreigners invading Ukraine, preferring to describe them as "rebels" or "separatists".&lt;ref name=AC161021/&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described a Russian citizen, who had no connection to Ukraine prior to taking up arms against its government, as a "pro-Russian rebel".&lt;ref name=Telegraph161017/&gt;

Some western sources stated that the pro-Russian unrest was fomented by the Russian government and [[Russian special forces]].&lt;ref name=MT140311/&gt; Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' accused Russia of "manufacturing of chaos in Ukraine" and described the chaos as "made in Moscow."&lt;ref name=TGAM140718/&gt;&lt;ref name=TGAM140718b/&gt; Some outlets proclaimed a "new cold war".&lt;ref name=GNbia/&gt; Seeing similarities with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s annexation of various lands with German-language speakers, such as [[Austria]] and the [[Sudetenland]], some called the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] Russia's [[Anschluss]].&lt;ref name=DB150105/&gt; On [[Tony Brenton]]'s proposal to make a deal with Putin, Con Coughlin of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote, "This seems uncomfortably similar to the [[appeasement]] arguments that were made in the 1930s – rather than confront Hitler over his threatening behaviour towards Germany's European neighbours, we should reach an accommodation with the Nazis."&lt;ref name=TEL141219/&gt; Conversely, [[Peter Hitchens]] of ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' accused the West of warmongering attitudes towards Russia: "we think we are the heroes, setting out with brave hearts to confront the Dark Lord, and free the saintly Ukrainians from his wicked grasp", and "stupid, ill-informed people nowadays like to compare Mr Putin with Hitler".&lt;ref name=Hitchens/&gt;

Ian Birrell, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', criticized Western leaders, saying they had done "little more than talk tough" and "Their failure is symbolized by verbal acrobatics as they avoid using the word "invasion", talking instead of "incursion" and "aggression.""&lt;ref name=IND140901/&gt; Commenting on [[Barack Obama]]'s refusal to send weapons to Ukraine as part of his policy of "no military solution" and avoiding escalation, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "weak U.S. and European support has allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin to impose his own military solution as he has repeatedly escalated his aggression."&lt;ref name=WP140919/&gt; ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' stated "The West has dithered under the assumption that providing lethal aid to Ukraine would escalate the conflict. But a sanctions-dominant approach clearly has not prevented escalation. Indeed, with France's determination to sell the Mistral ships to Russia, the West is in the peculiar position of arming the aggressor and forbidding arms to the victim."&lt;ref name=FP140816/&gt; [[Paul A. Goble]] was critical of Western governments' response, saying "by signalling that it will not oppose a particular case of aggression, the West has taught Putin and his regime a lesson, but very much the wrong one: aggression works and after "a decent interval" will be ignored, have no consequences for relations with the West, and then can be repeated."&lt;ref name=IM140923/&gt; In September 2014, ''[[GlobalPost]]'''s Gregory Feifer commented on the Ukrainian perspective, stating, "the arguments of some in the West who preach tolerance for Putin are generating anguish and disbelief – and increasingly outrage and hostility – toward the countries whose values Ukrainians believe they're being left alone to defend."&lt;ref name=GP140923/&gt; In February 2015, Charles Crawford of ''The Telegraph'' concluded that Putin had been "rewarded for his bullying."&lt;ref name=Teleg150213/&gt;

In ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', Oliver Bullough said that Western countries, including the UK, Austria, and Switzerland, had enabled the theft of billions by the Yanukovych government and were making little effort to track and return Ukrainian money, concluding, "If cynicism spreads among Ukrainians and they conclude that the West and Russia are as bad as each other -- and that, in essence, Westerners say pretty things but in reality care only for money -- then the revolution will fail."&lt;ref name=FP140909/&gt;

A number of U.K. and U.S. commentators echoed the Russian state media's portrayal of the Ukrainian crisis. Seumas Milne, John Pilger, John Mearsheimer, Stephen Cohen, and others blamed "neo-Nazis" in Ukraine and "NATO expansion", expressed understanding for Putin whom the West had "provoked", and presented Ukraine as a pawn which Russia was entitled to treat as its [[sphere of influence]].&lt;ref name=GN140305/&gt;&lt;ref name=gua140513&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/13/ukraine-us-war-russia-john-pilger |title= In Ukraine, the US is dragging us towards war with Russia |first= John |last= Pilger |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 13 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JJM&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2014-08-18/why-ukraine-crisis-west-s-fault |title= Why the Ukraine Crisis Is the West's Fault |issue= September/October 2014 |first= John J. |last = Mearsheimer |authorlink = John Mearsheimer |journal= [[Foreign Affairs]] |date= September–October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WAJ140710/&gt;

[[Seumas Milne]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized NATO's eastward expansion, and stated that "it is hardly surprising that Russia has acted to stop the more strategically sensitive and neuralgic Ukraine falling decisively into the western camp, especially given that Russia's only major warm-water naval base is in Crimea".&lt;ref name=GN140305/&gt; Likewise, [[John J.

Some writers for western newspapers, including [[Stephen F.

Some portrayals of Ukrainians were described as "patronizing", reducing Ukrainians to "pawns" of the CIA.&lt;ref name=DB150105/&gt; [[Alexander J.

In March 2014, Alan Yuhas wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'', "The occupation of Crimea by pro-Russian forces has been accompanied by a remarkable propaganda push by Moscow – an effort that has infiltrated western media and helped redefine the debate in Russia's favor."&lt;ref name=GNAY140317/&gt; In ''[[World Affairs]],'' Arthur Milikh criticized Western journalism, saying "much of the Western media, unwittingly complicit, maintain a spirit of scepticism to avoid open accusations against [Putin]. For example, many of those labelled Ukrainian "separatists" are in fact Russian-trained and -equipped troops."&lt;ref name=WA-Milikh/&gt; Some suggested [[false balance]] in Western reports on Ukraine. [[Paul A.

[[Occidental College]]'s [[Agnia Grigas]] and the Cicero Foundation's Marcel Van Herpen wrote that Russian propaganda "has insinuated itself into and been internalized by the Western media, complementing Russia's military tactics in achieving Putin's expansionist goals."&lt;ref name=Forbes140917/&gt; Laas Leivat of ''Estonian Life'' also found that Western media were "[[Internalization|internalizing]]" Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as an "irreparably dysfunctional" and "deeply divided" country.&lt;ref name=EL150222/&gt; [[Institute of Modern Russia|Interpretermag.com]]'s [[Catherine A.

When the Ukrainian government or even Western governments discuss the presence of Russian weapons or soldiers in the east, the media present their statements and then the Russian denial as if they were of equal value, but they are not."&lt;ref name=HIPS-Report/&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' was criticized for articles by Damien Sharkov and Felicity Capon.&lt;ref name=SF150208/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICDS150526/&gt; Sharkov and the executive director of [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Kenneth Roth]], falsely claimed that Ukrainian lawmakers had passed a motion allowing deserters to be shot.&lt;ref name=SF150208/&gt; Halya Coynash of the [[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]] found western reporting of the [[2015 Ukraine bus attack]] lacking: "The BBC and other western media reports present the Ukrainian side, then the militant denial, leaving out any detail about the labyrinth of different versions from the latter."&lt;ref name=KHPG150115/&gt;

==Media in Ukraine==
[[Ukrainian media]] stated that the unrest in Ukraine was manufactured by Russia.&lt;ref name=MT140311/&gt; They have consistently accused Russia of being a provocateur, and of controlling the anti-government groups behind the scenes.&lt;ref name=NRdanger/&gt; The annexation of Crimea was viewed as illegitimate and illegal.&lt;ref name=GNill/&gt; Following the start of the [[War in Donbass]], the Ukrainian government and some media described the armed groups of the self-proclaimed [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic]] as "terrorists" and "separatists" and referred to the military operation against the DPR and LPR as an "anti-terrorist" operation.&lt;ref name=MT140311/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSterror/&gt;

In September 2014, ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' was critical of the West's response to the crisis, stating "Ukraine can never surrender its nation and the West should be ashamed of its ongoing [[appeasement]] of Putin, who is trying to veto the Western, democratic aspirations of Ukrainians who do not share his warped dream of recreating a version of the Soviet Union."&lt;ref name=KP140911/&gt;

In April 2014, historian [[Timothy D.

Putin's idea of defending Russian speakers in Ukraine is absurd on many levels, but one of them is this: people can say what they like in Russian in Ukraine, but they cannot do so in Russia itself."&lt;ref name=FAZ140416/&gt; In August 2014, BBC News stated that Ukrainian coverage depicted Russia in a "negative light but language has been restrained in comparison to that on Russian TV."&lt;ref name=BBC140810/&gt; They reported that Ukrainian media were increasingly airing "direct accusations" and "harsh criticism" of Russia but "alternative opinions are also aired, and presenters make no attempt to block dissent."&lt;ref name=BBC140810/&gt; Conversely, Joseph L.

In December 2014, [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned the creation of the Ukrainian [[Ministry of Information (Ukraine)|Ministry of Information]], which is intended to counteract "Russian propaganda", observing that "In a democratic society, the media should not be regulated by the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RWB Opposes Creation of Information Ministry |publisher=Reporters without Borders |date=2 December 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url=http://en.rsf.org/ukraine-rwb-opposes-creation-of-02-12-2014,47325.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Japan's ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' said, "The latest ceasefire accord is defective in that it does not mention the withdrawal of thousands of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine.

The "modernization partnership" was pursued at any cost. Warnings from Poland or the [[Baltic states]] were dismissed as doomsday predictions." He stated, "Of course, the Kremlin bears responsibility for the war in Ukraine" but blamed Germany's and Europe's weakness on Berlin: "For too long, the Foreign Ministry followed comfortable patterns of thinking, engaged in too much [[appeasement]], integrated too deeply with a power over which we ultimately have no control."&lt;ref name=ZGO1409/&gt; In ''New Eastern Europe'', Dustin Dehez said that the German government was interested primarily in preserving its economic ties with Russia and "seemed ready to sacrifice not just the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but also its relationship with its Eastern European allies."&lt;ref name=NEE140819/&gt; In his article for ''[[Die Zeit]]'', Boris Schumatsky said, "Putin triumphs when other world leaders allow the lies to go unchallenged.

Western media have generally referred to armed anti-government and pro-Russian groups in Ukraine as "rebels" or "separatists."&lt;ref name=MT140728/&gt; ''Reuters'' describes the events in eastern Ukraine as an "[[uprising]]" and "revolt" by "[[separatists]]."&lt;ref name=Reut141228/&gt; Casey Michael of ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' questioned the use of "Ukrainian" and "rebels" to describe the armed pro-Russian groups, saying that their leadership and many fighters were "outsiders and usurpers, men with either mercenary or imperial motivations."&lt;ref name=MT140728/&gt; Laas Leivat of ''Estonian Life'' criticised the use of the term "separatists," saying it "obscures the reality of the situation" and "supports the Kremlin's version of events."&lt;ref name=EL150222/&gt; As of December 2014, ''BBC News'' and ''Reuters'' prefer the terms "crisis" and "conflict" over "war".&lt;ref name=BBC141209/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reut141228/&gt; The word "invasion" was usually avoided, a choice criticized by [[Garry Kasparov]], Ian Birrell of ''[[The Independent]]'', and Trudy Rubin of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.&lt;ref name=IND140901/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasparov140830/&gt;&lt;ref name=Phila141123/&gt; In April 2015, Julian Reichelt of [[Bild.de]] wrote that the "deceptive language of politics" (e.g. efforts "to prevent a war in Ukraine") often influenced reporting, making journalists "complicit in disguising what is actually happening in Ukraine, where a war is already in full swing."&lt;ref name=PEU150427/&gt;

Peter Dickinson stated that the Western media was "[[enabling]]" Russian aggression against Ukraine.&lt;ref name=AC160803/&gt; He called it "absurd" that Western media described a foreigner who had arrived from Russia to fight against Ukraine, such as [[Arsen Pavlov]], as a "pro-Russian separatist" and stated that the media was "creating the impression of a Russia-leaning local who was defending his democratic rights."&lt;ref name=AC161021/&gt;

Russia's actions were described as [[terrorism]] by [[Alexander J. Motyl]] of ''[[World Affairs]]'',&lt;ref name=MotylTerror/&gt; Marius Laurinavičius writing for [[Lithuania]]n [[Delfi (web portal)|Delfi]],&lt;ref name=DelfiLT141217/&gt; and [[Taras Kuzio]] in ''New Eastern Europe''.&lt;ref name=NEE150122/&gt; Brian Bonner, chief editor of the ''[[Kyiv Post]]'', decided to avoid the term, stating "While I certainly believe Russia and its proxies are committing terror in the east and are guilty of war crimes, the label "terrorist" does nothing to illuminate the reasons for their actions or present the combatants as human beings."&lt;ref name=Bonner150209/&gt; He also avoids the term "rebel", finding it "too gentle", and "civil war", saying "This conflict simply would not be happening if it were not instigated by Russia. There is no fratricidal conflict in the east among Ukrainians, nor is there much support for any kind of secessionist movement in the Donbas."&lt;ref name=Bonner150209/&gt; [[Anne Applebaum]], in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', also questioned the use of "civil war", describing the war in eastern Ukraine as "an artificial conflict, run by Russian security and enhanced by a sophisticated pan-European [[disinformation]] campaign."&lt;ref name=WP150208/&gt; Criticizing the term's use in German media, Reichelt wrote that it "comes straight out of Putin's propaganda machine, which frames the war as a national issue rather than an act of aggression. Calling it a [civil war] is an insult to the people who are being attacked, to our readers, and to our profession."&lt;ref name=PEU150427/&gt;

== Public reactions and social media ==
According to an April 2014 poll by the [[Razumkov Centre]] in Ukraine, the Russian media was trusted by 12.7% of respondents, the western media by 40.4%, and the Ukrainian media by 61.5%.&lt;ref name=PRUA140519/&gt; After a survey conducted from 5–13 September 2014, the [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]] reported 5% of Ukrainians had a "great deal" or "fair amount" of confidence in the Russian media, 42% in the Western media, and 67% in media based in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=IFES-Sept2014/&gt;

The Russian media had more influence in parts of [[Donbass]].&lt;ref name=Politico150104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reut141114/&gt; Having spoken to anti-Kiev protesters in [[Donetsk]] in March 2014, Lucian Kim of [[Reuters]] said, "In my 20 years as a journalist, I had never experienced such hostility – especially from a group that was supposedly facing persecution. [...] Besides a few stock phrases about a "referendum" and "the illegitimate Kiev junta," I also got no answers as to their motivations. It was like trying to have a conversation with a TV – Russian state TV."&lt;ref name=Reut141114/&gt;

A controversy developed over some reactions by the public to the media's coverage. In March 2014, the Polish version of ''[[Newsweek]]'' expressed suspicion that Russia was employing people to "bombard" its website with pro-Russian comments on Ukraine-related articles.&lt;ref name=NWPL140304/&gt; Poland's governmental [[computer emergency response team]] later confirmed that pro-Russia commentary had "flooded" Polish internet portals at the start of the Ukrainian crisis.&lt;ref name=JT150429/&gt; In May 2014, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted a large number of pro-Kremlin comments on news articles relating to Ukraine, which the newspaper believed was an "orchestrated pro-Kremlin campaign".&lt;ref name=gn140504/&gt; ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', and [[Reuters]] reported that German-language media websites had been "flooded" with pro-Russia comments since March 2014.&lt;ref name=Spiegel140530/&gt;&lt;ref name=SDZ140613/&gt;&lt;ref name=NZZ140629/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reut141125/&gt; ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'', ''[[BuzzFeed]]'', ''[[Yle]]'', ''[[:ru:Мой район (газета)|Moi Raion]]'', [[Agence France-Presse]], [[Associated Press]], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and others reported on allegations that a Russian company, the [[Internet Research Agency]], employed hundreds of workers to write comments in both Russian and western news sites.&lt;ref name=BF140602/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel150601/&gt;&lt;ref name=PaidComm/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP150405/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT150602/&gt; Dubbed a "troll factory/house/farm" by the media,&lt;ref name=Spiegel150601/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT150602/&gt; it operates out of a building on Savushkin Street in [[Saint Petersburg]], following a move from the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name=AFP150405/&gt; The agency may also have a location in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Spiegel150601/&gt; Jürg Vollmer of ''Watson.ch'' reported that Putin had developed the company since 2011 to "systematically manipulate public opinion on the Internet."&lt;ref name=Watson140622/&gt; Ilya Klishin of ''[[Dozhd]]'' said his sources suggested that Russian expats in Germany, India, and Thailand were also involved.&lt;ref name=MT140521/&gt; Russian blogger Anton Nosik said in August 2014 that "Comments were already serving as a well-financed Kremlin instrument of war against the opposition, even five years ago [...] But what's absolutely clear is that now they're spending more money on Ukraine than they ever spent against Aleksei Navalny, or Ekho Moskvy, "Kommersant," gazeta.ru, and all the rest."&lt;ref name=RFE140812/&gt; Paid commenters may earn 45,000 roubles a month or 65,000 if they know a foreign language.&lt;ref name=RFE150325/&gt; Their tasks included presenting Ukraine as a tool to weaken Russia, the Ukrainian government as fascist, Vladimir Putin as superior to leaders of other countries, and Western countries as depraved.&lt;ref name=AFP150405/&gt;&lt;ref name=GN150402/&gt; The Kremlin is also active on [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[LiveJournal]], [[VK.com]], and [[Odnoklassniki]].&lt;ref name=Spiegel150601/&gt;&lt;ref name=GVO150402/&gt;&lt;ref name=GVO150130/&gt;&lt;ref name=Facebook/&gt;

A poll conducted in December 2014 found that 63% of Germans have "little or no trust" in the coverage by German media of the Ukrainian conflict. This is compared to 53% for the coverage of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] and 40% for coverage about the recent [[Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer#2014 strikes|strike of German locomotive drivers]]. When respondents who said that they do not trust German media when it comes to Ukraine were asked why they have mistrust, 31% gave the reason as "coverage is one-sided/not objective", 18% said that "the coverage does not correspond to reality", and 9% said "the coverage is imprecise/not sufficiently comprehensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ZAPP Studie: Vertrauen in Medien ist gesunken |trans-title=ZAPF study: Trust in media has sunk |language=German |newspaper=[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] |date=17 December 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url=http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/zapp/ZAPP-Studie-Vertrauen-in-Medien-gesunken,medienkritik100.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225231734/http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/zapp/ZAPP-Studie-Vertrauen-in-Medien-gesunken%2Cmedienkritik100.html |archivedate=25 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vertrauen in Medien-Berichterstattung über den Ukraine-Konflikt |trans-title=Trust in media coverage of the conflict in Ukraine |language=German |publisher=ZAPP |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url=https://www.tagesschau.de/kultur/zapp-umfrage-101.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assaults, intimidation, and restrictions on press freedom==

===Ukraine===
Some journalists were physically assaulted or intimidated during the Ukrainian crisis. [[Tetiana Chornovol]], a journalist who was one of the leaders of the [[Euromaidan]] protests, was severely beaten and sustained a concussion in December 2013 in [[Boryspil]].&lt;ref name=Teleg131225/&gt; Also during Euromaidan, [[Ihor Lutsenko (politician)|Ihor Lutsenko]] was attacked by unknown assailants and [[RFERL]] journalists were injured by riot police.&lt;ref name=RFE140123/&gt; According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], Vyacheslav Veremyi (''Vesti'') died after he was pulled from his taxi and shot by unknown assailants and 27 other journalists were injured in Kiev on 18 and 19 February in attacks mostly by [[Berkut (special police force)|Berkut]] and unknown assailants.&lt;ref name=RWB140219/&gt; Oleksandr Yaroshenko (writing as Serhiy Levitanenko), an [[Odessa]] journalist who was critical of Vladimir Putin, was beaten on three occasions in the first half of 2014 and his apartment set on fire.&lt;ref name=KHPG140513/&gt;

Journalists were particularly vulnerable in eastern parts of Ukraine.&lt;ref name=OHCHR140515/&gt;&lt;ref name=CPJ140414/&gt; In April 2014, staff of ''Provintsiya'', the local newspaper in [[Kostiantynivka]], [[Donetsk Oblast]], were threatened for reporting critically on the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and the newsroom was burned down.&lt;ref name=CPJ140423/&gt; In May 2014, ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' reported that pro-Russian militants were conducting "systematic abductions" of journalists.&lt;ref name=DB140518/&gt; Irma Krat was held by insurgents from April to July 2014, accused of beheading [[Berkut (special police force)|Berkut]] members, and injected with a drug before being interrogated.&lt;ref name=RFE140807/&gt; After [[Oleksiy Matsuka]] reported on links between pro-Russian separatists and Moscow, his car was set on fire and leaflets calling him a traitor were circulated in his hometown, [[Donetsk]].&lt;ref name=TS141202/&gt; ''Pro Gorod'', a pro-Ukraine newspaper in [[Torez]], was attacked in April 2014.&lt;ref name=AFP140420/&gt; On 21 April 2014, pro-Russian insurgents in [[Sloviansk]] abducted [[Simon Ostrovsky]] of ''[[Vice News]]'', holding him in a basement and beating him before releasing him on 24 April.&lt;ref name=Vice140428/&gt; [[Vyacheslav Ponomarev (public figure)|Vyacheslav Ponomarev]] said Ostrovsky "needs to learn a lesson" and Ponomarev's spokeswoman, Stella Khorosheva, accused Ostrovsky of "not reporting in a correct way."&lt;ref name=DB140423/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFE140424/&gt; In May 2014, German journalist Stefan Scholl and Pavel Kanygin of ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' were abducted in [[Artemivsk, Donetsk Oblast|Artemivsk]] by four men who accused Kanygin of "failure to make it clear that the insurgents were good guys fighting fascist oppression."&lt;ref name=DB140518/&gt; Scholl was soon released and Kanygin was also released after the abductors were paid.&lt;ref name=DB140518/&gt; Serhiy Lefter, a Ukrainian journalist for Poland's Open Dialogue Foundation, was kidnapped and held for three weeks by insurgents in Sloviansk.&lt;ref name=RFE140512/&gt; Sergey Zakharov, an artist from Donetsk whose work satirized pro-Russian fighters, was held for six weeks and tortured.&lt;ref name=FP141021/&gt;

Other journalists who disappeared in militant-controlled areas included Roman Cheremsky, Valery Makeyev, Yehor Vorobyov, Yury Lelyavsky, Dmitry Potekhin, and Oleksandr Bilokobylsky.&lt;ref name=KHRPG140918/&gt; Taken prisoner by [[Lugansk People's Republic|LPR]] militants on 9 January 2015, [[Luhansk]] journalist Maria Varfolomeyeva was accused in March of spying for the Ukrainian military in late January, although she was in captivity at the time.&lt;ref name=KHPG150406/&gt; Sometimes family members of journalists were also seized. In August 2014, when militants of the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] were unable to find Donetsk journalist Viktoria Ishchenko, who had moved to Kiev, they took her parents.&lt;ref name=KHRPG140813/&gt; The same month, militants from the [[Luhansk People's Republic]] seized Luhansk journalist Serhiy Sakadynsky, holding him until January 2015, and his wife, Mariya Havak, holding her for two months.&lt;ref name=KHRPG150106/&gt; The Institute for Mass Information and the Independent Media Union of Ukraine – which began holding annual Enemies of the Press awards in 2007 – reported in June 2015 that the DPR and LPR were the most dangerous places in Ukraine for the media, citing 64 cases of abducted journalists, 21 cases in which journalists were beaten up, and 35 attacks on media offices which refused to cooperate with militants.&lt;ref name=KHPG150606/&gt;

Some journalists and media workers died during the war in eastern Ukraine. On 24 May 2014, an exchange of mortar fire near [[Sloviansk]] resulted in the deaths of Italian photojournalist Andrea Rocchelli and his interpreter, Andrey Mironov, and leg wounds to French photographer William Roguelon.&lt;ref name=RWB140526/&gt; Rossiya 24 journalist Igor Kornelyuk and  sound engineer Anton Voloshin died on 17 June 2014 during mortar fire near [[Luhansk]].&lt;ref name=KHPG140618/&gt; Anatoliy Klyan of [[Channel One Russia]] died on 29 June 2014 in Donetsk Oblast when his bus came under fire while approaching a Ukrainian military unit in the middle of the night.&lt;ref name=KHPG140703/&gt; Andrei Stenin died in unclear circumstances.&lt;ref name=IM140930/&gt; Serhiy Nikolayev, a photojournalist for ''[[Segodnya]]'', died on 28 February 2015 from wounds sustained during shelling in Pisky, Donetsk Oblast.&lt;ref name=AP150228/&gt;

The Ukrainian television journalist [[:ru:Коцаба, Руслан Петрович|Ruslan Kotsaba]] was arrested by Ukrainian authorities on suspicion of treason for posting a video on YouTube urging people to dodge the new military draft. He faces imprisonment of up to fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ukraine arrests journalist after call to dodge draft |date=9 February 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |newspaper=Japan Times |agency=AFP |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/02/09/world/ukraine-arrests-journalist-call-dodge-draft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amnesty International insists on reveal of a journalist calling the mobilization illegal  |url=http://igcp.eu/hronika-prestupleniy/amnesty-international-insists-reveal-journalist-calling-mobilization-illegal?language=en  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418062809/http://igcp.eu/hronika-prestupleniy/amnesty-international-insists-reveal-journalist-calling-mobilization-illegal?language=en  |archivedate=2015-04-18 |date=10 February 2016 |accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 18, the editor of ''The Working Class'' and former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada [[:ru:Бондарчук, Александр Васильевич|Alexander Bondarchuk]] was arrested under paragraph 1, article 110 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, "Violation of territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine", for publishing two articles in his newspaper.

In May 2016, the Ukrainian hacker website [[Myrotvorets]], which is curated by [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] and Ukrainian authorities, published a list of journalists who received press accreditation in [[Donetsk People's Republic]] in order to cover war on both sides; the journalists have been labeled as "collaborators with terrorists". Since the publication, a number of these journalists (including [[Hromadske.TV]] reporter Yekaterina Sergatskova and freelance journalist Roman Stepanovich) received death threats in emails and phone calls. The data publication was condemned by David Weisbrot, the chair of the Australian Press Council, as well as G7 ambassadors to Kyiv and an international group of journalists, including the BBC, The New York Times, The Daily Beast, and The Economist.&lt;ref name=DB161205/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP161205/&gt;

Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] found a rise in attacks on the press.&lt;ref name=CPJ150429/&gt; [[Roskomnadzor]] required that news outlets register as Russian entities by 1 April 2015. The body granted registration to 232 out of 3,121 outlets (8%) by that date.&lt;ref name=CPJ150429/&gt; The Institute for Mass Information and the Independent Media Union of Ukraine noted 32 cases of censorship, 13 abductions or illegal detentions of journalists, and 11 attacks on editorial offices.&lt;ref name=KHPG150606/&gt; Media were threatened with denial of registration if they criticized the annexation or described the situation as an "annexation" or "occupation" of Crimea.&lt;ref name=Razom150615/&gt; They were prevented from taking photographs or recording video of pro-Ukrainian gatherings.&lt;ref name=Razom150615/&gt;

===Russia===
Some journalists were assaulted and intimidated in Russia, including Vladimir Romensky ([[Dozhd]]), Ilya Vasyunin (Russkaya Planeta), Nina Petlyanova ([[Novaya Gazeta]]), Irina Tumakova (Fontanka.ru), Sergey Kovalchenko and Sergey Zorin (Telegraph agency).&lt;ref name=OSCE141127/&gt; Alexandr Skobov was stabbed in July 2014 after writing an article for ''Grani.ru'' criticising the ideology of the self-declared [[Federal State of Novorossiya]].&lt;ref name=GSPB140728/&gt; In August 2014, Arseniy Vesnin sustained a concussion in an attack while he was reporting for [[Ekho Moskvy]] on demonstrators supporting Ukraine in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name=RFERL140825/&gt; [[Lev Shlosberg]] (Pskovskaya Guberniya) was beaten unconscious in August 2014 in [[Pskov]] while investigating the alleged deaths of Russian paratroopers in eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref name=MT140831/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSCE141127/&gt; A [[BBC]] crew was attacked in September 2014 in [[Astrakhan]], also while investigating Russian soldiers' deaths.&lt;ref name=BBC140918/&gt; Ksenia Batanova, a journalist and producer for ''[[Dozhd]]'', a channel which reported extensively on the deaths, was attacked the same month in central Moscow, sustaining a fractured skull and concussion.&lt;ref name=BF140914/&gt; [[Timur Kuashev]], a journalist for ''Dosh'' magazine and human rights activist, openly criticized the invasion of Eastern Ukraine as well as abuses by security services in southern Russia. On 1 August 2014 he was kidnapped in [[Nalchik]] and killed by unknown perpetrators.&lt;ref name=GN140805/&gt;

'''Melanau''' or ''A-Likou'' (meaning River people) are an ethnic group indigenous to [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]]. They are among the earliest settlers&lt;ref&gt;'The Report: Sarawak 2008'' Oxford Business Group, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; of Sarawak. They speak in the [[Melanau language]], which is part of North Bornean branch of [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]. In 2010, there are estimated to be 123,410 who consider themselves Melanau, making it the fifth largest ethnic group in Sarawak (after [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]], [[Sarawak Malay|Malays]] and [[Bidayuh]]). Even though a minority in Sarawak, Melanau forms a large part of Sarawak's political sphere, 5 out of 6 of [[List of Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak|Yang di-Pertua Negeri]] of Sarawak is of Melanau ethnicity including the current Yang di-Pertua Tun Pehin Sri [[Abdul Taib Mahmud]] and 2 out of 5 of [[List of Chief Ministers of Sarawak|Chief Ministers]] of Sarawak are ethnic Melanau.

==Origins==
[[File:Tall House, Sarawak (7246626700).jpg|thumb|left| The traditional Melanau tall house. There are only few left standing in the world.]]
In the 19th century, the Melanaus settled in scattered communities along the main tributaries of the Rajang River in Central Sarawak. Melanau or problematic Kajang speaking tribes such as the Sekapan, the Rajang, the Tanjung and the Kanowit gradually moved and assimilated into Dayak migrations settling in the Rajang. The Melanau people were regarded as a sub-group of the purported [[Klemantan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Hose|author2=William Mcdougall|title=Borneo Shamanism|year=2015|publisher=Charles Hose|isbn=605-176-617-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Punan (or [[Punan Bah]]) people are also closely linked to the last riverine dwelling Melanau communities previously inhabiting the middle and upper Rejang tributaries. The Kajang language is kept relatively alive by the isolated Sekapan communities Kapit division of Sarawak.

The Melanau are considered among the earliest settlers in Sarawak. The name Melanau was not used by the Melanau to refer to themselves until recently. They call themselves ''a-likou'' meaning 'people of the river'. Legend has it that the name Melanau was given by the Malays of Brunei to the inhabitants of the coastal swamp flats and riverbanks of central Sarawak which might signifies "coast-dweller".&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/East-Southeast-Asia/Melanau-Orientation.html|author=|year=|title=Melanau - Orientation|work=|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eda Green, writing in 1909, referred to "...&amp;nbsp;the Milanes, whose girls are as fair as any Europeans and the belles of Borneo."&lt;ref name="EG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/asia/sarawak/green/01.html|author=Eda Green|year=1909|title=Borneo: The Land of River and Palm|work=Project Canterbury|accessdate=26 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
Grouping-wise, the Melanaus can be classified into the following;
* Melanau [[Matu, Sarawak|Matu]]-[[Daro]]
* Melanau [[Pulau Bruit]].
* Melanau [[Seduan (state constituency)|Seduan]]
* Melanau [[Dalat District|Dalat]]
* Melanau Oya
* Melanau [[Mukah]]
* Melanau Belawai-Rajang
* Melanau Rejang
* Melanau [[Balingian]]
* Melanau [[Bintulu]], and
* Melanau [[Miri District|Miri]].

The largest group is the Matu-Daro Each group has its own characteristic dialect, but they all share the same cultural and linguistic background. An exception is the Melanau Bintulu dialect, which can hardly be understood by speakers of other dialects and is thought by many linguists to hardly fit into the Melanau language grouping. This tribe is also known as "Vaie" whose language is very similar to Punan Lovuk Pandan and Punan Bah. Their early establishment were from Lavang and Segan riverine areas.
 
The Melanau languages have been divided in the following five groups&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/melanau ''Melanau'' Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Central, consists of dialects from Mukah-Oya, Balingian, Bruit, Dalat, Igan, Sarikei, Segahan, Prehan, Segalang, Siteng.
*Matu-Daro
*[[Kanowit]]-Tanjong
*[[Sibu]], consists of dialects from Seduan and Banyok.
*Seru (''extinct'')

Another Melanau group worth mentioning and inclusion is the Melanau Igan. They live in kampungs by the Igan River, e.g. Kampung Skrang, Kampung Tengah, Kampung Hilir, that border the Mukah - (Matu-Daro) district. The main language is Melanau. However some speak a local Malay dialect. This group of Melanau is probably all Muslim. They have mainly adopted Malay culture, while preserving some aspects of Melanau culture. It is believed that this group was originally Malays who settled in the area. However, intermarriage with Melanaus over many generations produced new generations who considered themselves Melanau.

Similar to the Igan Melanaus ancestral beginnings, many Melanaus who had migrated to different areas in Sarawak experienced the same transformation. A group of Matu Melanaus settled in Bintawa area in Kuching after World War 2. However their offspring, even though mostly Melanaus by blood, normally do not speak the language. They are considered as Malays. However, as a point of interest, the new secondary school built in Bintawa Kuching in 2007 is named SMK Matu Baru. Many areas in Kuching notably Petra Jaya, Lundu and Santubong do have a significant Melanau population. Miri, Bintulu and Sibu are also places where there is a significant Melanau population.

However the 'Bin' which mean "son of" and 'Binti', meaning "daughter of" factors in all their names (be they are Muslim, Christian or "Likou") had probably confused the census workers (read the following paragraph). One of the reasons the Muslim Melanau 'migrated' to become Malay is that during the registration of birth of the newborns, they will automatically being assumed as Malay if the parents don't inform the birth and death registration officer of their racial preference.

==Culture, religion and economy==


The Melanau were traditionally fishermen as well as padi and sago farmers. Some were skilled boat builders. They used to live in tall stilt and long houses, but nowadays, they live in Malaysian kampung-style houses (individual &amp; separated houses). Because of religious similarity, the majority of Melanaus live socially and culturally like the rest of the Malays in Malaysia.

The Melanau are one of the rare ethnic groups in Malaysia to have a population that remains more or less constant in numbers. This is because the Muslim Melanaus that have migrated to bigger towns in Sarawak have "automatically" become "Malays" especially during the National Census Operation as their names (and many times the language the elders use with their children at homes) are indistinguishable from those of the local Sarawak Malays. This has helped the Malay population of Sarawak to have significantly increased in the census.

Most Melanaus have a 'Bin' (son of) and 'Binti' (daughter of) in their names similar to the Malays&lt;ref&gt;http://learn-melanau.blogspot.com/2011/01/why-melanau-use-bin-and-binti-in-their.html&lt;/ref&gt; and it is also likely that the Christian Melanaus too were designated as Malays in the census.

The 2010 Malaysian Population Census showed the Melanaus population in Sarawak, Malaysia was about 123,410. They make up the 5th largest ethnic group in Sarawak, after the [[Iban people|Ibans]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] and [[Bidayuh]]. The continuous inter-marriage between the Melanau and other races in Malaysia has also caused the disappearance of the Melanau identity. Data from some private research estimated that the actual Melanau population (in Malaysia and outside Malaysia) is much higher.

Being migrants in the early days, Melanaus are found almost everywhere in Sarawak. Sadly, though their children know their roots, many of them cannot speak or even understand their Melanau language. Intentionally or unintentionally, many of them have registered themselves as other races, mostly as Malays. In some cases, their parents, both Melanaus, prefer to speak Malay or English to their children. This language trend is mainly found in the towns and cities in Sarawak. There have been little efforts done to preserve the Melanau dialects and to teach the current Melanau generation continuous usage of their own dialects.

The gradual disappearance of the Melanau cultures and dialects is further aggravated by the absence of qualified Melanau staff members handling the documentation on the Melanau culture and history in the 'Majlis Adat Istiadat' department in Sarawak. This department is involved in the preservation and documentation of the cultures and histories of the various ethnic groups in Sarawak. The Melanau are slowly being absorbed into other cultural groups. The Melanau [[Kaul festival]] will only serve as a reminder of the Melanau Pagan ritual.

While originally [[Animism|animists]], the majority of the Melanaus are now [[Muslim]], although some of them, especially among the Melanau Mukah, and Dalat are [[Christian]]. Nonetheless, many still celebrate traditional rites such as the annual [[Kaul festival|Kaul Festival]]. Despite their different beliefs and religions, the Melanaus, like other East Malaysians (Sabah and Sarawak) are very tolerant of each other and are proud of their tolerance. One can still come across a Melanau family with different children in the family embracing Christianity and Islam while their parents still have strong animist beliefs.

===Food===
The Melanaus have unique food such as jungle ferns, ''[[umai]]'', fresh fish products and ''siet'', (edible [[Rhynchophorus ferrugineus|sago palm weevil]] larva). &lt;ref name="foodmelanau"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2017/10/16/melanau-delicacies-to-enjoy-associations-women-bureau-actively-promoting-their-products-at-monthly-b/|author=Ansovina Chai|date=16 October 2017|title=Melanau delicacies to enjoy

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11461">The '''Montreal–Philippines cutlery controversy''' was an incident in 2006 in which a [[Filipino people|Filipino]]-born Canadian boy was punished by his school in [[Roxboro, Quebec|Roxboro]], [[Montreal]], for using his [[cutlery]] according to traditional [[Filipino culture|Filipino etiquette]].

In response to the media coverage of the affair, a protest was held outside the  [[Canada|Canadian]] [[embassy]] in [[Manila]], and the Philippine Ambassador to Canada, José Brillantes, described it as an "affront to Filipino culture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/montreal/story/qc-fork20060505.html Montreal boy's silverware choice sparks protest in Philippines], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], May 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators saw it as an example of prejudice, [[White nationalism]] and a culture clash, especially since the [[school board]] had previously expelled a [[Sikh]] student for carrying a [[kirpan]] (Sikh dagger).&lt;ref name="Mistake" /&gt;

==Timeline==
The boy, John Lucas Joachim "Luc"/"Jean Luc" Gallardo Cagadoc, was born in 1999 to a Filipino family in Manila. The Cagadocs migrated to Canada the same year for job opportunities.

In April 2006, schoolteacher Martine Bertrand, who was assigned a role of school lunchroom monitor at École Lalande, sanctioned the then seven-year old Luc on ten separate occasions for what the school called "disgusting" and "piggish" eating habits: using a [[fork]] to push his food onto a [[spoon]] before eating it. The school board countered that the boy was punished only for disruptive behavior. The boy's mother pursued a formal apology and reported that school principal Normand Bergeron told her in a telephone conversation that in Canada, one should eat with Canadian manners ''("Madame, you are in Canada. Here in Canada you should eat the way Canadians eat.")''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060505/food_fight_060505/20060505 Food fight infuriates Filipinos at home and abroad], CTV News, May 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

The story first appeared in the ''West Island Chronicle''. According to the Montreal-area newspaper, when his mother, Theresa Gallardo Cagadoc, questioned Bergeron about punishing students for their table habits, Bergeron replied that Luc must be moved to another table if he continues to "eat like a pig" as it was their manner of how they discipline students.

In a ''Chronicle'' article, Bergeron expanded on his comments, claiming that the Luc was sometimes disruptive, which was the reason for his sactions and not his fork and spoon habits:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[In my conversation with (the mother)] I said, "Here, this is not the manner in which we eat." ...
I don't necessarily want students to eat with one hand or with only one instrument, I want them to eat intelligently at the table ... I want them to eat correctly with respect for others who are eating with them. That's all I ask. Personally, I don’t have any problems with it, but it is not the way you see people eat every day. I have never seen somebody eat with a spoon and a fork at the same time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later reporting alleged that the Luc was warned that he was tardy at the table, and so he reverted to the spoon-feeding method to save time. Luc said that he was separated from his lunchmates any time he ate that way.

Bergeron was subsequently restrained from speaking on the issue by the [[school board]]; spokesperson Brigitte Gavreau stated that board policy was that students could eat with any utensils.

A score of protestors outside the Canadian Embassy in [[Manila]] appealed for "respect for [[cultural diversity]]" and affirmed "we eat with a spoon and we're proud."&lt;ref name="Protesters"&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2006/05/05/protesters.accused.canadian.school.of.discriminating.filipino.boy.(5.15.p.m.).html Protesters accused Canadian school of discriminating Filipino boy], May 5, 2006 (from website of Sun.Star network of local newspapers in the Philippines)&lt;/ref&gt; The item was quickly picked up worldwide, especially in Filipino newspapers and websites.

A [[security guard]] was assigned to the [[primary school]], a [[police cruiser]] went on duty, and the school principal received a death threat. Fo Niemi, the Cagadocs' lawyer and the executive director for the [[Center for Research-Action on Race Relations]] (CRARR), had to actively discourage people from the Filipino community from protesting in front of the school board.

France Pilon, the assistant director of the school board, said that Luc's parents were repeatedly invited to meet with school officials, but declined, reportedly on legal advice. Pilon also said that Luc's parents have instructed him to eat apart from other students.

The case was brought to the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal for formal mediation.&lt;ref name="Mistake"&gt;[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=c5a28d8d-f9c5-46a0-b882-00d5920e382b Incident might have been a mistake] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004064302/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=c5a28d8d-f9c5-46a0-b882-00d5920e382b |date=2008-10-04 }}, ''Montreal Gazette'', May 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mediation"&gt;[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=ebc974c3-f320-4681-9afe-b991137c9114&amp;k=23552 "Board seeks mediation in food fight."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617083454/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=ebc974c3-f320-4681-9afe-b991137c9114&amp;k=23552 |date=2006-06-17 }} 13 June 2006 .

==Commission ruling==
In 2008 the Quebec Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission ruled that Bertrand's reprimand was an isolated incident, and found no evidence that Bergeron was biased.&lt;ref name=AsianPacificNov19/&gt;  It found that Luc was disciplined for unsafe eating behavior,&lt;ref name=MailSeethes/&gt; not for his cutlery etiquette.&lt;ref name=AsianPacificNov19/&gt;

The commission concluded that Luc was [[Play (activity)|clowning around]] by stuffing a large amount of [[rice]] into his mouth, and that the reprimand was for his own safety.&lt;ref name=MailSeethes&gt;[http://www.manilamaildc.net/2008/10/18/canada-spoon-row-seethes/ Canada ’spoon’ row seethes], ''Manila Mail'', October 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The commission concluded that it was discriminatory for Bertrand to have asked Luc if people in "his country" [[hand washing|washed their hands]] before eating.&lt;ref name=AsianPacificNov19&gt;[http://www.asianpacificpost.com/portal2/c1ee8c441db66525011db767aa9f016a_Cutlery_controversy_back_on_the_table.do.html Cutlery controversy back on the table] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406031458/http://www.asianpacificpost.com/portal2/c1ee8c441db66525011db767aa9f016a_Cutlery_controversy_back_on_the_table.do.html |date=2009-04-06 }}, ''The Asian Pacific Post'', November 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MailSeethes/&gt;

In November 2008 it was reported that CRARR had asked the Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission to review its decision, alleging anomalies in process that possibly prejudiced the commission's decision. The principal's newspaper comments were allegedly ignored. Theresa said that the human rights commission had interviewed representatives from the school board, but not Cagadocs. Theresa was reportedly considering an [[appeal]] to the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body,&lt;ref name=AsianPacificNov19/&gt;&lt;ref name=MailSeethes/&gt; while members of the area Filipino community wanted to take the case to court.&lt;ref name=AsianPacificNov19/&gt;

In April 2010 the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal mandated that the school reimburse the Cagadocs CDN $17,000 in moral and punitive damages. The Tribunal stated that the school principal shared blame for not implementing an intercultural education policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/04/23/10/spoon-and-fork-boy-wins-17k-damages-canada 'Spoon-and-fork boy' wins $17K in damages in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Night markets''' or '''night bazaars''' are  [[street market]]s which operate at night and are generally dedicated to more leisurely strolling, shopping, and eating than more businesslike day markets. They are typically open-air markets.

==History==
{{Globalize|date=March 2018}}

The concept of the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese [[Tang dynasty]]. The Tang government put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards the end of the Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on night markets. During the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), night markets played a central role in Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business districts and red light districts.{{sfnp|Yu|2004|p=134}}

In the 1950s and 1960s, migrant urban workers made up a large base of night markets' customers. The vendors created simplified versions of banquet dishes and served [[xiaochi]] foods. The names of the towns came from the dishes they served. The serving of [[xiaochi]] foods attracted Taiwan's local elite. Stories were formed of how well-known politicians and intellectuals visited Night Market stalls.{{sfnp|Yu|2004|p=135}}

Night markets started to embody the local and the global modern popular culture because of commercial industries. Because of the global recession in the 1970s, canceled imports created more opportunities for vendors selling light industry and family made goods. This was due to more products becoming available to local markets. Night marketing networks were formed and sold Taiwan's light industry goods.{{sfnp|Yu|2004|p=136}}

Because of the prosperity of the night markets, some traditional businesses were replaced by higher quality garment and shoe stores in the 1980s. The energetic night markets were known during this period where neon signs, loud music and light displays were used to attract customers. The new replaced the old; cafeterias instead of restaurants, gift shops instead of sundry shops, sportswear outlets instead of low quality garment stores. At Taiwan's stock market surge, chains started opening franchises that were located in or near the night markets. These included fast food outlets such as [[McDonald's]] and convenience stores such as [[7-Elevens]], which were then followed by garment stores. This transformation continued in the 1990s, when chains who sold higher grade merchandise replaced individually owned businesses.{{sfnp|Yu|2004|p=136}}

Night Markets changed from places that sold traditional snack food and handicrafts to modern centers of popular culture. Markets rapidly responded to new trends by producing their own versions of popular goods, especially in the 1990s, when copyright and intellectual property laws were only loosely enforced. These [[counterfeit]] items that now flooded the market attracted young customers. In recent years, these laws are now more strictly enforced so counterfeit items are usually found in traveling night markets. The night markets are now known for not personifying Taiwan as it once did. The night market was transformed to accommodate to the modern capitalist economies of present day.{{sfnp|Yu|2004|p=137}}

==Geographical spread==
Night markets are popular in Chinese culture; they are especially common in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], found in [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], as well as Overseas Chinese communities across [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] to the [[Philippines]]. Nevertheless, night markets are more prominent within [[Han Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] economic and cultural activities. Some well-known night markets exist in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Bangkok, but they also exist in [[Chinatown]]s worldwide.

[[Image:Shilin Night Market 21, Dec 06.JPG|thumb|The [[Shilin Night Market]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]]]

Taiwan hosts numerous night markets in each of its major cities.  The larger and more formal of these markets might take place in purpose-built [[marketplace]]s while smaller or more informal ones tend to occupy streets or roads that are normal thoroughfares by day. The temporal night markets (ones that are not housed in any permanent structure) are actually consistent in their location; in most large cities, they are on a smaller street parallel and close (a block or two away) to the primary street of that city. Though the temporal night market stalls appear at night and then vanish by day, the vendors usually return to the same location the next evening. Night markets do not close, but the individual stalls may randomly take days off due to holidays, family illness, etc.  Most temporal stalls within a night market have white canvas tops and bright lights. This gives the temporary night markets a fantastical, carnival-like atmosphere.

[[Image:TWShiLinNightMarketRichy2.jpg|thumb|Taipei's Shilin Night Market indoor area.]]
When a new night market street develops, the initial response is not always positive - they are thought to be noisy and the customers often leave trash behind that the owners of the daytime stores must deal with.  As the night market becomes more well known, however, often it is looked upon more positively and the daytime stores adjust.  The daytime stores then stay open later, because there are now customers at night when previously there wouldn't be.  Night markets can increase profitability and often bring secondary type of consumers that are different from the daytime consumers.  For example, a daytime store may normally sell herbs. At night, that same daytime store may now change its wares to include iced grass jelly and honey tea; this second item caters towards the teenage and early-twenties crowd, which is the majority of night market customers.  Although some of these markets are specialized (e.g., in certain types of food), most have a mixture of individual stalls hawking clothing, consumer goods, ''[[xiaochi]]'' (snacks or fast food), and specialty drinks. The atmosphere is usually crowded and noisy with [[Hawker (trade)|hawker]]s shouting and fast-paced music playing over loudspeakers. Some individual vendors may take advantage of the informality of the market to offer counterfeit, [[copyright infringement|pirated]] or [[grey market]] consumer goods. The night markets usually open around 6pm, and are busy until past midnight.

Major night markets often have agreements and contracts where the vendors pitch in for utilities such as electricity and water hook-up.  A few (such as Shilin Night Market) actually include the cost of basic cleaning in this price.  There is also a greater police presence at major night markets, compared to the temporary night markets.

===Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore===
[[File:Pasar Malam Rawasari 4.JPG|thumb|Pasar malam in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].]]
{{Main article|Pasar malam}}
Night markets are commonly known as ''[[Pasar Malam]]'' by the locals, which literally means ''night market'', "pasar" being related to "bazaar" in Persian or also the meaning "market" in Malay/Indonesian, and "malam" meaning "night". A pasar malam is a street market in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore that opens in the evening, usually in residential neighbourhoods.

It brings together a collection of stalls that usually sell goods such as fruit, vegetables, snacks, toys, clothes, movie discs and ornaments at cheap or at least reasonable prices. A pasar malam often takes place only one to a few days of the week, as the traders rotate around different neighbourhoods on different days of the week. Haggling over prices is a common practice at such markets.

Today, several ''[[kecamatan]]'' (district) in [[Jakarta]] and also other provinces in Indonesia, hold weekly ''pasar malam'', usually held every Saturday night in nearby ''[[alun-alun]]'' square, open fields or marketplaces. In Indonesia, pasar malam has become a weekly recreational place for local families. Other than selling variety of goods and foods, some ''pasar malam'' also offer kiddy rides and carnival games, such as mini [[carousel]] or mini train ride.

===North America===
Night markets are also hosted in various areas of North America, particularly with large Overseas Chinese communities in the Pacific Northwest and the West Coast, with Taiwanese-American student organizations hosting annual night market events to emulate the jovial atmosphere and celebrate the unique culture of night markets. In [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]], a large night market with almost 100 booths takes place every autumn Saturday in Portsmouth Square. In [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown in Vancouver]], British Columbia, large night markets take place every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from May to September, as well as in an industrial area near suburban [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond, BC]]'s [[Golden Village (Richmond, British Columbia)|Golden Village]]; the [[Richmond Night Market]] features more than 400 booths and attracts in excess of 30,000 people per night (total attendance in 2005 was almost two million). [[Night It Up!]] (formerly Toronto Night Market and Asian Night Market), has been and continues to be Power Unit Youth Organization's flagship project, attracting hundreds of thousands to a three-day celebration of Asian food and culture in [[Markham, Ontario]] (attendance was over 130,000 in 2017). The [[626 Night Market]], held at [[Santa Anita Park]] in [[Arcadia, California]], a suburb of [[Los Angeles]], is stated to be the largest Asian night market in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.626nightmarket.com |title=626 Night Market}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Food Trust]] in [[Philadelphia]] operates a unique variant of a night market, with it being a temporary event only active for one night before moving somewhere else in the city; the market has thus far been held in [[East Passyunk Crossing|East Passyunk]], [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]], [[Northern Liberties, Philadelphia|Northern Liberties]], [[Mount Airy, Philadelphia|Mount Airy]], [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City]], [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Chinatown]], and other places across the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Night Market Philadelphia|url=http://thefoodtrust.org/night-market|publisher=The Food Trust|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queens Night Market is held in [[Flushing Meadows Corona Park]] in [[New York City]] on Saturdays from April to October. It hosts as many as 100 vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://queensnightmarket.com/|title=Queens Night Market - NYC's Night Market|website=queensnightmarket.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/dining/queens-night-market-review.html|title=Around the World in an Evening at the Queens Night Market|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/07/queens-night-market-the-new-yorkiest-food-fair-of-all.html|title=Queens Night Market Might Be the New Yorkiest Food Fair of All|first1=Robin | last1=Raisfeld | first2=Rob | last2=Patronite| others=Brian Finke, photographer | publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atom-Moratorium.svg|thumb|Eight German nuclear power reactors (Biblis A and B, Brunsbüttel, Isar 1, Krümmel, Neckarwestheim 1, Philippsburg 1 and Unterweser) were permanently shut down on 6 August 2011, following the Japanese [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2/ |title=Power Reactor Information System -  Highlights |author=IAEA |date=2011 |work= }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''nuclear power phase-out''' is the discontinuation of usage of [[nuclear power]] for energy production. Often initiated because of [[Anti-nuclear movement#Concerns about nuclear power|concerns about nuclear power]], phase-outs usually include shutting down [[nuclear power plants]] and looking towards [[fossil fuels]] and [[renewable energy]]. 
 
Three nuclear accidents have influenced the discontinuation of nuclear power: the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island partial nuclear meltdown]] in the United States, the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the USSR, and the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in Japan.
As of 2018, Italy is the only country that operated nuclear reactors but has since phased out nuclear power completely.

Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors and pledged to close the rest by the end of 2022.&lt;ref name="Annika Breidthardt" /&gt; Italy voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://referendum.interno.it/referendum/refe110612/RFT0003.htm |title=Italy Nuclear Referendum Results |date=13 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325171121/http://referendum.interno.it/referendum/refe110612/RFT0003.htm |archivedate=25 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland and Spain have banned the construction of new reactors.&lt;ref name="nweek11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/11/27/post-fukushima-nuclear-power-changes-latitudes.html |title= Nuclear Power Goes Rogue |author= [[Henry Sokolski]] |date= 28 November 2011 |work=Newsweek }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan’s prime minister has called for a dramatic reduction in Japan’s reliance on nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-28/nuclear-promotion-dropped-in-japan-energy-policy-after-fukushima.html |title=Nuclear Promotion Dropped in Japan Energy Policy After Fukushima |author1=Tsuyoshi Inajima  |author2=Yuji Okada   |lastauthoramp=yes |date=28 October 2011 |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan’s president did the same. [[Shinzō Abe]], the  prime minister of Japan since December 2012, announced a plan to re-start some of the 54 Japanese nuclear power plants (NPPs) and to continue some NPP sites under construction.&lt;ref&gt;He is fighting a continuing economic crisis with [[Abenomics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years but overall capacity has increased.&lt;ref name=econ13&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/11/difference-engine-0 |title=Difference Engine: The nuke that might have been |author= |date=11 November 2013 |work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italy]] is the only country that has permanently closed all of its functioning nuclear plants. [[Lithuania]] and [[Kazakhstan]] have shut down their only nuclear plants, but plan to build new ones to replace them, while [[Armenia]] shut down its only nuclear plant but subsequently restarted it. [[Austria]] never used its first nuclear plant that was completely built. Due to financial, political and technical reasons [[Cuba]], [[Nuclear power in Libya|Libya]], [[Nuclear power in North Korea|North Korea]] and [[Nuclear energy in Poland|Poland]] never completed the construction of their first nuclear plants (although North Korea and Poland plan to).  [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Nuclear power in Ghana|Ghana]], [[Nuclear energy in Ireland|Ireland]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Peru]], [[Singapore]], [[Nuclear energy in Venezuela|Venezuela]] have planned, but not constructed their first nuclear plants. Between 2005 and 2015 the global production of nuclear power declined by 0.7%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2017/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2017-nuclear-energy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:ANTIAKW.jpg|thumb|right|120,000 people attended an anti-nuclear protest in [[Bonn]], Germany, on 14 October 1979, following the [[Three Mile Island accident]].&lt;ref name=kits&gt;Herbert P.

A [[Anti-nuclear|popular movement against nuclear power]] has gained strength in the Western world, based on concerns about more [[List of nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accidents]] and concerns about [[nuclear waste]]. Anti-nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous, expensive way to boil water to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Caldicott (2006).  ''Nuclear Power is Not the Answer to Global Warming or Anything Else'', Melbourne University Press, {{ISBN|0-522-85251-3}}, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; The 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] and the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] played a key role in stopping new plant construction in many countries. Major [[List of anti-nuclear power groups|anti-nuclear power groups]] include [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Greenpeace]], [[Institute for Energy and Environmental Research]], [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]], and [[Sortir du nucléaire (France)]].

Several countries, especially [[Europe]]an countries, have abandoned the construction of new of nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name="berssele"&gt;[http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/551/5290.html Netherlands: Court case on closure date Borssele NPP], article from anti-nuclear organization (WISE), dated 29 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria]] (1978), [[Sweden]] (1980) and [[Italy]] (1987) voted in referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power, while opposition in Ireland prevented a nuclear program there. Countries that have no nuclear plants and have restricted new plant constructions comprise [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Ireland]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="nuclearoutlook"&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/1999/birol.htm Nuclear Power in the World Energy Outlook], by the [[Uranium Institute]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nuclearfree"&gt;[http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/478/aai.html Anti-nuclear resolution of the Austrian Parliament]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223000000/http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww10.antenna.nl%2Fwise%2F478%2Faai.html |date=23 February 2006 }}, as summarised by an anti-nuclear organisation (WISE).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland]] stopped the construction of a plant.&lt;ref name="nuclearoutlook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="polandnuclearstop"&gt;[http://www.euronuclear.org/e-news/e-news-8/newsfrompoland.htm Nuclear news from Poland], article from the Web site of the [[European Nuclear Society]], April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgium]], [[Germany]],  [[Spain]], and [[Sweden]] decided not to build new plants or intend to phase out nuclear power, although still mostly relying on nuclear energy.&lt;ref name="nuclearoutlook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="germanynuclearstop"&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1029748,00.html Germany Starts Nuclear Energy Phase-Out], article from [http://www.dw-world.de/ Deutsche Welle], 14 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

New reactors under construction in Finland and France, which were meant to lead a nuclear new build, have been substantially  delayed and are running over-budget.&lt;ref name=jk&gt;James Kanter.

Countries that wish to shut down [[nuclear power plant]]s must find alternatives for electricity generation; otherwise, they are forced to become dependent on imports. Therefore, the discussion of a future for nuclear energy is intertwined with discussions about [[fossil fuels]] or an [[energy transition]] to [[renewable energy commercialization|renewable energy]].

===Austria===
{{See also|Anti-nuclear movement in Austria}}
A nuclear power station was built during the 1970s at [[Zwentendorf]], [[Austria]], but its start-up was prevented by a popular vote in 1978. On 9 July 1997, the [[Parliament of Austria|Austrian Parliament]] voted unanimously to maintain the country's anti-nuclear policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/478/aai.html |publisher=WISE News Communique |date=26 September 1997 |title=Coalition of Nuclear-Free Countries |accessdate=2006-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223141723/http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww10.antenna.nl%2Fwise%2F478%2Faai.html |archivedate=23 February 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
Belgium's nuclear phase-out legislation was agreed in July 1999 by the [[Liberalism worldwide|Liberals]] ([[Flemish Liberals and Democrats|VLD]] and [[Reformist Movement|MR]]), the [[Socialism|Socialists]] ([[Socialist Party - Different|SP.A]] and [[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|PS]]) and the [[Greens party]] ([[Green!|Groen!]] and [[Ecolo]]). The phase-out law calls for each of [[List of nuclear reactors#Belgium|Belgium's seven reactors]] to close after 40 years of operation with no new reactors built subsequently. When the law was being passed, it was speculated it would be overturned again as soon as an administration without the Greens was in power.&lt;ref name="essential programme"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nuclearliaison.com/pdfs/Nuclear_Task_Force_July_2003.pdf| title=An Essential Programme to Underpin Government Policy on Nuclear Power| date=July 2003| publisher=Nuclear Task Force| first=Philip| last=Ruffles|author2=Michael Burdekin |author3=Charles Curtis |author4=Brian Eyre |author5=Geoff Hewitt |author6=William Wilkinson | format=PDF| accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Belgian federal election, 2003|federal election in May 2003]], there was an [[electoral threshold]] of 5% for the first time. Therefore, the Green parties 
the [[ECOLO]] got only 3.06% of the votes. , so ECOLO got no seat in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]]. In July 2003, [[Guy Verhofstadt]] formed [[Verhofstadt II Government|his second government]].  It was a continuation of the [[Verhofstadt I Government]] but without the Green parties.
In September 2005, the government decided to partially overturn the previous decision, extending the phase-out period for another 20 years, with possible further extensions.

In July 2005, the [[Federal Planning Bureau]] published a new report, which stated that [[petroleum|oil]] and other [[fossil fuel]]s generate 90% of Belgian [[energy]] use, while nuclear power accounts for 9% and [[renewable energy]] for 1%. Electricity only amounts to 16% of total energy use, and while nuclear-powered electricity amounts to 9% of use in Belgium, in many parts of Belgium, especially in [[Flanders]], it makes up more than 50% of the electricity provided to households and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=French|title=Quelle énergie pour un développement durable ?|first=Alain|last=Henry|series=Working Paper 14-05|date=12 July 2005|url=http://www.plan.be/publications/publication_det.php?lang=fr&amp;TM=30&amp;IS=63&amp;KeyPub=198|publisher=[[Federal Planning Bureau]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the major reasons to revert the earlier phase-out, since it was impossible to provide more than 50% of the electricity by 'alternative' energy-production, and a revert to the classical coal-driven electricity would mean inability to adhere to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

In August 2005, French [[SUEZ]] offered to buy the Belgian [[Electrabel]], which runs nuclear power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/10/business/worldbusiness/10suez.html | work=The New York Times | first=James | last=Kanter | title=Big French Utility Offers a Full Buyout in Belgium | date=2005-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2005, Suez had some 98.5% of all Electrabel shares. Beginning 2006, Suez and Gaz de France announced a merger.

After the [[Belgian federal election, 2007|federal election in June 2007]], a [[2007–11 Belgian political crisis|political crisis began and lasted until the end of 2011]].

In the [[2010–2011 Belgian government formation]] negotiations, the phase-out was emphasized again, with concrete plans to shut off three of the country's seven reactors by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15521865 | work=BBC News | title=Belgium plans to phase out nuclear power | date=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear disaster]], the plan of the [[Belgian federal government|government]] was for all nuclear power stations to shut down by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=48&amp;story_id=21976&amp;name=Addicted+to+nuclear+energy%3F Addicted to nuclear energy? &lt; Belgian news | Expatica Belgium]. Expatica.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Although intermediate deadlines have been missed or pushed back, on 30 March 2018 the Belgian Council of Ministers confirmed the 2025 phase-out date and stated draft legislation would be brought forward later in the year.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180404&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Belgium-maintains-nuclear-phase-out-policy-0404184.html |title=Belgium maintains nuclear phase-out policy |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=4 April 2018 |accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Energiemix Deutschland.svg|thumb|right|Nuclear power is getting largely replaced with renewables in Germany]]

In 2000, the [[First Schröder cabinet]], consisting of the [[SPD]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens]], officially announced its intention to phase out the use of nuclear energy. The power plants [[Stade Nuclear Power Plant|in Stade]] and [[Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant|in Obrigheim]] were turned off on 14 November 2003, and 11 May 2005, respectively. The plants' dismantling was scheduled to begin in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terradaily.com/2003/031114130333.jlvf6wjx.html German nuclear energy phase-out begins with first plant closure].

The year 2000 [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] provided for a [[Feed-in tariffs in Germany|feed-in tariff]] in support of renewable energy. The German government, declaring [[Greenhouse effect|climate protection]] as a key policy issue, announced a [[carbon dioxide]] reduction target by the year 2005 compared to 1990 by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agores.org/Publications/EnR/GermanyREPolicy2000.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040913211008/http://www.agores.org/Publications/EnR/GermanyREPolicy2000.pdf |date=13 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the use of renewables in Germany reached 284&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|PJ]] of primary energy demand, which corresponded to 5% of the total electricity demand. By 2010, the German government wanted to reach 10%.;&lt;ref name="essential programme"/&gt; in fact, 17% were reached (2011: 20%, 2015: 30%).&lt;ref&gt;[https://1-stromvergleich.com/strom-report/oekostrom/#stromerzeugung-erneuerbare-energien ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-nuclear activists have argued the German government had been supportive of nuclear power by providing financial guarantees for energy providers. Also it has been pointed out, there were, as yet, no plans for the final storage of [[nuclear waste]]. By tightening safety regulations and increasing taxation, a faster end to nuclear power could have been forced. A gradual closing down of nuclear power plants had come along with concessions in questions of safety for the population with transport of nuclear waste throughout Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pds-coesfeld.de/anti%20atom.gronau2.htm]{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [http://www.kww-naumann.ch/konzeption-und-vorgehen Kommunikation Wissenschaft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122002350/http://www.kww-naumann.ch/konzeption-und-vorgehen |date=22 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter point has been disagreed with by the Minister of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmu.de/english/nuclear_safety/doc/3420.php 'Nuclear phase-out in Germany and the Challenges for Nuclear Regulation'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050520081034/http://www.bmu.de/english/nuclear_safety/doc/3420.php |date=20 May 2005 }}. Bmu.de. Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Critics of a phase-out in Germany argued that the power output from the nuclear power stations will not be adequately compensated and predict an [[energy crisis]]. They also predicted that only coal-powered plants could compensate for nuclear power and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would increase tremendously (with the use of oil and fossils). Energy would have to be imported from France's nuclear power facilities or Russian natural gas.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4295389.stm | work=BBC News | title=Germany split over green energy | date=2005-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Deutsche Bank]] analysts concluded that "the global impact of the [[Fukushima accident]] is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health, safety, security, and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways". There were many [[anti-nuclear]] protests and, on 29 May 2011, Merkel's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by December 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/14.abstract |title=The implications of Fukushima: The European perspective |author=Caroline Jorant |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dw31511&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14912184,00.html | title = Merkel shuts down seven nuclear reactors  | last = Knight | first = Ben |date = 15 March 2011 | publisher = [[Deutsche Welle]] | accessdate = 15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors.

In September 2011, German engineering giant [[Siemens]] announced it will withdraw entirely from the [[nuclear industry]], as a response to the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in Japan, and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world. The company’s chairman, [[Peter Löscher]], said that "Siemens was ending plans to cooperate with [[Rosatom]], the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company, in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/energy-environment/the-year-of-peril-and-promise-in-energy-production.html?src=un&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjson8.nytimes.com%2Fpages%2Fbusiness%2Fglobal%2Findex.jsonp  |title=The Year of Peril and Promise in Energy Production |author=John Broder |date=10 October 2011|work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14963575 |title=Siemens to quit nuclear industry |date=18 September 2011  |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September 2011, IAEA Director General [[Yukiya Amano]] said the Japanese nuclear disaster "caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2011/09/23/IAEA-sees-slow-nuclear-growth-post-Japan/UPI-87041316777856/ |title=IAEA sees slow nuclear growth post Japan |date=23 September 2011 |work=[[UPI]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early-October 2016, Swedish electric power company [[Vattenfall]] began litigation against the German government for its 2011 decision to accelerate the phase-out of nuclear power.  Hearing are taking place at the [[World Bank]]'s [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) in [[Washington DC]] and Vattenfall is claiming almost €4.7{{nbsp}}billion in damages.

On 5{{nbsp}}December 2016, the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (''{{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}}'') ruled that the nuclear plant operators affected by the accelerated phase-out of nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster are eligible for "adequate" compensation.  The court found that the nuclear exit was essentially constitutional but that the utilities are entitled to damages for the "good faith" investments they made in 2010.  The utilities can now sue the German government under civil law.  E.ON, RWE, and Vattenfall are expected to seek a total of €19{{nbsp}}billion under separate suits.&lt;ref name="clew-2016c"&gt;

=== Italy ===
Nuclear power phase-out commenced in [[Italy]] in 1987, one year after the [[Chernobyl accident]]. Following a referendum in that year, Italy's [[List of nuclear reactors#Italy|four nuclear power plants]] were closed down, the last in 1990. A moratorium on the construction of new plants, originally in effect from 1987 until 1993, has since been extended indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energytrends.pnl.gov/italy/it004.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906154331/http://energytrends.pnl.gov/italy/it004.htm |archivedate=6 September 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Italy has been an importer of nuclear-generated electricity, and its largest electricity utility [[Enel|Enel S.p.A.]] has been investing in reactors in both France and Slovakia to provide this electricity in the future, and also in the development of the [[European Pressurized Reactor|EPR]] technology.

In October 2005, there was a [[seminar]] sponsored by the [[Berlusconi III Cabinet|government]] about the possibility of reviving Italian [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prospettive dell'energia nucleare in Italia|url=http://vastxiv.camera.it/attivita/31/192/217/218/scheda_seminario.asp|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Berlusconi IV Cabinet|fourth cabinet]] led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]] tried to implement a new nuclear plan but a [[Italian referendums, 2011#Nuclear power|referendum held in June 2011]] stopped any project.

A year after the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979 the [[Swedish nuclear power referendum, 1980]] was held. It led to the Swedish parliament deciding that no further nuclear power plants should be built, and that a nuclear power phase-out should be completed by 2010. On 5 February 2009, the [[Government of Sweden]] effectively ended the phase-out policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/sweden-reverses-nuclear-phase-out/ |date=11 November 2009 |first=Johan |last=Borgenäs |title=Sweden Reverses Nuclear Phase-out Policy |publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Parliament approved for new reactors to replace existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10347187 |title=Sweden to replace existing nuclear plants with new ones |date=18 June 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[nuclear reactor]]s at the [[Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant]] were shut down between 1999 and 2005. In October 2015, corporations running the nuclear plants decided to phase out two reactors at Oskarshamn&lt;ref&gt;http://okg.se/sv/Press/2015/Beslut-fattat-om-fortida-stangning-av-O1-och-O2/&lt;/ref&gt; and two at Ringhals,&lt;ref&gt;https://corporate.vattenfall.se/press-och-media/engelska/r1-and-r2-in-operation-until-2020-and-2019/&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the number of remaining reactors from 12 in 1999 to 6 in 2020.

An opinion poll in April 2016 showed that about half of Swedes want to phase out nuclear power, 30 percent want its use continued, and 20 percent are undecided.&lt;ref name="SR2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6419421 |title=30 years after Chernobyl: Half of Swedes oppose nuclear power |newspaper=[[Sveriges Radio]] |date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in 2011, "a clear majority of Swedes" had been in favour of nuclear power.&lt;ref name="SR2016"/&gt; In June 2016 the opposition parties and the [[Löfven Cabinet|government]] reached an agreement on Swedish nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20160610/sweden-agrees-to-continue-nuclear-power |title=Sweden strikes deal to continue nuclear power |date=10 June 2016 |newspaper=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement is to phase out the output tax on nuclear power, and allow ten new replacement reactors to be built at current nuclear plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/regeringen-overens-om-energiuppgorelse|title=Klart i dag: så blir den svenska energipolitiken|last=Juhlin|first=Johan|website=svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|language=swedish|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many Swiss [[referendum|referenda]] on the topic of nuclear energy, beginning in 1979 with a [[initiative|citizens' initiative]] for nuclear safety, which was rejected. In 1984, there was a vote on an initiative "for a future without further nuclear power stations" with the result being a 55 to 45% vote against. On 23 September 1990, Switzerland had two more referenda about nuclear power. The initiative "stop the construction of nuclear power stations", which proposed a ten-year [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on the construction of new nuclear power plants, was passed with 54.5% to 45.5%. The initiative for a phase-out was rejected with by 53% to 47.1%. In 2000, there was a vote on a [[Green tax shift|green tax]] for support of [[solar energy]]. It was rejected by 67–31%. On 18 May 2003, there were two referenda: "Electricity without Nuclear", asking for a decision on a nuclear power phase-out, and "Moratorium Plus", for an extension of the earlier-decided moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants. Both were turned down. The results were: Moratorium Plus: 41.6% Yes, 58.4% No; Electricity without Nuclear: 33.7% Yes, 66.3% No.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energie-schweiz.ch/internet/00552/?lang=de Bundesamt für Energie BFE – Startseite]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}. Energie-schweiz.ch. Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program of the "Electricity without Nuclear" petition was to shut down all nuclear power stations by 2033, starting with Unit 1 and 2 of Beznau nuclear power stations, Mühleberg in 2005, Gösgen in 2009, and Leibstadt in 2014. "Moratorium Plus" was for an extension of the moratorium for another ten years, and additionally a condition to stop the present reactors after 40 years of operation. In order to extend the 40 years by ten more years, another referendum would have to be held (at high administrative costs). The rejection of the Moratorium Plus had come as a surprise to many, as opinion polls before the referendum had showed acceptance. Reasons for the rejections in both cases were seen as the worsened economic situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnfc.or.jp/plutonium/pl42/e/cnfc_report.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213102612/http://www.cnfc.or.jp/plutonium/pl42/e/cnfc_report.html |date=13 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland]], a nuclear power plant was first proposed in 1968. It was to be built during the 1970s at [[Carnsore Point]] in [[County Wexford]]. The plan called for first one, then ultimately four plants to be built at the site, but it was dropped after strong opposition from environmental groups, and Ireland has remained without nuclear power since. Despite opposing nuclear power (and nuclear fuel reprocessing at [[Sellafield]]), Ireland is to open an interconnector to the mainland UK to buy electricity, which is, in some part, the product of nuclear power.

[[Slovenia]]n nuclear plant in [[Krško]] (co-owned with [[Croatia]]) is scheduled to be closed by 2023, and there are no plans to build further nuclear plants. The debate on whether and when to close the Krško plant was somewhat intensified after the [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute#Cutting off the supply|2005/06 winter energy crisis]]. In May 2006 the Ljubljana-based daily ''Dnevnik'' claimed Slovenian government officials internally proposed adding a new 1000&amp;nbsp;MW block into Krško after the year 2020.

Greece operates only a single small nuclear reactor in the Greek National Physics Research  Laboratory in [[Demokritus Laboratories]] for research purposes.

The future of [[nuclear power in the United Kingdom]] is currently under review. The country has a number of reactors which are currently reaching the end of their working life, and it is currently undecided how they will be replaced. The UK is also currently failing to reach its targets for reduction on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, which situation may be made worse if new nuclear power stations are not built. The [[United Kingdom|UK]] also uses a large proportion of gas-fired power stations, which produce half the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions as coal, but there have been recent difficulties in obtaining adequate gas supplies.

In the [[Netherlands]], in 1994, the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|Dutch parliament]] voted to phase out after a discussion of nuclear waste management. The power station at [[Neder-Betuwe|Dodewaard]] was shut down in 1997. In 1997 the government decided to end [[Borsele|Borssele's]] operating license, at the end of 2003. In 2003 the shut-down was postponed by the [[Second Balkenende cabinet|government]] to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerncentrale.nl/nieuws/nw030522.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223194844/http://www.kerncentrale.nl/nieuws/nw030522.htm |date=23 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecology.at/nni/country.php?country=Netherlands ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612100037/http://www.ecology.at/nni/country.php?country=Netherlands |date=12 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the decision was reversed and research in expanding nuclear power has been initiated. Reversal was preceded by the publication of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]]'s report on sustainable energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/news/nl_jul-aug2005.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923163834/http://www.world-nuclear.org/news/nl_jul-aug2005.htm |date=23 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other coalition parties then conceded. In 2006 the government decided that Borssele will remain open until 2033, if it can comply with the highest safety standards. The owners, [[Essent]] and [[DELTA (company)|DELTA]] will invest 500 million euro in sustainable energy, together with the government, money which the government claims otherwise should have been paid to the plants owners as compensation.

=== Australasia ===
{{See also|Anti-nuclear movement in Australia}}
[[New Zealand]] enacted the ''[[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]]'' which prohibits the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of New Zealand and the entry into New Zealand waters of nuclear armed or [[Nuclear marine propulsion|propelled]] ships. This Act of Parliament, however, does not prevent the construction of nuclear power plants.

In [[Australia]] there are no nuclear power plants. Australia has very extensive, low-cost coal reserves and substantial natural gas and majority political opinion is still opposed to domestic nuclear power on both environmental and economic grounds.

For [[North Korea]], two [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]]s at Kumho were under construction until that was suspended in November 2003. On 19 September 2005 North Korea pledged to stop building nuclear weapons and agreed to international inspections in return for energy aid, which may include one or more light water reactors – the agreement said "The other parties expressed their respect and agreed to discuss at an appropriate time the subject of the provision of light-water reactor" [sic].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050919/ap_on_re_as/koreas_nuclear ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920211454/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050919/ap_on_re_as/koreas_nuclear |date=20 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, the [[Turkey|Turkish]] government decided not to build four reactors at the controversial [[Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant]], but later changed its mind.

Once a nuclear proponent, Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] became increasingly [[anti-nuclear]] following the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. In May 2011, he closed the aging [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]] over earthquake and tsunami fears, and said he would freeze plans to build new reactors. In July 2011, Kan said that "Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy ... saying that the Fukushima accident had demonstrated the dangers of the technology".&lt;ref name="Hiroko Tabuchi"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/world/asia/14japan.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=Japan Premier Wants Shift Away From Nuclear Power |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |date=13 July 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, the Japanese government passed a bill to subsidize electricity from [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref name="Chisaki Watanabe"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-26/japan-passes-renewable-energy-bill-one-precondition-of-kan-s-resignation.html |title=Japan Spurs Solar, Wind Energy With Subsidies, in Shift From Nuclear Power |author=Chisaki Watanabe | date=26 August 2011 | work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Japanese Cabinet energy white paper says "public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged" by the Fukushima disaster, and calls for a reduction in the nation's reliance on nuclear power.&lt;ref name="Tsuyoshi Inajima and Yuji Okada"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-28/nuclear-promotion-dropped-in-japan-energy-policy-after-fukushima.html |title=Nuclear Promotion Dropped in Japan Energy Policy After Fukushima |author1=Tsuyoshi Inajima  |author2=Yuji Okada  |lastauthoramp=yes | date=28 Oct 2011 | work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|08}}, the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is still leaking low levels of radioactivity and areas surrounding it could remain uninhabitable for decades.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/27/us-japan-nuclear-uninhabitable-idUSTRE77Q17U20110827 |title=Areas near Japan nuclear plant may be off limits for decades | date=27 August 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2012, one year after the disaster, all but two of Japan's nuclear reactors were shut down; some were damaged by the quake and tsunami. The following year, the last two were taken off-line. Authority to restart the others after scheduled maintenance throughout the year was given to local governments, and in all cases local opposition prevented restarting.

Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe|Shinzo Abe]]'s government, reelected on a platform of restarting nuclear power, plans to have nuclear power account for 20 to 22 percent of the country’s total electricity supply by 2030, compared with roughly 30 percent before the disaster at the Fukushima complex.

In 2015 two reactors at [[Sendai Nuclear Power Plant|Sendai nuclear power plant]] have been restarted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Kyushu restarts second reactor at Sendai plant under tighter Fukushima-inspired rules|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/15/national/second-reactor-restarted-kyushu-tighter-fukushima-inspired-rules/|newspaper = The Japan Times Online|date = 2015-10-15|access-date = 2015-10-19|issn = 0447-5763|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 [[Ikata Nuclear Power Plant|Ikata-3]] restarted and in 2017 [[Takahama Nuclear Power Plant|Takahama-4]] restarted.

=== United States ===
{{See also|Anti-nuclear movement in the United States}}
The United States is, as of 2013, undergoing a practical phase-out independent of stated goals and continued official support. This is not due to concerns about the source or anti-nuclear groups, but due to the rapidly falling prices of [[natural gas]] and the reluctance of investors to provide funding for long-term projects when short term profitability of turbine power is available.

Through the 2000s a number of factors led to greatly increased interest in new nuclear reactors, including rising demand, new lower-cost reactor designs, and concerns about [[global climate change]]. By 2009, about 30 new reactors were planned, and a large number of existing reactors had applied for upgrades to increase their output. In total, 39 reactors have had their licences renewed, three Early Site Permits have been applied for, and three consortiums have applied for Combined Construction-Operating Licences under the ''[[Nuclear Power 2010 Program]]''. In addition, the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] contains incentives to further expand nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.com.au/nip58.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522133338/http://www.uic.com.au/nip58.htm |archivedate=22 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 2012 the vast majority of these plans were cancelled, and several additional cancellations followed in 2013. Currently only five new reactors are under construction, and one, at Watts Bar, was originally planned in the 1970s and only under construction now. Construction of the new AP1000 design is underway at two locations in the United States in [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant|Georgia]] and [[Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station|South Carolina]]. Plans for additional reactors in Florida were cancelled in 2013.

Some smaller reactors operating in deregulated markets have become uneconomic to operate and maintain, due to competition from generators using low priced natural gas, and may be retired early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/6007202 |title=Some merchant nuclear plants could face early retirement: UBS |newspaper=Platts |date=9 January 2013 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 556 MWe [[Kewaunee Power Station]] is being closed 20 years before license expiry for these economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dom.mediaroom.com/2012-10-22-Dominion-To-Close-Decommission-Kewaunee-Power-Station |title=Dominion To Close, Decommission Kewaunee Power Station |publisher=Dominion |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nei-20130101&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/opinion/opiniona-write-off |title=Why are North American plants dying? |author=Caroline Peachey |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=1 January 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke Energy]]'s [[Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant]] in Florida closed, as it could not recover the costs needed to fix its containment building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke-energy.com/news/releases/2013020501.asp "Crystal River Nuclear Plant to be retired; company evaluating sites for potential new gas-fueled generation". 5 February 2013.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022070113/http://www.duke-energy.com/news/releases/2013020501.asp |date=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these changes, after reaching peak production in 2007, US nuclear capacity has been undergoing constant reduction every year.

Proponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear power is a [[sustainable energy]] source which reduces [[carbon emissions]] and can increase [[energy security]] if its use supplants a dependence on imported fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aXb5iuqdZoD4&amp;refer=us U.S. Energy Legislation May Be `Renaissance' for Nuclear Power].&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution, in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel. Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course to achieve [[energy independence]] for most Western countries. They emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors, and the operational safety record in the Western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Economics===
{{Main|Economics of nuclear power plants}} 
The '''economics of new nuclear power plants''' is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multi-billion dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. [[Nuclear power plant]]s typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low direct fuel costs (with much of the costs of fuel extraction, processing, use and long term storage externalized).  Therefore, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants. Cost estimates also need to take into account [[nuclear decommissioning|plant decommissioning]] and [[nuclear waste]] storage costs. On the other hand measures to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] [[global warming]], such as a [[carbon tax]] or [[carbon emissions trading]], may favor the economics of nuclear power versus fossil fuels.
 
In recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult, which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors, with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks.&lt;ref name=kidd2011/&gt; In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out.&lt;ref name=kidd2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2058653 |title=New reactors—more or less? |author=Kidd, Steve |date=21 January 2011 |work=Nuclear Engineering International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212195417/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2058653 |archivedate=12 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects.&lt;ref name=kidd2011/&gt;

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by [[Nationalized|state-owned]] or [[Regulated market|regulated]] [[Electric utility|utility monopolies]]&lt;ref name=ft-20100912&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad15fcfe-bc71-11df-a42b-00144feab49a.html |title=Nuclear: New dawn now seems limited to the east |author=Ed Crooks |publisher=Financial Times |date=12 September 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where many of the risks associated with construction costs, operating performance, fuel price, and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. Many countries have now liberalized the [[electricity market]] where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=MIT-2003&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-615-12420-8 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.&lt;ref name="Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2011 xv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/studies/documents/nuclear-fuel-cycle/The_Nuclear_Fuel_Cycle-all.pdf |title=The Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2011 |work= |page=xv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
{{Main|Environmental impact of nuclear power}} 
[[File:Nuclear power environmenal collage.jpg|thumb|right|Nuclear power activities involving the environment; mining, enrichment, generation and geological disposal.]]
 
The '''environmental impact of [[nuclear power]]''' results from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], operation, and the effects of [[nuclear accidents]].

The [[greenhouse gas emission]]s from nuclear fission power are small relative to those associated with coal, oil, gas, and biomass. They are about equal to those associated with wind and hydroelectric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/uploadedFiles/org/WNA/Publications/Working_Group_Reports/comparison_of_lifecycle.pdf |title=Comparison of Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Various Electricity Generation Sources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The routine health risks from nuclear fission power are very small relative to those associated with coal, oil, gas, solar, biomass, wind and hydroelectric.&lt;ref name="ExterneE"&gt;[http://manhaz.cyf.gov.pl/manhaz/strona_konferencja_EAE-2001/15%20-%20Polenp~1.pdf Economic Analysis of Various Options of Electricity Generation  - Taking into Account Health and Environmental Effects, based on EU ExterneE Project data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230434/http://manhaz.cyf.gov.pl/manhaz/strona_konferencja_EAE-2001/15%20-%20Polenp~1.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is a "catastrophic risk" potential if containment fails,&lt;ref name=ipfm2010/&gt; which in nuclear reactors can be brought about by over-heated fuels melting and releasing large quantities of fission products into the environment. The public is sensitive to these risks and there has been considerable [[Anti-nuclear movement|public opposition to nuclear power]]. Even so, in comparing the fatalities for major accidents alone in the energy sector it is still found that the risks associated with nuclear power are extremely small relative to those associated with coal, oil, gas and hydroelectric.&lt;ref name="ExterneE" /&gt; For the operation of a 1000-MWe nuclear power plant the complete nuclear fuel cycle, from mining to reactor operation to waste disposal, the radiation dose is cited as 136 person-rem/year, the dose is 490 person-rem/year for an equivalent coal-fired power plant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/ORNL%20Review%20v26n3-4%201993.pdf pg28&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] and 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], along with high construction costs, ended the rapid growth of global nuclear power capacity.&lt;ref name=ipfm2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fissilematerials.com/ipfm/site_down/rr09.pdf |title=The Uncertain Future of Nuclear Energy |author=International Panel on Fissile Materials |date = September 2010|work=Research Report 9 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further disastrous release of radioactive materials followed the 2011 Japanese tsunami which damaged the [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]], resulting in [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|hydrogen gas explosions and partial meltdowns]] classified as a [[International Nuclear Event Scale|Level 7]] event. The large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in people being evacuated from a 20&amp;nbsp;km exclusion zone set up around the power plant, similar to the 30&amp;nbsp;km radius [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] still in effect.

===Accidents===

The effect of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate practically since the first [[nuclear reactor]]s were constructed. It has also been a key factor in [[Anti-nuclear movement|public concern about nuclear facilities]].&lt;ref name=mvr&gt;[[M.V. Ramana]]. Nuclear Power: Economic, Safety, Health, and Environmental Issues of Near-Term Technologies, ''Annual Review of Environment and Resources'', 2009, 34, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Some technical measures to reduce the risk of accidents or to minimize the amount of [[radioactivity]] released to the environment have been adopted. Despite the use of such measures, [[Normal Accidents|human error]] remains, and "there have been many accidents with varying effects as well near misses and incidents".&lt;ref name="mvr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/the-nuclear-ups-and-downs-of-2011/ |title=The Nuclear Ups and Downs of 2011 |author=Matthew Wald |date=29 February 2012 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
{{Main|Nuclear safety and security}} 
Nuclear safety and security covers the actions taken to prevent [[nuclear and radiation accidents]] or to limit their consequences.  This covers [[nuclear power plants]] as well as all other nuclear facilities, the transportation of nuclear materials, and the use and storage of nuclear materials for medical, power, industry, and military uses.

Although there is no way to guarantee that a reactor will always be designed, built and operated safely, the nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed safer reactor designs, though many of these designs have yet to be tested at industrial or commercial scales.&lt;ref name=globen/&gt; Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake.&lt;ref name="Hugh Gusterson"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Hugh Gusterson  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013  |df=dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DIAZMAURIN2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diaz Maurin |first=François |date=26 March 2011 |title=Fukushima: Consequences of Systemic Problems in Nuclear Plant Design |journal=Economic &amp; Political Weekly (Mumbai) |volume=46 |issue=13 |pages=10–12 |url=http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/15865.pdf }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says |author=James Paton |date=4 April 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515064305/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.&lt;ref name=globen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy transition]] is the shift by several countries to sustainable economies by means of [[renewable energy]], [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[sustainable development]]. This trend has been augmented by diversifying electricity generation and allowing homes and businesses with solar panels on their rooftops to sell electricity to the grid. In the future this could "lead to a majority of our energy coming from decentralized solar panels and wind turbines scattered across the country" rather than large power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Renewable energy encompasses [[Wind power|wind]], [[biomass]] (such as [[landfill gas]] and [[sewage gas]]), [[hydropower]], [[solar power]] (thermal and photovoltaic), [[Geothermal electricity|geothermal]], and [[Marine energy|ocean power]]. These renewable sources serve as alternatives to conventional power generation from [[thermal power station]]s run on nuclear or fossil fuels.
A significant part of energy transition is reducing consumption by [[energy conservation]] and improvements in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], an example is improved [[building insulation|insulation]] for buildings; or improved energy efficiency by [[cogeneration]] of heat and power. [[Smart meter]]s are able to charge higher prices at the time consumption peaks during the day, thereby causing electricity demand to drop slightly when the price increases.

Issues exist that currently prevent a shift over to a 100% renewable technologies. There is debate over the [[environmental impact of solar power]], and the [[environmental impact of wind power]]. Some argue that the pollution produced and requirement of [[rare earth elements]] offsets many of the benefits compared to other alternative power sources such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear power.&lt;ref name="US Department of Energy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy |title=Advantages and Challenges of Wind Power |date= 12 Feb 2015 |work=DOE}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |title=Post Carbon Pathways |author=John Wiseman |date=April 2013 |work=University of Melbourne |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620031627/http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a research paper published in 2014, renewable energy by itself, will not be able to stop climate change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2008/TargetCO2_20080407.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Google spent $30 million on their RE&lt;C project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change. The project was cancelled after concluding that a best-case scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change&lt;/ref&gt; 
Current developments towards a 100% renewable energy policy require solutions to low storage capacity, low energy density, and high cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engerati.com/article/energy-storage-development-still-faces-obstacles&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ob-Ugric languages''' are a hypothetical{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} branch of the [[Uralic languages]], specifically referring to the [[Khanty language|Khanty]] (Ostyak) and [[Mansi language|Mansi]] (Vogul) languages. Both are split in numerous and highly divergent dialects. They, along with [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], comprise the [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] branch of the [[Uralic languages]].

The languages are spoken in the region between the [[Urals]] and the [[Ob River]] and the [[Irtysh]] in central [[Russia]]. The forests and forest steppes of the southern Urals are thought to be the original homeland of the Ugric branch. Beginning some 500 years ago the arrival of the Russians pushed the speakers eastward to the Ob and Irtysh. Some Mansi speakers remained west of the Urals until as late as the early 20th century. [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] split off during the 11th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Hajdú, Péter | year = 1981 | title = Az uráli nyelvészet alapkérdései | publisher = Tankönyvkiadó, Budapest | isbn  = 963-17-4219-9 | authorlink = Péter Hajdú }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jászó, Anna | year = 1994 | title = A magyar nyelv könyve | publisher = Trezor Kiadó, Budapest | isbn = 963-7685-42-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Khanty Mansi dialects.svg|thumbnail|300px|Khanty (reddish and greenish) and Mansi (bluish) dialects]]
The status of the Ob-Ugric languages as a close [[Sprachbund|areal]] grouping is clear, with adjacent varieties regularly sharing isoglosses and having loaned vocabulary back and forth (as well as from common external sources, e.g. from eastern dialects of [[Komi language|Komi]] into northern dialects of Mansi and Khanty). This effect is particularly clear between the more eastern and northern varieties of Mansi, and the more western varieties of Khanty. Modern-day Northern Mansi and Northern Khanty continue to affect each other's evolution. Some areal similarities are also shared with their eastern Samoyedic relatives, in particular between Khanty and [[Selkup language|Selkup]], but also [[Forest Nenets language|Forest Nenets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Eugene|last=Helimski|title=Areal groupings (Sprachbünde) within and across the borders of the Uralic language family: A survey|year=2003|journal=Nyelvtudományi Közlemények|ISSN=0029-6791|url=http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/100/helimski.pdf|accessdate=2014-10-31|pp=160–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The relationship to Hungarian is looser: in their current state, the Ob-Ugric languages are radically different from Hungarian in phonology, syntax, and vocabulary.

Typological features distinguishing the Ob-Ugric languages include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

* Retention of Proto-Uralic word-initial *w as /w/. (Also a feature of [[Nenets languages|Nenets]].)
* [[Vowel harmony]] is found in the most archaic varieties, southern Mansi and eastern Khanty.
* [[Ablaut]] of vowels, particularly in eastern Khanty
* In the northern dialects: a change *k → /x/ before [[back vowel]]s. (A similar change also occurred in Hungarian.)
* Retention of [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) word order
* Retention of [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]]
* Partial or full replacement of the original [[Grammatical person|2nd person]] pronominal and suffixal elements; marked by the consonant /t/ in most Uralic languages but for the most part /n/ in Ob-Ugric.
* A smaller [[grammatical case|case]] system than in other Uralic languages, including a lack of the [[genitive case]].

The Ob-Ugric languages have also been strongly influenced by nearby [[Turkic languages]], especially [[Tatar language|Tatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greller, Wolfgang | date = 2000-04-01 | title = Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | isbn = 0-631-22039-9 | page = 478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansi has about 1,000 speakers while Khanty has about 10,000 speakers, all within Russia. Until 1930, these languages had no written or literary traditions, but since 1937 have used a modified [[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic alphabet]].  However, no significant texts have been created in these languages and they have few official usages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056621 | title = Ob-Ugric languages | accessdate = 2006-06-22 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a common Ob-Ugric period after the separation from Hungarian and the rest of Uralic is not universally accepted: some linguists treat all common features of Mansi and Khanty as either later convergence under mutual influence, or retentions from the common Ugric and earlier periods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2943">'''Objective abstraction''' was a British art movement c. 1933-1936.

==History==
Objective abstraction was a form of abstract art developed by a group of British artists in 1933. Experimentation was prevalent in [[British art]] at the time.

The main figures were [[Graham Bell (artist)|Graham Bell]], [[William Coldstream]], [[Edgar Hubert]], [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] and [[Geoffrey Tibble]].

The movement was short-lived lasting only a few years. Many of the artists involved went on to be part of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] [[Euston Road School]].

==Method==
William Townsend told the [[Tate Gallery]] that 'the style originated with [[Geoffrey Tibble]] in the latter half of 1933. It was immediately taken up by [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] [...] and at the same time or shortly after by [[Edgar Hubert]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hubert-painting-t06602/text-catalogue-entry|title=Stephens, Chris (1997) Edgar Hubert, Painting 1935-6: Catalogue entry, Tate website|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.ucl.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo==%27TOWNSEND%27&amp;dsqDb=Catalog|title=William Townsend papers, University College London archive |accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Townsend, early paintings by the group were derived from external objects but they became increasingly abstract.

The more abstract paintings, that came to represent the movements style, were created using improvised freely applied brushstrokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/o/objective-abstraction|title=Objective Abstraction, Tate website|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/moynihan-objective-abstraction-t00172|title=Rodrigo Moynihan, artwork 'Objective Abstraction' c.1935–6, Tate Gallery|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Tibble]] described them as 'not abstracted from nature, and which made no reference to and had no associations with anything outside themselves [...] the picture was an object in its own right' (Bowness, 1960:198).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/873008?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104397110851|title=Bowness, Alan (1960) The Paintings and Constructions of Victor Pasmore, ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 102, no. 168, May, pp. 198-203|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 1934, the exhibition ''Objective Abstractions'' was held at the [[Zwemmer Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/galleries/zwemmer-gallery|title=Zwemmer Gallery, Artist Biographies website|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing the group's work, except Hubert's. The exhibition also included work by more representational artists, [[Ivon Hitchens]], [[Victor Pasmore]], and [[Ceri Richards]].

The '''pandemic severity index''' ('''PSI''') is a proposed classification scale for reporting the severity of [[influenza pandemic]]s in the United States. The PSI was accompanied by a set of guidelines intended to help communicate appropriate actions for communities to follow in potential [[pandemic]] situations.&lt;ref name=HHS&gt;[[Department of Health &amp; Human Services]], (2007) [http://www.pandemicflu.gov/plan/community/community_mitigation.pdf Interim Pre-Pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States— Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions] (Full Text of the Initial Report outlining PSI), [[Centers for Disease Control]], USA&lt;/ref&gt; Released by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) on 1 February 2007, the PSI was designed to resemble the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] classification scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Health Officials Unveil Flu Pandemic Plan | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/01/AR2007020101246.html | quote=U.S. health officials on Thursday outlined an early-warning system similar to that employed for hurricanes to protect and mobilize the country against a flu pandemic. |work=Washington Post |date=1 February 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-21 | first=Amanda | last=Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ties&gt;{{cite news | last=Roos | first=Robert |author2=Lisa Schnirring | title=HHS ties pandemic mitigation advice to severity | publisher=[[CIDRAP]] News | date=1 Feb 2007 | url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/feb0107pandemic.html | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The PSI was developed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) as a new pandemic influenza planning tool for use by states, communities, businesses and schools, as part of a drive to provide more specific community-level prevention measures.&lt;ref name=unveils&gt;{{cite press release | title=HHS unveils two new efforts to advance pandemic flu preparedness | publisher=Office of Enterprise Communication, Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date=2007-02-01 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/2007/r070201a.htm | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although designed for domestic implementation, the HHS has not ruled out sharing the index and guidelines with interested international parties.&lt;ref name=simple&gt;{{cite news | last=Pellerin | first=Cheryl | title=Simple Planning Tools Can Help in Early Days of Pandemic | publisher=[[USINFO]] | date=12 Feb 2007 | url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/February/20070212130917lcnirellep0.3025629.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128201729/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/February/20070212130917lcnirellep0.3025629.html | archivedate=28 November 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The index and guidelines were developed by applying principles of [[epidemiology]] to data from the history of the last three major flu pandemics and [[seasonal flu]] transmission, mathematical models,  and input from experts and citizen focus groups.&lt;ref name=ties/&gt; Many "tried and true"&lt;ref name=praise&gt;{{cite news | last=Roos | first=Robert |author2=Lisa Schnirring | title=Experts give qualified praise to new pandemic guidance | publisher=[[CIDRAP]] News | date=2007-02-02 | url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/feb0207reactions.html | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; practices were combined together in a more structured manner:-

{{quote|We also realize as we look back through history is what cities did – 44 cities did, is that many of these measures ultimately every city adopted at some point or another, and the difference may be in the timing of using these measures and whether they're coordinated in an effective way for us to really gain the benefits of them.|Dr Martin Cetron, Director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;}}

==Context==
During the onset of a growing pandemic, local communities cannot rely upon widespread availability of [[antiviral drug]]s and [[influenza vaccine|vaccine]]s&lt;ref name=simple/&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news
  | last = Manning
  | first = Anita
  | title = Government issues pandemic flu plans
  |work=USA Today
  | date = 2 Feb 2007
  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-02-01-flu_x.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Influenza research]]).
The goal of the index is to provide guidance as to what measures various organizations can enact that will slow down the progression of a pandemic, easing the burden of stress upon community resources while definite solutions, like drugs and vaccines, can be brought to bear on the situation. The CDC expects adoption of the PSI will allow early co-ordinated use of community mitigation measures to affect pandemic progression.&lt;ref name =ties/&gt;

==Guidelines==
The index focuses less on how likely a disease will spread worldwide – that is, become a pandemic – and more upon how severe the epidemic actually is.&lt;ref name = transcript&gt;{{cite press release | title=Update of Pandemic Flu Preparedness | publisher=Office of Enterprise Communication, Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control | date=1 February 2007 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/%20t070201.htm | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main criterion used to measure pandemic severity will be [[case-fatality ratio]] (CFR), the percentage of deaths out of the total reported cases of the disease.&lt;ref name=ties/&gt;

The actual implementation of PSI alerts is expected to occur after the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) announces [[WHO pandemic phases|phase 6]] influenza transmission (human to human) in the United States. This would probably result in immediate announcement of a PSI level 3–4 situation.&lt;ref name=ties/&gt;

{{anchor|Categories}}The analogy of "category" levels were introduced to provide an understandable connection to [[Tropical cyclone scales|hurricane classification]] schemes, with specific reference to the recent aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt;&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;
Like the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]], the PSI ranges from 1 to 5, with Category 1 pandemics being most mild (equivalent to [[seasonal flu]]) and level 5 being reserved for the most severe "worst-case" scenario pandemics (such as the 1918 [[Spanish flu]]).&lt;ref name=ties/&gt;&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

The report recommends four primary [[social distancing]] measures for slowing down a pandemic:
* Isolation and treatment of people who have suspected or confirmed cases of pandemic influenza
* Voluntary home quarantine of household contacts of those with suspected or confirmed pandemic influenza
* Dismissing school classes and closing daycare centers
* Changing work schedules and canceling large public gatherings&lt;ref name=HHS/&gt;

These actions, when implemented, can have an overall effect of reducing the number of new cases of the disease; but they can carry potentially adverse consequences in terms of community and social disruption.&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt; The measures should have the most noticeable impact if implemented uniformly by organizations and governments across the US.&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt;&lt;ref name=simple/&gt;&lt;ref name=praise/&gt;

==Response==
While unveiling the PSI, Dr. [[Martin Cetron]], Director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at the CDC, reported that early feedback to the idea of a pandemic classification scale has been "uniformly positive".&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;

The [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy]] (CIDRAP) reports that the PSI has been "drawing generally high marks from public health officials and others, but they say the plan spells a massive workload for local planners". One MD praised that the PSI were "a big improvement over the previous guidance"; while historical influenza expert and author [[John M. Barry]] was more critical of the PSI, saying not enough emphasis was placed on basic health principles that could have an impact at the community level, adding "I'd feel a lot more comfortable with a lot more research [supporting them]".&lt;ref name=praise/&gt;

During the initial press releases in 2007, the CDC acknowledge that the PSI and the accompanying  guidelines were a work in progress and will likely undergo revision in the months following their release.&lt;ref name=unveils/&gt;

The '''Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum''' is a museum located in Hubbard Hall at [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]].  Named after Arctic explorers and Bowdoin College graduates [[Robert E. Peary]] (Class of 1877) and [[Donald B. MacMillan]] (Class of 1898), it is one of two museums in the [[United States]] dedicated completely to Arctic Studies.

==History==
Bowdoin College’s historic relationship with the Arctic dates back to 1860, when a group of Bowdoin students accompanied one professor on a research trip to [[Labrador]] and [[West Greenland]]. Peary and MacMillan made many trips to the Arctic, together and separately. Bowdoin students also accompanied MacMillan on several expeditions in the early-to-mid-20th century.  To this day, professors and students of the college continue to travel to the Arctic to pursue research.

The Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum was made possible by generous donations from the Class of 1925, George B. Knox (Class of 1929), and other alumni and friends.  The Museum was dedicated in 1967, and MacMillan attended the opening that same year.

Established in 1985, the Arctic Studies Center links the resources of the museum and the library with teaching and research efforts, and hosts lectures, workshops, and educational outreach projects. "Through course offerings, field research programs, employment opportunities, and special events, the Arctic Studies Center promotes anthropological, archaeological, geological, and environmental investigations of the North."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowdoin.info/academics/courses/catalog/pdf-09-10/55-peary-macmillan-arctic-museum.pdf Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum and Arctic Studies Center] ''Educational Resources and Facilities'', The College Catalogue, 2011, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The Arctic Museum's exhibitions focus on different aspects of the Arctic, ranging from natural life, such as plants and animals, to cultural life of people native to the Arctic region.  Artifacts in the Museum's collection include Peary and MacMillan's expedition equipment, anthropologic objects, [[Inuit art]], films, archival papers, publications, and natural history specimens.  The Museum's exhibitions now change approximately every two years to show as much of the collection as possible.

The exhibition 'Imagination Takes Shape' will be on display through December 2011.  The exhibition is a collection of Canadian Inuit sculpture and prints from the Robert and Judith Toll Collection.

==Academic program==
Bowdoin College's Departments of Sociology, Anthropology, and Geology offer a concentration in Arctic Studies. These departments, together with the Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum, provide students with opportunities to explore cultural, social, and environmental issues involving Arctic lands and peoples. The Director of the Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum &amp; Arctic Studies Center is Susan A. Kaplan, Associate Professor of Anthropology.

==Visiting==
The Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum is open Tuesday – Saturday from 10:00&amp;nbsp;am to 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm, and on Sundays from 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm – 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm. The Museum is closed on Mondays and on national holidays. 
Admission is free, and donations are accepted. School and group tours may be arranged.

'''The resolution of the [[Comintern]]''' of January 11, 1934, was an official political document, in which for the first time, an authoritative international organization has recognized the existence of a separate [[Macedonian nation]] and [[Macedonian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Perry, "The Republic of Macedonia: finding its way" in Karen Dawisha and Bruce Parrot (eds.), Politics, power and the struggle for Democracy in South-Eastern Europe, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp. 228-229.&lt;/ref&gt; 
== Background ==
At that time there were few historians, ethnographers or linguists who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation and language existed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis P. Hupchick]] states that "the obviously plagiarized historical argument of the Macedonian nationalists for a separate Macedonian ethnicity could be supported only by linguistic reality, and that worked against them until the 1940s. Until a modern Macedonian literary language was mandated by the communist-led partisan movement from Macedonia in 1944, most outside observers and linguists agreed with the Bulgarians in considering the vernacular spoken by the Macedonian Slavs as a western dialect of Bulgarian". Dennis P. Hupchick, ''Conflict and Chaos in Eastern Europe'', Palgrave Macmillan, 1995, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loring M. Danforth, The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World, Princeton University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0691043566}}, [https://books.google.bg/books?id=ZmesOn_HhfEC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=At+the+end+of+World+War+I+there+were+very+few+historians+or+ethnographers+who+claimed+that+a+separate+Macedonian+nation+existed.+It+seems+most+likely&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EfXbyDIBVN&amp;sig=2nRM9Me1yHGZcZac3heOv6U0nsM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbqaqLzPXZAhUmhaYKHdJ3BN4Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 65.]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 20th century among the majority of the Slavs in the region of Macedonia coexisted pro-Bulgarian ethnic sentiments and regional Macedonian identity.&lt;ref&gt;''During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.'' "Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe", Ethnologia Balkanica Series, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2010, {{ISBN|3825813878}}, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gallagher|first1=Thomas|title=Outcast Europe: The Balkans, 1789-1989: From the Ottomans to Milosevic|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415375592|page=47|quote=Where an overarching identity existed among Slavs in Macedonia, it was a Bulgarian one until at least the 1860s. The cultural impetus for a separated 'Macedonian identity' would only emerge later.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partition of the Ottoman Macedonia between Balkan nation-states after the conclusion of the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918) left the area divided mainly between Greece and Serbia (later Yugoslavia). As result part of the Slav inhabitants of the region emigrated to [[Bulgarian Macedonia]]. Under Serbian control in Vardar Macedonia the locals faced with the policy of forced [[Serbianisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dejan Djokić, Yugoslavism: histories of a failed idea, 1918–1992, University of Wisconsin Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0299186105}}, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek governments also began promulgating a policy of persecution of the use of Slavic dialects both in public and in private, as well of expressions of any ethnic distinctiveness. In 1919 and 1927 [[Population transfer|population exchange]] agreements were signed and the bulk of the Slavic-speaking population in Greece left for Bulgaria. In this way the ''[[Bulgarian Millet|Bulgarian community]]'' in most of the area began to reduce, either by population exchanges or by change of its ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Banac, The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics, Cornell University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0801494931}}, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resolution ==
In June 1931 the registrar of the Comintern [[Otto Kuusinen]] in his report on the [[national question]] to the Executive Committee, suggested that the main weakness of the Comintern was the insufficient appreciation of the national questions.&lt;ref&gt;К у у с и н е н, О. Слабият участък от фронта на Коминтерна. — Комунистическо знаме, VIII. 1931, № 9, с. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuusinen called to discuss the national question in order to develop a new national program for each of the parties. Meanwhile, to the Balkan communist parties a directive was provided, for the gradual abandonment of the slogan of the [[Balkan Federation]], highlighting in its foreground the "''right of the distinct peoples of self-determination to a full separation''". The reason for this political turning, was the rising of [[Nazism]] in [[Germany]]. Thus in 1932 a members of the Comintern sponsored [[IMRO (United)]], put for the first time the issue of the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Произходът на македонската нация - Стенограма от заседание на Македонския Научен Институт в София през 1947 г.&lt;/ref&gt; This question was discussed among them, however, there was a split when Vasil Hadzhikimov and his group, refused to agree that the Macedonians are a separate people from the Bulgarians. Nevertheless, the highest institutions of the Comintern were informed about this issue from Dino Kyosev who gave a lecture in Moscow in 1933 on the distinct Macedonian national consciousness.

As result in the autumn of 1933 the Macedonian [[Dimitar Vlahov]] - leader of the [[IMRO (United)]] and former Bulgarian diplomat, was summoned in Moscow and took part in a number of meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Мемоари на Димитър Влахов. Скопје, 1970, стр. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; At one of  them the Executive Committee ordered the leading cadres of the Balkan Secretariate, [[Henryk Walecki|Valecki]] - a Pole, and [[Bohumír Šmeral|Šmeral]] - a Czech, to draw up a special resolution on the issue. Because they had no concept of this problem, using Vlahov's help the resolution yet had been prepared.&lt;ref&gt;Balkan Studies: Biannual Publication of the Institute for Balkan Studies, Hidryma Meletōn Chersonēsou tou Haimou (Thessalonikē, Greece), 1994, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; Vlahov claims, before the convening of the consultation the leadership had already its stand that the Macedonian nation exists.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitar Vlahov, Memoirs, Skopje, Nova Makedonija, 1970, str. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; So on January 11, 1934, the Political Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Comintern adopted its final decision on the [[Macedonian Question]] about the existence of a Macedonian nation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ppbuavUZKEwC&amp;pg=PA98 Who are the Macedonians?] Hugh Poulton, C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|1-85065-534-0}}, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the new concept was the common view that the [[region of Macedonia]] is one of the pivots of future imperialist war and therefore the Comintern seeks an option to blunt the contradictions between the countries that possess it. This decision by the Comintern was the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Палешутски, Костадин. Югославската комунистическа партия и македонският въпрос, 1919–1945, Издателство на Българската Академия на Науките, София 1985, стр. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vlahov, that was precisely what happened in Moscow in 1934:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"I mentioned earlier that the Comintern itself wanted the Macedonian Question to be considered at one of the consultations of its executive committee. One day I was informed that the consultation would be held. And so it was. Before the convening of the consultation, the inner leadership of the committee had already reached its stand, including the question of Macedonian nation, and charged the Balkan Secretariat with the drafting of corresponding resolution... In the resolution, which we published in the Makedonsko Delo in 1934, it was concluded that the Macedonian nation exists"''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&amp;pg=PA328 The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics], [[Ivo Banac]], Cornell University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-8014-9493-1}}, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This will bring even Dimitar Vlahov on the session of the Politburo of the Macedonian communist party in 1948, when speaking of the existence of the Macedonian nation, to say that in 1932 (when left wing of IMRO issued for the first time the idea of separate Macedonian nation) a mistake was made.

Despite the fact that this was formally a Resolution of IMRO (United), it was a document adopted by the Comintern, which was immediately published in all the mouthpieces of this international communist centre. Afterwards the mainstream Bulgarian public opinion has maintained that the Comintern is the "inventor" of the idea about the existence of a separate Macedonian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Macedonia: Warlords and Rebels in the Balkans, John Phillips, I.B.Tauris, 2004, {{ISBN|186064841X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SB1OrH8iZtcC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=bulgarian+1934+macedonian++comintern+vlahov&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xoaMUqT4I4bwhQfd4YGgCw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 37.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Prior to the [[Second World War]], this views on the Macedonian issue had been of little practical importance. During the War the macedonist ideas were further developed by the Yugoslav Communist Partisans, although  some researchers doubt that even at that time the Macedonian Slavs identified themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world, Loring M.

A '''school uniform''' is a [[uniform]] worn by [[students]] primarily for a [[school]] or otherwise educational institution. They are common in [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s in various countries. Although often used interchangeably, there is an important distinction between  '''[[dress codes]]''' and '''school uniforms''': according to scholars such as Nathan Joseph, clothing can only be considered a uniform when it "(a) serves as a group emblem, (b) certifies an institution's legitimacy by revealing individual’s relative positions and (c) suppresses individuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Nathan|title=Uniforms and nonuniforms : communication through clothing|date=1986|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0313251959}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a uniform would be requiring white [[Dress shirt|button-downs]] and ties for boys and pleated skirts for girls, with both wearing blazers. A uniform can even be as simple as requiring collared shirts, or restricting colour choices and limiting items students are allowed to wear. A dress code, on the other hand, is much less restrictive, and focuses "on promoting modesty and discouraging anti-social fashion statements", according to Marian Wilde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilde|first1=Marian|title=Do Uniforms Make Schools Better|url=http://www.greatschools.org/find-a-school/defining-your-ideal/121-school-uniforms.gs?page=2|website=GreatSchools.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of a dress code would be not allowing ripped clothing, no logos or limiting the amount of skin that can be shown.

It is not difficult to trace the origins of the uniform as there is no comprehensive written history, but rather a variety of known influences. School uniforms are believed to be a practice which dates to the 16th century in the United Kingdom. It is believed that the Christ Hospital School in London in 1552 was the first school to use a school uniform.&lt;ref&gt;see https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-29047752&lt;/ref&gt; Students were given a uniform that most notably consisted of a long blue coat and yellow, knee-high socks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christs-hospital.org.uk/about-ch/history-of-the-uniform/|title=History of the Uniform|website=www.christs-hospital.org.uk|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An almost identitical uniform is still worn by students attending the school today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The earliest documented proof of institutionalised use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the then Archbishop of Canterbury ordered the wearing of the cappa clausa.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite  book

This monastic and academic practice evolved into collegiate uniforms in England, particularly in charity schools where uniform dress was often provided for poor children. Universities, primary schools and secondary schools used uniforms as a marker of class and status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brunsma|first1=David L.|title=The School Uniform Movement and What it Tells Us about American Education : a Symbolic Crusade|date=2004|publisher=ScarecrowEducation|location=Lanham, Md.

[[File:Uwabaki.jpg|thumb|In many schools, Japanese students are required to take off the shoes they wear outdoors and put on their ''[[uwabaki]]'', a kind of soft slipper meant to be used only indoors.]]

In the [[United States]], a movement toward using uniforms in [[state school]]s began when [[Bill Clinton]] addressed it in the 1996 [[State of the Union]], saying: "If it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear uniforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boutelle|first1=Marsha|title=UNIFORMS: Are They A Good Fit?|journal=Educational Digest|date=2003|volume=73|issue=6|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1998 approximately 25% of all U.S. public elementary, middle and junior high schools had adopted a uniform policy or were considering a policy, and two thirds were implemented between 1995 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=Kathleen|last2=Stafford|first2=Mary|title=Public School Uniforms: Effect on Perceptions of Gang Presence, School Climate, and Student Self-Perceptions|journal=Education and Urban Society|date=August 2003|volume=35|issue=4|pages=399–420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are an abundance of theories and [[empirical studies]] looking at school uniforms, making statements about their effectiveness. These theories and studies elaborate on the benefits and also the shortcomings of uniform policies. The issue of [[nature vs. nurture]] comes into play, as uniforms affect the perceptions of [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]], complicate the issue of gender classification and also subdue the [[Human female sexuality|sexuality of girls]]. With uniforms also comes a variety of controversies, pros, cons and major legal implications.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

There are two main empirical findings that are most often cited in the political rhetoric surrounding the uniform debate. One of these, the [[case study]] of the [[Long Beach Unified School District]], is most often cited in support of school uniforms and their effectiveness whereas ''Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance, Behavior Problems, Substance Use, and Academic Achievement'' is the most frequently cited research in opposition to the implementation of school uniform policies.

===Effects of uniforms on students===
The case study of the Long Beach Unified School District was the study of the first large, urban school in the United States to implement a uniform policy. In 1994, mandatory school uniforms were implemented for the districts elementary and middle schools as a strategy to address the students' behaviour issues.&lt;ref name="nmu.edu"&gt;Reed, Joshua B. "Effects of a School Uniform Policy on an Urban School District." Northern Michigan University. N.p., 1 August 2011. Web. 19 April 2015. &lt;https://www.nmu.edu/sites/DrupalEducation/files/UserFiles/Files/Pre-Drupal/SiteSections/Students/GradPapers/Projects/Reed_Joshua_MP.pdf&gt;.Wade, K. K., &amp; Stafford, M. E. (2003). Public School Uniforms: Effect on Perceptions of Gang Presence, School Climate, and Student Self-Perceptions. Education and Urban Society, 35(4), 399–420. http://doi.org/10.1177/0013124503255002&lt;/ref&gt; The district simultaneously implemented a longitudinal study to research the effects of the uniforms on student behavior. The study attributed favourable student behavioral changes and a significant drop in school discipline issues&lt;ref name="nmu.edu"/&gt; to the mandatory uniform policy. This case study attributed the following noticeable outcomes to the use of uniforms throughout the district:
*Fewer absences and truancies;
*Fewer referrals to the office for behavior problems;
*Fewer suspensions and expulsions;
**Reduced by 28% (elementary) and 36% (middle school);
*Decreased crime and vandalism;
**Reduced by 74% (elementary) and 18% (middle school);
*Better grades, and in some cases, significantly higher achievement.&lt;ref name="faculty.unlv.edu"&gt;Brunsma, David L., and Kerry A. Rockquemore. "Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance,  Behavior Problems, Substance Use, and Academic Achievement." The Journal of  Educational Research 92.1 (1998): 53-62. Web. 31 March 2015. &lt;https://faculty.unlv.edu/sloe/Courses/EPY%20702/Class%20Exercises/Lecture%201%20Materials/Articles/Brunsma%20et%20al.%20(1998).pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|200px|Colombian primary school students with their teacher]]
Other research found that uniforms were not an effective deterrent to decrease truancy, did not decrease behavior problems, decrease substance use, or increase student achievement.

A study suggested that "instead of directly affecting specific outcomes, uniforms act as a catalyst for change and provide a highly visible opportunity for additional programs" within schools. In fact, Brunsma et al., 1998 considered that this was the case with the Long Beach Unified School District case study as several additional reform efforts were implemented simultaneously with the mandatory uniform policy.&lt;ref name="faculty.unlv.edu"/&gt;

Brunsma stated that despite the inconclusiveness of the effects of uniforms, they became more common because "this is an issue of children's rights, of social control, and one related to increasing racial, class and gender inequalities in our schools."&lt;ref name=Northen&gt;{{cite web|author=Northen, Stephanie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/school-uniform-results|title=School uniform does not improve results – discuss |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2011-01-18|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws and rulings  ==
As uniforms have become more normalised, there have also been an increasing number of lawsuits brought against school districts.  According to David Brunsma, one in four public elementary schools and one in eight public middle and high schools in the USA have policies dictating what a student wears to school.&lt;ref&gt;Brunsma, David L. Uniforms in Public Schools: A Decade of Research and Debate. Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The school code within states’ constitutions typically asserts that it allows the board of school directors to make reasonable rules and regulations as they see fit in managing the school’s affairs.  As of 2008, there are currently 23 states that allow school districts to mandate school uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Colasanti, Michael. "School Uniforms and Dress Codes: State Policies." StateNote (2008). Education Commission of the States. Education Commission of the States. Web. 19 April 2015. &lt;http://www.ecs.org/clearinghouse/77/97/7797.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitutional objections usually brought upon school districts tend to fall into one of the following two categories: (1) a violation of the students’ [[First Amendment]] right to free expression (2) a violation of parents' right to raise their children without government interference.  Although up until this point, The Supreme Court has not ruled on a case involving school uniforms directly, in the 1968 decision [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]], the Court ruled that upon entering school, students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Kraft, Jacquelyn. Society's Perceptions and Attitudes Toward School Uniforms. Research Paper. 
University of Wisconsin-Stout.  August 2003.  Web http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.390.8124&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, there are differing views of school uniforms. In the Australian state of Queensland, Ombudsman Fred Albietz ruled in 1998 that state schools may not require uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optionality.net/mag/oct98a.html|title=Those disgusting School Uniforms (B)|publisher=Optionality Magazine|accessdate=30 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Philippines]], the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] abolished the requirement of school uniforms in public schools{{definition|date=December 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;DepEd Order No. 45, s. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[England and Wales]], technically a state school may not permanently exclude students for "breaching school uniform policy", under a policy promulgated by the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] but students not wearing the correct uniform are asked to go home and change.  In Scotland, some [[local government in Scotland|local councils]] (that have responsibility for delivering state education) do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gourockhigh.inverclyde.sch.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAxADYANAB8AHwARgBhAGwAcwBlAHwAfAA0AHwA0 |title=Authority Strategic Statement of Inverclyde Education Service |publisher=Gourock High School |accessdate=28 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064212/http://gourockhigh.inverclyde.sch.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAxADYANAB8AHwARgBhAGwAcwBlAHwAfAA0AHwA0 |archivedate=14 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkey abolished mandatory uniforms in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-210471-101-school-uniform-requirement-to-be-abolished.html School uniform requirement to be abolished]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of lawsuits in the United States===

====''Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board''====

In the ''Canady v. [[Bossier Parish School Board]]'' lawsuit in 2000, a Louisiana district court ruled in favour of the school board because it did not see how the free speech rights of the students were being violated due to the school board's uniform policy.  Even though the plaintiff appealed the decision, the Fifth Circuit Court also ruled in favour of the school board after implementing a four-step system that is still used today.  Firstly, a school board has to have the right to set up a policy.  Secondly, the policy must be determined to support a fundamental interest of the board as a whole.  Thirdly, the guidelines cannot have been set for the purpose of censorship.  Finally, the limits on student expression cannot be greater than the interest of the board.  As long as these four policies are in place, then no constitutional violation can be claimed.&lt;ref&gt;"First Amendment Schools: The Five Freedoms - Court Case." First Amendment Schools: The Five Freedoms - Court Case. First Amendment Schools. Web. 19 April 2015. &lt;http://www.firstamendmentschools.org/freedoms/case.aspx?id=1690&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Littlefield v. Forney Independent School District''====

In the [[Forney Independent School District]] of [[Forney, Texas]] in 2001, the school board decided to implement a school uniform policy allowing the students to wear a [[polo shirt]], [[oxford shirt]] or [[blouse]] in four possible colours, and blue or [[Khaki#Tones of khaki|khaki]] pants or shirts, a skirt or jumper.  While there was some flexibility with shoes, certain types were prohibited along with any sort of baggy clothes.  The parents of the Littlefield family requested that their son be exempt from the policy, but were denied.  In response, the Littlefields filed a lawsuit against the school district, under the pretenses that this uniform mandate infringed on their rights as parents to control how they brought up their children and their education. They even went as far as to cite an infringement on religious freedom, claiming that opting out of the uniforms on the grounds of religion allowed the school to rank the validity of certain religions.  Before trial, the District Court dismissed the case, so the family appealed.  Ultimately, the Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the students' rights were not being violated even though the claims presented were valid.  They ruled that school rules derived from the education would override the parents' right to control their children's upbringing in this specific situation.  As far as the religious freedom violation accusations, the court ruled that the policy did not have a religious goal, and thus did not infringe on religious freedom rights.&lt;ref&gt;"First Amendment Schools: The Five Freedoms - Court Case."

====''Jacobs v. Clark County School District''====

In 2003, Liberty High School, a school of the [[Clark County School District]] in [[Henderson, Nevada]], implemented a uniform policy of khakis and red, white or blue polo shirts.  A junior by the name of Kimberly Jacobs was suspended a total of five times because she wore a religious shirt to school and got cited for uniform violations.  Her family sued the Clark County School District under the claims that her First Amendment rights were being infringed upon and that the uniform policy was causing students to be deprived of [[due process]]. The plaintiff's requests were for injunctive relief, the expunging of suspensions from Jacob's school record and awarding of damages.  The injunction was granted to the family meaning that the school could no longer discipline her for breaking the uniform policy.  At this ruling, the school district appealed.  The next court ruled on the side of the school district as it determined that the uniform policy was in fact neutral and constitutional, and it dismissed the claims of the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;"Jacobs v. Clark County School District." The Recorder. 12 May 2008.

====''Frudden v. Washoe County School District''====

In 2011, a Nevada public elementary school of the [[Washoe County School District]] decided to add the school's motto, ''Tomorrow's Leaders'' embroidered in small letters on the shirt.  In response, Mary and John Frudden, parents of a student sued the school district on the basis of it violating the [[1st Amendment]]. The court ultimately dismissed the case filed by the Fruddens over the uniforms. However, the family appealed, and two years later, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard the case.  The court ruled to reverse the previous decision of dismissing the case, and also questioned the apparent policy for students that were part of a nationally recognised group such as Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts who were able to wear the uniforms in place of the school ones on regular meeting days. The 9th circuit panel ruled that the school had not provided enough evidence for why it instituted this policy, and that the family was never given a chance to argue.&lt;ref&gt;"Appeals Court Revives Reno School Uniform Case."

==Social implications of school uniforms on gender==
[[File:Indian schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|200px|Schoolgirls in Delhi, India. Indian schoolgirls can have uniform of both shirt and skirt, as well as ''[[shalwar kameez]]''.]]
[[File:School_girls_in_Bhaktapur.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|School girls in [[Nepal]]. Some school uniform policies include trousers for girls]]
[[File:ギリギリ短 (15580964194).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Japanese schoolgirls in short mini-skirts: [[Kogal|Kogal culture]]]]

There are several positive and negative social implications of uniforms on both the students wearing them and society as a whole.

===Perceptions of masculinity and femininity===
One of the criticisms of uniforms is that it imposes standards of masculinity and femininity from a young age. Uniforms are considered a form of discipline that schools use to control student behavior and often promote conventional gendered dress.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, R. W. "Teaching the Boys: New Research on Masculinity, and Gender Strategies for  Schools". ''Teachers College Record'' 98:2 (1996): 206-235. 31 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Happel, Alison 2013"&gt;Happel, Alison. "Ritualized girling: school uniforms and the compulsory performance of  gender." ''Journal of Gender Studies'' 22:1 (2013): 92-96. 1 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Boys often are required to wear trousers, belts, and closed-toe shoes and have their shirts tucked in at all times. They are also often required to have their hair cut short. Some critics allege that this uniform is associated with the dress of a professional business man, which, they claim, gives boys at a young age the impression that masculinity is gained through business success.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, J. (2007). "Uniforms Exposed: The Proliferation of Uniforms in Popular Culture as Markers of Change and Identity." Uniformierungen in Bewegung. Ed. Gabreile Mentges, Dagmar Neuland-Kitzerow, and Birgit Richard. Munster: Waxmann Verlag. 7-53.&lt;/ref&gt; For girls, some uniforms promote femininity by requiring girls to wear skirts. Skirts are seen by some critics as a symbol of femininity because they restrict movement and force certain ways of sitting and playing.&lt;ref name="Happel, Alison 2013"/&gt; Uniforms that include an [[apron]] for girls may suggest that the appropriate feminine societal role is a primarily domestic one. Some girls' school uniforms have been criticized as having an uncomfortable design, which prevents girls from free movement and exposes girls to cold during winter.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/mar/06/sexist-school-uniform-rules-trousers-girls&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexualization of girls===
Uniforms often start to increase in popularity around [[middle school]] in the [[United States]], when students begin going through puberty. Uniforms can be seen as a way to restrict the sexualization of girls (rules on hems of skirts, no shoulders). Uniforms take the focus away from sexuality and focus it on academics in a school setting for girls.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association, Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls. (2007). Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. Retrieved from www.apa.org/pi/wpo/sexualization.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the desire to prevent overtly sexualized clothing through uniforms can fail, as uniforms, especially those that include skirts, can have the opposite effects, as in Japan or South Korea. Miniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they became part of school uniforms, and they came to be worn within the [[Kogal]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/11/12/business/man-who-gave-us-loose-white-socks-eyes-comeback/#.Vifjt9IrJdh Kogal back in fashion- report by Japan Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/japans-schoolgirls-set-the-trend-1295844.html Japan's schoolgirls set the trend]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liberia schoolgirls (7269275010).jpg|thumb|220px|School girls in [[Liberia]]]]
In some cultures, the topic of school uniforms has sparked a multitude of controversies and debates over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Perspective On School Uniforms  |url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/perspective-school-uniforms/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=17 November 2017 |accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates concerning the constitutionality and economic feasibility of uniforms also contribute to the controversy.

In the United States, the implementation of school uniforms began following ten years of research indicating the effectiveness of [[private schools]]. Some state-school reformers cited this research to support policies linked to private and [[Catholic school]] success. However, within the Catholic school literature, school uniforms have never been acknowledged as a primary factor in producing a Catholic school effect.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic school effect is the thought that certain elements in a catholic school provide children with a stronger academic education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunsma, David L. 1998"&gt;Brunsma, David L.; Rockquemore, Kerry A. "Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance,  Behavior Problems, Substance Use, and Academic Achievement." ''The Journal of  Educational Research'' 92.1 (1998): 53-62. 31 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some public-school administrators began implementing uniform policies to improve the overall school environment and academic achievement of the students. This is based on the assumption that uniforms are the direct cause of behavioral and academic outcome changes.&lt;ref name="Brunsma, David L. 1998"/&gt;

Another area of controversy regarding school uniform and dress code policies revolve around the issue of gender. Nowadays, more teenagers are more frequently "dressing to articulate, or confound gender identity and [[sexual orientation]]", which brings about "responses from school officials that ranged from indifferences to applause to bans".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Hoffman, Jan (6 November 2009). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/fashion/08cross.html "Can a Boy Wear a Skirt to School?"] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, there were multiple conflicts across the United States arising from disparities between the students' perception of their own gender, and the school administrators' perception of the students' gender identity. Instances include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, J. (8 November 2009). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/fashion/08cross.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r= "Can a Boy Wear a Skirt to School?"] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Spring 2009: Marion County, FL – Students must dress "in keeping with their gender"
**Boy came to school wearing high-heeled boots, a stuffed bra, and a V-neck T-shirt, he was sent home to change because he was "cross-dressing"
*Aug 2009: Mississippi senior female barred from yearbook because she had posed in a tuxedo
*Oct 2009: Cobb County, GA sent home a boy who favored wigs, makeup, and skinny jeans
*Nov 2009: Cross-dressing Houston senior was sent home because his wig violated the school's dress code rule that a boy's hair may not be "longer than the bottom of a regular shirt collar"
Although not all schools in the United States are required to wear school uniforms, the United States is slowly adapting the use of school uniforms.  "Almost one in five US public schools required students to wear uniforms during the 2011-2012 school year, up from one in eight in 2003-2004."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideology of school uniform is that it will create a safer environment for students and help with equality.  In some areas uniforms have become essential due to the poverty level that the schools reside in. "Mandatory uniform policies in public schools are found more commonly in high-poverty areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Stephanie Northen of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that school uniforms are less controversial in the United Kingdom compared to the United States and are usually not opposed on free speech grounds.&lt;ref name=Northen/&gt;

=== Positives ===
[[File:2013_school_tour.jpg|thumb|School children in [[Namibia]]]]
[[File:School uniforms GBR.jpg|thumb|English girls in school uniform.]]
Advocates of uniforms have proposed multiple reasons supporting their implementation and claiming their success in schools. A variety of these claims have no research supporting them. Some of these pros include the following:
Advocates believe that uniforms affect student safety by:&lt;ref name="faculty.unlv.edu"/&gt;
*Lowering student victimization
*Decrease gang activity and fights
Kathleen Wade conducted an experiment to see if bullying and gang presence was higher in uniform or non-uniform schools. The research was done with multiple schools where she gave a questionnaire to both students, and faculty to see if there was a significant difference. Her results showed that bullying and gang presence significantly decreases with students wearing school uniforms. &lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Wade, K. K., &amp; Stafford, M. E. (2003). Public School Uniforms: Effect on Perceptions of Gang Presence, School Climate, and Student Self-Perceptions. Education and Urban Society, 35(4), 399–420. http://doi.org/10.1177/0013124503255002&lt;/ref&gt;
*Differentiating strangers from students in school buildings

For example, in the first year of the mandatory uniform policy in Long Beach, California, officials reported that fighting in schools decreased by more than 50%, assault and battery by 34%, sex offenses by 74%, and robbery by 66%.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;		
Advocates also believe that uniforms increase student learning and positive attitudes toward school through:
*Enhanced learning environments
*Heightened school pride
*Increased student achievement
*High levels of preparedness
*Conformity to organizational goals
*Increased chance of staying in school&lt;ref name="Murray, R. K. 1997"&gt;Murray, R. K. (1997). The Impact of School Uniforms on School Climate. NASSP Bulletin, 81(593), 106–112. http://doi.org/10.1177/019263659708159314&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increased commitment to learning&lt;ref name="Murray, R. K. 1997"/&gt;
*Increased use of school setting to the student’s advantage&lt;ref name="Murray, R. K. 1997"/&gt;

Wearing uniforms leads to decreased behavior problems by increasing attendance rates, lowering suspension rates, and decreasing substance use among the student body. Proponents also attribute positive psychological outcomes like increased self-esteem, increased spirit, and reinforced feelings of oneness among students to wearing uniforms. Additional proponent arguments include that school uniforms:&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, Marian. The Debate Over Dress Codes and Uniforms (2006): 1-3.Boward Teacher's  Union. July 2006. Web. 9 Apr 201&lt;/ref&gt;
*Encourage discipline
*Help students resist peer pressure to buy trendy clothes
*Diminish economic and social barriers between students

Currently pros of school uniforms center around how uniforms affect schools' environments. Proponents have found a significant positive impact on school climate, safety, and students’ self-perception from the implementation of uniforms.

=== Negatives ===
[[File:Schoolshorts.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A Scottish boy's school uniform for [[Marr College]]]]
The opposing side of uniforms have claimed their ineffectiveness using a variety of justifications, a variety of which have research supporting them. Some of the cons to school uniforms include the following legal, financial, and questionable effectiveness concerns:&lt;ref name="faculty.unlv.edu"/&gt; The primary concern with school uniforms or strict dress codes is that it limits the ability of students to express themselves. Clothing is viewed as a mean of expression – making all students wear the same clothes or limit them to what they can wear can disrupt their sense of identity.  One of the main controversies can lie within Dress Code Policies vs. Freedom of Speech.&lt;ref name="School Dress Codes - FindLaw"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://education.findlaw.com/student-rights/school-dress-codes.html
| title = School Dress Codes - FindLaw
| website = Findlaw
| access-date = 26 February 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This establishes that students cannot wear the latest trends, mid-drift, or clothes that the school finds that interrupts the learning environment. However, students can wear clothing artifacts that express their religion.  "Both the Constitution and most state laws protect students' rights to wear religious attire inool [''sic''] school, such as the wearing of a turban, yarmulke, or head scarf."&lt;ref name="School Dress Codes - FindLaw"/&gt;

Another negative aspect of school uniforms is that it can be sexist. Boys and girls are not disciplined the same when it comes to dress codes. "Transgender students have been sent home for wearing clothing different from what’s expected of their legal sex, while others have been excluded from yearbooks."&lt;ref name="Zhou"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/10/school-dress-codes-are-problematic/410962/
| title = Why School Dress Codes Are Sexist
| last = Zhou
| first = Li
| website = The Atlantic
| language = en-US
| access-date = 26 February 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools are not advocates of females and females dressing of the opposite sex.  Research on how school uniforms and school dress codes influence the student can be inconclusive, but many people oppose  to school uniforms and strict dress code policies. "In the U.S., over half of public schools have a dress code, which frequently outline gender-specific policies."&lt;ref name="Zhou"/&gt;
*Legal concerns
**Focus on the supposition that requiring a uniform violates children’s individual rights (Thomas, 1994; Virginia State Dep’t of Edu, 1992)
**Mandatory uniform policies are being considered largely for urban school districts, and, hence are being forced on a predominantly minority and poor student population (Thomas, 1994)
*No effect on Social Status
**Many students felt the school uniform policy had little impact on the social dynamic of the school and students found ways to express individuality by making minor alterations to the school uniform (Da Costa, 2006&lt;ref&gt;DaCosta, K. (2006). Dress code blues: An exploration of urban students' reactions to a public High School uniform policy. The Journal of Negro Education, 75(1), 49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;). Some parents and students interviewed in a research about the social aspect of school uniforms said that uniforms were a violation of their rights and freedom. "Like adults, children’s freedom to choose or to act is also circumscribed by the community – massively so by schools, with their high density, constant supervision and evaluation, lack of privacy, and the obligatory nature of their activities." (Bodine, 2003&lt;ref&gt;Bodine, A. (2003). School uniforms and discourses on childhood. Childhood, 10(1), 43-63.&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Financial concerns
**Groups such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] have voiced concerns about the cost of uniforms, specifically that some disadvantaged parents are unable to afford them (Gursky, 1996)
*Questionable effectiveness of those policies
**Strongest opponents of uniform policies charge that no empirical evidence exists to support the numerous and varied claims of uniform proponents (LaPorte, Holoman, &amp; Alleyne, 1992)
**School uniforms suppress students’ individuality by mandating standardization of appearance and removing student expression (Joseph, 1986&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Nathan. Uniforms and Nonuniforms: Communication through Clothing. Greenwood Press, New York, NY, 1986. ProQuest. Web. 18 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;)
**While uniform policies have been linked to school climate, safety, and student self-perception, there is no evidence to indicate that a uniform policy increases academic achievement (Wade &amp; Stafford, 2003&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Kathleen Kiley, and Mary E. Stafford. "Public School Uniforms. Effect on Perceptions of Gang Presence, School Climate, and Student Self-Perceptions." Education and Urban Society 35.4 (2003): 399-420. ProQuest. Web. 18 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Marian Wilde,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; additional opponent arguments include that school uniforms:
* Are simply a Band-Aid on the issue of school violence
* Make students a target for bullies from other schools
* Are an unfair additional expense for parents who pay taxes for a free public education
* Are difficult to enforce in state/public (government) schools

[[File:Criticising the SA arms deal.JPG|thumb|A banner on the Central [[Methodist]] Mission church in Green Market Square, [[Cape Town]] criticising the South African Arms Deal by comparing it to a [[golden calf]].]]
The '''Strategic Defence Package''' or the '''Strategic Defence Acquisition''', popularly referred to as the '''Arms Deal''' was a South African [[military procurement]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Rocky |editor-first= |editor-last= |title=SIPRI Yearbook 2004: Armaments, Disarmament and International Security |publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] |date=c. 2004 |pages=237 |chapter=National defence reform and the African Union |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved a US$4.8 billion (R30 billion in 1999 rands) purchase of weaponry by the [[African National Congress]] government led by [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1999. It has been subject to repeated, seemingly substantive, allegations of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifp.org.za/Newsletters/071122wn.htm |title=Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Weekly Newsletter to the Nation |date=22 November 2007 |publisher=[[Inkatha Freedom Party]] |work=Ifp.org.za |accessdate=2008-11-13 |first=Mangosuthu |last=Buthelezi |authorlink=Mangosuthu Buthelezi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rotten/&gt;

The [[South African Department of Defence]]'s Strategic Defence Acquisition aimed to modernise its defence equipment, which included the purchase of [[corvettes]], [[submarines]], light utility [[helicopters]], lead-in fighter trainers and advanced light fighter aircraft.

The South African government announced in November 1998 that it intended to purchase 28 [[British Aerospace|BAE]]/[[Saab AB|SAAB]] [[JAS 39 Gripen]] fighter aircraft from Sweden at a cost of R10.875 billion, i.e. R388 million (about US$65 million) per plane.

The Arms Deal was plagued by accusations of corruption and in 2011 President Zuma announced a commission of enquiry "into allegations of fraud, corruption, impropriety or irregularity in the Strategic Defence Procurement Packages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armscomm.org.za/|title=Arms Procurement Commission|work=armscomm.org.za|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was chaired by Judge Seriti, a judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal and became known as the Seriti Commission.

== Review ==
In a January 2001 report, the [[Attorney-General]] of the Western Cape and the SIU's own senior legal advisor recommended further investigation:

{{quote|[T]here are sufficient grounds in terms of the Special Investigating Units and Special Tribunals Act No 74 of 1996, for a special investigating unit to conduct an investigation, and, in our opinion, such an investigation is warranted.|sign=Frank Kahn and Jan Lubbe, "Report (A) from the Director Public Prosecutions Western Cape, Advocate FW Kahn SC, and Advocate J Lubbe SC, to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, PM Maduna", January 18, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report (A) from the Director Public Prosecutions Western Cape, Advocate FW Kahn SC, and Advocate J Lubbe SC, to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, PM Maduna |url=http://www.info.gov.za/issues/procurement/kahn1.htm |date=18 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A joint investigative team looked at the arms deal in 2000. This team consisted of the auditor general, the public defender and the national director of public prosecution. Their published November 2001 report stated that there were no grounds to believe that the government had acted "illegally or improperly".&lt;ref name=jit&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mbeki, Manuel 'doctored arms deal report'|newspaper=News24|date=22 October 2009|url=http://www.news24.com/Content/SouthAfrica/Politics/1057/9f62c9ef0fbb4d03a79afdf60c88123b/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QroM7dSt|archivedate=6 July 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, in October 2009, documents provided by Cape Town businessman Richard Young, whose company, CCII Systems, lost the tender for the navy's new corvettes, showed their initial report had been doctored, factual bases had been removed and its conclusions changed.&lt;ref name=jit /&gt;

Whistleblower [[Patricia de Lille]] alleged in Parliament that she had evidence of three payments by warship supplier [[Thyssen-Krupp]] on 29 January 1999, each of R500,000, to the ANC, to the [[Nelson Mandela Children's Fund]] and to the Community Development Foundation, a Mozambique charity associated with Mandela's wife, [[Graça Machel]].&lt;ref name=rotten&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/10/somethingisrotten Bright hopes betrayed] Mail &amp; Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Sweden's Channel 4 investigative programme Kalla Fakta (Cold Facts) uncovered [[Stefan Löfven]]'s role – a former head of the Swedish industrial union IF Metall. In 1999 Löfven was the head of Metall's international section and a good friend of [[Moses Mayekiso]], the former general secretary of the [[National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa]] (Numsa). Numsa and the [[South African National Civics Organisation]] (SANCO) announced their joint support for the Saab Gripen bid. Mayekiso had by then left Numsa to lead Sanco, though he remained influential within the union. Saab would support Numsa in establishing an Industrial School, supported by Metall and another big Swedish union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-11-22-swedish-tv-reveals-fresh-arms-deal-claims Swedish TV reveals fresh claims in South Africa's arms deal] ''M&amp;G''&lt;/ref&gt; They allege that R30 million for the school was in reality a bribe for South African politicians.

==After the Party==
In his book Feinstein alleges:

* That a report submitted by [[Scorpions (South Africa)|Scorpions]] investigators recommended that arms deal corruption involving the ANC itself should be investigated. This was driven by a number of factors, Feinstein writes, including "trips that the party's treasurer general, [[Mendi Msimang]], made to Switzerland to meet the successful bidders";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ever-fasternews.com/index.php?php_action=read_article&amp;article_id=716 The central role of the President in a corrupt deal] MARK GEVISSER ON MBEKI AND THE ARMS DEAL&lt;/ref&gt;
* That Italian submarine bidders [[Fincantieri]] were told they had won the contract, but were informed later that they had been dropped in favour of the Germans. They were offered the chance to "better the Germans" via a payment of $15-million in bribes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-08-09-a-very-odd-way-to-buy-submarine A very odd way to buy a submarine] Mail &amp; Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinstein points out that this is the same sum under investigation by the German authorities, in relation to an amount allegedly solicited by South Africa's former chief of acquisitions, Chippy Shaik. Shaik has denied the allegation. Feinstein also contradicts public claims by senior government figures that there was no attempt to interfere with the probe into the arms deal once Parliament had authorised a joint investigation team (JIT). He writes: "I was told by someone from the JIT about a meeting with the president at which they… were told who they could and could not investigate."

Elsewhere he claims: "It was made clear to investigators that a shadowy financier close to Mbeki and Zuma who has played an ongoing role in financing the ANC, was off limits." He notes: "For instance, the charge sheet for the arrest of Schabir Shaik was drawn up to charge both Shaik and Zuma. When presented to [[Bulelani Ngcuka]], he is alleged to have responded: 'I will charge the deputy president only if my president agrees.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armsdeal-vpo.co.za/articles11/take_down.html|title=I will take ANC down with me if charged, vows Zuma|date=2007-11-10|work=armsdeal-vpo.co.za|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recounting how he was hauled before the party's top brass after Parliament had authorised its own investigation, Feinstein writes: "I was given a brief opportunity to try to explain the prima facie evidence we had and the process we were following. Within a few minutes Minister in the Presidency [[Essop Pahad]] had launched into a ferocious diatribe, spluttering 'Who the fuck do you think you are, questioning the integrity of the government, the ministers and the president?' Pointing aggressively at me, he shouted that we should simply withdraw the resolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=84112&amp;sn=Detail Feinstein on Essop Pahad] PoliticsWeb&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28006">The '''Tacoma riot of 1885''', also known as the '''1885 Chinese expulsion of Tacoma''', involved the forceful expulsion of the Chinese population from [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington Territory]], on November 3, 1885. City leaders had earlier proposed a November 1 deadline for the Chinese population to leave the city. On November 3, 1885, a mob that consisted of prominent businessmen, police, and political leaders descended on the Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 219-220.&lt;/ref&gt; The mob marched Chinese residents to a railroad station and forced them to board a train to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, the structures that remained in the Chinese community were razed.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 222-223.&lt;/ref&gt; The event was the result of growing [[Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States|anti-Chinese sentiment]] and violence throughout the American West.

This organized action became known as the "Tacoma method", and despite national and international outcry, it was used as an example of how to forcibly remove Chinese residents from cities and towns throughout the American West.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Chinese sentiment in Tacoma and Washington Territory more broadly made it so that those involved did not face repercussions for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 224-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

This impacted Chinese immigration to Tacoma for decades. In 1992, the Chinese Citizens Reconciliation Committee was created.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, "[http://www.tacomachinesepark.org/about/the-history-of-the-foundation/ The History of the Foundation]."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Tacoma City Council issued a statement on the expulsion saying that it was "a most reprehensible occurrence".&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, "[http://www.tacomachinesepark.org/about/the-history-of-the-foundation/ The History of the Foundation]."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Chinese Reconciliation Park broke ground on the Tacoma waterfront to commemorate the event.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, "[http://www.tacomachinesepark.org/tacoma-chinese-park/ Tacoma Chinese Park]."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Chinese community of Tacoma ===
[[File:Tacoma Pac Ave 1885.jpg|thumb|Some members of the Chinese community were situated along Pacific Avenue, near the Hatch Mill. Some of their shacks are pictured here.]]
In 1873, the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] announced plans to situate its western terminus in Tacoma. Given the experience of Chinese laborers on other major railroad projects, they were among the laborers that were hired to work on the new construction.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Pacific Railway completed its Tacoma terminal on December 27, 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Because there was still work to be done building wharves and smaller rail lines, Chinese workers remained in the area. The Northern Pacific Railway leased the Chinese land near the train tracks which became the [[Chinatown, Tacoma|Tacoma Chinatown]].&lt;ref&gt;Chin 1992, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; This was located on the Tacoma waterfront near present-day Downtown Tacoma.&lt;ref&gt;Chin 1992, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1880s, there were approximately 1,000 Chinese residents living in [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] with 700 of them in Tacoma.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox 1978, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; There was a fluctuation of the numbers of Chinese residents during this time due to the lack of record keeping and the transient nature of the industries that many Chinese residents worked in. There were several Chinese owned businesses within Chinatown selling groceries and household goods, but the majority of the Chinese were employed in laundries, small stores, hotels, restaurants, and domestic work.&lt;ref&gt;Chin 1992, pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional and national anti-Chinese sentiment ===
California became the core site of early anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States beginning in the 1850s. While Chinese immigrants enjoyed a much older history in the United States, the true expansion of Chinese immigration to the United States was with the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1848. This gave poor Chinese families the hope and opportunity to raise their families. The rate of immigration was relatively small until 18,000 Chinese came to California in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; As they formed communities, they developed their own benevolent societies to support them in their new lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This gave them a connection to their homeland but it also provided them job opportunities, education, recreation, medical help, and assistance in settling disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chinese miners began to work in California's mines, tensions began to rise between European and Chinese workers. Similar animus took place once the Chinese began to branch out into other industries.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Chinese sentiment was particularly strong with labor organizations in California. [[Denis Kearney]], an Irish immigrant and one of California's most public anti-Chinese labor leaders, popularized the call of "The Chinese Must Go!" This rallying cry became increasingly common throughout the American West and was used in the buildup to the Chinese expulsion in Tacoma.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; As anti-Chinese sentiment became common in California, corresponding incidents of violence and anti-Chinese legislation occurred throughout the state. This included several riots as well as ordinances that set limits on housing and property ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Racial animus and new economic opportunities led Chinese immigrants to other territories, moving to other parts of the American West and Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following decades, anti-Chinese sentiment began to be reflected in national policy. The [[Chinese Exclusion Act|1882 Chinese Exclusion Act]], and the subsequent 1892 [[Geary Act]], were federal laws that targeted Chinese immigrants by barring all new immigration from China. Local sentiment among anti-Chinese activists in the Washington Territory was that this legislation was not being enforced, and that Chinese migrants were entering primarily from [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;Chin 1992, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1880s, anti-Chinese incidents became increasingly common. On September 4, 1885, the [[Rock Springs massacre|Rock Springs Massacre]] occurred in [[Rock Springs, Wyoming|Rock Springs]], [[Wyoming Territory]] and represented one of the deadliest anti-Chinese incidents in the United States during the nineteenth century. A group of coal miners drove out hundreds of Chinese miners and killed at least 28 of them. News of this event spread nationally and internationally and led to increased friction between the Chinese consulate and the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;Yung, et. al 2012, pp. 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This would become one of a string of violent incidents directed towards the Chinese population in the Pacific Northwest territories.

This violence soon spread to Washington Territory. On September 7, 1885, in [[Attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers, 1885|Squak Valley]] (present-day [[Issaquah, Washington]]), a group of white and Native American laborers, fired into the tents of Chinese hop pickers and killed three of them.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 1885, another instance of anti-Chinese violence occurred in the Coal Creek mines of [[Newcastle, Washington|Newcastle]], Washington Territory. There, one Chinese miner was kidnapped and the barracks of several dozen Chinese workers was set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;Chin 1992, pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 1885 in the coal mining community of [[Black Diamond, Washington|Black Diamond]], Washington Territory, white miners drove the Chinese out and injured nine of them.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox 1978, pp. 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chin 1992, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; These events spurred a flurry of organizing activity devoted to expelling the Chinese from other communities in the Washington Territory.

== Growing anti-Chinese sentiment in Tacoma ==
[[File:Mayor Weisbach.jpg|thumb|Jacob Weisbach, the mayor of Tacoma during the Chinese expulsion, was a central figure in the anti-Chinese movement in Tacoma.]]
In February 1885, Tacoma Mayor Jacob Weisbach (a German immigrant) met with a small group of men to discuss the Chinese question. William Christie who had witnessed the Chinese expulsion that had recently occurred in [[Eureka, California]], was among the attendees.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1916, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; During this meeting, they discussed the actions taken by other localities to expel their Chinese citizens and considered how they might do the same in Tacoma. This was one of the earliest recorded instances of Tacoma citizens meeting to discuss taking direct action to expel Chinese residents.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1916, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 1885, Mayor Weisbach called a mass meeting at the Alpha Opera House to discuss methods of expelling the Chinese population of Tacoma. Roughly 900 of Tacoma's 6,936 total citizens came to the meeting. The crowd was mostly male and white, and the crowd represented nearly half of the town's electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; A former alderman, J. E. Burns, suggested passing sanitation laws to enable the city to evict Chinese residents and burn down Chinese homes.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend J. A. Ward suggested that white property owners cease selling and leasing property to the Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisbach roused the crowd with a closing speech, stating: "If the people are in earnest, if they are Free Americans in fact they will not yield up their homes and business to the filthy horde."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd adopted a resolution to exclude Chinese people from Tacoma and discourage citizens from employing any Chinese people. The resolution stipulated that any citizen who did not boycott Chinese employment would have their name published.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, pp. 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert Hunt stated that during 1885, "the discussion of the [Chinese] question was constant and it figured in many business and social affairs."&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1916, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Many groups formed in 1885 in Tacoma with the express goal of expelling the Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, pp. 225-226.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7 of 1885, a Tacoma chapter of the [[Knights of Labor]] was formed, which helped to increase hostility against Chinese residents.&lt;ref&gt;Chin 1992, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tacoma City Council also tried to pursue expulsion through legal means, by making residence in Tacoma more difficult for the Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; The council passed an ordinance at the recommendation of Mayor Weisbach stating that all sleeping rooms needed to have 500 cubic feet of air per individual.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1916, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 1885, an "Anti-Chinese Congress" met in Seattle. Tacoma's Mayor Weisbach presided over the congress, which proclaimed that all Chinese people must leave Western Washington by November 1 of that year. The congress planned for "ouster committees" to notify the Chinese residents in the communities assembled of the expulsion date.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox 1978, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting was held at the Alpha Opera House in Tacoma on October 3 to elect the Tacoma "ouster committee," which would later become known as the Committee of Fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, pp. 229-230.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the meeting, members of this committee alerted members of Tacoma's Chinese community that they had to leave the city by November 1.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox 1978, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-Chinese community members put additional pressure on white Tacomans to fire their Chinese employees.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, pp. 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this alert, much of the Chinese community left the city, with merchants and some laborers choosing to remain behind. Some members of the Tacoma community gave their assurances to Chinese residents that they would be protected and not forced to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of events occurred in the days leading up to the expulsion. On October 31, the night prior to the deadline for the Chinese residents to leave, a final rally was held. Nearly 700 people came to show support for the expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1916, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; As the November 1st deadline approached, an additional 150 Chinese people left the city, leaving roughly 200 Chinese people in Tacoma. The following day, November 2, those accused in the Squak Valley massacre were acquitted, leading to a feeling that those involved in anti-Chinese actions could act with relative impunity.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expulsion and destruction of Chinese community ==
On the morning of November 3 at 9:30 AM, 200 to 300 white citizens of Tacoma gathered on Pacific Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The mob had shortly thereafter grown to nearly 500 people.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The mob marched from Seventeenth Street to [[Old Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington|Old Tacoma]], stopping at each Chinese residence and business to tell the people within to pack and be ready for a wagon to come at 1:30 PM that day to take them away.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, pp. 237-238.&lt;/ref&gt; They visited the homes and businesses of white citizens who had refused to fire their Chinese employees, delivering their message to them as well.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The mob acted methodically and militaristically in their action to expel the Chinese population of Tacoma, and many of the men were armed with either guns or clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expulsion was often violent. Lum May, a prominent merchant who had been in Tacoma since 1875, reported in a later deposition that the mob "broke forcibly into the houses, smashing in doors and breaking in windows."&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The wife of Lum May refused to leave and was dragged by members of the mob out of her house. May reported that: "From the excitement, the fright, and the losses we sustained through the riot she lost her reason. She was hopelessly insane and attacked people with a hatchet or any other weapon if not watched...She was perfectly sane before the riot."&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; There were only a few instances of resistance to the actions of the mob.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; A few Chinese residents sent telegrams to Governor [[Watson C. Squire|Watson Squire]] asking for help, but he did not take any action.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, pp. 239-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Some who may have intervened against the action of the mob later reported a hesitance due to the presence of the mayor, judge, multiple members of the city council, and the fire chief in the mob.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, pp. 239-241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; When Lum May appealed to Mayor Weisbach and noted General [[John W. Sprague]]'s promise of protection for the Chinese community, Weisbach retorted that "General Sprague has nothing to say. If he says anything we will hang him or kick him."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 1:30 PM, 150 to 200 members of the Chinese community were rounded up and forced to march 8 miles to the Lake View train station in a torrential downpour.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, pp. 242-243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1916, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, pp. 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; A select number of Chinese merchants were granted a stay of 48 hours to pack up their business, however, for many this was not honored and they were forced to leave with the rest of the Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving at Lake View, the expelled Chinese people were forced to buy their own train tickets to Portland.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who could not afford tickets rode in the boxcars of a freight train or walked the 140 miles along the rail grade. While waiting for transportation, two men died of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing days, members of the Tacoma community preceded to burn down the city's Chinatown. On November 4, three members of the Committee of Fifteen went to inspect Chinese property along the waterfront, and shortly after their departure the buildings were engulfed in flames.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; No attempts were made by the Tacoma Fire Department to save the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Within four days of the expulsion, all physical memory of Tacoma's Chinese community had been erased by fire.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Local aftermath ===
[[File:Tacoma 27.jpg|thumb|The Tacoma 27 were indicted on felony conspiracy charges related to the Chinese expulsion. None of them were ultimately convicted.]]
The headline of the ''Tacoma Daily Ledger'' on November 4, the day after the expulsion, read: "Gone! Two Hundred Chinese Leave the City – How the People's Request was Enforced."&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, a ball was held by Tacoma Turnverein, the city's German society, to celebrate the actions of Mayor Weisbach and the Committee of Fifteen. That same day, Mayor Weisbach, the fire chief, and 25 others who were involved with the expulsion were indicted on felony conspiracy charges. This group would become known as the Tacoma Twenty-Seven. They were escorted to [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], Washington Territory on the morning of November 9.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Community members cheered on the 27 as they left, and immediately began raising money for a legal fund.&lt;ref&gt;Pfelzer 2007, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Each member of the Tacoma Twenty-Seven stated that they would plead not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 12th, the 27 had posted bail and returned to Tacoma, where they were greeted with much fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial of the 27 had been set for the first Monday of April in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial stalled for a year before the original indictments were dropped on a technicality. The United States Attorney immediately presented evidence for a new trial but only 10 of the original 27 were re-indicted. These indictments were also dropped for procedural reasons. Finally, in 1887, the case was brought before a new grand jury, but in the end, no one was indicted.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1979, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The men involved in the Chinese expulsion had become local heroes and would go on to dominate city politics for years afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1916, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US government and Chinese consulate ===
The Chinese consulates in San Francisco and Washington D.C. were in contact with Washington Territory officials and representatives of the federal government throughout 1885. In September, [[Frederick Bee]], representing San Francisco's Chinese consulate, exchanged messages with Governor Watson Squire over the safety of the territory's Chinese residents. Bee noted that "Complaints are made to this consulate from your Territory that evil-disposed persons have attacked and wounded several Chinese residents, and that further violence is threatened; that, in fact, the Chinese are to be expelled from the Territory."&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand 1977, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Squire assured Bee that Washington officials would be vigilant about future actions.

Immediately following the expulsion, Chinese consulates in Washington D.C. and San Francisco pursued legal avenues to ensuring a just resolution. On Yang Ming, the consul general in San Francisco, messaged Secretary of State [[Thomas F. Bayard]] and noted that "Several hundred Chinese driven from Tacoma...No effort made by the governor or authorities to protect them. Prompt action must be taken, or the same outrage will be enacted all over the Territory."&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese consulate continued to make the argument that the expulsion and related acts of anti-Chinese violence were a direct violation of the [[Burlingame Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese officials experienced several challenges in working with the administration of United States President [[Grover Cleveland]]. President Cleveland reacted to the growing anti-Chinese sentiments by strengthening the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 under the belief that cultural differences and anti-Chinese hostility made the U.S. unsafe for Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, "[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0327.html Justice for the Chinese]."&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the Qing government felt that the U.S. was unable or unwilling to protect Chinese citizens living in America. In August 1886, the Chinese foreign office proposed a new Sino-American treaty be drafted with the U.S. State department.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, "[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0327.html Justice for the Chinese]."&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 1888, Congress passed the Scott Act which permanently banned the immigration or return of Chinese laborers to the United States. The Qing government did not recognize the legitimacy of this act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0327.html Kennedy, "Justice for the Chinese."]&lt;/ref&gt;

President Cleveland, concerned about trade relations with China following the Tacoma expulsion and other cases of anti-Chinese violence in the United States, asked Congress to pass legislation to indemnify the Chinese who suffered from riots in the Pacific states and territories. Congress authorized a payment of $276,619.75 on October 19, 1888 to China as compensation for the Tacoma expulsion and other cases of anti-Chinese violence.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1916, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National response ===
After the Tacoma expulsion, the Portland, Oregon, newspaper ''[[The Oregonian]]'' published a piece condemning the actions of Tacoma and comparing the treatment of Chinese in Tacoma to the expulsion of the Jews and Moors from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 2003, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Seattle Chronicle'' echoed the Oregonian's concern of the treatment of the Chinese in Tacoma, and noted that two Chinese residents who were driven out of Tacoma were British citizens who appealed to the British government for redress.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 2003, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicle also stated that Tacoma would not be so proud of their method once its situation became an international incident. Tacoma received criticism from several newspapers on the East Coast, including The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]], [[New York Herald]], [[The New York Sun|New York Sun]]'' and ''[[New-York Tribune|New York Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 2003, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''Tacoma method'' was coined in the aftermath of the Tacoma expulsion in a piece written by Tacoma resident George Dudley Lawson in California's ''[[Overland Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaelzer 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawson's piece attempted to justify the expulsion which he viewed as a boon to Tacoma.

== Reconciliation ==
[[File:Tacoma park.jpg|thumb|This custom pavilion is one of the centerpieces of Chinese Reconciliation Park in Tacoma, Washington.]]
Dr. David Murdock moved to Tacoma in 1982 and noticed the lack of Chinese presence in the city. After learning about the 1885 expulsion of Tacoma's Chinese citizens and worried by the lack of recognition of the event, Murdoch submitted a Citizen Suggestion Award Application to the city of Tacoma on August 27, 1991. The statement suggested that "since the eviction [of the Chinese populace] was from the Old Town waterfront, it would be appropriate to set aside an area of reconciliation (small park with a Chinese motif) and a monument acknowledging the incident, noting Tacoma's regret and desire to move ahead in unity and respect."&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, "[http://www.tacomachinesepark.org/tacoma-chinese-park/ Tacoma Chinese Park]."&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 1993, the Tacoma City Council approved resolution number 32415 in order to formally apologize for the Chinese expulsion of 1885. In doing so, the council recognized efforts of local citizens in promoting reconciliation and endorsed the construction of a Chinese commemorative park which would be located at the former national guard site on Commencement Bay. The city council authorized $25,000 to begin the project, and the Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation was founded in spring of 1994 in order to continue the process of reconciliation in the Tacoma community. The centerpiece of the foundation has been the construction of Chinese Reconciliation Park, located on the Ruston Way shoreline. The park is very close to the former Chinese settlement of Little Canton, from which residents were expelled in 1885. The park consists of a waterfront trail, the String of Pearls Bridge, and a custom pavilion that was originally constructed in China.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation 2013, "[http://www.tacomachinesepark.org/tacoma-chinese-park/ Tacoma Chinese Park]."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Furies Collective''' was a communal [[lesbian]] group in [[Washington, D.C.]] that was established in the summer of 1971. The group intended to give a voice to [[lesbian separatism]] through its newspaper, ''The Furies''.  In the first issue in January 1972, contributor Ginny Berson stated her view that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... Sexism is the root of all other oppressions, and Lesbian and woman oppression will not end by smashing capitalism, racism, and imperialism.  Lesbianism is not a matter of sexual preference, but rather one of political choice which every woman must make if she is to become woman-identified and thereby end male supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;The Furies, Vol. 1, Issue 1, as quoted at {{cite web |url=http://www.rainbowhistory.org/furies.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208114038/http://www.rainbowhistory.org/furies.htm |archivedate=2012-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History and mission==
The Furies Collective, which lived at 219 11th St SE in Washington, D.C., was, along with the Gay Liberation House and the Skyline Collective, among Washington, D.C.'s best known communal living groups in the early 1970s. They were an example of lesbian feminism which emerged in during the women's movement of the late 1960s and 1970s. The twelve women in the collective were aged eighteen to twenty-eight, all feminists, all lesbians, all European-American, with three children among them. They shared chores and clothes, held some of their money in common, and slept on mattresses on a common floor. 

All of the founding members had extensive organizing and activist experience before they started The Furies. In particular, many were members of the women's movement, specifically the DCWLM (D.C. Women's Liberation Movement). The group was modeled after other revolutionary movements such as the [[Black Panther Party]] and [[Weather Underground|the Weathermen]]. In this sense, they aimed to promote a global revolution through the establishment of small radical groups. They wanted to abolish patriarchy, white supremacy and imperialism. They were particularly devoted to developing and exploring feminist theory, especially the way in which sexual identity is socially constructed.

As part of their mission, they started a school to teach women auto and home repair so they would not be dependent on men. Members called for other feminists to create more communes wherein women could nurture their relationships with one another away from male chauvinism. Not only men, but heterosexual women were also seen as impediments to progress.&lt;ref name="valk 140 141"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valk|first1=Anne|title=Radical Sisters: Second-Wave Feminism and Black Liberation in Washington, D.C.|page=140-141}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most of the members of the collective wrote for their newspaper, ''The Furies''. From January 1972 until mid-1973, the paper was published and distributed nationally.

The group promoted a model of lesbianism for all members of the women's movement, an alternative identity which combined sexual orientation, gender identity, and radical philosophy.&lt;ref name="valk 140 141"/&gt; For member [[Charlotte Bunch]], to be a lesbian "is to love oneself, woman, in a culture that denigrates and despises women." Another Furies member, Ginny Berson, commented that "Lesbianism is not a matter of sexual preference, but rather one of political choice." She also stated, "Lesbians must become feminists and fight against woman oppression, just as feminists must become Lesbians if they hope to end male supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valk|first1=Anne|title=Radical Sisters: Second-Wave Feminism and Black Liberation in Washington, D.C.|page=142-143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==

According to [[Rita Mae Brown]] in ''Rita Will'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Rita Mae Brown]], ''Rita Will: Memoir of a Literary Rabble-Rouser'', Bantam Books, New York, 1997. p.  267.&lt;/ref&gt; the members of the collective were "Rita Mae Brown, [[Charlotte Bunch]], Tasha Byrd [sic], Ginny Berson, Sharon Deevey, Susan Hathaway, Lee Schwin [sic], Helaine Harris, Coletta Reid, Jennifer Woodull [sic], Nancy Myron and [[Joan E. Biren]] (J.E.B.)" The names marked "[sic]" are actually Tasha Petersen or Peterson, Lee Schwing, and Jennifer Woodul.

==Legacy==

The collective did not last long but its influence was felt beyond the group's end. The first two members asked to leave were [[Joan E. Biren]] and Sharon Deevey, followed shortly thereafter by Rita Mae Brown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rita Mae Brown]], ''Rita Will: Memoir of a Literary Rabble-Rouser'', Bantam Books, New York, 1997. p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; The newsletter survived the disbanding of the collective in the spring of 1972 by about a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbowhistory.org/furies.htm|title=Rainbow History|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208114038/http://www.rainbowhistory.org/furies.htm|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Olivia Records]] was founded in [[1973 in music|1973]] by the group members and by the [[Radicalesbians]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jill|date=|title=Feeling Women’s Culture: Women’s Music, Lesbian Feminism, and the Impact of Emotional Memory|url=|journal=Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism|volume=Spring 2002|pages=205-219|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the Furies' theoretical contributions to the women's movement outlasted the collective's existence. Future feminist groups across the country cited the importance of the Furies' theoretical developments of feminism to their own organizing efforts. Former members of the collective went on to other organizing and activist positions, especially in media and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valk|first1=Anne|title=Radical Sisters: Second-Wave Feminism and Black Liberation in Washington, D.C.|page=153-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2016 the house at 219 11th St. SE which was home to the Furies Collective was named as the first lesbian-related historic landmark in Washington, D.C. when it was unanimously voted into the D.C. Inventory of Historic Sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hillnow.com/2016/01/29/capitol-hill-rowhome-becomes-d-c-s-first-lesbian-related-historic-landmark/|title=Capitol Hill Rowhome Becomes D.C.’s First Lesbian-Related Historic Landmark|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year that house became the first lesbian site on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="metroweekly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2016/05/furies-collective-becomes-first-lesbian-site-national-register/|title=Furies Collective becomes first lesbian site on National Register|work=Metro Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''The Philippine Order of Narnians''' (often called tPON) is the [[Philippines]]' only organized community of [[C. S. Lewis]] readers and enthusiasts.  It aims to promote the discussion of all of Lewis works, exploring the themes in his writings, and celebrating Lewis' impact on today's world.

==Members==
An eclectic group, tPON's almost 300 members  range from grade school pupils to university professors, from all over the [[Philippines]] and from [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Communities in other countries.

According to tPON founder (and current High King) [[RE de Leon|Professor RE de Leon]], the group was created for Filipino or Philippines-based C.S. Lewis enthusiasts, with the term "Filipino" referring more to cultural, rather than national or political affiliation.  Thus, tPON's officers explain, the group includes members who were raised in the Philippines but have since become citizens of other countries, and foreigners who live in the Philippines.

==Group Interests==
While named after [[the Chronicles of Narnia]], Lewis' most famous work, the group also appreciates Lewis' other works.

The organization is a member of the [[New Worlds Alliance]], the alliance of different science fiction and fantasy fangroups in the Philippines.  However, since not all of C.S. Lewis' works involve [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]], the group's interests are not limited to the science fiction and fantasy aspects of Lewis' work.

According to the group's website:

''All of CS Lewis’ works are considered within the purview of tPON. We simply use the word “''Narnians''” because ''Narnia'' is by far Lewis’ most popular work. For example, [[Till We Have Faces]] has easily become a group favorite – not much of a surprise because Lewis himself considered it his best work. In fact, some of the members have never read a Narnia book! They start off from some other Lewis work such as [[The Screwtape Letters]] or [[The Four Loves]] or even [[Perelandra]]!''

==Activities==

===Summons===
In the tradition of several New Worlds Alliance (NWA) organizations, the regular tPON meetings have been named '''Summons'''.  While this was initially considered the acceptable singular and plural form of the word, the current practice on the group's mailing list is to call these meetings ''Summonses'' in the plural form.

De Leon recalls that the name was suggested by Ian Roxas, then head of tPON's NWA sister group, [[The Philippine Tolkien Society]] (TPTS), during the very first Summons.  (By the same tradition, TPTS' own meetings are called ''Moots'')

Summonses are currently held about once every month, with the schedule decided by members' availability and announced on the group's website and mailing list.

The decision for the Summons venue is very fluid. Most of the time, tPON meets either at Mosaic Lounge, found on the 3rd floor of [[Greenbelt (Makati)|Greenbelt 1]] building in [[Makati City]] or at Seattle's Best Coffee at the nearby [[Greenbelt (Makati)|Greenbelt 3]] building. Some occasions call for a South ([[Alabang]]) and North ([[Quezon City]]) Summons at times. Announcements are made via the mailing list.

===Movie Promotion===
During the recent release by [[Walden Media]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures]] of the cinematic version of [[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]], tPON partnered with several organizations to promote the movie in several ways.

In November 2005, tPON partnered with the [[British Council]] and [[Fully Booked (bookstore)|Fully Booked]] to hold symposium on [[The Chronicles of Narnia]].  It also invited the cast of the [[Trumpets (Theatre Group)|Trumpets]]' [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Philippine Stageplay)|stageplay version]] of [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]] and the co-writer of the libretto, [[Luna Griño-Inocian]].

In January 2006, coinciding with the Philippine release of the movie, the organization partnered with [[Shangri-la Mall]] and Radio Station [[Magic 89.9]] to hold a [[Cosplay]] contest and a special block screening of the movie.

===CosPlays===
Every now and then, tPON participates in Costuming Events sponsored by the NWA.

===The Philippine Science Fiction and Fantasy Conventions===
Previously an NWA member, tPON had been a regular participant of the [[New Worlds Alliance|Annual Philippine Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention]].

==History==
Starting from five group inactive mailing list members in July 2003, tPON grew slowly at first. But when some of the members attended the '''''A Long Expected Party: the Second Philippine Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention''''' in 2004, things began to heat up. New members came in, exciting discussions popped up, and the Filipino C.S. Lewis community grew. Since then, the annual New Worlds convention has become a sort of time-marker for the organization, signifying steps in the organization's history.

==="After the Party"===
It was in the aftermath after the convention that tPON's had its first few meetings.

The first meeting saw only four members come to a coffeeshop in Greenbelt3, Makati City.  The second, which was timed to coincide with a "moot" of The Philippine Tolkien Society, was better attended and saw the introduction of the name ''Summons'' to distinguish tPON meetings from those of other NWA groups.

It was also at this second meeting that names for the organization were first suggested.  Names like "The CS Lewis Society of the Philippines" and "Filipino Narnians" were suggested along with humorous suggestions such as "Lamp Post Philippines", "The Philippine Wardrobe Society" and "The Lion's Club".  "The Philippine Order of Narnians" eventually won out, though it took almost a year before the name was officially accepted.

The Group also began meeting at Mosaic Lounge, another venue in Makati, which now serves as the meeting place of choice for tPON.

===New Worlds: Episode III===
In 2005, the group was formally invited to become a participant of  '''''New Worlds Episode III: Third Philippine Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention''''', and had provisionally become a member of the New Worlds Alliance (NWA), the umbrella organization of Science Fiction/Fantasy Organizations who were managed the annual convention.

The last stretch of 2005 proved very hectic for tPON.  From November 2005 to January 2006, the organization was busy promoting the movie adaptation of [[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe]].

====New Worlds Alliance Council Membership====
In July 2006, tPON took part in ''''New Worlds 4: A Broken Time Machine'''', which marked its second full participation in a major NWA activity and qualified it to be a full member of the organization. The organization came within a hair's breadth of bagging that year's Best Booth award for its eye-catching "Aslan's Tent" motiff.

Because it had become a full member of the NWA, it was selected along with another NWA member, Arkham Philippines, to become part of the NWA Council as of January 13, 2007.

The NWA Council was originally composed of the seven charter groups who were present at the formation of the New Worlds Alliance in 2003. Over time, two groups become inactive and thus forfeited their place in the Council.

In October 2007, tPON did not participate in the New Worlds 5 convention due to the concern for safety brought upon by the mall blasts at the Glorietta which happened a week before the said convention.

In early 2008, tPON left the New Worlds Alliance to concentrate more on scholarly endeavors which is one of the main purposes of the group. tPON acknowledges NWA's contribution to the Filipino-Narnian community.

The [[urbanization]] of the United States has progressed throughout [[History of the United States|its entire history]]. Over the last two centuries, the [[United States of America]] has been transformed from a predominantly [[rural]], [[agricultural]] nation into an [[urban area|urbanized]], [[industrial society|industrial]] one.&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite conference

In 1790, only about one out of every twenty Americans (on average) lived in [[urban areas]] ([[cities]]), but this ratio had dramatically changed to one out of four by 1870, one out of two by 1920, two out of three in the 1960s, and four out of five in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;

==Urbanization==
The [[urbanization]] of the United States occurred over a period of many years, with the nation only attaining urban-majority status between 1910 and 1920.&lt;ref name = "main"/&gt; Currently, over four-fifths of the U.S. population resides in urban areas, a percentage which is still increasing today.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt; The [[United States Census Bureau]] changed its classification and definition of urban areas in 1950 and again in 1990, and caution is thus advised when comparing urban data from different time periods.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |title=Population Division Working Paper - Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990 - U.S. Census Bureau |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2013-03-18 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69hd5KAIE?url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=2012-08-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urbanization was fastest in the [[Northeastern United States]], which acquired an urban majority by 1880.&lt;ref name = "main"/&gt; Some Northeastern U.S. states had already acquired an urban majority before then, including [[Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]] (majority-urban by 1850),&lt;ref name="MA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RI"/&gt; and [[New York (state)|New York]] (majority-urban since about 1870). The [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Western United States]] became urban majority in the 1910s, while the [[Southern United States]] only became urban-majority after [[World War II]], in the 1950s...&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;

The Western U.S. is the most urbanized part of the country today, followed closely by the Northeastern United States. The Southern U.S. experienced rapid industrialization after World War II, and is now over three-quarters urban, having almost the same urban percentage in 2010 as the Midwestern United States.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt; Just four U.S. states (out of fifty) have a rural majority today, and even some of these states (such as [[Mississippi]]) are continuing to urbanize. Some U.S. states currently have an urban percentage around or above 90%, an urbanization rate almost unheard of a century ago.

The state of [[Maine]] (and [[Vermont]], to a lesser degree) has bucked the trend towards greater urbanization which is exhibited throughout the rest of the United States. Maine's highest urban percentage ever was less than 52% (in 1950), and today less than 39% of the state's population resides in urban areas. Maine is currently the least urban U.S. state; its urban percentage (39%) is less than half of the United States average (81%).&lt;ref name="main"/&gt; Maine was less urban than the United States average in every U.S. census since the [[U.S. Census, 1790|first one in 1790]].&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;
