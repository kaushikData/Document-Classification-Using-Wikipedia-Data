'''''Abele''''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] opera inspired on the first [[Bible|Bible's]] chapters by [[Vittorio Alfieri]] (1749–1803) which he described as a [[tramelogedia]]. It was written in 1786 and first published after Alfieri's death in 1804 in [[London]]. The play's characters can be divided in two groups:
The first group includes the firsts earth's residents after [[Genesis creation narrative|the creation]] ([[Adam]], [[Eve|Eva]], [[Cain]] and [[Abel]]) and the second group represents the spiritual beings ([[God]], [[Beelzebub]], Sin, Envy, [[Death]], [[Angels]] and [[Demons]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Abele (Alfieri)]], Retrieved 11 February 2013{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Auberge de Castille et Portugal''' ({{lang-mt|Berġa ta' Kastilja u Portugall}}) was an auberge in [[Birgu]], [[Malta]]. It was built to house knights of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] from the [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)|langue]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castille]], [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]].

The first Auberge de Castille, which was known as the ''vecchia alberghia di Castiglia'', was built in the 1530s. Its exact location is not known and no remains have survived of this first auberge. A second auberge was built in Barrack Front Street (now Hilda Tabone Street) during the magistracy of Grand Master [[Claude de la Sengle]]. This auberge was designed by the architect Niccolò Bellavante in the traditional Maltese style, and it housed the langue until the building of a new [[Auberge de Castille]] in [[Valletta]] in 1574. Today, the building still exists, but it was heavily altered over time, and only a [[quoin]] and some windows with Melitan [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] remain of the original auberge.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; The building is privately owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zahra|first1=Lorenzo A.|title=The Spanish Langues and Auberges of the Order in Birgu|url=http://www.vittoriosahistorica.org/Leaflets/Auberge-de-Castille-Leon-et-Portugal.pdf|website=Vittoriosa Historical &amp; Cultural Society|publisher=Veritas Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704164025/http://www.vittoriosahistorica.org/Leaflets/Auberge-de-Castille-Leon-et-Portugal.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, together with the other auberges in Birgu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Antiquities Regulations 21st November, 1932 Government Notice 402 of 1932, as Amended by Government Notices 127 of 1935 and 338 of 1939. |url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |website=[[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6guMwmZDW?url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |archivedate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument on 22 December 2009,&lt;ref name=tom&gt;{{cite news|title=Auberge de Castille et Portugal (Leon)|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121127/environment/Auberge-de-Castille-et-Portugal-Leon-.447039|accessdate=1 March 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is also listed on the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auberge de Castille et Portugal (leon) |url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01163.pdf |website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands |accessdate=17 October 2015 |date=28 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065036/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01163.pdf |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Destinations ==

Bălți City airport and its heliport serve primarily for local destinations in neighbouring [[Administrative divisions of Moldova|districts]] of Moldova. The airplanes and helicopters based at Bălți City airport are mostly used in agriculture, and for public service needs.

== History ==

During the [[World War II]], Bălți City was the most important airport within the surrounding region. The airport has an unpaved runway of unknown proportions.

'''CSI-DOS''' is an [[operating system]], created in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Elektronika BK|Elektronika BK-0011M]] and [[Elektronika BK|Elektronika BK-0011]] [[microcomputer]]s. CSI-DOS did not support the earlier BK-0010. CSI-DOS used its own unique [[file system]] and only supported a color graphics video mode. The system supported both hard and floppy drives as well as [[RAM disk]]s in the computer's memory. It also included software to work with the AY-3-8910 and AY-3-8912 music co-processors, and the [[Covox Speech Thing]]. There are a number of games and demos designed specially for the system.

The system also included a [[Turbo Vision]]-like [[application programming interface]] (API) allowing simpler design of user applications, and a graphical file manager called ''X-Shell''.

'''"Chance of a Lifetime"''' was the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1968]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Pat McGeegan]]. It was written by [[John Kennedy (Irish celebrity)|John Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/tv/lucykennedy/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is a ballad, with McGeegan reminiscing about the first time he saw his lover. He tells her that he thought her appearance in his life was "the chance of a lifetime", and goes on to explain that he does not want to lose such a chance.

The song was performed fourteenth on the night, following [[Norway]]'s [[Odd Børre]] with "[[Stress (Odd Børre song)|Stress]]" and preceding [[Spain]]'s [[Massiel]] with "[[La, la, la]]". At the close of voting, it had received 18 points, placing 4th in a field of 17.  However, the song went to the top of the Irish singles chart, only to be knocked off a week later by [[Cliff Richard]]'s "[[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|Congratulations]]", which came second in the contest.

It was succeeded as [[Republic of Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Irish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969 Contest]] by [[Muriel Day]] with "[[The Wages of Love]]".

The '''Danish Islamic Council''' ({{lang-da|Dansk Islamisk Råd}}) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Islamic]] organization representing [[Sunni]] Muslims in Denmark.

== History ==
The Council was initiated in 2000 by the politician Hamid El-Mousti and gathered 30 associations of Muslims upon its creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yearbook of Muslims in Europe|publisher=BRILL|first1=Oliver|last1=Scharbrodt|first2=Samim|last2=Akgönül|first3=Ahmet|last3=Alibašić|first4=Jørgen|last4=Nielsen|first5=Egdunas|last5=Racius|date=2015|volume=7|isbn=9789004308909|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the Danish Islamic Council opened the [[Grand Mosque of Copenhagen]] (officially Hamad Bin Khalifa Civilisation Center, after the Emir of Qatar [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]]), the country's largest [[mosque]], and the first one with a [[minaret]]. [[Qatar]] provided $27 million to finance the construction, which led the [[Danish People's Party]] to express their concerns about potential interference of the Qataris in the Danish domestic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/denmarks-first-real-mosque-opens-bankrolled-by-qatar/|title=Denmark’s first ‘real’ mosque opens, bankrolled by Qatar|website=Timesofisrael.com|date=19 June 2014|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it condemned the [[2015 Copenhagen shootings]] against secular and Jewish targets, saying, "The Danish Islamic Council invites everyone in Danish society to unite in the fight against extremism and terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2015/02/15/0215003933.htm|title=Dansk Islamisk Råd: Håber gerningsmand fanges snart|publisher= Danmarks Radio |date=15 February 2015|accessdate=15 February 2015|trans-title=Danish Islamic Council: Hope the perpetrator will be caught soon|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/krimi/2015-02-15-dansk-islamisk-raad-haaber-gerningsmand-fanges-snart|title=Dansk Islamisk Råd: Håber gerningsmand fanges snart|work=Nyhederne.tv2.dk|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=15 February 2015|trans-title=Danish Islamic Council: Hope the perpetrator will be caught soon|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, the Council was in favor of the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spa.gov.sa/1347964|title=Danish Islamic Council President commends Determination Storm|website=Spa.gov.sa|date=9 April 2015|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish Islamic Council said that the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen had chosen a moderate approach of Islam, but in a TV documentary that was aired in March 2016 on [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]], a female reporter with a hidden camera recorded the imam of the mosque preaching a radical vision of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7648/denmark-sharia|title=Sharia in Denmark|website=Gatesoninstitute.org|date=22 March 2016|author=Judith Bergman|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations with neighboring [[Afghanistan]] began in 1992 and are generally satisfactory. The areas which form the two countries were once connected, especially during the [[Samanid]], [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid]], and [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurid]] periods. After a friendship treaty in 1750 between [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] of Afghanistan and [[Mohammad Murad Beg]] of [[Bukhara]], the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus River) became the official border of Afghanistan. The Persian language is widely used in both countries, and there are slightly more Tajiks in Afghanistan than Tajikistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 2007, with funding from the United States, Afghanistan and Tajikistan opened a [[Tajikistan–Afghanistan bridge at Panji Poyon|bridge]] over the Pyanj River linking the two countries. Although the goal is to improve trade, the president of Tajikistan expressed concern that it could also increase drug traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2016 the official press agency of the People's Republic of China announced that the state will set up an anti-terrorism alliance with Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/china-joins-afghanistan-pakistan-tajikistan-in-security-alliance/|title=China joins Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan in security alliance|last=Reuters|first=|date=4 August 2016|website=www.atimes.com|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomatic relations between India and Tajikistan were established soon after Tajikistan gained independence following the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. Tajikistan occupies a strategically important position in Central Asia, bordering Afghanistan and the People's Republic of China and separated by a small strip of Afghan territory from Pakistan. India's role in fighting the [[Taliban]] and [[al-Qaeda]] and its strategic rivalry with both China and Pakistan have made its ties with Tajikistan important to its strategic and security policies. India's military presence and activities have been significant, beginning with India's extensive support to the anti-Taliban [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] (ANA).

In 2002, India undertook a US$10 million project to upgrade an old Soviet military base in Ayni, Tajikistan which would support the Northern Alliance forces.&lt;ref name=atime&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IC03Df01.html|title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news - India makes a soft landing in Tajikistan|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base also had a hospital to treat injured anti-Taliban forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jir/jir010315_1_n.shtml|title=Defence &amp; Security Intelligence &amp; Analysis - IHS Jane's 360|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; India provided extensive counter-insurgency military training to Tajikistan and also supplied them with new aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=9693 India, Tajikistan to boost military cooperation].

Since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Tajikistan has enjoyed a close relationship with Iran, helped along via a shared [[Persian people|Persian]] identity. Iran was the first nation to establish an embassy in [[Dushanbe]]. It was also one of the first countries to extend diplomatic recognition of the newly independent Tajikistan in 1991. Iran provided diplomatic assistance and built new mosques within Tajikistan. Due to the resurgence of Iranian culture within Tajikistan, Iran helped encourage cultural exchange through conferences, media, and film festivals. Iranian television programs, magazines, and books became increasingly common in Tajikistan.

However, despite the many things the nations have in common, there are also vast differences. Tajikistan's post communist government is secular while Iran's is Islamic. Furthermore, Iran is a predominantly [[Shia]] nation while Tajikistan is [[Sunni]]. The leading figures of the Islamic revival movement in Tajikistan have stated that Iran would not be a model for whatever Islamic government they advocate for Tajikistan.

As of 2011 Iran is the second largest investor in Tajikistan after China.

Until 2005, Russia had 11,000 border guards manning the Tajik frontier with Afghanistan. In September 2012, and after months of negotiating, Russia and Tajikistan have reached an agreement on what Russia will pay for its bases in Tajikistan and extended the lease to 20 or 29 years. The bases are used for 9,000 Russian troops of the 201st Motor Rifle Division. The new deal with Tajikistan makes it worthwhile for Russia to upgrade the four army camps and one air base they occupy. To get the long lease, Russia agreed to sell Tajikistan weapons and military equipment at a sharp discount and train Tajik officers in Russian schools, for free, for the duration of the deal. Tajikistan also promises to help keep the heroin out of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russians Continue to Guard the Tajik Border with Afghanistan|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/russians-continue-to-guard-the-tajik-border-with-afghanistan/|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=21 September 2012|publisher=Satrapia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two countries now have a broad-based relationship, cooperating in such areas as counter-[[narcotics]], [[counter-terrorism]], non-proliferation, and regional growth and stability. In light of the Russian border forces' withdrawal from the Tajik-Afghan border, the U.S. Government leads an international donor effort to enhance Tajikistan's territorial integrity, prevent the transit of narcotics and material or technology related to [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD), and support a stable, peaceful Tajikistan in order to prevent the spread of influence and activities of radical groups and terrorists.

The '''G90''', otherwise known as the '''Group of 90''', is an alliance between the poorest and smallest developing countries, many of whom are part of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). The G90 emerged as a strong grouping at the WTO’s Ministerial conference at Cancun in September 2003, taking common positions representing the largest number of countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends16.htm "G90 Poor Countries Make Advances,"]&lt;/ref&gt; with 64 of the 90 countries in the G90 being members of the WTO. It is the largest trading body in the WTO, and it was formed as an umbrella body including the [[ACP countries|African, Caribbean and Pacific Group]] (ACP), the [[African Union]], and the group of [[Least Developed Countries]] (LDC).

==Objectives==
The driving force for the formation of the G90 was the lack of economic power faced by poor and small nations to enact resolutions in trade disputes, as envisioned by the WTO.  G90 nations, unable to enforce or afford countervailing measures, or compete with the subsidized economies of wealthier nations, formed the trade block in order to ensure a collective voice on issues of importance to landlocked and island economies, less developed countries, and commodity-dependent nations. Primarily, they want preferential domestic subsidies by the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]] to be removed in order to allow G90 products greater access to foreign markets.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Together with the [[G20]] and the [[G33 (developing countries)|G33]], the G90 aims to counterbalance the power of the United States and European economies in directing global trade, particularly with respect to negotiations over agricultural goods, upon which most of the G90 economies depend.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==G90 Membership==
* [[African Union]]/Group
* [[ACP countries|African, Caribbean and Pacific Group]]
* Least-Developed Countries: [[Angola]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Benin]], [[Botswana]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Burundi]], [[Cambodia]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Cuba]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Djibouti]], [[Egypt]], [[Fiji]], [[Gabon]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]] (Conakry), [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Guyana]], [[Haiti]], [[Kenya]], [[Lesotho]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malawi]], [[Maldives]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mauritius]], [[Morocco]], [[Mozambique]], [[Myanmar]], [[Namibia]], [[Nepal]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Tanzania]], [[Togo]], [[Tunisia]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focusweb.org/main/html/Article661.html "the G-Guide Groupings in the WTO Agricultural Negotiations,"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galão''' ({{IPA-pt|ɡaˈlɐ̃õ|}}) is a hot drink from [[Portugal]] made of [[espresso]] and foamed milk. Similar to [[caffè latte]] or [[café au lait]], it consists of about one quarter coffee and three quarters foamed milk. It is served in a tall glass, as opposed to the smaller [[Garoto (coffee)|garoto]] that is served in a [[demitasse]]. When the proportion is 1:1 it is called ''meia de leite'' (half of milk) and it comes in a cup.

The '''history of elephants in Europe''' dates back to the [[ice age]]s, when [[mammoth]]s (various species of prehistoric [[elephant]]) roamed the northern parts of the Earth, from [[Europe]] to [[North America]]. There was also the [[dwarf elephant]] of Cyprus (''[[Palaeoloxodon cypriotes]]''), Sicily-Malta (''[[Palaeoloxodon falconeri]]'') and mainland Europe (''[[Palaeoloxodon antiquus]]''). However, these became extinct several thousand years ago, and subsequently the presence of elephants in Europe was only due to importation of these animals.

== Overview ==
{{See also|Elephant#Etymology}}
Europeans first came in contact with live elephants in 327 BC, when [[Alexander the Great]] descended into [[Indian subcontinent|India]] from the [[Hindu Kush]], but Alexander was quick to adopt them. Four elephants guarded his tent, and shortly after his death his associate Ptolemy issued coins showing Alexander in the elephant headdress that became a royal emblem also in the Hellenized East. Aristotle depended on first-hand information for his account of elephants, but like most Westerners he believed the animals live for two hundred years. Roman scouts in the royal Syrian parks shortly before the last of the [[Seleucid]]s fell to Rome had orders to [[Hamstringing|hamstring]] every elephant they could capture, and while elephants performed in the circuses of Rome, [[Shapur II|Shapur]]'s war elephants in the mid-4th century numbered in the hundreds (Fox 1973 p 338).

Elephants largely disappeared from Europe after the Roman Empire.  As exotic and expensive animals, they were exchanged as presents between European rulers, who exhibited them as luxury pets, beginning with [[Harun ar-Rashid]]'s gift of an elephant to [[Charlemagne]].
&lt;!-- An example of the lack of presences of elephants in Europe is that the [[chess piece]] representing an elephant (''pīl'' in Persian, ''al-fil'' in Arabic) became the meaningless ''alfil'' in Castilian and ''[[bishop (chess)|bishop]]'' in English. --but it remained "elephant" in Russian, so what's the point? --&gt;

== Examples ==
Historical accounts of elephants in Europe include:

* The 20{{efn|Contemporary accounts report a significantly higher number of elephants: [[Pliny the Elder]] records 142 "or, as some say", 140; in the [[Epitome of Livy]] and by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], the number is 120; [[Florus]] says that they were "about a hundred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', BOOK VIII. THE NATURE OF THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS., CHAP. 6. (6.) —WHEN ELEPHANTS WERE FIRST SEEN IN ITALY.|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:8.6#note5|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} elephants in the army of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], which landed at [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in 280 BC for the first [[Battle of Heraclea]], recorded by [[Plutarch]]'s (in [[Parallel Lives|''Lives'']]), [[Polybius]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Livy]]. "The most notable elephant in Greek history, called Victor, had long served in Pyrrhus's army, but on seeing its [[mahout]] dead before the city walls, it rushed to retrieve him: hoisting him defiantly on his tusks, it took wild and indiscriminate revenge for the man it loved, trampling more of its supporters than its enemies".&lt;ref&gt;

* The 37 elephants in [[Hannibal]]'s army that crossed the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] in October/November 218 BC during the [[Second Punic War]], recorded by [[Livy]].
* The first historically recorded elephant in northern Europe, the animal brought by [[Roman emperor|emperor]] [[Claudius]] during the [[Roman invasion of Britain]] in AD 43 to the British capital of [[Colchester, Essex|Colchester]].  At least one elephant skeleton with flint weapons that has been found in England was initially misidentified as this elephant, but later dating proved it to be a [[mammoth]] skeleton from the [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mammoths: Giants of the Ice Age|first1= Adrian |last1=Lister|first2= Paul G. |last2=Bahn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6WBlUwYPa8C&amp;pg=PA116|page= 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abul-Abbas]], the [[Asian elephant]] which [[Harun al-Rashid|Harun ar-Rashid]] gave to [[Charlemagne]] in 797 or 802. The animal died in 810, of pneumonia.
* The ''[[Annals of Innisfallen]]'' record that King [[Edgar of Scotland]] gave a large, exotic animal to [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]] in 1105, possibly an elephant but more probably a [[camel]]. (''Annals of Innisfallen'', s.a. 1105; [[A. A. M. Duncan]], ''Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom'' (1975), p.&amp;nbsp;128)
*The [[Cremona elephant]] presented to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Al-Kamil]] in 1229.
* The elephant given by [[Louis IX of France]]  to [[Henry III of England]], for his menagerie in the [[Tower of London]] in 1255 (see: [[Sandwich, Kent]]). Drawn from life by the historian [[Matthew Paris]] for his ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', it was the first elephant to be seen in England since Claudius' war elephant. Matthew Paris' original drawing appears in his [[bestiary]], on display in the [[Parker Library]] of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]. The bestiary explains that while in residence at the Tower of London, the elephant enjoyed a diet of prime cuts of [[beef]] and expensive red wine, and is claimed to have died in 1257 from drinking too much wine. The accompanying text reveals that at the time, Europeans believed that elephants did not have [[knee]]s and so were unable to get up if they fell over (the bestiary contains a drawing depicting an elephant on its back being dragged along the ground by another elephant, with a caption stating that elephants lacked knees – compare [[cow tipping]]). Europeans also interpreted descriptions of [[howdah]]s to mean that Indian elephants were capable of carrying actual stone [[castle]]s on their backs, albeit only big enough to be garrisoned by three or four men; note that turreted [[war elephants]] did exist, though not ones made of stone. A carving of the elephant can be found on a contemporary miserichord in [[Exeter Cathedral]]. This animal may be the inspiration for the heraldic device '[[Elephant and Castle]]', the arms of the Cutlers' Company of London, a guild founded in the 13th century responsible for making scissors, knives and the like. Its heraldry survived in an 18th-century pub-sign that in turn gave its name to a largely modern [[Elephant and Castle|district]] in South [[London]].
* In the 1470s King [[Christian I of Denmark]] founded a chivalric order, the ''[[Order of the Elephant]]'', and had it confirmed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The order takes its name from the battle elephants which symbolized the Christian Crusades. {{As of|2003|alt=Today}}, it continues to be awarded under statutes established by king [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] in 1693, amended in 1958 to permit the admission of women to the order.
* The elephant given by [[Afonso V of Portugal]] to [[René d'Anjou]] about 1477.
* The merchants of [[Cyprus]] presented [[Ercole d'Este]] with an elephant in 1497.
* [[Suleiman (elephant)|Suleyman the elephant]], a present from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] king [[John III of Portugal|John III]] to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]].  Travelling from Spain in 1551, it arrived in Vienna in 1552, but died in 1554.
* [[Hanno (elephant)|Hanno]], or ''Annone'', was a [[white elephant (animal)|white elephant]] presented by king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] to [[Pope Leo X]] on the occasion of his coronation in 1514. He died in 1518, probably of an intestinal obstruction misdiagnosed as angina, with Pope Leo at his side. His story is told in [[Silvio Bedini]]'s ''The Pope's Elephant'' (Nashville: Sanders 1998). At the [[Villa Madama]], in the garden facing the loggia, the Elephant Fountain designed by [[Giovanni da Udine]] depicts "Annone", whose tomb was designed by [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]] himself.
*[[Hansken]], a female elephant from [[Ceylon]] that became famous in early 17th-century Europe, touring through many countries demonstrating circus tricks, and sketched by [[Rembrandt]] and [[Stefano della Bella]].

Newly published books are listed in a yearly compilation called ''bókatíðindi'' ("book news") that is distributed to all households for free; the total number of new books published was about 800 in 2007&lt;ref name="snaefell20071121" /&gt; and 760 in 2008.&lt;ref name="iwr20081228" /&gt;
A further ramification of the custom stems from both Iceland's centuries-long literary tradition, and strict WWII currency restrictions which limited the amount of imported giftware. Given that restrictions on imported paper were more lenient than on other products, books became a massively popular Christmas gift, and indeed the default gift, and thus the custom was established for the settling in and of the reading of said books.&lt;ref name="Iceland Christmas Eve Book Reading Binge"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/12/25/167537939/literary-iceland-revels-in-its-annual-christmas-book-flood |title=Literary Iceland Revels In Its Annual 'Christmas Book Flood' |last=JORDAN |first=TEICHER |date=2012-12-25 |website=NPR |access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH)''' is a [[South Korea]]n government research institute, established in 1989 to help develop technologies for the domestic industry, with focus on export competitiveness and [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]].

South Korea's then Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) established the Korea Academy of Industrial Technology (KAITEC) in 1989 to strengthen the technological base of [[small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.E.

KITECH's focus is on the development and management of manufacturing technologies for SMEs.&lt;ref name="KITECH1996"/&gt; KITECH receives both government and private funding, and distributes most of its research grants to private companies.&lt;ref name="KITECH1996"/&gt; By the middle of the 1990s, KITECH's annual budget was around US$130 billion, and employed a staff of one thousand in five sub-institutes.&lt;ref name="KITECH1996"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">'''Optus Aurora''' was a [[free-to-view]] [[satellite television]] platform in [[Australia]], which aimed at providing [[television]] and [[radio]] services to remote and black spot areas using the [[Optus fleet of satellites|Optus C1]] and [[Optus fleet of satellites|B3]] satellites.&lt;ref name="aboutaurora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.optus.com.au/portal/site/business/menuitem.1d0f746547349c557c0268109c8ac7a0/?vgnextoid=55ddaf2bd0cc8010VgnVCM10000029867c0aRCRD |title=Optus Aurora |accessdate=2007-08-25 |work=[[Optus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was available in all areas, using a standard [[satellite dish]] and [[set top box]], however commercial stations carried on the platform were restricted to their respective coverage areas.

Aurora replaced the analogue ''Homestead and Community Broadcast Satellite Service'' (HACBSS) in late 1998. HACBSS, carried on the [[Optus fleet of satellites|Optus B1]] satellite, was originally launched in the 1980s, and was in many areas the first means of receiving television signals.

The [[Viewer Access Satellite Television]] (VAST) was launched in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

 | accessdate = 2011-01-03
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a replacement for Optus Aurora, and now provides a full range of digital channels. Aurora ceased transmission in December 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalready.gov.au/what-is-the-switch/VAST-service.aspx|title= Viewer Access Satellite Television |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the last Aurora uplink taking place during February 2014.

==Services==

===Television===
The [[Remote Area Broadcasting Services|remote area broadcast services]] carried on the platform comprised the major [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] networks available in the service's two main coverage areas - Remote and Regional [[Western Australia]], and Remote Central and Eastern Australia.

[[ABC Television|ABC TV]] and [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] was available in all areas with the use of a [[smartcard]],&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://personal.optus.com.au/web/ocaportal.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=Template_woRHS&amp;FP=/personal/tv/satellitetvauroranews/faqssatellitetvauroranews&amp;site=personal |title=FAQs: Satellite TV - Aurora News |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; however commercial stations were only available to viewers in their respective coverage areas - [[Golden West Network|GWN]] and [[WIN Television|WIN WA]] to regional [[Western Australia]], and [[Imparja Television]] and [[Southern Cross Central]] to remote viewers in central and eastern Australia.

The multichannels of the broadcasters were not available on the service.

Indigenous broadcaster [[National Indigenous Television]] (NITV) and WA government service [[Westlink Network]] were also available on Aurora,&lt;ref name="lyngsat-b3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/aurora.html |title=Optus Aurora on Optus C1 at 156.0°E |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to some wagering channels from [[Sky Racing]].

===Radio===
A number of remote commercial and indigenous stations broadcast on Aurora, as did a few in-store radio services.

Most of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s radio networks were carried on the platform. [[SBS Radio]]'s national network was carried for five timezones. SBS Radio 1, SBS Radio 2 and [[ABC DiG]] was not carried by Aurora, but they were available on FTA [[Ku-Band]] on [[Optus D1]].&lt;ref name="d1lyngsat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/Optus-D1.html |title=Optus D1 |accessdate=2012-06-30 |work=Lyngsat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian government's [[Community Broadcasting Foundation]] broadcast a number of services on the platform including the [[BBC World Service]], [[National Indigenous Radio Service]], [[Vision Australia Radio]] and the [[Community Broadcasting Association of Australia|Community Radio Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

[[Coles Supermarkets]], [[Officeworks]] and [[Kmart Australia]] also used the Aurora service to broadcast their in-store radio to different locations in Australia.

{{Politics of Chile}}

A province is the second largest administrative division in [[Chile]] with 54 in total. The largest administrative division in Chile is that of a [[Regions of Chile|region]] with 16 in total.

Each provincial government (''gobernación provincial'') is headed by a governor (''gobernador'') appointed by the [[President of Chile|president]]. The governor exercises their powers in accordance with instructions from the regional [[intendant]] (''intendente''). The governor is advised by the Provincial Economic and Social Council (''Consejo Económico y Social Provincial'' or CESPRO). The only exception is the [[Santiago Province, Chile|Santiago Province]], which makes no provision for provincial government in its regulations; the position corresponds to the intendant of the [[Santiago Metropolitan Region]]. In January 2001, the Provincial Delegation of Santiago was created with the position of a Provincial Delegate, who exercises the functions of a provincial governor on behalf of the respective intendant.

The country's provinces are further divided into 346 [[Communes of Chile|communes]] which are administered by an [[alcalde]] and [[municipal council]].

Until the 1980's a province was the main administrative division in Chile, with 25 provinces: Tarapacá, Antofagasta, Atacama, Coquimbo, Aconcagua, Valparaíso, Santiago, O'Higgins, Colchagua, Curicó, Talca, Maule, Linares, Ñuble, Concepción, Arauco, Biobío, Malleco, [[Cautín_Province|Cautín]], Valdivia, Osorno (since 1940), Llanquihue, Chiloé, Aisén (since 1929), Magallanes (since 1929)

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Mukachevo''' ({{lang-la|Dioecesis Munkacsiensis Latinorum}}) is a [[diocese]] of the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in [[Ukraine]]. [[Antal Majnek]] is the current bishop of the [[diocese]]. He was appointed to the See of [[Mukachevo]] in 1997.

==History==
The history of the diocese begins 1993 when the Apostolic Administration of [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]] was split off from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Satu Mare|Diocese of Szatmár]]. This is unique among the Ukrainian dioceses, the remainder of which were all split off from [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Lviv]], and represents the divisions across the [[Carpathians]]. Elevated to a diocese in 2002, the diocese has only had one ordinary for the entirety of its existence.

==Geography==
The diocese is a suffragan of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Archdiocese of Lviv of the Latins]].

==Biography==
Henderson was born in [[Key West, Florida]]. He served two years in the U.S. Army towards the end of the Second World War, and then enrolled at [[Morehouse College]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where he earned a bachelor’s degree in English and sociology with high honors in 1949. He went on to pursue graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, being awarded a master's degree in English in 1950.&lt;ref name=CBB&gt;Bethel, Kari,
 [https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/henderson-stephen-e-1925-1997 "Stephen E. Henderson 1925–1997"], ''Contemporary Black Biography'', encyclopedia.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, he became a professor of English at [[Virginia Union University]], which post he held until 1962, meanwhile obtaining a PhD in English and Art History (1959). In 1962 he took an appointment as chair of the English department at Morehouse, and from 1969 for two years was as a senior research fellow at the Institute for the Black World in Atlanta, before in 1971 taking on professorship at Howard University in Washington, D.C., teaching in the departments of English and African American Studies. He was director of the Institute for the Arts and the Humanities at Howard (1973–85), and also lectured in the US and abroad. His 1973 book ''Understanding the New Black Poetry: Black Speech and Black Music as Poetic Reference'' is regarded as a seminal work that has been "heralded as the first formalized articulation of a theoretical understanding of African-American poetry and sparked new debate and dialogue in the world of African-American literature."&lt;ref name=CBB /&gt;

Henderson retired in 1992 and died aged 71 at his home in [[Langley Park, Maryland]], on January 7, 1997.&lt;ref name=CBB /&gt;

'''Telephone numbers in San Marino''' are 6 to 10 digits long. Numbers starting with either ''0'', ''8'' or ''9'' are assigned to landlines, ''6'' is used for mobile services, ''5'' for IP telephony services and ''7'' for premium numbers. There's no trunk code: all the digits are always dialed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T02020000B50001PDFE.pdf |title=National Numbering Plans : San Marino|website=[[ITU]]|access-date=1 April 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of country calling codes|country code]] for [[San Marino]] is ''378'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/ob-lists/icc/e164_763.pdf |title=List of ITU-T recommendation E.164 - assigned country codes |publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]] |format=PDF |access-date=1 April 2017 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but landlines are reachable via the Italian country code ''39'' as well. The [[international call prefix]] is 00. The emergency numbers are "112"/"113" (police), "115" (fire) and "118" (medical).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.itu.int/net/itu-t/inrdb/e129_important_numbers.aspx?country=87 |title=International Numbering Resources Database - San Marino |publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]] |access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Until 1996, San Marino was part of the [[Telephone numbers in Italy|Italian telephone numbering plan]], using the Italian area code "0549", but in that year it adopted its own country code "378". However dialing arrangements between San Marino and Italy continued as before. In 1998, as Italy switched to a [[Closed telephone numbering plan|closed dialling plan]], San Marino incorporated the 0549 area code into its subscribers' numbers.

The following numbers are equivalent:
* "0549 xxx xxx": from Italy
* "+378 xxx xxx": from rest of the world
* "+39 0549 xxx xxx": from rest of the world, using the Italian country code
* "+378 0549 xxx xxx": from rest of the world, using the San Marino country code and the Italian area code

'''The Voice of China''' ({{lang-zh|中央人民广播电台中国之声}} or {{lang|zh|中国之声}}), a.k.a. '''CNR-1''', is the flagship radio channel of [[China National Radio]] (CNR). It provides news and commentaries and broadcast 24 hours a day (exc. [[Beijing Time|BJT]] 2:05-4:25 on Tuesday) via AM, FM, SW and Internet. 

==History==
The infrastructure began with a transmitter from [[Moscow]] to set up its first station in [[Yan'an]] (延安).  It used the [[call sign]]''' XNCR''' ("'''New China Radio'''") for broadcasts, and is the first radio station set up by the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;[[Toby Miller|Miller, Toby]] (2003). ''Television: Critical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies''.  Routledge Publishing.  {{ISBN|0-415-25502-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the west, it was known as the '''Yan'an New China Radio Station''' ({{zh|s=延安新华广播电台|labels=no}}) broadcasting two hours daily.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;  In China, it was called the '''Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station''', which was established on December 30, 1940.&lt;ref name="CNR"&gt;CNR website. "[http://www.cnr.cn/introduce/cnrweb/web/zytjj.html CNR website]." ''CNR introduction.'' Retrieved on 2007-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 1947, it was renamed '''Shanbei Xinhua Broadcasting Station''' ({{zh|s=陕北新华广播电台|labels=no}}) after it departed from Yan'an. It began to broadcast in [[Peiping]] under the name of '''Peiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station''' ({{zh|s=|北平新华广播电台|labels=no}}) on March 25, 1949. On December 5, 1949, it was officially named to '''Central People's Broadcasting Station 1st Program''' ({{zh|s=中央人民广播电台第一套节目|labels=no}}), two months after the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]]. &lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

On January 1, 2004, CNR-1 was rebrand '''The Voice of China'''.

'''USA-63''', also known as '''GPS II-8''' and '''GPS SVN-21''', was an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which formed part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the eighth of nine [[GPS Block II|Block II]] GPS satellites to be launched, which were the first operational GPS satellites to fly.

USA-63 was launched at 05:39:00 UTC on 2 August 1990, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D197, flying in the 6925 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-63 into a transfer orbit.
