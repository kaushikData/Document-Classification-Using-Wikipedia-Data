The '''[[1986–87 NHL season|1986–87]] [[Calgary Flames]] season''' was the [[Calgary Flames seasons|seventh]] [[National Hockey League]] [[Season (sports)|season]] in [[Calgary]] and 15th for the Flames franchise.  The Flames posted their best record in franchise history to that time, as Calgary's 95 points was the third best total in the league.  The Flames' defence of their 1986 [[Western Conference (NHL)|Campbell Conference]] championship was quickly snuffed out by the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]], as the Flames were upset in the first round of the playoffs in six games by their Manitoba rivals.

[[Joe Mullen]] captured his first [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] for gentlemanly conduct, while [[Al MacInnis]] was named a [[1986–87 NHL season#All-Star teams|Second Team All-star]].&lt;ref&gt;Award Winners, ''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Flames had no player representatives at [[Rendez-vous '87]], which replaced the [[NHL All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] for this season, though head coach [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey b. 1931)|Bob Johnson]] served as an assistant coach for the NHL all-stars.

Tragedy struck the Flames in the summer of 1986, as their first round draft pick, [[George Pelawa]], died in an automobile crash over the [[Labour Day]] weekend.&lt;ref&gt;Ulmer, Mike, [http://www.canoe.ca/Slam031008/col_ulmer-sun.html Heat is on], canoe.ca, October 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pelawa's death is commonly rumoured to be an inspiration for the 1988 [[Tom Cochrane]] song ''Big League'', but has never been confirmed as true.

Following the season, the Flames released a music video to benefit charity. The "Red Hot" video featured many players, including [[Lanny McDonald]], [[Gary Roberts (ice hockey)|Gary Roberts]], [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]], Al MacInnis and [[Joel Otto]], among others, lipsynching and pretending to play instruments. It was released on VHS and on vinyl. It enjoyed popularity then but was forgotten until the video surfaced on the internet in 2005.

The '''2010 ANZ Championship season''' was the third season of the [[ANZ Championship]], commencing on 20 March. The 2010 season started two weeks earlier than in previous years to accommodate the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] in Delhi, in which netball is a core sport. 69 matches were played over 17 weeks, including an initial 14-week round-robin stage, followed by a three-week finals stage. Several rule changes were also implemented in the 2010 season.

After 14 weeks of round-robin competition, the Swifts emerged undefeated as minor premiers, progressing to the finals stage with the Thunderbirds, Magic and Steel. But the Thunderbirds progressed to the grand finale, inflicting the first loss of the season for the Swifts, who lost the preliminary final to the Magic one week later. The grand final was contested on 11 July in Adelaide between the Thunderbirds and Magic. In front of a capacity crowd, the Thunderbirds defeated the Magic by 52–42 to emerge as champions for the 2010 season.

== Overview ==

=== Format ===
The format of the 2010 season was identical to those of previous seasons. During the round-robin stage, played over 14 weeks, each team played every other team once, and played teams from their home country a second time. Teams also had one bye somewhere between Rounds 6–10. Week 4 of the round-robin stage was the designated Rivalry Round, in which all games were trans-Tasman match-ups. The top four teams from the round-robin stage progressed to the finals stage, played over three weeks in a [[Page-McIntyre System]].

Round 14 matchups in 2009 were identical to round 14 matchups in 2010, round 4 matchups in 2009 were identical to round 11 matchups in 2010, and round 1 matchups in 2009 were identical to round 3 matchups in 2010. Also, for the Rivalry Round, round 13 matchups in 2009 were identical to round 4 matchups in 2010. In addition, in trans-Tasman matches the home and away teams were switched around from 2009 to ensure that the teams got to play home and away games over two years: e.g., the Thunderbirds hosted the Magic in round 14 in 2009, but the same game in 2010 was hosted by the Magic.

The 2010 season saw the first use of the assistance package for teams that finished in the bottom two placings of the competition ladder for two consecutive seasons. The Central Pulse finished 10th in 2008 and 2009, winning one game in 26 outings, and were granted additional money as well as a second import player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=NZPA |date=2009-07-29 |title=Financial support offered to ailing Pulse |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/netball-news/financial-support-offered-ailing-pulse-2879808 |publisher=TVNZ |accessdate=2010-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613023310/http://tvnz.co.nz/netball-news/financial-support-offered-ailing-pulse-2879808 |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rules ===
Matches were played under international test rules, with a few exceptions. Games that had tied scores at the end of regular time continued into extra time until a winner emerged. Starting from 2010, two additional rule changes were also implemented: coaching was permitted during time stoppages, and venue clocks showed the countdown of the final minute of play, rather than turning blank for that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johannsen |first=Dana |date=2010-02-19 |title=Netballers see return of team talk|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/netball/news/article.cfm?c_id=69&amp;objectid=10627075 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teams ===
All ten teams from the inaugural season continued in 2010.

== Player transfers ==
:''See the [[2010 ANZ Championship transfer period]]''

The 2010 ANZ Championship season, the third year of the competition was expected to be the best yet. Teams organised their franchises, and then went on the hunt to poach opposition players. There was excitement on both sides of the Tasman, but in New Zealand it was all coming from one team. The [[Northern Mystics]] went on a shopping spree, signing [[Waikato/BOP Magic|Magic]] stars [[Maria Tutaia]] and [[Joline Henry]]. Along with [[Canterbury Tactix]] Silver Fern [[Larrissa Willcox]] and Jamaican international [[Althea Byfield]], to join current internationals [[Catherine Latu]] and [[Temepara George]] in Auckland. The Magic, who lost the services of Tutaia and Henry, made up for it by inking former Silver Ferns shooter [[Jodi Brown]] and Australian [[Peta Scholz]] from retirement. The new duo, teamed up with Magic stalwarts [[Irene van Dyk]], [[Laura Langman]] and [[Casey Williams]].

In Wellington, the Pulse who lost Byfield, made up for it by bringing in English import [[Ama Agbeze]] and [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]] benchie [[Jane Altschwager]]. They also snared Silver Fern defender [[Katrina Grant]] from the [[Southern Steel|Steel]], to form a nice looking team. At the [[Canterbury Tactix]], the retirement of captain [[Julie Seymour]] as well as losing Jodi Brown and Sonia Mkoloma left the red and black's midcourt in all sorts of trouble. Southlander [[Hayley Crofts]] was called into the franchise, but made no impact. They initially signed off out of favour [[Queensland Firebirds]] defender Peta Stephens, but an injury ruled her out of contention.
 
And down south at the [[Southern Steel]], after the retirements of star players [[Donna Wilkins]], [[Adine Wilson]] and [[Megan Hutton]], along with [[Katrina Grant]] moving north, it left the Steel in trouble too. They still pulled together a play off potential side. Former Silver Fern and [[Southern Sting|Sting]] player [[Leana de Bruin]] was back from pregnancy and was pulled into the backline. With the re-signing of internationals [[Daneka Wipiiti]], [[Megan Dehn]], [[Liana Leota]], [[Wendy Frew]] and [[Sheryl Scanlan]], Steel still had high chances for 2010.

Up north in Australia, the [[Queensland Firebirds]] answered their shooting problems, by snaring Australian Diamonds star [[Natalie Medhurst]] from the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]]. She set up a wonderful combination with returning Jamaican import [[Romelda Aiken]]. In the Firebird's midcourt, [[Lauren Nourse]] led the way without fellow Wing Attack [[Tamsin Greenway]]. The English player decided to not return for a third year of ANZ Championships netball. At the [[NSW Swifts]], the Sydney club picked up touring, English defender [[Sonia Mkoloma]], to give her a third franchise to play at. Mkoloma, again along with [[Catherine Cox]], [[Susan Pratley]] and [[Kim Green]] were the key players to their line-up.

In Melbourne, the [[Melbourne Vixens|Vixens]] opted against bringing in an import. The 2009 champions kept consistency in their lineup. Shooters [[Sharelle McMahon]] and [[Caitlin Thwaites]], midcourter [[Natasha Chokljat]] and defenders [[Julie Corletto]] and [[Bianca Chatfield]] all inked again with the team. At the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds|Thunderbirds]], Coach Jane Woodlands-Thompson returned as coach, along with stars [[Natalie von Bertouch]], [[Kate Beveridge]], [[Mo'onia Gerrard]] and import [[Geva Mentor]]. After the loss of Medhurst, and which speculation since has arisen Woodlands-Thompson wanted rid of her, she was replaced by former netballer, turned basketball player [[Carla Borrego]]. The tall Jamaican would become a huge hit.

The cash strapped [[West Coast Fever]] again kept their coach Jane Searle, and the core group of players. There were no huge changes in the Perth team's line-up, apart from [[Leah Shoard]] returning to Australia, after a year with the [[Southern Steel|Steel]] and [[Janelle Lawson]] returning home from the Firebirds.

== Pre-season ==
An early pre-season tournament was held in early February in Christchurch. This tournament featured the Steel and Tactix, as well as a New South Wales state team, in which the Steel emerged undefeated. The first of the major pre-season tournaments in 2010 was held in [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], New Zealand from 19–21 February, featuring the Firebirds, Mystics, Pulse, Tactix and Steel, along with a team from the [[Australian Institute of Sport]]. The Queensland Firebirds emerged undefeated from the Queenstown tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=NZPA |date=2010-02-21 |title=Coach Broughton admits flaws in Steel armour |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/3356557/Coach-Broughton-admits-flaws-in-Steel-armour |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5r7LpGoO5?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/3356557/Coach-Broughton-admits-flaws-in-Steel-armour |archivedate=2010-07-10 |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official pre-season tournament is the Netball Cup (formerly the SOPA Cup), which was held in Sydney from 5–7 March. In 2010, the tournament was contested between the Firebirds, Swifts, Vixens, Thunderbirds and Fever from Australia, and the Pulse and Steel from New Zealand. Once again, the Queensland Firebirds went through the tournament undefeated to emerge champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=NZPA |date=2010-03-07 |title=McCausland-Durie confident Pulse can be threat |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/3415948/McCausland-Durie-confident-Pulse-can-be-threat |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5r7LjYL5r?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/3415948/McCausland-Durie-confident-Pulse-can-be-threat |archivedate=2010-07-10 |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival of the Stars==
The Festival of the Stars is a charity match where two celebrity teams play each other to win money for their charities. The captains of the match in 2010 were the Australia's [[ONE HD]] Sunday commentators, Luke Darcy and Liz Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anz-championship.com/extra.asp?id=8079&amp;OrgID=2344   ANZ Championship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525091744/http://www.anz-championship.com/extra.asp?id=8079&amp;OrgID=2344 |date=May 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was played in two 15-minute halves and umpired by [[Natalie Medhurst]] and [[Wendy Fleming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netball.asn.au/newsItem.asp?orgID=1&amp;ID=17529 Netball Australia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127023104/http://www.netball.asn.au/newsItem.asp?orgID=1&amp;ID=17529 |date=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrity teams were as follows:

{|
|-
|width=50%|MARS Red [[Beyondblue]]:
* [[Luke Darcy]] (captain, GS)
* [[Dave Hughes|Dave "Hughesy" Hughes]] (GA)
* [[James Tomkins (footballer)|James Tomkins]] (GK)
* [[Lehmo]] (GD)
* [[Mieke Buchan]] (WD)
* [[Rebecca Judd|Rebecca Twigley]] (WA)
* [[Shelley O'Donnell]] (C)

* [[Liz Ellis]] (captain, GK)
* [[Adam Spencer]] (GA)
* [[Adam Swanson]] (WD)
* [[Brigitte Duclos]] (WA)
* [[Glenn Archer]] (GD)
* [[Lydia Lassila]] (C)
* [[Ryan Moloney]] (GS)
|}

During the match, Darcy's team scored the first two goals, giving them a two-goal lead, however Ellis' team came back with two goals from Spencer. Late in the half, Archer scored a goal on the goal circle (not legal in standard rules) and that was the only goal scored by him. At the end of the first half, Darcy's team lead 4-3. In the second half, a change was made by Ellis' team with Ellis moving to WD and shifting Archer and Swanson to GD and GK respectively to add more height in the defense circle, while Darcy placed Twigley to GA and Hughes to WD. Later on, Ellis called time to put Melbourne Vixens player Caitlin Thwaites at GS, moving Moloney to WD, Ellis to GK and benching Swanson. After a thrilling battle, despite Thwaites's goals and tricks and Spencer's long range shot on goal, Darcy's team won the match by two goals. As a result, the MARS Red beyondblue team won $10,000 for winning the match as well as $2,000 for scoring the first goal in both halves and $100 for every goal scored after, adding up to $12,900 for the beyondblue charity. The Holden Cruze National Breast Cancer Foundation team won $5,000 as runner-up prize and $100 for every goal scored, adding up to $5,900 for the National Breast Cancer Foundation charity.

The '''2016 Samoa vs. Fiji rugby league test match''' was played between [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]] and [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]] at [[Apia Park]].

==Background==
On 7 May 2016, it was confirmed that [[Apia]] would host a test-match between Samoa and Fiji on 8 October 2016, marking the 30th anniversary of [[rugby league in Samoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=7 May 2016|title=Samoa to host Fiji in historic Test|url=http://www.nrl.com/samoa-to-host-fiji-in-historic-test/tabid/10874/newsid/95676/default.aspx|publisher=NRL.com|accessdate=7 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508120424/http://www.nrl.com/samoa-to-host-fiji-in-historic-test/tabid/10874/newsid/95676/default.aspx|archivedate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Grant (rugby league)|John Grant]], the Chief Executive of the [[Australian Rugby League Commission]], shared his support for the test by confirming that an Australian registered referee would be provided along with senior staff and management to help with the organisation of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walter|first=Brad|date=7 May 2016|title=ARLC chairman John Grant expects NRL clubs to support historic Test in Samoa|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/arlc-chairman-john-grant-expects-nrl-clubs-to-support-historic-test-in-samoa-20160507-goowbt.html|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Squads==
Samoa picked 6 débutantes for the test match, while Fiji selected four. All of the Samoan team had players based in the NRL except for [[Denny Solomona]], who plays for English [[Super League]] club [[Castleford Tigers]]. Fiji on the other hand had a fair share of National Rugby League, and New South Wales Cup players along with one domestic player, [[Pio Seci]]. Samoa's most capped player was [[Leeson Ah Mau]], who made his 11th appearance for his country, while Fiji's most experienced player was [[James Storer]], who also made his 11th appearance for his country.

[[St. George Illawarra Dragons|St. George Illawarra]]'s Leeson Ah Mau captained Samoa, and [[Wests Tigers]]' Kevin Naiqama led Fiji.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5032">The '''Ballet Azul''' (''Blue Ballet'') is a term coined in [[Colombia]] in the 1950s to describe the [[Club Deportivo Los Millonarios|Millonarios]] football team, during its successful period from 1949–1964, because the blue color of their uniform, the large number of titles who had won the team, and the quality of its game. The term was first used by the sportscaster Carlos Arturo Rueda.

Later in the 1960s, in [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Costa Rica]], was used the same term to refer to [[Universidad de Chile (football club)|Universidad de Chile]] during its successful period from 1959–1969, [[Club Sport Emelec|Emelec]], and [[C.S. Cartaginés]] respectively.

== Millonarios, the first ''Ballet Azul'' ==
The term was born in the era known like ''El Dorado'', in [[Colombia]], when the football league broke away from [[FIFA]], because the Colombia football league turned professional in 1948. Instead, the Colombian league reached its golden era during the period. The best footballers in Latin America came to play in Colombia.

In this period the best team was Millonarios, with players like [[Adolfo Pedernera]], a star with the legendary [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] team of the 1940s better known as [[La Máquina]]; [[Alfredo Di Stefano]], who would later star for the legendary [[Real Madrid]] team of the 1950s; and [[Néstor Rossi]].

The team won the [[Colombian Professional Football|Colombian League]] championship in [[Campeonato Profesional 1949|1949]], [[Campeonato Profesional 1951|1951]], [[1952 Copa Mustang|1952]], [[1953 Copa Mustang|1953]], [[1959 Copa Mustang|1959]], [[1961 Copa Mustang|1961]], [[1962 Copa Mustang|1962]], [[1963 Copa Mustang|1963]], [[1964 Copa Mustang|1964]]

In addition, the best players were part of the ''Ballet Azul'' in the era of ''el Dorado'' of the Colombian football (1949–1954):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millonarios.com.co/dorado.html Millonarios Historia: El Dorado]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bath Racecourse''' is a [[thoroughbred horse racing]] venue located on [[Lansdown Hill]], about {{convert|3+1/4|mi|km}} northeast of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], Somerset, England. It is owned and operated by [[Arena Racing Company]].

The [[Horseracing in Great Britain|racecourse]] is a left-handed oval track of 1 mile 4 furlongs and 25 yards, with a run-in of nearly half-a-mile.&lt;ref name=BRR-77 &gt;''[[British Racing and Racecourses]]'' ({{ISBN|978-0-9501397-2-2}}) by [[Marion Rose Halpenny]] - Page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

At {{convert|780|ft|m|0}} above sea level, Bath is Britain's highest flat racecourse, although [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]] courses Hexham and Exeter are higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attheraces.com/course.aspx?CID=116 |title=Bath |publisher=At the races |accessdate=2008-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707184454/http://www.attheraces.com/course.aspx?CID=116 |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Racing was first recorded at Bath in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical Encyclopaedia of British Racing |last1=Mortimer |first1=Roger |last2=Onslow |first2=Richard |last3=Willett |first3=Peter |year=1978 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's |location=[[London]] |isbn=0-354-08536-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811, the first major meet at Bath Racecourse was held, under the auspices of a local family, the Blathwayts. Originally there was just one meet a year at the course, lasting for two days, but gradually over the years, the number of meets increased to its present level of twenty-two. In the early years, the Somerset Stakes was the major race of the calendar, and this race is still held annually. There were a number of grandstand buildings in those days and people used to watch the races from their carriages, lined up beside the track.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bath-racecourse.co.uk/our-racecourse/about-us |title=About Bath Racecourse |publisher=Bath Racecourse |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the racecourse was used as a landing field by the [[Royal Air Force]] and named RAF North Stoke.&lt;ref name="berryman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Somerset airfields in the Second World War |last=Berryman |first=David |year=2006 |publisher=Countryside Books |location=Newbury |isbn=1-85306-864-0 |pages=124–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Bath Racecourse was the site of a criminal plot surrounding the "Spa selling plate". Having two horses that looked almost identical, the gang substituted a good horse for a poor one. They bet heavily on the substituted horse and damaged the power supply to the racecourse, which prevented the bookmakers from changing the odds which remained at 10-1. The horse won the race and the gang would have profited highly had not racing officials become suspicious and called in [[Scotland Yard]]. The gang were subsequently brought to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Ward|title=Horse-Racing Strangest Races: Extraordinary but true stories from over 150 years of racing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVnACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123 |year=2015 |publisher=Pavilion Books |isbn=978-1-910232-32-3 |pages=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015/16 the racecourse facilities underwent a significant redevelopment and investment programme, funded by the [[Arena Racing Company]]. The racetrack has a new look with bands of buttermilk and French grey, the parade ring is revamped and the Beckford Bar opened. The new Langridge Grandstand opened in July 2016 and has various new facilities including a canopied roof garden from which races can be watched. It is also available as a venue between race days for corporate events, dinners and weddings.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5648">A '''benefit season''' is a method of financially rewarding professional [[cricket]]ers that is used by English [[county cricket]] teams to compensate long serving players. 

The system originated in the 19th century to help out professional cricketers who were paid low wages and generally could not play professional cricket much beyond the age of forty. Early "benefits" typically comprised the gate receipts of a designated match. Nowadays, a benefit season comprises a sequence of events such as dinners and auctions of memorabilia over the course of the summer cricket season or the whole year in which the relevant cricket season falls. In almost all cases only one player from a club is given a benefit in each season in order to avoid two or more players competing to attract money from the same people. Until recently, players with less service might sometimes be given a "Testimonial" season or match: the difference appears to have been largely semantic, but for almost half a century one of the less financially sound English first-class county clubs, [[Derbyshire CCC|Derbyshire]], made a point of not awarding benefits, but giving testimonials instead. The Australian cricketer [[Colin McCool]] was awarded a testimonial in 1959, only three years after joining [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Somerset County Cricket Club Year Book 
| edition = 1958-59
| publisher = Somerset County Cricket Club
| chapter = Colin McCool's Testimonial Year&amp;mdash;1959
| page = 95
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player will appoint a "benefit" committee to help him organise his benefit, composed of other current and former cricketers, and any business and professional people with relevant skills and contacts who are willing to help out. All the profits go to the player and they are exempt from tax following the ruling of the [[House of Lords]] over the benefit for [[James Seymour (cricketer)|James Seymour]], the [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] cricketer whose benefit in 1920 was the subject of a protracted legal case brought by the [[Inland Revenue]] and not fully resolved until 1926.  

A player may be rewarded with a benefit season by his county committee about ten years after receiving his [[county cap]], but this varies from player to player, partly because in order for his benefit to qualify for tax exemption a player must not have had a contractual expectation of a benefit. Occasionally a player stays with a county long enough to be awarded a second benefit. Sometimes this is also known as a "testimonial": an example is [[Graham Gooch]] of [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] who had a benefit in 1985 and a testimonial in 1995. 

The system has survived into the 21st century even though county cricketers are now reasonably well paid. The amounts raised generally vary from a few tens of thousands of pounds to low six figures. A few players (such as [[Graeme Hick]] [http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/1/1988/1988.html]) have made over three hundred thousand pounds. The amount that a player makes from his benefit depends on factors such as his personal popularity, contacts, social skills and fame at least as much as on his degree of financial need and the quality of his contribution to his club on the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]]. One aspect of this which attracts particular scepticism is that famous international cricketers, some of whom will retire as millionaires in any case, tend to make more out of their benefit season than less well off players who have never played for their country, and who seem closer to the being the kind of "deserving cause" for whom benefits were first devised. The supporters of the system contend that it brings about two million pounds a year into the English game which would otherwise be lost if the system were to be abandoned.

Since the 1990s the proportion of cricketers who move from one county club to another during their playing career has been rising sharply, and many players who do so never receive a benefit. However, salaries have risen sharply in recent years, and many players prefer to hunt for a better salary rather than stay where they are in the hope of being awarded a benefit at some point. A conventional pension scheme for cricketers has also been introduced to complement the benefit system.

If a county has no player in its squad who is eligible for a benefit but has not yet had one, it may organise a "county benefit" or a "youth cricket benefit" to raise funds for special projects, but these often do not raise much money as many people are more interested in taking part in a benefit if they know that they are helping an individual.

Tax exempt events to raise money for long serving players are also used in some other sports such as [[football (soccer)|football]], although they tend to be called [[testimonial match|testimonial]]s in that case and are usually a single match rather than a season of events. The tax free status of benefits and testimonials rests on a single early 20th century legal ruling, and great care has to be taken by every benefit committee not to breach the rules in some small way which might lead to the player receiving a demand for tax on the entire amount, or to provoke the [[Inland Revenue]] into challenging the exemption on an overall basis. However, testimonials for prominent professional footballers have in modern times increasingly become charity fundraisers in which the player donates either a large part or all of the proceeds to one or more organisations.

'''Damanhour International Stadium''' was a proposed [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Damanhour]], [[Egypt]] that if built, would have become home to [[Ala'ab Damanhour SC|Ala'ab Damanhour Sporting Club]], replacing their current home ground [[Ala'ab Damanhour Stadium]], and one of the venues to host the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] if Egypt was selected as hosts. The stadium had a planned capacity of 60,000 [[all-seater stadium|all-seated]].

After [[South Africa]] was selected to host the World Cup, the construction and building of this stadium was completely halted.

'''''Gus''''' is a 1976 American [[Children's film|family]] [[comedy film]] by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]], directed by [[Vincent McEveety]] and starring [[Edward Asner]], [[Don Knotts]] and [[Gary Grimes]]. Its center character is Gus, a football-playing mule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/77172/Gus/|title=Gus (1976) - Overview - TCM.com|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gus-1976|title=Gus|author=Roger Ebert|date=13 July 1976|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film did well at the box office and was released on [[home video]] in 1981. The movie is remembered for two sequences involving a hotel and a supermarket.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=December 2015}}
The film opens in [[Yugoslavia]] with the Petrovic family watching their son Stepjan winning a soccer game.  Their other son Andy works on his farm, and can't play soccer at all, after falling into the well by accident. One day, Andy discovers Gus can kick a soccer ball long distances when Andy shouts, "Oyage!".  [Note: there is fierce debate in the ''Gus'' fan community re the spelling of "Oyage."  Some spell it "Oyatch!," while others give it a more Yugoslavian-sounding, "Ojigdz!" The word itself has no meaning in any of the Yugoslavian languages, though.]

Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, the California Atoms are a professional football team owned by Hank Cooper ([[Ed Asner]]) and coached by the inept Coach Venner ([[Don Knotts]]). They are the worst team in the league and have not won a game in years. Cooper also owes a lot of money to two mobster bookmakers named Charles Gwynn ([[Harold Gould]]) and Cal Wilson ([[Dick Van Patten]]). When Cooper tells them he cannot pay his debts, the bookies give him a last chance bet: if the Atoms win the upcoming Super Bowl, all gambling debts will be forgiven, but if they do not win, Gwynn and Wilson will take ownership of the team.

Desperate to draw in fans, Cooper looks for a great half time show. His secretary, Debbie ([[Louise 'Liberty' Williams]]), sees a story in her parents' Yugoslavian newspaper about Gus.  Debbie flies to Yugoslavia and hires Gus and Andy.  After Gus is a hit in his first halftime show, Cooper and Venner decide to put him in the game as a place kicker. The other team protests, but as the rule book does not require a player to be human, Cooper allow Gus to kick, And able to kick a field goal from anywhere in the field, the Atoms win.  The Atoms go on to win their next few games thanks to Gus, and move to first place in their division. The only catch is that that Gus will only kick when Andy holds the ball and shouts the command. Debbie is assigned to watch over Andy and Gus, since she can speak Serbian.  A romance begins between them, aided by Gus.

Gwynn and Wilson, realizing their deal with Cooper is backfiring, hire two incompetent criminals named Crankcase ([[Tim Conway]]) and Spinner ([[Tom Bosley]]) to stop Gus from playing and make the team lose.  Through their schemes, Crankcase and Spinner cause the Atoms to lose two games.  Despite the losses, the Atoms make the playoffs.  Andy becomes a celebrity, but his parents remain unimpressed, saying he only holds the ball for Gus.

Before the playoff game, Spinner convinces Andy that Debbie has been injured in a car accident. When Andy arrives at the [[hospital]], Crankcase locks him up.  Without Andy, Gus refuses to kick, and the Atoms fall behind. In the final quarter, Debbie dresses up in Andy's uniform and convinces Gus to kick a field goal, scoring the winning points. Andy, who managed to escape, arrives after the game is over. He tells Debbie his father is right: Andy is nothing, and anyone can hold the ball for Gus.

With the Atoms headed to the [[Super Bowl]], Spinner and Crankcase steal Gus and replace him with an ordinary mule.  Spinner and Crankcase check into a local [[hotel]] and lock up Gus with them and Gus breaks the [[TV]] and the hotel room door. At the Super Bowl, Andy quickly realizes the mule he has is not Gus, and he and Cooper leave by [[helicopter]] to search for Gus.  When the two criminals watch the game on TV, Gus goes wild and escapes.  In a long comic sequence, Crankcase and Spinner chase Gus into a local [[supermarket]] where they unsuccessfully attempt to recapture the mule. The criminals make a huge mess in the supermarket, including stepping on bottles of Ketchup and Mustard, making a mess of themselves, and getting in the way of a strong man who beats them up, Or landing in a basket of balls for the children, and finally, attempting to ride Gus, who throws them into a huge ready made cake, destroying it completely. Running from the supermarket, Spinner and Crankcase are apprehended for mule napping and for causing an extended amount of damages in the supermarket. Gus is spotted from the air by Andy and Cooper.  They airlift Gus to the Super Bowl and arrive by half-time.

With Gus back in the game, the Atoms make a comeback. With 45 seconds left on the clock, the Atoms are down 16–15 with the ball on their own five-yard line. Gus lines up for a field goal attempt, but slips in the mud and misses the football.  In the scramble for the ball, Gus knocks it over to Andy, who runs 95 yards for the touchdown.  As Andy and team walk off the field to celebrate their win, Debbie winks at Gus and says, "I know you did that on purpose". Gus winks back at her.

==Production==
This is the only one of their five films together where [[Don Knotts]] and [[Tim Conway]] do not share any scenes.

[[Johnny Unitas]] appears as a commentator with [[Bob Crane]] (in his last feature film appearance) supplying the [[play-by-play]] during the football broadcasts. [[Dick Enberg]] did the play-by-play for the local games.

The name "Hank Cooper" was used in the 1997 Disney film ''[[The Love Bug (1997 film)|The Love Bug]]'' as the name of the mechanic ([[Bruce Campbell]]) who meets Herbie. In ''[[Herbie Goes Bananas]]'' (1980), a partygoer wearing an Atoms jersey is briefly seen during a masquerade ball scene.

''Gus'' would be the final feature film for [[Bob Crane]] as well as the last film in the promising, yet short career of then 20-year-old Grimes.   This was also the final film appearance of [[Virginia O'Brien]].

The Kinsmen Field House is part of the '''Kinsmen Sports Centre''' - a multi-purpose sport and recreation facility located in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. The land surrounding the facility is called '''Kinsmen Park''', part of Edmonton's city-long [[North Saskatchewan River valley parks system]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/kinsmen-park.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Its namesake is the [[Kin Canada|Kinsmen]], a service organization.  

The field house was opened January 3, 1968, and was intended to be the first phase of a multifaceted Kinsmen Village that would eventually include an Olympic-size swimming pool and an indoor/outdoor performing arts theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinsmen-edmonton.ca/webpages/sports_center.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402004355/http://www.kinsmen-edmonton.ca/webpages/sports_center.htm |archivedate=2010-04-02 |title= Kinsmen Sports Centre |accessdate=2011-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its creation, it was unique among such facilities in Canada and remains the only such facility in [[North America]] which is open to general use.&lt;ref name="edmontonplus"&gt;[http://www.edmontonplus.ca/arts_entertainment/Kinsmen_Sports_Centre/34546 Edmonton Plus.ca - Arts &amp; Entertainment - Kinsmen Sports Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsmen Field House once hosted concerts by many famous artists, including [[Led Zeppelin]] &amp; [[Vanilla Fudge]] (1969), [[Frank Zappa]] (1971), [[Manfred Mann]] &amp; [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] (1974), [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] (1975),  [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (1975), [[Wishbone Ash]] (1975), [[Max Webster]] (1977),  [[Rush (band)|Rush]] (1975, 1976 &amp; 1977), [[Bob Marley]] (1979), [[Motörhead|Motorhead]] (1981),  [[Ozzy Osbourne]] (1981), [[Girlschool]], [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Scorpions (band)|The Scorpions]] (1982), [[The Clash]] (1982), [[Billy Idol]] w/[[Platinum Blonde (band)|Platinum Blonde]] (1984), [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] (1985) and [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] (1986).

In 1976, the Kinsmen Aquatic Centre was added to the facility to serve the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref name="2005wm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2005worldmasters.com/bcm/wmgames/wmgames-website.nsf/AllDoc/1355BC974EEE5DEE87256E1200663F58-OpenDocument.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109230055/http://www.2005worldmasters.com/bcm/wmgames/wmgames-website.nsf/AllDoc/1355BC974EEE5DEE87256E1200663F58-OpenDocument.htm |archivedate=2006-11-09 |title=Kinsmen Sports Centre |accessdate=2011-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also added in 1992 was the Keltie Byrne Fitness Centre.&lt;ref name="edmontonplus" /&gt;

The Kinsmen Sports Centre is owned by the City of Edmonton and operated by the Community Services Department. It was the competition site for the 2005 World Masters Games diving, swimming, synchronized swimming and table tennis.&lt;ref name="2005wm" /&gt;

'''MMA gloves''' or '''grappling gloves''' are small, open-fingered gloves used in [[mixed martial arts]] bouts. They usually have around 4–6 oz of padding and are designed to provide some protection to the person wearing the glove, but leave the fingers available for [[grappling]] maneuvers such as [[clinch fighting]] and [[Submission hold|submissions]].
&lt;!--Deleted image removed: [[Image:Fight glove.jpg|thumb|200px|MMA fight/grappling gloves with open fingered designs.{{Pufc|1=Fight glove.jpg|log=2011 November 5}}]]--&gt;

==History==
[[Boxing gloves#Influence of boxing gloves in other fight sports|Small, open-fingered gloves]] were first mandatory in Japan's [[Shooto]] promotion and were later adopted by the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] as it developed into a regulated sport. Gloves were introduced to protect fighters' fists from injuries, as well as reduce the number of facial lacerations (and stoppages due to cuts) that fighters experienced without gloves. The introduction of gloves was also intended to encourage fighters to use their hands for striking to allow more captivating matches for fans. There are some similarities to the wrist-supporting, closed-thumb, broken-knuckle ''kempo gloves'' popularized by [[Bruce Lee]]'s 1973 movie ''[[Enter the Dragon]]''.

==Types and use==
[[File:Gina Carano ground-and-pound.jpg|thumb|[[Gina Carano]] wears MMA gloves during a bout.]]
'''Competition gloves''' - Most professional fights have the fighters wear 4 ounce (110 g) gloves, whereas amateurs may wear a slightly heavier 6 ounce (170 g) glove for increased protection. According to the rules, UFC allows gloves between 4-6 ounces, and even heavier for certain larger sized gloves, e.g. 2 XL – 4 XL.

'''Sparring gloves''' - Generally speaking MMA sparring gloves weight is usually 7 ounces. When sparring there is obviously a lot of punching involved, from working the bag to actual sparring with a partner. Both of these require that your knuckles are adequately protected and cushioned from the forces put upon them. The 7oz refers to the weight of the padding inside the gloves and not the overall weight.

'''Grappling gloves''' -  Otherwise known as hybrid or training gloves these are used mainly for clinch work/grappling.This type of glove has less padding than sparring or competition gloves. In addition each finger can be moved independently allowing for more gripping ability.

==Impact of gloves on safety and injuries==
The impact of gloves on the injuries caused during a fight is a controversial issue, mostly looked at in relation to boxing. The use of padded gloves in fights protect the fists of the wearer but don't prevent [[Brain damage|brain injury]] unless they are so large that they become difficult to use.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/attachmentsbytitle/pdfboxingdebate/$file/theboxingdebate.pdf|title=The Boxing Debate British Medical Association|last=Brice|first=Mr J.|last2=Robins|first2=Sallie|last3=Secretariat|first3=Editorial|last4=Glanville|first4=Design Hilary|last5=Mars|first5=Sarah|last6=Burton|first6=Lynne|date=1993|journal=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=|location=|pages=23, 68|archive-url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.110.6345&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archive-date=2007-09-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dillner, 1993"&gt;Dillner L. ''Boxing should be counted out, says BMA report''. BMJ. 1993;306:1561–1562.&lt;/ref&gt; These gloves protect the fists of the wearer and allow stronger punches than in [[Bare-knuckle boxing|bare-knuckle fights]], and it is the changes in acceleration to the head as a whole that tears the blood vessels, not the impact with the glove.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Rupp Arena''' is an [[list of indoor arenas|arena]] located in downtown [[Lexington, Kentucky]], [[United States|U.S.]] Since its opening in 1976, it has been the centerpiece of [[Lexington Center]], a convention and shopping facility owned by an arm of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, which is located next to the Lexington [[Hyatt Regency Hotel, Lexington|Hyatt]] and [[Hilton Lexington/Downtown|Hilton]] hotels. Rupp Arena also serves as home court to the University of Kentucky men's basketball program, and is named after legendary former Kentucky coach and [[University of Kansas]] alumnus [[Adolph Rupp]]. With an official capacity of 23,500, it is currently the largest arena in the United States designed specifically for basketball. In Rupp Arena, the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball]] team is second in the nation in [[college basketball]] home attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13208237/syracuse-orange-again-lead-nation-men-basketball-attendance|title=NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Attendance Leaders Year-by-Year (1970-2011) |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other basketball-specific arena in US history larger than the arena is the now-demolished [[Charlotte Coliseum]]. Rupp Arena also regularly hosts concerts, conventions and shows.

==History==
The arena's primary tenant is the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball]] team, but the [[Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball]] team has also hosted games there in recent years, particularly an upset in early 2006 of the #1 [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Tennessee Lady Volunteers]]. Rupp Arena was the host of the [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985 NCAA Final Four]], won in an upset by eighth-seeded [[Villanova University|Villanova]].  It also formerly hosted the [[Kentucky Thoroughblades]] (currently the [[San Jose Barracuda]]) (capacity 10,011) and the [[Lexington Men O' War]] (capacity 7,500) minor-league [[ice hockey|hockey]] teams, and the [[Lexington Horsemen]] [[arena football]] team (capacity 7,550), numerous concerts (theater capacity 2,300; concert hall 10,000; arena capacity 23,500+), conventions, and other events. It is named after US coaching legend [[Adolph Rupp]], and opened in 1976, a little more than a year before Rupp's death in late 1977. Since the 1985 Final Four, Rupp Arena has hosted a number of NCAA Tournament regional games, most recently in [[2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2013]] when it hosted second and third round NCAA Tournament games. Rupp Arena is also home to Kentucky's high school boys' basketball Sweet Sixteen, a single elimination tournament which determines the state champion with sixteen teams representing each of Kentucky's regional high school champions.  The construction of Rupp Arena came to a halt during the beginning of the dig after the discovery of bones left behind from the Inuit Tribe local to the Lexington Kentucky area. It was decided to move the build site 1,000 feet in order to properly respect the Native Indian Burial ground.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Seating arrangement==
The arena has an official capacity for basketball of 23,500, but has packed in more than 24,000 for many UK basketball games. This is possible because less than half of the seating (about 10,000) consists of chair-back seats, all of them in the lower seating bowl. The lower bowl also incorporates a student standing-room area called the "eRUPPtion Zone" behind one goal. The upper bowl is completely made up of bleacher bench seats that allow more capacity than chair-back seats. Unlike many arenas built in the following years, it has no luxury suites, and has never been renovated to add them. However, in 2001, the arena received some minor renovations including four oversized video boards, new lower bowl seating, new locker rooms, and a new court.

==Milestones==
*The first act to perform at Rupp Arena was Lawrence Welk on Sunday, October 17, 1976. The performance attracted 20,000 people to the newly opened facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.rupparena.com/arena-information/about-us/history|website=Rupp Arena|publisher=Rupp Arena|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ceremonial first basket in the new facility was sunk by Adolph's young grandson Chip (Adolph III), who went on to play college basketball at [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) rival [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]].
*Rupp Arena is the home court of the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team, which boasts an impressive overall record in Rupp Arena of 529-64 (.892) since beginning play there on November 27, 1976. The court itself is named Cawood's Court after longtime University of Kentucky football and men's basketball radio broadcaster [[Cawood Ledford]].
*Rupp staged three [[Southeastern Conference]] men's basketball tournaments between 1982 and 1993; it was also the host of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] men's basketball tournament in 1992 and 1993.
*It hosted [[WWE Backlash]] in [[Backlash (2006)|2006]].
*The Rupp Arena attendance record was set on January 2, 2010, when 24,480 people watched number-three Kentucky play rival Louisville. The final score was a 71-62 victory by the Kentucky Wildcats. 
[[File:rupparenaK.JPG|275px|thumb|right|[[University of Kentucky]] cheerleaders at Rupp Arena during a basketball game]]
*The UK men are the only basketball program in the SEC that plays home games in an off-campus facility. All of the other programs play on-campus, including the UK women, who play in the men's former home of [[Memorial Coliseum (Lexington)|Memorial Coliseum]]. However, when the women's program expects an unusually large crowd, it will shift an occasional game to Rupp; they notably upset then top-ranked [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]] there on January 26, 2006. 
*Rupp is also home to the annual [[Sweet Sixteen (KHSAA State Basketball Championship)|KHSAA State Basketball Championship]], known and trademarked as the Sweet Sixteen, with 16 boys' basketball teams from throughout the commonwealth appearing for a shot at the state title. The KHSAA girls' Sweet Sixteen will join the boys' event at Rupp in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://khsaa.org/051017-board-of-control-addresses-championship-sites-for-football-girls-basketball-dance/ |title=Board of Control Addresses Championship Sites for Football, Girls' Basketball, Dance |publisher=Kentucky High School Athletic Association |date=May 10, 2017 |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The University of Kentucky has led the nation 25 times in NCAA men's basketball home attendance (an NCAA record) since the 1976-77 season (the previous 39 seasons at Rupp Arena), including 17 out of the last 20 seasons, and eight of the last 10 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/Reports/attendanceYBYtop25.pdf|title=NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Attendance Leaders Year-by-Year (1970-2011)|publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*On December 21, 2009, in Rupp Arena, the Kentucky men's basketball team became the first college basketball program to win 2000 games, in an 88-44 win against the [[Drexel Dragons|Drexel University Dragons]]. 
*On November 8, 2010, ESPN ranked Rupp Arena as the third-loudest venue in college basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kentuckysportsradio.com/1/rupp-arena-named-the-third-loudest-in-america/|title=Rupp Arena Named The Third Loudest in America - Kentucky Sports Radio|author=|date=|website=kentuckysportsradio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rupp Arena hosted the August 2, 2011, tapings of [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] and [[WWE Superstars]], with the former set to air on August 5, 2011, and the latter having aired on August 4, 2011.
*Hosted several TV tapings for various WWF shows in the 1980s and '90s.
*The 500th win in Rupp Arena came on November 27, 2013, against [[Eastern Michigan]], with Kentucky winning 81-63.
*It is Kentucky's largest arena and has hosted concerts by many performers, including [[Paul McCartney]], [[Elton John]], [[George Strait]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Phish]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[CKY (band)|CKY]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]], and in recent years, [[Pearl Jam]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], [[Brad Paisley]], and [[Miranda Lambert]].
*On January 28, 2017, with number-four Kentucky hosting number-two Kansas at Rupp Arena,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400910697|title=Kansas vs. Kentucky - Game Recap - January 28, 2017 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' measured the loudest indoor crowd roar at 126.4&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seccountry.com/kentucky/rupp-arena-kentucky-world-record-crowd-noise|title=Kentucky's Rupp Arena breaks Guinness World Record for indoor crowd noise|author=|date=28 January 2017|website=seccountry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseaofblue.com/2017/1/28/14426984/kentucky-fans-set-record-for-loudest-indoor-crowd-roar|title=Kentucky Fans Set Indoor Noise Record|author=|date=|website=aseaofblue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted 17 days before Guinness recorded a roar of 130.4&amp;nbsp;dB at [[Allen Fieldhouse]] when West Virginia played at Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400916243|title=West Virginia vs. Kansas - Game Recap - February 13, 2017 - ESPN|author=|date=|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steetley Company Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Shireoaks]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]].  The ground was laid out in 1951&lt;ref&gt;Cricket Grounds of Nottinghamshire  P Wynne Thomas ACS 1984 p.27&lt;/ref&gt; and the first important match on the ground was in 1955, when the [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire Second XI]] played  the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire Second XI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/734_minc.html Minor Counties Championship Matches played on Steetley Company Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ground has played host to both Nottinghamshire Second XI and [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire Second XI]] matches in the [[Second XI Championship]] and Second XI Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/734_sec.html Second XI Championship Matches played on Steetley Company Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/734_set.html Second XI Trophy Matches played on Steetley Company Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Emerald Diamond''''' is a documentary following the history of [[Baseball Ireland]] and the [[Irish national baseball team]]. It was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnfitzgerald.net/2014/03/07/st-patricks-day-spring-training-irish-baseball/ |title=St. Patrick's Day + Spring Training = Irish Baseball! – John Fitzgerald |publisher=Johnfitzgerald.net |date=7 March 2014 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director John Fitzgerald financed the film almost entirely on credit cards while working freelance at various jobs in the TV and film industries. The film crew was made up of professionals from in and around Fitzgerald's hometown of Valhalla, NY, with each crew member coincidentally living in towns along the Metro North Railroad's Harlem Line – leading to the creation of Harlem Line Pictures and, later, Harlem Line Media.

== Release  ==
Although the film received positive reviews from The New York Times, New York Post, Irish Echo and National Public Radio, Fitzgerald opted to release it immediately before receiving a traditional distribution deal. On 25 February 2006, "The Emerald Diamond" debuted to a sold out crowd of 250 people at the [[Jacob Burns Film Center]] in New York. Among those in the crowd was Major League Baseball Executive Vice-President Robert Manfred. Manfred was taken with the Irish National Team's story and promised to help the film and the team in any way he could. He arranged to have the film's trailer played at [[Shea Stadium]] (New York), [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] (Minneapolis), and [[AT&amp;T Park]] (San Francisco).

"The Emerald Diamond" was screened in theatres in 22 US cities and two Irish cities, between February and August 2006. Many of the US screenings were sponsored by Irish heritage organisations, baseball museums or Irish-based vodka company Boru Vodka.

== Film Festivals ==
{{primary sources|date=April 2012}}
The film received the Critic's Choice Award at the 2006 Baseball Film Festival at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in [[Cooperstown, NY]]. The award was selected and presented by film critic Jeffrey Lyons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseballhall.org/node/2269 |title=2006 Film Festival &amp;#124; Baseball Hall of Fame |publisher=Baseballhall.org |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media reviews and publicity stunts==
The film received positive reviews from The New York Times, New York Post, National Public Radio and several Irish-American newspapers. In addition, the film was featured by [[FoxNews]], [[National Public Radio]] and Boston's CBS-4. The attraction of major media outlets is rare for a low-budget film, but was likely due to the underdog story of the Irish National Team, coupled with Fitzgerald's determination to make the film entirely on credit cards.

== The Future of ''The Emerald Diamond'' ==
After winning the Critic's Choice Award at the 2006 Baseball Film Festival, Fitzgerald confirmed that he was writing a feature film script based on the story of the Irish National Baseball Team. He noted that the script will contain several stories that didn't make it to the documentary. He refused to confirm or deny interest or involvement of any actors.

Fitzgerald also announced that he has founded a nonprofit group to help further the development of Irish youth baseball and the Irish National Baseball Team. The organisation is called "The Baseball United Foundation" and is focused on making the game of baseball accessible to communities where the game is not traditionally played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney |first=Tom |url=http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20140726/News/307269986 |title=Irish baseball player gets taste of America's pastime in R.I. – News – providencejournal.com – Providence, RI |publisher=Providencejournal.com |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During World War I, the National Recreation Foundation began as the War Camp Community Services (WCCS), Inc. Its goal was to provide military men on the homefront with recreational activities. After the War, the Foundation was organized in 1919 and became the NRF.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In 1995, the NRF changed its mission to focus on promoting [[Healthy lifestyle|healthy lifestyles]] in [[at-risk youth]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Mission and achievements ==
As a non-profit organization, the NRF is dedicated to providing and encouraging at-risk youth with recreational activities to improve their quality of life. The Foundation has worked at improving mental, physical, and social health through recreational activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalrecreationfoundation.org/about-us/history-2/|title=National Recreation Foundation - about-us|website=www.nationalrecreationfoundation.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also seeks to promote healthy lifestyles in communities across the United States by partnering with local, sate and national agencies.

One of its goals includes providing grant money to projects that are in line with their mission. The NRF has been giving grants since 1965. The members of the board of trustees are the ones who seek out recipients of the grants, which is a unique thing about the NRF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalrecreationfoundation.org/about-us/grantmaking-3/|title=National Recreation Foundation - about-us|website=www.nationalrecreationfoundation.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2016, the National Recreation Foundation donated $1,384,445 to charities that support their mission.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

They also award the Robert W. Crawford Achievement Prize to people who make significant contributions to the recreation field by helping at-risk youth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2010-2011 the NRF gave out grants to 36 programs for nearly $2 million to support non-profit organizations and government agencies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parksandrecreation.org/2012/February/National-Recreation-Foundation/|title=Parks and Recreation Magazine - National Recreation and Park Association - NRPA|website=www.parksandrecreation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''University of Bolton Stadium''' (formerly '''Macron Stadium''' and '''Reebok Stadium''') is the home stadium of English [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], and is located on the [[Middlebrook, Greater Manchester|Middlebrook Retail Park]], [[Horwich]] in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton]], Greater Manchester.&lt;ref name=bwfcaddress&gt;To check the stadium's full postal address, go to the [http://postcodefinderpreprod.royalmail.com/addressfinder.aspx Royal Mail address finder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107011137/http://postcodefinderpreprod.royalmail.com/addressfinder.aspx |date=7 January 2014 }} and type: BL6 6JW. Retrieved 7 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its opening in 1997 until 2014, the stadium was named "Reebok Stadium", after long-term club sponsors [[Reebok]]. However, after Bolton Wanderers signed an initial four-year naming rights and kit deal with Italy's [[Macron (sportswear)|Macron sportswear company]], the stadium name was changed to reflect the new deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-macron-announcement-24.4.14-1507087.aspx |title=BWFC strike stadium and kit deal with Macron|publisher=bwfc.co.uk |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was renamed the [[University of Bolton]] Stadium in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/2018/august/welcome-to-the-university-of-bolton-stadium/|title=Welcome to the University of Bolton Stadium|last=|first=|date=1 August 2018|work=[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.]]|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hotel forms part of the stadium's construction and some of the rooms offer views of the pitch. The hotel was operated by the [[De Vere Group]] until August 2013, when the club assumed ownership and renamed it the "Bolton Whites Hotel".

==History==
University of Bolton Stadium is a  [[all-seater stadium]] with a capacity of almost 29,000 and was completed in 1997, replacing the club's old ground, [[Burnden Park]]. The lead consultant/architect of the project was Lobb Sports, while local firm [[Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope]] acted as planning supervisors and [[quantity surveyor]]s, the contractor was Birse Construction, and Deakin Callard &amp; Partners provided structural engineering services. The value of the contract was £25&amp;nbsp;million (US$42.1 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolton Wanderers Football &amp; Athletic Co Ltd. New Stadium|url=http://www.bghbolton.co.uk/Leisure_ReebokStadium.html|website=Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope|publisher=Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope, LLP|accessdate=6 August 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is noted for its distinct gabled architecture, first pioneered by the [[Galpharm Stadium|John Smith's Stadium]]. The upper-tier corners do not have seating due to concerns of health and safety access.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The stadium was opened in 1997 by [[John Prescott]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who was the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeline: A history of the Reebok Stadium|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/11171470.print/|accessdate=6 August 2014|work=The Bolton News|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium consists of four stands: The [[Carrs Pasties]] (North) Stand at one end; the South Stand ([[Franking Sense]] and also the away end) at the other end; the West Stand  at one side of the pitch; and the Nat Lofthouse (east) Stand at the other side.

When the stadium was named after long-time team sponsor Reebok in 1997, fans considered the title impersonal and believed that too much emphasis was being placed on financial considerations. This opposition considerably lessened after the stadium was built, as fans grew accustomed to the name and were bolstered by Reebok's status as a local company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Antrobus |url=http://www.footballfancast.com/premiership/should-football-fans-really-be-so-fearful-of-such-deals |title=Should football fans really be so fearful of such deals? |publisher=FootballFanCast.com |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macron title was applied in July 2014 after the Bolton Wanderers club finalised a partnership with the large Italian sportswear brand. In April 2014, club chairman Phil Gartside stated that he was "proud" to be associated with Macron and had "been very impressed with their [Macron's] passion for football". A four-year duration was negotiated for the Macron deal and the club had the option to extend at completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bolton to change stadium name to Macron Stadium – but where does it rank in the worst arena names?|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/boltons-reebok-stadium-name-change-3450046|accessdate=6 August 2014|work=The Daily Mirror|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the deal with Macron came to an end in August 2018 the stadium was again renamed, this time as the University of Bolton Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/2018/august/welcome-to-the-university-of-bolton-stadium/ |title=Welcome to the University of Bolton Stadium|publisher=bwfc.co.uk |date=1 August 2018 |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport, originally known as Rock-It-Ball, is a ball sport which originated from the UK. It evolved in [[North Yorkshire]] ([[Great Britain]]) and was officially launched at the [[Youth Sport Trust]]'s Sports Colleges Conference in February 2006.

Rock-It-Ball spread through schools in the UK. It featured on four of the Youth Sport Trust’s programmes, began to be played regularly in 17 countries,&lt;ref&gt;Government Business (2010): Rock-It-Ball - the Fastest Growing Sport in the World. ''Government Business''. Volume 17, Number 8. pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; and saw the establishment of an international federation and eleven national governing bodies&lt;ref&gt;Nieć P. (2011): ''Rock-It-Ball - Gra Zespołowa z Elementami Edukacji Olimpijskiej''. Unpublished Dissertation, Poznan University, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time the international administrative body had taken the original game and further developed and extended it, setting up a full sports infrastructure. In 2012, in order to cater for the international growth, the sport was rebranded by the international community to VX.  All the clubs and NGBs followed suit and now all leagues, tournaments and international competitions are under the VX banner.

In August 2017 VX gained international recognition as a sport at the General Assembly of the Sport Recognised Association.

==Rules==
VX is played by two teams of five players.  The court is roughly the size of a sports hall with four badminton courts.  In the USA, basketball courts are used.  Each player uses a VstiX.  This is made up of a control bar and a thrower/catcher at each end.  Players are not restricted to a certain area but can go anywhere on court.  They must dribble by rock-ing the ball between the two ends, or by using one end of the VstiX to bounce the ball on the floor. Five balls are in play.  One point is scored by hitting an opponent with the ball between the shoulders and the feet. Three points are scored by catching an opponent's thrown ball.  When a player is hit (s)he must stand still, raise a hand and look to the referee.  The referee records the point and tells the player to play on. The referee is assisted by two umpires positioned on the opposite side of the court.  The role of the umpires is simply to look for infringements.  All infringements incur a three-point penalty.  Violence results in ejection from the game and disciplinary action.  Examples of infringements are:

* A player fails to acknowledge a strike.
* Fishing (this refers to picking up a ball while waiting to play on after being hit)
* Travelling, i.e. not dribbling.  A player can take two steps and then must dribble.  
* Striking.  A player is not allowed to strike either the ball or another player with the VstiX.
* Illegal bodily contact - for example deliberately barging into an opponent.
* Knocking the ball out of an opponent’s VstiX.
* Swearing

Formal matches consists of four quarters each of which lasts four minutes.

==Versions==
As part of the development of VX, the International Federation introduced Singles (V2), a 1v1v1 (V3) version and Doubles (V4) 	
* V2 is played by two players on a squash court with three balls. This version is possibly the most intense of the official versions. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bushell|first=Mike|title=Bushell's Best Bits|year=2013|publisher=John Blake|location=London|isbn=978-1-78219-012-7|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* V3 is also a singles version played on a squash court, however it is played by three players using four balls.  V3 is played on the basis of ‘every man for himself.’ The winner is the player who concedes the least number of points. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.
* V4 is also played on a squash court and is played 2v2 with four balls. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.&lt;ref&gt;''Skizzy'' 2013 television programme, Uganda TV, Kampala February&lt;/ref&gt;	 
	
The new versions were created by the International Federation to develop the sport and provide individuals with an opportunity to set up clubs more easily.

==Federation==
The International Federation was established in December 2006 but changed its name to Global VX when the sport was rebranded in 2012. Global VX administers the sport on a global basis, assists with the establishment and running of NGBs &lt;ref&gt;VX: Spreading Like Bushfire (2014, Jan 1)''New Vision'' p37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Game On'' 2012 television programme, Urban TV, Kampala December 27&lt;/ref&gt; and organises international competition.  Global VX also runs the annual rules committee which takes place every January.

Global VX also has an awards programme.  The annual 'Executive' Awards recognise the work of volunteers in the sport.  'The Person of the Year' Award is awarded to an outstanding volunteer who has done exceptional work to promote and develop the sport.  The 'Person of the Year' and the Executive Awards are announced annually on Dec 31st

'''2010:''' Person of the Year: Conrad Broughton (England) &lt;br /&gt;
'''2011:''' Person of the Year: Matti Chasan Bergstein (Denmark) &lt;br /&gt;
'''2012:''' The first Person of the Year since the sport was rebranded: VX Uganda.  Unusually, the award did not go to one individual but was presented to VX Uganda as a body to recognise the work and effort that had been made by several people to grow the sport in Africa &lt;br /&gt;
'''2013:''' Person of the Year: Eric Clark (Ripon Lions) &amp; John Sheepy (Boroughbridge Lions) &lt;br /&gt;
'''2014:''' Person of the Year: Tony Notarianni (USA)&lt;br /&gt;
'''2015:''' Person of the Year: Dr Suman Shankar Tiwari (India) &lt;br /&gt;
'''2016:''' Person of the Year: Matty Horsfield (England) &lt;br /&gt;


==Hall of Fame==
Any member affiliated to Global VX (e.g. player, coach, administrator) can nominate any other affiliated member who they consider to have made an outstanding contribution to the sport. Any nominee with three nominations passes to the next stage for voting by the committee. The Hall of Fame Awards generally takes place every two years. In 2010 the voting committee felt unable to differentiate between the 3 nominees who reached the voting stage and so, as an exception, voted to induct all three.
In 2008 the founders of the original sport (Paul Hildreth, Paul Law, Bob Eldridge) were honoured by inducting them into the newly established Hall of Fame. 
*2008: Tom Hildreth, Craig Buttery
*2010: Carl Alsop, Graeme Wood, Ian Crosby
*2015: Helen Mackenzie, James Hasindihe

==Legends==
The 'Legends' Award and Gallery is reserved for players who have reached an outstanding level of achievement. This award was instigated in 2012 as a direct result of the achievements of Scotland's Scott MacMichael and is not intended to be an annual honour.
*2012: Scott MacMichael (Scotland)
*2013: Tom Hildreth (England)

The '''World Amateur Go Championship''' ('''WAGC''') is an [[international]] tournament for amateur [[Go (game)|Go]] players, held once a year since 1979. The organising body is the [[International Go Federation]] (IGF).

Each participating country sends one player, although in the beginning of the contest there were multiple players from the stronger Go Countries (e.g. [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]]); in 2007 there were 68 participants.

Some of the participants have gone on to become top [[Go professional]]s.
