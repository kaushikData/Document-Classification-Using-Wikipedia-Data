      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3323">'''Adolph Matz''' (April 25, 1905 – October 1, 1986) was a German/American organizational theorist, and Professor of Accounting at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], known for his work on [[cost accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;Pong, Chris, and Falconer Mitchell. "Full costing versus variable costing: Does the choice still matter? An empirical exploration of UK manufacturing companies 1988–2002." ''The British Accounting Review'' 38.2 (2006): 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Matz was born in [[Karlsruhe]]&lt;ref name="MJO 2005"&gt;Michael-Jörg Oesterle et al. ''Internationalisierung und Institution'' Springer-Verlag, 2005. p. 454&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Heidelberg]],&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Brockhoff (2012) ''Betriebswirtschaftslehre in Wissenschaft und Geschichte: Eine Skizze.'' p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Germany and started his studies in Weimar Republic. In the early 1930s he came to the United States, and obtained the American citizenship in 1933. He obtained his BA in 1932 at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], where he also obtained his MA in 1933 and his PhD in 1937. He started his academic career at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], and became Professor of Accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mantel (2009). ''Betriebswirtschaftslehre und Nationalsozialismus.'' p. 773&lt;/ref&gt;

Matz is noted for his 1946 prediction, that "completion of the first all-electronic general-purpose computing machine [would open] the future to the development of business machines heretofore undreamed of... and may well also revolutionize methods and systems of dealing with everyday business transactions." These ideas were however dismissed as "too ephemeral," and his article initially rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Dilys Winegrad.

'''Alfonso Fanjul Sr.''' (30 September 1909 &amp;ndash; 16 October 1980) was a Cuban-born American sugar baron.

==Early life==
Alfonso Fanjul was born in [[Havana]], Cuba.&lt;ref name="PBCHO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfonso Fanjul Sr.|url=http://www.pbchistoryonline.org/page/alfonso-fanjul-sr|website=Palm Beach County History Online|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two brothers.&lt;ref name="palmbeachpostobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones Poit|first1=Katrina|title=Sugar Magnate Alfonso Fanjul Dead At 71|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/135020587/|accessdate=August 9, 2017|work=The Palm Beach Post|date=October 17, 1980|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Catholic University of America]] (CUA) in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="PBCHO"/&gt;

}}'''Alfred George Gardyne de Chastelain''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1906–1974) was a British-Canadian businessman, soldier, and [[Espionage|secret agent]], noted for his actions during [[World War II]]. He was the father of [[Canadians|Canadian]] General [[John de Chastelain]].

== Early life and stay in Romania ==
[[File:Mr and Mrs de Chastelain.tif|thumb|left|Mr and Mrs de Chastelain in 1945]]
Born in [[London]] in February 1906, of [[Anglo-Scottish]] parents and of [[Huguenot]] background, he was educated in [[Scotland]] and the [[University of London]], from which he received a First Class degree in [[Engineering]]. On graduation, he moved to [[Romania]] and worked for Unirea (a [[BP|British Petroleum]] branch) in [[Bucharest]], rising to a managerial position towards the end of the 1930s. While in Bucharest, he married [[Marion Elizabeth Walsh]], the daughter of Jack Walsh, an [[United States|American]] accountant with [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] in Romania.

==Wartime activities with the SOE ==
On the outbreak of war with [[Nazi Germany]], de Chastelain was commissioned into the [[Artists' Rifles]] and became a member of [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), with which organisation he conducted [[sabotage]] operations in the [[Balkans]] and served in the [[North African campaign]].

In late 1943, with the rank of [[Lieutenant-Colonel]], he led a team of two other SOE members ([[Ivor Porter]] and [[Silviu Meţianu]]) by [[Paratrooper|parachute]] into Romania ([[Operation Autonomous]]), to test the possibility of the country's surrender to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] was losing battles on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''). Captured by the [[Jandarmeria Română|Romanian Gendarmerie]] soon after their landing near [[Plosca]], [[Teleorman County]], he and his team were taken into custody as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and held in a Bucharest apartment.&lt;ref name="Duţu ''et al.''"&gt;Duţu ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

They were all released in August 1944, when ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]] was overthrown and [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael of Romania|Michael I]] assumed full powers (''see [[King Michael Coup]]'').&lt;ref name="Duţu ''et al.''"/&gt; Decorated, de Chastelain was demobilised after the war, joining a unit of the [[Special Air Service]] in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]].

==Life in the post-war era==
After the start of the [[Cold War]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities alleged that he was keeping contacts with [[Iuliu Maniu]], the leader of the [[National Peasants' Party]]; the latter had opposed both Antonescu's regime and the [[Soviet occupation of Romania]]. During [[Tămădău Affair|Maniu's trial for treason]] (1947), the [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]], [[Teohari Georgescu]], was handed a report which indicated Maniu's alleged contacts with de Chastelain as proof that the politician was a British spy.&lt;ref&gt;Pokivailova &amp; Chiper, p.48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside a group of partners, de Chastelain started [[Griffin Enterprises]] (1945), a business centered in London and [[Kent]], dealing in [[film processing]], import and exports and other activities. In 1954, he left that business to accept a post as Vice-President of the Canadian branch of an American oilwell drilling and services company, [[H. J. Eastman]], in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].  Living for several years in Canada and then in [[Australia]], he returned to Canada in the early 1970s and died in Calgary at the age of 68.

A book giving an account of the SOE Operation in Romania was written by one member of the team, [[Ivor Porter]], later a British [[Ambassador]] (''Operation Autonomous: With SOE in Wartime Rumania'', [[Chatto and Windus]], 1989).

He was a founding member of the [[Special Forces Club]] in [[Knightsbridge]], and of the [[Food and Wine Society]] in Calgary.

{{Wiktionary|listenership|readership|viewership}}

'''Audience measurement''' measures how many people are in an [[audience]], usually in relation to [[radio]] '''listenership''' and [[television]] '''viewership''', but also in relation to [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] '''readership''' and, increasingly, [[web traffic]] on [[website]]s. Sometimes, the term is used as pertaining to practices which help [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] and [[advertising|advertisers]] determine ''who'' is listening rather than just ''how many'' people are listening. In some parts of the world, the resulting relative numbers are referred to as '''audience share''', while in other places the broader term [[market share]] is used. This broader meaning is also called '''audience research'''.

Measurements are broken down by [[media market]], which for the most part corresponds to [[metropolitan area]]s, both large and small.

==Methods==

===Diaries===
The [[diary]] was one of the first methods of recording information.  However, this is prone to [[Error|mistakes]] and [[forgetting|forgetfulness]], as well as [[subjectivity]].  Data is also collected down to the level of listener opinion of individual songs, cross referenced against their age, race, and economic status in listening sessions sponsored by oldies and mix formatted stations. [[Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics|IBOPE]] was the first realtime service for audience measurement of the world, it started in [[São Paulo]] in 1942.

The audience measurement of [[U.S. television]] has relied on sampling to obtain estimated audience sizes in which advertisers determine the value of such acquisitions.  According to The Television Will Be Revolutionized, [[Amanda D. Lotz]] states that during the 1960s and 1970s, Nielsen introduced the Storage Instantaneous Audimeter, a device that daily sent viewing information to the company's computers using phone lines and made national daily ratings available by 1973.  Although the audimeters did not supply sufficient information regarding [[demographics]] of the audience, it did however allow Nielsen to establish diary reports that presented some insight on the audience.  According to Lotz, the Nielsen sample included approximately 1,700 audimeter homes and a rotating panel of approximately 850 diary respondents.  Nielsen was the controlling factor of audience measurement for national network television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotz|first=Amanda|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|year=2007|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, networks cried foul, blaming Nielsen for inaccurate rating measurements. This public attention was just the beginning, as Nielsen implemented its automated Local [[People Meter]] (LPM) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Napoli|first=Philip M.|title=Audience Economics: Media Institutions and the Audience Marketplace|year=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LPM marked the shift from active, diary based local measurement to more passive, meter-monitored measurement of local markets. Technologically, the LPM is very similar to the original Nielsen People Meter. The key advancement was that the LPM provided accurate measurements of particular local markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2009/people-meter-technology-brings-miami-more-accurate-ratings.html|title=People Meter Technology Brings Miami More Accurate Ratings|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170800/http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2009/people-meter-technology-brings-miami-more-accurate-ratings.html|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silcock|first1=B.

Researchers believed that the LPM more accurately reported the full range of programming viewers watched, including that while channel-surfing. [[Arbitron]]'s [[Portable People Meter]] uses a [[microphone]] to pick up and record [[subaudible tone]]s embedded in broadcasts by an [[encoder]] at each station or [[broadcast network|network]].  It has even been used to track in-store [[radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.northwestern.edu/webster/pubs/Webster%20%282008%29%20People-Meter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312214806/http://www.soc.northwestern.edu/webster/pubs/Webster%20(2008)%20People-Meter.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the digital terrestrial television (DTT) around the world brings new problems to the television audience measurement process. In a multisignal context, with the emergence of new contents and squarely in front of the contemporary technological convergence, the correct representation of the viewing behaviors faces methodological challenges. New methodologies (Audio or Video Matching, Water Marketing) are needed in order to measure the digital television audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buzeta|first1=Cristian|last2=Moyano|first2=Patricio|url=http://cuadernos.info/index.php/CDI/article/view/503/pdf_1|title=The Television Audience Measurement in the Digital Age|year=2013|issue=33|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213090326/http://cuadernos.info/index.php/CDI/article/view/503/pdf_1|archivedate=2017-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The measurement using audimeters enters a new era, facing the dual challenge of analog and digital measurement in a mixed television broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Portilla|first1=Idoia|url=http://www.tripodos.com/index.php/Facultat_Comunicacio_Blanquerna/article/viewFile/243/201|title=Television Audience Measurement: Proposals of the Industry in the Era of Digitalization|year=2015|issue=36|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213003807/http://www.tripodos.com/index.php/Facultat_Comunicacio_Blanquerna/article/viewFile/243/201|archivedate=2017-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the internet, many businesses are no longer constrained to establishing sales to just their local markets, but alternatively can serve customers across much larger territories. The arising development of [[market (economics)|markets]] boosts the likelihood of offering low-occurrence [[niche market|niche]] items that would go through challenges in order to encounter the ideal customers in a specific area of markets. In his Journal of Advertising Research, author [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] remarks: "for some internet-based businesses, locality no longer regulates the market."
When [[consumers]] obtain access to a greater range of choices, they gravitate toward exercising those choices, awarding fewer of their "votes" to the big hits and more of their "votes" to specialized niche choices. Anderson argues that people always wanted more choices, but their desires previously were obscured by distributional bottlenecks imposed by cost or locality.

===Software===
New digital technologies initially complicated in-home measurement systems. The [[digital video recorder|DVR]], for example, initially seemed incompatible with a Nielsen box, which was designed to register the frequency of the television signal in order to measure the channel being viewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/10/18/fall-tv-2012-dvr-ratings-increases/|title=Why DVR Ratings Increases Matter, and Why They Don’t – TVLine|work=TVLine|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017201935/http://tvline.com/2012/10/18/fall-tv-2012-dvr-ratings-increases/|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a DVR always produces the same frequency, an A/P or active/passive meter could be developed to read audio tracks of a particular program rather than the frequency of the television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tngresearch.com/old_articles/active_passive.htm|title=Dave Zornow Articles: Nielsen's Active/Passive Digital Meter|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316165448/http://www.tngresearch.com/old_articles/active_passive.htm|archivedate=2014-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another challenge to the industry was consumers' turning to [[digital cable]], the [[internet]] and devices other than their television sets to view entertainment content. As new ways of measurement were becoming readily available and people could easily be tracked and monitored for content and use, the industry worried that traditional sampling techniques might become obsolete. Furthermore, the increasing fragmentation of viewing across different technologies posed difficulties in reporting actual viewer numbers for a content piece. In 2010 Nielsen began rolling out its "anytime anywhere media measurement" initiative, which includes DVR views in the television figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Straubhaar|first1=Joseph|last2=LaRose|first2=Robert|last3=Davenport|first3=Lucinda|title=Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Stamford, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed “GTAM,” which stands for Global Television Audience Metering, is based on the development of new audience metering technologies aimed at dealing with all of the conceivable challenges involved in measuring the video viewing behavior of contemporary consumer households across multiple platforms (TV, Internet, mobile devices). Existing A/P meters will be replaced by so-called GTAM meters which are expected to utilize a combination of active and passive measurement technologies. However, unlike A/P meters, they will not require a physical connection to any media devices to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/174443/nielsen-unveiling-suite-of-next-generation-tv-mete.html|title=Nielsen Unveiling Suite Of Next-Generation TV Meters: Designed To Enhance Compliance, Cross-Platform Measurement Too|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017060812/http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/174443/nielsen-unveiling-suite-of-next-generation-tv-mete.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New media==
Nielsen//NetRatings measures [[Internet]] and [[digital media]] audiences through a telephone and Internet survey. Nielsen BuzzMetrics measures [[user-generated content|consumer-generated media]]. Other companies collecting information on internet usage include [[comScore]], [[Wakoopa]], and [[Hitwise]], who measure hits on internet pages. Companies like Visible Measures focus on measuring specific types of media; in the case of Visible Measures, they measure online video consumption and distribution across all video advertising and content. [[GfK]] offers Cross Media Measurement Solutions that allows to attribute offline sales to media exposure across TV, Internet and Mobile utilizing its proprietary LEOtrace technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mrs.org.uk/article/item/356|title=Awards case study:The GfK NOP Media Efficiency Panel|publisher=The Market Research Society|accessdate=9 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328185554/http://www.mrs.org.uk/article/item/356|archivedate=28 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sightcorp, TruMedia, Quividi, relEYEble, stickyPiXEL, Cognitec, goCount and [[CognoVision]] provide real-time audience data including size, [[attention span]] and [[demographics]] by using [[video analytics]] technology to automatically detect, track and classify viewers watching [[display device|digital displays]]. Networked Insights measures online audiences, and released [http://www.socialsights.com/post/56628872/measuring-the-social-tv a report] ranking [[television shows]], based on people's interactions within social media. The study showed that half of the shows on Networked Insights' top 10 list did not appear on the [[Nielsen Media Research]] (NMR) list.

According to "The Television Will Be Revolutionized" by Amanda D. Lotz, one of the most challenging aspects of audience measurement during the multi-channel transition resulted from the intermediary nature of new technologies and distribution systems. The sampling techniques that most audience research relied upon were based on a fairly uniform nationwide availability of technologies and programming, and thus reflected a network-era experience with television. The arrival of varied programming tiers of cable channels challenged the system as US television homes began having highly descriptive access to technology and programming and consequently began using television in significantly different ways. Although the A/P meter solved the problem of DVR use, programming on video on demand systems did not include the "audio watermark" used by the device. The nation's many cable providers also limited access to the proprietary data recorded by their set top boxes, which reduced the informational gain offered by this technology. Video on demand desperately needed to establish measurement matrices to prove its economic viability, but the lack of shared and consistent information further confounded knowledge about use. Likewise, the erosion of the thirty- second advertisement's dominance and the new advertising strategies that became increasingly common required the creation of new methods and matrices to determine value and pricing.

The goal of these leading providers in automated audience measurement solutions is to deliver results to inquiries such as: The nature of the audience, the number of viewers, the content viewed, the amount of time spent on viewing, the type of display utilized and the audience interest in those displays. In "The Television Will be Revolutionized", Amanda Lotz clearly indicates how technological development in the audience measurement practice provides a multitude of technological advancements such as the DVR, Video-On-Demand portable devices such as the iPod and even a boost in mobile phone proficiencies. These improvements comply with television viewing not to be restrained to be "home-watched". Internet measurement is taken to the next level through its sophistication and high tech distribution. This allows several audiences measurement companies to refer to the Internet as the most measurable media.

==Demographics==
{{expand section|date=April 2011}}

The [[demographic]] of a particular show's audience is also measured. This is often notated in an abbreviated form,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcuniversal.presscentre.com/content/detail.aspx?newsareaid=2&amp;releaseid=1827 NBC Universal Press release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923112949/http://www.nbcuniversal.presscentre.com/content/detail.aspx?newsareaid=2&amp;releaseid=1827 |date=September 23, 2010 }}, accessed 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g.:

* P2+    = Persons aged 2 or more
* P12–34 = Persons aged 12 to 34
* P18–49 = Persons aged 18 to 49
* A18–34 = Adults aged 18 to 34
* Men 18–34
* Women 18–34

==Ratings point==

Ratings point is a measure of viewership of a particular [[television programme]].

One single [[television]] ratings point (Rtg or TVR) represents 1% of television households in the surveyed area in a given minute. As of 2004, there are an estimated 109.6 million television households in the [[United States]]. Thus, a single national ratings point represents 1%, or 1,096,000 television households for the 2004–05 season. When used for the broadcast of a program, the average rating across the duration of the show is typically given. Ratings points are often used for specific demographics rather than just households. For example, a ratings point among the key 18- to 49-year-olds demographic is equivalent to 1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds in the country.

A Rtg/TVR is different from a share point in that it is the percentage of all possible households, while a share point is 1% of all households watching television at the time. Hence the share of a broadcast is often significantly higher than the rating, especially at times when overall TV viewing is low. A low TRP can have an adverse effect on a TV program eventually leading to its closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://tech-bie.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-is-television-rating-point-trp.html |title=What is Television Rating Point TRP ? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830142418/http://tech-bie.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-is-television-rating-point-trp.html |archivedate=2011-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GRPs/TRPs===
[[Gross rating point]]s (GRPs) or [[target rating point]]s (TRPs) are chiefly used to measure the performance of TV-based advertising campaigns, and are the sum of the TVRs of each commercial spot within the campaign. An ad campaign might require a certain number of GRPs among a particular demographic across the duration of the campaign. The GRP of a campaign is equal to the percentage of people who saw, multiplied by the average number of spots that these viewers saw.  Targeted Rating Points are a refinement of GRPs to express the reach time frequency of only the most likely prospects. For example, if a campaign buys 150 GRPs for a television spot, but only half of that audience is actually in the market for the campaign's product, then the TRP would be stated as 75 to calculate the net effective buy [https://web.archive.org/web/20090611172153/http://forum.researchinfo.com/showthread.php?t=1217].

Gross rating point, a standard measure in advertising, it measures advertising impact. It is a percent of the target market reached multiplied by the exposure frequency. Thus, a program which advertises to 30% of the target market and gives them 4 exposures, will have 120 GRP.

GRPs as a measure has some limitations. People like to think of it as a measure of impact, but that is really overstated. Impact should measure sales; this measures exposures, which is in fact assumed not actual exposures.

* Basics of TAM (television advertising measurement):

'''Universe''': Universe is the total or actual number of people in a defined target audience.

'''Reach''': Reach is the number of individuals from the universe who are exposed to the medium or vehicle.

Reach is normally expressed in terms of % (percentages)

* Calculation of reach:

If universe is: 1,000,000 individuals (this is approx. data, it is usually defined through sampling through people-meter):

For a single episode of a program (30 minutes or 1 hour)
If out of above 1,000,000 of individuals 600,000 saw at least 1 minute of programme then:

Reach = (600,000/1,000,000) x 100

Reach = 60%

Variations of the reach concept:

;'''Gross reach''':
Gross reach is the summation of all audiences who have been exposed to the vehicle.
* Week 1: 1,000
* Week 2: 2,000
* Week 3: 1,500
* Week 4: 1,200
* Hence, gross reach = Week 1 + Week 2 + Week 3 + Week 4
* Gross reach = 5,700

;'''Cumulative reach'''

{{disputed-section|date=January 2017}}
Cumulative reach: The audiences accumulate over the time
* The number of individuals within the TG who are exposed to the medium or vehicle over a certain period of time
* Total time = Total average minutes (universe) x Universe
* Total time/reach = Avg minutes viewers
* Net reach

;'''Net reach''': Net reach is the summation of all audiences who have been exposed to the vehicle and excludes the duplication of the viewership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moyano|first=Patricio|author2=Muñoz, Orlando|author3=Selman, Elias|title=Estimation method for media audience duplication|journal=ESOMAR Worldwide Audience Measurement Cross Media/Television Conference|date=2005|url=http://www.ibope.com.br/pt-br/conhecimento/artigospapers/Documents/05%20-%20Estimation%20method%20for%20media%20audience%20duplication%20-%20IBOPE%20Time%20Chile.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424120029/http://www.ibope.com.br/pt-br/conhecimento/artigospapers/Documents/05%20-%20Estimation%20method%20for%20media%20audience%20duplication%20-%20IBOPE%20Time%20Chile.pdf|archivedate=24 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is a '''TVR''' (television rating point):
TVR = Reach x Time spent

TVR = (minutes viewed/minutes available) + (minutes viewed / minutes available) /N  X100

N = Number of individuals

* '''Gross rating points''' (GRPs)
The sum of all ratings achieved in a campaign
GRP levels are generally measured and reported on a 4-week basis
It is a measure of the media plan's trust

* '''CPRP'''
Measurement used in planning a television media buy based on the cost of a commercial time slot and the rating of the program where the time slot is positioned. If, for example, the cost of a commercial time slot during prime time was 1000 and the program rating for that time was 10 (which means that 10% of the total potential audience was tuned to that program), then the cost per GRP would be 1000 divided by 10%, or 100. The CPRP measurement is a way of measuring the efficiency of media cost, as compared to measuring the cost per thousand (CPT) and is generally used when making comparisons of the various broadcast vehicles. When the actual buy is made, the advertiser will still want to know the cost of reaching people on a cost-per-thousand basis.

==Terminology==
The ratings industry breaks their statistics down in several ways, to express different measurements:

;Share
:The Share is the percentage of radio listeners tuned into a given station at a given time. For example – a "1.4 Share" means that 1.4% of all people listening to the radio at a specified time are tuned into the specified station or program.

;Rating
:Rating is the percentage of potential audience members – whether tuned into any program or not – who are tuned into a particular program or station at a given time.

;Cume
:Cume or Cumulative Audience is the number of unique people tuned into a program or station at a given time. Cume is usually expressed as the estimated number of listeners in any given quarter-hour.

;Average Quarter Hour (AQH)
{{Main|AQH Share}}
:The AQH figure is the average number of audience members during a typical quarter-hour (measured as quarters of the hour from :00 to :15, :15 to :30, :30 to :45, and :45 after the hour to the top of the hour, respectively.

;Time Spent Listening (TSL)
:The amount of time an average listener spends listening to the station or program before [[channel surfing]]. This measurement drives both the frequency of [[radio commercial]] breaks, as well as the station's programming strategy.  Stations whose [[radio format]]s tend to have short TSLs (music stations) as well as dayparts (see below) with short TSLs (morning drive time, for example) will have more frequent commercial breaks; formats and times with longer TSLs will schedule breaks less frequently.

===Demographics===
All of the other ratings are broken down by [[demographics]]. Stations that might have weak overall ("12+") demographics may have strong enough ratings within a given, desired "demographic" to be attractive to advertisers, and thus profitable.

For example, [[talk radio]] stations frequently have lower-than-average "12+" ratings, but much higher numbers among males age 35-54.  Since the 35-54 male demographic is highly coveted by advertisers, such a station can be quite profitable.

===Dayparts===
{{Main|Dayparting|Broadcast programming}}

In addition to demographics, a key breakdown in ratings is the "Daypart", or segment of the broadcast day.

In radio (and to a lesser extent television), the key dayparts are:
* Morning Drive: characterized by short TSLs (the time a person spends in their car) and, for the well-programmed station, high cumes, Morning Drive (usually from 5AM to around 9AM) is a key revenue generator.
* Mid-Mornings, Mid-Days: With lower listenership (measured by lower average quarter hours) but generally longer TSLs, the middle of the day is a place where stations frequently experiment with longer music, television programming, and longer [[television commercial]] sets.
* Afternoon Drive: Again, high listenership but short TSL, combined with a more-tired listenership that is driving home from work, combines to make afternoon drive time (usually from 3PM to 7PM) a time of short sweeps and, in talk radio, brief conversational snips.
* Evenings and Overnights: Lower listenership means lower revenues – but a standout program frequently can draw a niche audience that, if it shows up in the ratings book, can mean solid revenue.

==Criticisms==

There have been many criticisms of audience measurement. These criticisms tend to refer to methodological problems, sampling issues and reporting issues.

A major issue for media owners and advertisers is that the standard audience surveys only collect data on audience size and basic demographic composition. Audience quality is inferred from the demographic profile of an audience. However, current metrics fail to capture audience engagement. Increasingly advertisers are demanding better measures of media engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, pp 123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, audience research methods generally were thrown into question with the arrival of [[new media]], especially digital media and changes to the public's media habits. [[People meter]]s, which recorded the household's viewing by noting the station to which a TV was tuned, failed to capture new viewing habits such as recording programs for playback at a later time or watching a [[podcast]] / download on another device such as a tablet or computer. The proliferation of new media has given consumers much greater control over where and when they access content. For instance, [[Video on Demand]] (VoD) enables consumers to decide ''when'' to watch programs while [[smartphone]]s enable consumers to decide ''where'' to access content.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, J., Phalen, P. and Lichty, L., "'Ratings Analysis: Audience Measurement and Analytics,''  New York, Routledge, 2014, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Media research companies have been forced to devise new methologies capable of tracking new and unprecedented viewing habits across a diverse range of different platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue which has presented challenges for media measurement is the consumer habit of ''[[media multitasking|simultaneous]] [[media consumption]]''. Modern audiences are often consuming multiple media at the same time. For example, a teeanger might be plugged into radio via earphones while working on the Internet, where he or she is scanning online newspapers and magazines. Thus the user may be consuming three or more media alternatives at the same time. Media research companies, which historically specialised in a single media such as radio or TV, were poorly equipped to respond to the challenge of simultaneous consumption across multiple platforms. However, media research is slowly devising methods designed to capture simultaneous media consumption habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/news/exclusive-simultaneous-media-rife-study-finds/51148|title=Exclusive: Simultaneous media use rife, new study finds|last=Cuneo|first=A.Z.|date=7 October 2002|work=AdAge|access-date=2018-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105123125/http://adage.com/article/news/exclusive-simultaneous-media-rife-study-finds/51148/|archive-date=2018-01-05|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timing of audience reports is a major issue for both the networks and advertisers. Data collected by people-meters is available on the morning after programs have aired. However, data collected by diary methods requires much more time to collate and analyse. Radio surveys, for example, which are still used for radio ratings in many countries, are normally only available on a quarterly basis. The time lag in reporting fails to provide advertisers with sufficient lead times to take corrective action during a campaign.

Other questions have been raised about diary-based data collection methods. The expectation that diarists participating in the radio sample will accurately record their listening at 15 minute intervals has been challenged by many analysts. Many analysts suspect that diarists only fill in their diaries at the end of each week, or perhaps less often which forces them to recall their radio usage thereby raising concerns about reliability. In addition the diary based method appears to inflate average audience size, because the total audience is captured by recording any person who was listening during a quarter-hour counts as listening for the entire duration, even if the actual time was just for a minute or two.

The process of surveying listeners for their preferences has also been criticised for its lack of flexibility. Listeners complain that modern radio lacks variety and depth but the measurement methods only facilitate further refinement of already minutely programmed formats rather than the overhaul that many listeners are asking for. Radio in the US, is where listeners hear their old favorites rather than are exposed to new music. Data obtained by some audience measurement methods is detailed to individual songs and how they are reacted to by each age, racial, and economic group the station is seeking to attract. This statistical approach leads to highly recognizable songs (such as those from [[the Beatles]]) which score well with a cross-section of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Marc | authorlink = | title = Something in the Air | publisher = Random House | location = | pages = 271–277 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-375-50907-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601081.html|title=The Songs You Want to Hear|author=Fisher, Marc|publisher=The Washington Post|date=January 21, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113094159/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601081.html|archivedate=November 13, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement conferences==
The world's largest audience measurement conference, AM X.0, is presented annually by the [[Advertising Research Foundation]]. Each year, hundreds of attendees from around the world gather to hear a collection of experts speak on [[Social Media]], [[Mobile phone|Mobile]] and [[Multimedia|Cross-Platform]] issues.

==Measurement companies==

In most countries the advertising industry, via its peak [[industry association]]s, endorses a single media research company as the official provider of audience measurement. The methodology used by the official provider then becomes known as the ''industry currency'' in audience measurement. Industry members fund the audience research and share the findings.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, pp 119-120&lt;/ref&gt; In a few countries, where the industry is more fragmented or where there is no clear peak industry association, two or more competing organisations may provide audience measurement services. In such countries, there is said to be no industry currency.

Four basic methods of data collection are used to survey broadcast audiences, namely  interviews, diaries, meters or scanning and modelling. Research companies employ different methodologies depending on where  and  when  media is  used  and  the cost of data collection. All these methods involve  [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] – that is taking a representative sample of the population and recording their media usage which is then extrapolated to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Belfast City Centre''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]].

The city centre was originally centred on the Donegall Street area. Donegall Street is now mainly a business area, but with expanding residential and entertainment development as part of the [[Cathedral Quarter, Belfast|Cathedral Quarter]] scheme - St. Anne's, Belfast's [[Church of Ireland|Anglican]] cathedral is located here. The [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St. Peter's]] is located a little to the west of the city centre.

Two of Belfast's three main newspapers - ''[[Belfast Telegraph|The Belfast Telegraph]]'' and ''[[Irish News|The Irish News]]'' are also located nearby. ''[[The News Letter]]'', which claims to be the oldest continually published [[English language]] daily newspaper still in existence, was originally located in the area at 55 Donegall Street, [[1972 Donegall Street bombing|site of a massive]] [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] [[carbomb]] in March 1972, in which seven people died and 148 were injured.

The city centre is now centred on [[Donegall Square]] (location of the [[Belfast City Hall|City Hall]]), Donegall Place, [[Royal Avenue]], Castle Junction, High Street and surrounding streets and alleys.

==Redevelopment==
[[File:Victoria Square completed.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Victoria Square, Belfast|Victoria Square]] completed in March 2008]]
Over the past decade the city Centre has seen expansive redevelopment. The [[Laganside Corporation|Laganside Development]] includes the landmark [[Waterfront Hall]], [[British Telecommunications|BT]] Tower, [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton Hotel]], [[Odyssey (Belfast)|Odyssey Complex]] and various riverside apartment complexes.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231152/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/gasworks/ Gasworks Business Park] is owned by [[Belfast City Council]] and managed by the Councils Estates Management Unit. The site contains commercial offices, [[call centre]]s, small business units, housing, cafés &amp; restaurants, the [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel]] and an award winning public landscaped park. The Gasworks has been internationally recognised as a key example of [[Brownfield land|brownfield]] regeneration in [[Europe]] and has won numerous awards in relation to all aspects of its development. The initial phase is now almost complete and the City Council are currently preparing a master plan in preparation for the commencement of Phase II development.

[[Victoria Square, Belfast|Victoria Square]] is a commercial, residential and leisure development in Belfast developed and built by [[Multi Development UK]] UK over 6 years. At approx 800,000&amp;nbsp;ft² (75,000m²) and costing £400m it is the biggest and one of the most expensive property developments ever undertaken in Northern Ireland. It opened on March 6, 2008. Its anchor tenant at nearly 200,000&amp;nbsp;ft² (18,581m²) is the largest [[House of Fraser]] that the retailer has opened in the UK (as opposed to taken over).

In March 2006, the government gave the go-ahead for a £300m regeneration of a run-down part of Belfast city centre, in the [[Cathedral Quarter, Belfast|Cathedral Quarter]], which could create up to 2,000 jobs. Plans include a new shopping centre, anchored by a department store. The project will not be completed until 2011. It is estimated that 1,000 people will help build the development and 2,000 will be employed there.

'''William Dawes "Bill" Schulz''' (born August 14, 1975) is an American journalist, writer, and television personality, best known for being on the [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] late-night show ''[[Red Eye (TV series)|Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfield]]''. Schulz is also a freelance writer and a former senior editor of ''[[Stuff Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=Facebook&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bill-Schulz/42340060035#/pages/Bill-Schulz/42340060035?v=info&amp;viewas=0 Information on Bill Schulz retrieved on his Facebook page]&lt;/ref&gt;
Schulz is the host of "Mornin'!!! With Bill Schulz" on [[Compound Media]].

==Early life==
Schulz was born William Dawes Schulz in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]]. He has two brothers, Alfred and Jonathan, and was raised Catholic.&lt;ref name=twit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schulz|first1=Bill|url=https://twitter.com/BillSchulz/status/67354996496281600|website=Twitter|accessdate=29 November 2014|date=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a descendent of [[William Dawes]], who rode with [[Paul Revere]] in the "Midnight Ride" during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/lisadepasquale/2012/05/07/de_pasquales_dozen_with_red_eyes_bill_schulz/page/full|title=De Pasquale's Dozen with Red Eye's Bill Schulz|publisher=townhall.com |date= 2014-05-07|accessdate=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended high school in [[Illinois]] at [[Lake Forest Academy]], and in 1998 received a BA in Print Journalism from [[Emerson College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2273253/bio |title=IMDb page|publisher=IMDb |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red Eye==
From its debut in 2007 until November 2013, Schulz was a regular panelist, writer, and producer on "Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld". Serving as host [[Greg Gutfeld]]'s "repulsive sidekick" who was routinely the target of Gutfeld's running gags, Schulz often looked directly into the camera (even when he was not being talked to) with his signature [[Facial expression|"crazy-eyed look]]," along with frequently [[Gesture|waving]] to the television viewing audience.

'''Calixto R. Catáquiz''' (born December 29, 1948) is the former [[mayor]] of [[San Pedro, Laguna]], [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowlaguna.com/?s=Calixto+R.+Cat%C3%A1quiz&amp;submit=Search|title=San Pedro, Laguna (Population, History, Gov. Officials, Barangays, Industries)|publisher=WowLaguna.com|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a [[businessman]] and [[banker]], and once managed the [[Laguna Lake Development Authority]] from 2001 to 2003.

==Early life and education==
Calixto Catáquiz was born in [[Manila]]. His parents were Rodolfo C. Catáquiz of [[Unisan, Quezon]], and Rosa T. Ramírez of [[San Pedro, Laguna]]. His parents were the pioneers of the ''[[balut (food)|balút]]'' industry in San Pedro. Calex, as his family members and friends call him, grew up in his mother's hometown. He was an only child from an affluent family.
Catáquiz had his elementary education first in San Pedro Central Elementary School (1959–1961), then he transferred to Canossa School of [[Santa Rosa, Laguna]] (1961–1965).
He spent his high school and college days in [[San Beda College]], Manila where he took up Bachelor of Science in Commerce (Management).

==After graduation==
After his studies, Catáquiz assisted his parents in their various businesses. He became the bank manager of Entrepreneur Bank (Rural Bank of Unisan) which his father had founded in the latter's hometown of [[Unisan, Quezon]]. Back in his hometown of San Pedro, he founded the Sampaguita Savings Bank at age 30, but eventually sold Sampaguita Savings Bank to a family from Muntinlupa.

==Political career==
According to Mayor Catáquiz, he never really had any intention at all to run for any public office. He was just prodded by the people of San Pedro, particularly former Mayor José L. Amante, to run against then incumbent Mayor Felicísimo Vierneza during the [[Philippine local election, 1980|30 January 1980 Philippine Elections]]. He lost during his first foray into Philippine politics.

During the [[1986 People Power Revolution]], he led San Pedro's delegation of the Justice for Aquino, Justice for All (JAJA), funding the participants with his own money (for food, transportation, and other protest rally materials). His association with the opposition brought him into a misunderstanding with none other but his parents, who were known close friends of former dictator [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]].

Due to his participation in [[EDSA I|EDSA]], the leaders of the newly installed [[president]] [[Corazon C. Aquino|Corazón C. Aquino]]'s Revolutionary Government appointed him as the Officer In Charge of San Pedro, replacing Vierneza. It was not an easy ascent into power because Mayor Vierneza, like most local chief executives at that time, refused to go down, believing that Aquino's revolutionary government was illegal. Thus, a forced takeover ensued wherein Catáquiz supporters clashed with Vierneza's men.

Mayor Catáquiz served as San Pedro's OIC from 1986 to 1988. During the 1988 Philippine elections, he was elected into office for the first time. He remained in power until 1998.

In 2001, he was seen once again in the second People Power Revolution at EDSA. Upon [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]'s appointment as President of the Philippines, Catáquiz was tasked to head the Laguna Lake Development Authority.

As LLDA General Manager, he was able to make [[Laguna de Bay]] a member of the Living Lakes of the World.

2007 saw him once again as San Pedro's mayor. He was re-elected as mayor on the 2010 elections.

'''Carlos Arturo Ardila Lülle''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkaɾlos aɾˈðila ˈlule}}; born July 4, 1930) is a Colombian entrepreneur and the founder and head of the [[Organización Ardila Lülle]], a major Colombian conglomerate which controls companies such as [[RCN TV]], the [[Postobón|Postobon]] soft drink, and the [[Atlético Nacional]] football team. His net worth is estimated at over $2.7 billion U.S. dollars.

== Biography ==
Carlos Ardila Lülle was born in the city of [[Bucaramanga]], [[Colombia]] on July 4, 1930. At fifteen he completed secondary education at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] run [[Colegio San Pedro Claver]], and moved to [[Medellín]] to study civil engineering at the School of Mines at the [[National University of Colombia]], graduating in 1951.&lt;ref name=lablaa/&gt; He then began work in the soft drink business as a Plant Manager for Gaseosas LUX, entrusted with production and expansion in the city of [[Cali]]. While working there he met his wife, Maria Eugenia Gaviria, a daughter of one of the owners of the company, Antonio Gaviria. With her he had two children, Carlos Julio and Antonio Jose. He also has two daughters, Maria Emma and Maria Eugenia.&lt;ref name=ladycuervo/&gt;

At Gaseosas LUX, he worked on the development and promotion of new flavors, and in 1954 saw great success in the development of a new soft drink flavored with apples. One of the first in the world with that flavor, it is now marketed as their flagship product, Postobon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esseconsultores.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=33 |title= Quién es Carlos Ardila Lulle |work= ESSE Consultores |language= Spanish |year= 2008 |accessdate= December 2, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ardila later said he feels a special affection for this achievement as a contribution to the beverage industry.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The commercial success with Gaseosas LUX allowed them to gradually acquire shares in the company [[Postobón|Postobón, S.A.]], which made a popular drink, Kola Champaña. After uniting the two companies, Ardila then became president of Postobón, S.A. in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.elcolombiano.com/proyectos/serieselcolombiano/textos/empresas_exitosas/postobon.htm |title= Postobón, la Niña Mimada del Industrial Ardila Lulle |first=Francisco J. |last=Arias |work= [[El Colombiano]] |date= July 9, 2007 |language= Spanish |accessdate= December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage he initiated the acquisition of other Colombian soft drink companies over the final decades of the twentieth century, bringing these similar companies under the same management at Postobón. After his commercial success with non-alcoholic beverage companies, he began investing in companies directly related to the raw materials of soda, such as the sugar industry, marking the beginning of his [[Organización Ardila Lülle]] (OAL).&lt;ref name=gutierez/&gt; Ardila next moved into textiles and media, and in 1972 acquired the nationwide radio company Radio Cadena Nacional ([[RCN TV|RCN]]). He acquired the record company Sonolux in 1973, and in 1978, he added a television channel under the RCN platform called RCN TV.&lt;ref name=ladycuervo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ladycuervo.blogspot.com/2007/11/carlos-ardila-lulle-biography.html |title= Carlos Ardila Lulle Biography |first= Leonardo |last= Perdomo |date= July 2007 |accessdate= December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would develop into a prominent premium channel in 1998, and branch off in 2008 with a news channel called [[Nuestra Tele Noticias 24 Horas]] (NTN24).

In 1978, he also acquired textile company [[Coltejer]], which has remained a leader in the textile sector in [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dinero.com/noticias-especial/carlos-ardila-lulle-forjador-empresas/52161.aspx |title= Carlos Ardila Lulle.

Ardila has been distinguished in Colombia by the National Government with the Grand Cross award [[Colombian military decorations|Order of Boyaca]], for services to the  Colombian military, and the Order of Democracy of Simón Bolívar. He was chosen as "The Entrepreneur of the Twentieth Century" by a group of eleven business school deans in Colombia, and has received commendations from King of Spain [[Juan Carlos I]] including honorary Spanish citizenship. He is listed as one of the richest men in Latin America, and has appeared on several occasions in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, with his capital assets estimated at over 1 billion dollars.&lt;ref name=lablaa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/ardila-lulle.htm |title= Carlos Ardila Lulle |work= Biblioteca Luis Angel Arango |language=Spanish |date= January 10, 2007 |accessdate= December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/global/1998/0706/064_01.html |title= The Americas |first= Jay |last= Akasie |date= July 6, 1998 |work= [[Forbes]] |accessdate= December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church Street''' is a short, but heavily travelled, north-south street in [[Lower Manhattan]] in [[New York City]].  Its southern end is at '''Trinity Place''', of which it is a continuation, and its northern end is at [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]].

Trinity Place begins at [[Battery Park|Battery Place]] and runs uptown, passing west of [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]], the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings and [[Zuccotti Park]].  It then forms the southern part of the eastern boundary of the [[World Trade Center site]] before becoming Church Street, which continues as the eastern boundary.  A few blocks before Canal Street, Church Street connects to the southern end of [[Avenue of the Americas]] (Sixth Avenue), with a roadway branching off Church Street. When not obstructed by construction on the [[World Trade Center site]], Trinity Place, Church Street, and Avenue of the Americas form a continuous northbound four-lane through-route from Lower Manhattan to [[Central Park]].

Church Street is named after Trinity Church, a historic [[Gothic architecture|Gothic-style]] parish church on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] at [[Wall Street]], Extended in 1784, Church Street was in existence as early as 1761.  Part of the street was owned by the church, but was given to the city in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite streetbook}}, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity Place is also a namesake of the church, being named so in 1834, prior to which it was known at various times as "Lumber Street" and "Lombard Street".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite streetbook}}, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1869, the south end of the street was at Fulton Street, three blocks north of Trinity Place;&lt;ref&gt;[[:c:File:1865 Dripps Map of New York City - Geographicus - NewYork-dripps-1865.jpg|1865 map]]&lt;/ref&gt; then, over several years, a connection was cut through those blocks, both streets were widened, and Trinity Place was extended south to Morris Street. The work, plagued by delays and, allegedly, corruption, was completed by the end of 1872.&lt;ref&gt;[[:c:File:1873 Dripps Pocket Map of New York City, Brooklyn and Hoboken - Geographicus - NYC-dripps-1873.jpg|1873 map]]; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1869/05/06/79818624.pdf "The Church Street Extension",] ''The New York Times'' (May 6, 1869); [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1870/08/13/79824310.pdf "Church Street Extension",] ''The New York Times'' (August 13, 1870); [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1871/08/19/90533552.pdf "Cholera Seeds",] ''The New York Times'' (August 19, 1871); [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1872/12/15/79204090.pdf "New York and Suburban News.

==Places==
The Church Street Station post office at [[90 Church Street]] serves the [[10048 (ZIP code)|10048 ZIP code]] as well as the surrounding area, and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan below 14th Street|National Register of Historic Places]], as is the Canal Street Station post office at the north end of Church Street. Other notable buildings include the rear of the 1765 [[St. Paul's Chapel]], the residential tower under construction at [[99 Church Street]], and [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, New York|St. Peter's Church]].

Near Rector Street, Trinity Place passes under the Trinity Place bridge. Completed in 1989, the bridge is a private elevated walkway connecting the rear side of Trinity Church to its parish house across Trinity Place.

The [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Eighth south}}) in the [[New York City Subway]] runs below Church Street from Liberty Street to Sixth Avenue. A portion of the [[BMT Broadway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Broadway south}}) runs under Church Street south of [[Vesey Street]].

'''''Duck Dynasty''''' is an American [[reality television]] series on [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] that portrayed the lives of the Robertson family, who became successful from their family-operated business, [[Duck Commander]].

He was a standout quarterback at [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]]&lt;ref name=lthtbpr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/23626584/louisiana-tech-honors-terry-bradshaw-phil-robertson-at-tulane-game|work=CBS Sports|last=Patterson|first=Chris|title=Louisiana Tech honored Terry Bradshaw, Phil Robertson Thursday|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (actually starting ahead of future Hall of Famer [[Terry Bradshaw]]) and was contacted by the [[Washington Redskins]] after his junior year. He chose instead to quit football because it interfered with duck hunting season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/416910/phil-robertson-explains-why-he-turned-down-nfl-for-duck-dynasty|title=Phil Robertson Explains Why He Turned Down NFL For 'Duck Dynasty'|publisher=Inquisitr.com|date=November 29, 2012|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phil graduated from Louisiana Tech with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and later received a Masters of Arts degree in Education via night classes while working as a schoolteacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=hollyandersonsi|url=http://college-football.si.com/2012/03/22/duck-punt-how-phil-robertson-found-stardom-after-giving-up-football|title=Duck Punt: How Phil Robertson found stardom after giving up football|publisher=College-football.si.com|date=March 22, 2012|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil went through a "dark period" while running a bar that led to his separation from his wife. It was at this low point he reports that he found Christ and reconciled with his wife. It was then that he invented his duck call, and founded the Duck Commander Company in 1973.&lt;ref name="duckcommander1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Phil Robertson|url=http://www.duckcommander.com/duckmen/profile/3/phil_robertson.aspx|title=Profile: Phil Robertson|publisher=Duck Commander|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aetv.com/duck-dynasty/meet-family/phil-robertson |title=Phil Robertson&amp;nbsp;– Duck Dynasty Cast |publisher=AEtv.com |accessdate=June 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619135710/http://www.aetv.com/duck-dynasty/meet-family/phil-robertson/ |archivedate=June 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phil is known for his dislike of modern technology, calling himself "a low-tech man in a high-tech world," and his concern that his grandchildren are becoming "[[yuppie]]s". At the end  of each episode, the family is shown at the dining table, usually with Phil praying over the meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker|first=Kyle|title=Duck Dynasty Star: 'They Told Us To Stop Praying To Jesus|url=http://www.ijreview.com/2013/10/85738-duck-dynasty-star-told-us-stop-praying-jesus-wouldnt-offend-muslims|date=October 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215221425/http://www.ijreview.com/2013/10/85738-duck-dynasty-star-told-us-stop-praying-jesus-wouldnt-offend-muslims/|archivedate=February 15, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Editing controversy===
In 2012, [[Phil Robertson]] stated on ''Sports Spectrum'', a Christian sports publication, that he confronted producers about editors of the show telling them not to say Jesus' name while praying at the end of episodes, and that they added intermittent [[bleep censor]]s over random portions of the cast's unscripted dialogue although there was no profanity being spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/duck-dynasty-star-dishes-on-confronting-producers-over-fake-bleeps-cutting-jesus-video|title='Duck Dynasty' Star Reveals Clash With Producers Over Fake Bleeps, Cutting Jesus|type=video|newspaper=The Wrap}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=TV news|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/duck-dynasty-star-reveals-clash-producers-over-fake-224906242.html|title='Duck Dynasty' Star Reveals Clash With Producers Over Fake Bleeps, Cutting Jesus|type=video|publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson cited the issues as part of what is often called "[[spiritual warfare]]", that there was no [[swear word|swearing]] that needed to be edited out, and the prayers were being censored to avoid offending non-Christian religious people. A&amp;E did not comment on the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/467620/duck-dynasty-controversy-phil-robertson-believes-network-edited-the-family-unfairly|title=Duck Dynasty Controversy: Phil Robertson Believes Network Edited the Family Unfairly|publisher=E! Online|place=UK|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''GQ'' interview===
On December 18, 2013, A&amp;E announced that it was suspending [[Phil Robertson]] from the show indefinitely over remarks he made during an interview with [[Drew Magary]] (''[[GQ|GQ Magazine]]'') which had attracted outside criticism.&lt;ref name="InsideTV_Suspension"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=December 18, 2013|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/12/18/duck-dynasty-robertson-phil/?hpt=hp_t2|title='Duck Dynasty' star suspended for anti-gay comments|newspaper=Inside TV|publisher=EW|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the interview for a featured article in ''GQ's'' January 2014 issue, titled {{Anchor|What the Duck?}}''What the Duck?'', Magary asked Robertson: "What, in your mind, is sinful?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Merrigan|first=Tara Wanda|date=December 19, 2013|url=https://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/12/readers-react-to-gqs-duck-dynasty-story-and-phil-robertsons-indefinite-suspension.html|title=Readers React to GQ's 'Duck Dynasty' Story and Phil Robertson's Indefinite Suspension|newspaper=GQ|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson replied: "Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."&lt;ref name="GQprimer pg1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Magary|first=Drew|date=January 2014|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/television/201401/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson|title=What the Duck?|newspaper=GQ|pages=1–3|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Phil Robertson by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|Robertson speaking at [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]] 2015 in Washington, D.C.]]

A&amp;E stated they were "extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in ''GQ'', which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series ''Duck Dynasty''". He said he is a "product of the '60s" but has since lived his life on Biblical principles. He added: "I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Fox News|department=Entertainment|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/12/18/phil-robertson-suspended-after-comments-about-homosexuality|date=December 18, 2013|title='Duck Dynasty' star Phil Robertson suspended by A&amp;E|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Robertson family released a statement about A&amp;E's decision, refusing to do the show without him and supporting Phil by saying that while some of his comments were "coarse," his beliefs are "grounded in the teachings of the Bible."&lt;ref name="officialfamilyresponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duckcommander.com/news/robertson-family-official-statement|publisher=Duckcommander.com|title=The Robertson Family Official Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first public interview since the ''GQ'' interview, Robertson stood by his words and said:

Robertson's remarks were reported in the media, with reactions split. Many [[social conservative]]s, including his corporate sponsors, some religious groups, and some [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians including [[Sarah Palin]], [[Bobby Jindal]] and [[Mike Huckabee]], supported his right to such opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=St. Amand|first=Jason|date=December 19, 2013|url=http://www.edgeboston.com/news/national/News/153328/more_conservatives_show_support_for_’duck_dynasty’_star|title=More Conservatives Show Support for 'Duck Dynasty' Star|newspaper=Edge Boston|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson faced significant opposition from individuals viewing his comments as [[anti-LGBT rhetoric|anti-gay]] and [[bigot]]ed.&lt;ref name="dailymail1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Will|last=Payne|place=West Monroe, LA|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2528043/Duck-Dynasty-family-seen-today.html|title=Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson says he is a lover not a hater|work=DailyMail.co.uk|date=March 21, 2012|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kevin|first=Patrick|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-duck-dynasty-fans-outraged-over-aes-phil-robertson-punishment-20131219,0,4223629.story#axzz2oODoNFX2|title='Duck Dynasty' fans outraged over A&amp;E's Phil Robertson punishment|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, A&amp;E reversed Robertson's suspension. The network cited Robertson's and the family's regret for the use of "coarse language" in discussing body parts,&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-duckdynasty-idUSBRE9BQ0J820131227|title=A&amp;E puts Phil Robertson back on 'Duck Dynasty' after anti-gay flap|date=December 27, 2016|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that A&amp;E would launch a [[public service announcement]] across the channel's "entire portfolio" that would promote "tolerance and acceptance among all people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-duck-dynasty-reverses-phil-robertsons-suspension-20131227,0,4062820.story|work=Chicago Tribune|title=`Duck Dynasty': A&amp;E reverses Phil Robertson's suspension|date=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A [[Human Rights Campaign]] representative saw the reinstatement as a positive step and said they had been assured that "the Robertson family is now open [...] to address the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/27/showbiz/duck-dynasty-resumes "A&amp;E: 'Duck Dynasty' resuming 'with the entire Robertson family'"], CNN.com; accessed August 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

CNN said the controversy showed that a [[culture war]] was at play, in part because of what GLAAD characterized as "offensive depictions of minorities" in public discourse. Republican [[Louisiana]] governor [[Bobby Jindal]] and others, mostly conservatives, noted the issue as a [[First Amendment]] right to [[free speech]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-duck-dynasty-phil-robertson-20131220,0,1685719.story 'Duck Dynasty' star used anti-gay comments in 2010 speech], chicagotribune.com; accessed October 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/12/what-anti-gay-comments-are-too-anti-gay-gop/356369 "What Anti-Gay Comments Are Too Anti-Gay for the GOP?"], thewire.com, December 2013; accessed August 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/conservatives-defend-duck-dynasty-star-phil-robertsons-anti-gay-remarks-1516160 Conservatives Defend 'Duck Dynasty' Star Phil Robertson's Anti-Gay Remarks], ibtimes.com; accessed October 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; while liberals said that the First Amendment did not apply, since the question was not whether he had the right to speak his views, but rather whether sponsors and the network had the right to disassociate themselves from Phil and the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/american-millennial/2013/dec/20/phil-robertson-and-americans-consitutinal-right-fr "Phil Robertson and an American's Constitutional right to free speech"], Washingtontimes.com; accessed August 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other television and media==
The Robertsons appeared on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. Scheduled musical guest [[Morrissey]] canceled because he objected to being on the show with those he called "animal serial killers". The band [[Churchill (band)|Churchill]] filled in for Morrissey. Phil Robertson responded, saying, "Whoever he is, I don't hold it against him." They made a parody video where they sold a carrot call, instead of a duck call, to call wild carrots to jump straight into their mouths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woo|first=Kelly|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/-duck-dynasty--patriarch-s-secret-past-revealed--phil-robertson-turned-down-the-nfl--195603788.html?cache=clear|title='Duck Dynasty' patriarch's secret past revealed: Phil Robertson turned down the NFL!|publisher=Yahoo!|work=TV News|date= February 27, 2013|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Robertsons have appeared on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', ''[[Live! with Kelly and Michael]]'', ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'', ''[[Katie (talk show)|Katie]]'', ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'', and ''[[The 700 Club|700 Club]]''.

'''FirstEnergy Stadium''' is a multi-purpose [[stadium]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], United States, primarily for [[American football]]. It is the home field of the [[Cleveland Browns]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), and serves as a venue for other events such as college and high school football, [[soccer]], and concerts. It opened in 1999 as '''Cleveland Browns Stadium''' and was renovated in two phases in early 2014 and 2015. The initial [[seating capacity]] was listed at 73,200 people, but following the first phase of the renovation project in 2014, seating capacity was reduced to 67,431. Since 2017, capacity is listed at 67,895. The stadium sits on {{convert|31|acre}} of land between [[Lake Erie]] and the [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway]] in the [[North Coast Harbor]] area of [[downtown Cleveland]], adjacent to the [[Great Lakes Science Center]] and [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The site was previously the location of [[Cleveland Stadium]] from 1931 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=2016 Official NFL Record and Fact Book |url=http://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2015/07/21/0ap3000000502939.pdf#page=58 |year=2014 |publisher=[[National Football League]] |page=58 |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us |url=http://firstenergystadium.com/stadium-info/about-us/ |year=2017 |accessdate=July 6, 2017 |publisher=FirstEnergy Stadium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Cleveland Browns relocation controversy}}
FirstEnergy Stadium is located on the site of [[Cleveland Stadium]], commonly called Cleveland Municipal Stadium, a multipurpose facility built in 1931 that served as the Browns' home field from their inception in 1946 through the [[1995 Cleveland Browns season|1995 season]]. During the 1995 season, owner [[Art Modell]] announced his plans to move the team to [[Baltimore]], which resulted in legal action from the city of [[Cleveland]] and Browns season ticket holders. The day after the announcement was made, voters in Cuyahoga County approved an extension of the original 1990 [[sin tax]] on alcohol and tobacco products to fund renovations to Cleveland Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=
PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT : AFC : Tax Measure Passes Easily in Cleveland |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-08/sports/sp-668_1_cleveland-browns |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 8, 1995 |accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, as part of the agreement between Modell, the city of Cleveland, and the NFL, the city agreed to tear down Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site using the sin tax funds. Modell agreed to leave the Browns name, colors, and history in Cleveland and create a new identity for his franchise, eventually becoming the [[Baltimore Ravens]], while the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by 1999 through expansion or relocation of another team. Demolition on the old stadium began in November 1996 and was completed in early 1997. Debris from the former stadium was submerged in [[Lake Erie]] and now serves as an [[artificial reef]].

Ground was broken for the new stadium on May 15, 1997, and it opened in July 1999. The first event was a preseason game between the Browns and the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on August 21, followed the next week by a preseason game against the [[Chicago Bears]].  The first regular-season Browns game at the stadium was played the evening of September 12, 1999, a 43–0 loss to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleveland Browns - 1999 |url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/team/history/year-by-year-results/1999.html |publisher=[[Cleveland Browns]] |year=2015 |accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the stadium has been referred to by some as the "Factory of Sadness", a name that was first coined that year by comedian and Browns fan [[Mike Polk]]. Polk made a video outside the stadium in which he complains about the team's futility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2011/11/cleveland_browns_fans_growing.html | title=Are Cleveland Browns fans at last growing weary of their NFL 'factory of sadness'? | publisher=Cleveland.com | work=The Plain Dealer | date=November 11, 2011 | accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[2017 NFL season|2017 season]], FirstEnergy Stadium is one of two NFL venues that have yet to host a postseason game of any kind, the other being [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], which opened in 2017 and is scheduled to host [[Super Bowl LIII]] in February 2019. The Browns are one of five teams who have yet to host a home playoff game in their respective stadium, along with the [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[San Francisco 49ers]], [[Detroit Lions]], and [[New York Jets]]. The latter three teams, however, have hosted the [[Super Bowl]] at their respective stadiums, while the Jets' home, [[MetLife Stadium]], has also hosted a [[New York Giants]] home playoff game.

==Facility==
[[File:Dawg Pound 2016.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dawg Pound]] in 2016]]
The stadium was designed by [[Populous (company)|Populous]], which was known at the time as the [[HOK Sport|Sport Venue Event Division]] of [[Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum]] (HOK). [[Indianapolis]]-based [[Hunt Construction Group|Huber, Hunt &amp; Nichols]] was the construction manager. The stadium is a concrete and glass structure, using [[precast concrete]] and cast in-place for the upper concourse. Natural stone accents were used at the base of the stadium. The construction of the concrete superstructure took more than 6,000 truckloads of concrete, or the equivalent of {{convert|60000|cuyd|m3}}, with a weight of approximately {{convert|235000000|lbs|kg}}.

The playing surface is a [[Kentucky Bluegrass]] irrigated field, with a sand-soil root zone and an underground heating system that involves nine boilers and 40 miles of underground piping. The heating system prevents the field from freezing and extends the growing season of the turf.&lt;ref name="Browns1" /&gt; Although it was designed for football, the playing surface was built large enough to accommodate international soccer matches.

The eastern seating section is the home of the [[Dawg Pound]], a section of [[bleacher]] seats. It was designed as a successor to the original Dawg Pound at [[Cleveland Stadium]], the bleacher section also located in the east end zone. When FirstEnergy Stadium opened in 1999, the Dawg Pound was a 10,644, double-deck area. During stadium renovations in 2014, the upper level of the Dawg Pound was reduced to make way for a new, larger scoreboard, auxiliary scoreboard, and additional fan areas, and the bleacher seating in the upper level was replaced with chairbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cleveland Browns announce FirstEnergy Stadium renovations are on time and on budget |url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2014/06/sneak_peek_at_firstenergy_stad.html |author=Moore, Glenn |date=June 16, 2014 |newspaper=[[Thye Plain Dealer]] |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renovations===
In 2013, Browns owner [[Jimmy Haslam]] announced a modernization project for FirstEnergy Stadium. The project included two phases that took place during the NFL offseasons in 2014 and 2015. Phase one included improving the audio system, installing new scoreboards three times the size of the original scoreboards and at the time the 4th largest in a NFL stadium, and adding more seats to the lower bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alec Scheiner Outlines FirstEnergy Stadium Renovation|url=http://www.ohio.com/blogs/cleveland-browns/cleveland-browns-1.270107/video-browns-president-alec-scheiner-outlines-firstenergy-stadium-renovation-during-media-tour-1.496420|publisher=Akron Beacon Journal|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phase two included [[Concession (contract)|concession]] improvements, upgrades to technology connectivity, graphics throughout the stadium, and enhancing the premium suites. The renovations reduced the stadium's capacity to approximately 68,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2013/11/cleveland_browns_renovations_f.html |title=Cleveland Browns reveal 2-year FirstEnergy Stadium modernization proposal |date=November 13, 2013 |work=Cleveland.com |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of the renovations was estimated at $120 million with the city of Cleveland paying $30 million over 15 years and the Browns covering the rest of the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cleveland City Council approves financing for upgrades to FirstEnergy Stadium |url=http://www.cleveland.com/cityhall/index.ssf/2013/11/cleveland_city_council_approve_5.html |date=November 25, 2016 |author=Atassi, Leila |work=Cleveland.com |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadium naming===
The city specifically chose not to sell the [[naming rights]] to the stadium itself, which is highly unusual for major American stadiums built in recent years. However, it instead sold the naming rights to each of the facility's four main entrance gates. Originally, the gates were named for [[National City Corp.|National City Bank]], Steris Corp., CoreComm Inc., and the [[Cleveland Clinic]] Sports Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric|last=Mitchell|title=Browns not selling stadium naming rights, but gates are another story|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/1999/07/19990705/No-Topic-Name/Browns-Not-Selling-Stadium-Naming-Rights-But-Gates-Are-Another-Story.aspx|work=[[Sports Business Journal]]|date=July 5, 1999|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement was later discontinued, though has since been partially restored. As of the 2018 season, the southwest gate is not sponsored, while the southeast gate is sponsored by and named for [[University Hospitals of Cleveland]], the northeast gate by [[Cree Inc.]], and the northwest gate by [[Fifth Third Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|title=Cleveland Browns 2016 Stadium Seating Guide |year=2016 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Cleveland Browns]] |accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Browns vs. Bills: Need to Know Game Day Information |url=https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/2018-cleveland-browns-preseason-gameday-information |date=August 16, 2018 |work=ClevelandBrowns.com |publisher=[[Cleveland Browns]] |accessdate=September 10, 2018 |quote=New in 2018, Browns fans will pass through the Fifth Third Bank Gate when entering FirstEnergy Stadium from the northwest corner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is sometimes referred to as the "Factory of Sadness," due to the Browns' recent period of futility.

[[Randy Lerner]] sold the Browns to [[Jimmy Haslam]], CEO of truck stop chain [[Pilot Flying J]], in August 2012.  Before the deal officially closed in October 2012, Haslam announced he would sell the stadium's naming rights. Haslam effectively ruled out his family business as buying the naming rights, mentioning that he had received offers for the naming rights, and that none of them are based in his home state of [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pilot won't buy naming rights for FirstEnergy Stadium |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/sports/football/browns/pilot-wont-buy-naming-rights-for-cleveland-browns-stadium |publisher=Newsnet5.com |accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cspnet.com/news/corporate/articles/update-pilot-flying-js-haslam-buys-cleveland-browns |title=UPDATE: Pilot Flying J's Haslam Buys Cleveland Browns |publisher=Cspnet.com |accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 14, 2013, it was reported that the naming rights were sold to [[FirstEnergy]] Corporation, the [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]-based electric utility serving most of northeastern Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8844636/cleveland-browns-sell-stadium-naming-rights-according-reports |title=Browns to sell stadium naming rights |work=ESPN.com |author=[[Associated Press]] |date=January 14, 2013 |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns announced the following day that the stadium would be renamed "FirstEnergy Stadium, Home of the Cleveland Browns", with the deal getting official [[Cleveland City Council]] approval on February 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Naymik, Mark|date=March 8, 2013|title=Browns owner Jimmy Haslam has spell over football fans and politicians alike |url=http://www.cleveland.com/naymik/index.ssf/2013/03/browns_owner_jimmy_haslam_has.html |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |publisher=Cleveland Live LLC |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |quote=Sweeney let the naming-rights deal pass on Feb. 15...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though naming rights belong to FirstEnergy Corporation through 2029, the stadium itself is actually serviced by [[Cleveland Public Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mike Polensek says utility First Energy will have its name on a stadium powered by the city's electric company |url=http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2013/jan/22/mike-polensek/mike-polensek-says-utility-first-energy-will-have-/ |date=January 22, 2013 |author=Feran, Tom |work=Politifact Ohio |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services===
The stadium does not have public parking facilities. However, there are several adjacent parking facilities: the [[Port of Cleveland|Port Authority]] visitors lot, the West 3rd Street parking lot, and the Great Lakes Science Center parking garage. Additionally, the [[West 3rd (RTA Rapid Transit station)|West 3rd Street station]] of Cleveland's [[Waterfront Line|Waterfront light rail line]] serves the stadium.

==Other events==
[[File:FirstEnergy Stadium soccer.jpg|thumb|left|Lined for soccer in 2016]]
In addition to home games for the Browns, the stadium hosts other events during the year, including [[college football]], [[high school football]], and international soccer, along with occasional concerts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9511">'''Foreign ownership''' or control of a [[business]] or [[natural resource]] in a [[country]] by individuals who are not citizens of that country or by [[company (law)|companies]] whose headquarters outside that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cambridge Business English Dictionary|date=28 Nov 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521122504|ref=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Oct 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, foreign ownership occurs when [[multinational corporation]]s, which do business in more than one country, inject long-term investments in a foreign country, usually in the form of [[foreign direct investment]] or [[procurement|acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chau|first1=Esther|last2=Wu|first2=Jayce|title=Economics HL/SL - Study Guide for the IB Diploma|date=2013|publisher=CANA Academy Limited|isbn=978-9881686824|page=166}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Oct 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

If a multinational corporation acquires at least half of a company, the multinational corporation becomes a [[holding company]], and the company receiving the foreign investment becomes a [[subsidiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/subsidiary?view=uk |title=Definition of subsidiary - Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English) |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |date= |accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, foreign ownership can occur when a domestic property is acquired by a foreign individual. An example is an Indian businessman buying a house in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Royse|first1=Roger|title=Foreign Ownership of U.S. Real Estate|url=http://www.rroyselaw.com/featured_articles_foreignownership-roger_article.html|website=rroyselaw.com|publisher=Royse Law Firm|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
According to the [[US Department of Defense]], the following factors relating to a company, the foreign interest, and the government of the foreign interest are reviewed in the aggregate in determining whether a company is under foreign ownership, control, or Influence:
*The record of economic and government espionage against US targets
*The record of enforcement and/or engagement in unauthorized technology transfer
*Type and sensitivity of the information that is accessed,
*The source, nature, and extent of the foreign ownership
*The record of compliance with pertinent US laws, regulations and contracts
*The nature of any bilateral and multilateral security and information exchange agreements that may be pertinent
*The ownership or control, in whole or in part, by a foreign government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence|url=http://www.dss.mil/isp/foci/foci_info.html|website=Defense Security Service|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
*The transfer of technology and organisational knowledge can lead to higher productivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of Technological Change on Productivity|website=Boundless|publisher=Boundless|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company in the host country can learn from multinational corporations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimsley|first1=Shawn|title=What Is Foreign Direct Investment? - Definition, Advantages &amp; Disadvantages|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/what-is-foreign-direct-investment-definition-advantages-disadvantages.html|website=Education Portal|publisher=Education Portal|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It increases employment and wages. Inward foreign direct investment has an overall positive effect in employment, as companies have more capital to expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign ownership and consequences for British business|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/Evidence%20briefing%20-%20foreign%20ownership_tcm8-13313.pdf|website=Economic &amp; Social Research Council|publisher=Economic &amp; Social Research Council|accessdate=2014-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213045656/http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/Evidence%20briefing%20-%20foreign%20ownership_tcm8-13313.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It lowers prices and improves the quality of products. That is a result of higher productivity, which is beneficial for consumers and the company's competitiveness for exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blink|first1=Jocelyn|last2=Dorton|first2=Ian|title=IB Economics Course Book 2nd edition: Oxford IB Diploma Programme (International Baccalaureate)|date=2012-09-06|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0198390008}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-10-23--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
*Foreign ownership can increase the demand of products, leading to price increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heakal|first1=Reem|title=Economics Basics: Supply and Demand|url=http://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp|website=Investopedia|publisher=Investopedia US|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The increase in productivity in the firms in foreign ownership can cause other domestic companies to become relatively less competitive, which reduces profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chau|first1=Esther|last2=Wu|first2=Jayce|title=Economics HL/SL - Study Guide for the IB Diploma|date=2013|publisher=CANA Academy Limited|isbn=978-9881686824|page=167}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Oct 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Multinational corporations may use their power to influence government policies, especially in underdeveloped countries. That may have an adverse impact on [[economic development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Impact of Direct Foreign Investment on Wages and Working Conditions|url= https://www.oecd.org/investment/mne/40848277.pdf|website=OECD|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A lowering of employment because of operational optimization or an increase by a planned expansion can occur. Wages can be reduced for new employees by new corporate policies, and an optimized employee benefits package can reduce benefits for all. 
*The demise of local economies can be caused by siphoning money from communities to global elites.

==Policies ==
===Indonesia===
The House of Representatives of [[Indonesia]] passed the plantation bill to set stricter rules on foreign ownership in the plantation sector to prioritise smaller local plantation firms. There is no specific percentage value on the limit on foreign ownership, but a 30% foreign ownership ceiling had been demanded by the House's Commission IV.

Plantation business groups as well as the Ministry of Agriculture had previously voiced criticism of the bill, expressing concern that it would negatively impact plantation firms and growers, as foreign investment might be reduced.

Even though the bill was passed to limit foreign ownership, the law encourages cooperation research and development between domestic and foreign businesses, universities and individuals.

A reduction in foreign ownership limit may reduce foreign investment, but it can help boost revenue for domestic firms and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Jarkata Post|title=New plantation law limits foreign ownership|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/09/30/new-plantation-law-limits-foreign-ownership.html|accessdate=2014-10-25|work=The Jakarta Post|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qatar===
As part of financial reforms, Qatar's emir has issued a law, allowing foreign investors to obtain up to 49% of listed Qatari companies for expansion in the stock market and to stimulate development in the financial industry.

Prior to the law, ceilings on listed Qatari firms restricted foreign ownership to 25%.

The reform aims to help attract more foreign investment in the long run. However, according to a wealth manager in the Gulf, "It's a step in the right direction, but it will have to be backed up by good performance from companies in order to attract foreign investment. Also, there should be limited impact from the law in the short term due to liquidity issues and limited numbers of shares available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bakr|first1=Amena|last2=Torchia|first2=Andrew|title=UPDATE 1-Qatar emir issues law raising foreign ownership limits for stocks|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/06/qatar-stocks-ownership-idUSL6N0QC2DO20140806|accessdate=2014-10-24|work=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|date=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
The Russian Duma has passed a law, reducing the foreign ownership ceiling for print publications and radio and television outlets from 50% to 20%; it was passed by with a vote of 430-2. The legislation forbids foreign governments, organisations, companies and individuals from founding or holding more than a 20% stake in Russian media businesses.

According to Vadim Dengin, one of the bill's authors, " the tighter limit on foreign ownership would help protect Russia from western influence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luhn|first1=Alec|title=Russia tightens limit on foreign ownership of media|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/russia-limit-foreign-ownership-media|accessdate=2014-10-25|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, publishers and editors of independent media companies in Russia argued that the new law would further reduce diversity of opinion.

It was spread out over a few months, so it was a very short period of my life. It was something that I tried and quickly decided that I was done with." Eklund went on to say in the interview that he is proud of who he is, that he does not regret anything, and that his past involvement in the pornographic film industry has not negatively affected his career.&lt;ref name=OUT /&gt;

The '''Fremont Hotel &amp; Casino''' is located in downtown [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], on the [[Fremont Street Experience]].  The casino is operated by the [[Boyd Gaming Corporation]].

==History==
The Fremont Hotel is located on 200 [[Fremont Street]].  It was designed by architect [[Wayne McAllister]] and opened on May 18, 1956 as [[List of tallest buildings in Nevada|the tallest building]] in the state of [[Nevada]].  At the time of its opening it had 155 rooms, cost $6 million to open and was owned by [[Ed Levinson]] and Lou Lurie.&lt;ref name=lvs1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/casinosbyname.html|title= Las Vegas Hotels and Casino's|accessdate=2008-11-21 |work= |publisher= University of Nevada|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963 the Hotel was expanded to include the 14 story Ogden tower and one of the city's first vertical parking garages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Las Vegas - A Centennial History |last= |first= |authorlink= |authors= Eugene P. Moehring, Michael S. Green|year= 2005|publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] |location= |isbn= 9780874176155|pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQ7mORxm6TYC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Las+Vegas+By+Eugene+P.+Moehring,+Michael+S.+Green#PPA142,M1|accessdate= 2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Allen Glick's [[Argent Corporation]] purchased the Fremont and in 1976 expanded the casino at a cost of $4 million.&lt;ref name="lvs1"/&gt;  In 1983 Sam Boyd bought the Fremont to add to his Boyd Gaming group properties.&lt;ref name=lvs2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/archdb/archinfo.php?act=2&amp;ent=proj&amp;id=539|title= Fremont Hotel|accessdate=2008-11-21 |work= |publisher= University of Nevada|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fremont Hotel and Casino is one of the casinos and hotels currently located in Downtown Las Vegas that is part of the [[Fremont Street Experience]].  The casino is located on what is commonly referred to as the four corners.  These are the four main hotels that are located on the corner of Casino Center Boulevard and Fremont Street.  The four casinos making up the four corners are The Fremont, the [[Four Queens Casino|Four Queens]], the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]], and [[Binion's|Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel]].  Casino Center Boulevard is the only through street that passes under the canopy of the Fremont Street Experience.  It passes between the Fremont and the Four Queens located on one side of the boulevard and The Golden Nugget and Binions located on the opposite side of the Boulevard.

In 1959&lt;ref name=lvs3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uso.org/whoweare/famousfaces/waynenewton/|title= USO Wayne Newton|accessdate=2008-11-21 |work= |publisher= USO.org|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wayne Newton]] made his start in Las Vegas at the Fremont at its Carnival Lounge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Las Vegas - A Centennial History |author=Eugene P. Moehring |author2=Michael S. Green |year= 2005 |publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] |location= |isbn=0-87417-615-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQ7mORxm6TYC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Las+Vegas+By+Eugene+P.+Moehring,+Michael+S.+Green#PPA142,M1 |accessdate= 2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film history ===
Many scenes from the [[Jon Favreau]] and [[Vince Vaughn]] movie ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'' were filmed inside the Fremont, including their games of blackjack. The casino also appears periodically in the 1992 [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film, ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]''.

'''Frist Campus Center''' is a focal point of social life at [[Princeton University]]. The campus center is a combination of the former Palmer Physics Lab, and a modern addition completed in 2001. It was endowed with money from the fortune the Frist family has made in the private hospital business.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Designed by Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates, the firm of acclaimed architects [[Robert Venturi]] (a Princeton alumnus) and [[Denise Scott Brown]], the building consists of a modern expansion to the existing Collegiate Gothic Palmer Hall. The new building volume fills in the courtyard of the previous C-shaped structure, and extends across its open side to create a new east facade.  In 2008 and 2009 extensive renovations&lt;ref&gt;https://www.princeton.edu/frist/timeline.html&lt;/ref&gt; were performed on the 100 level by [http://jamesbradberry.com James Bradberry Architects]

Room 302 is a lecture hall restored to its condition at the time that [[Albert Einstein]] lectured there.

This building has also been used for external shots of the fictitious [[Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital]] in the [[television series]] ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''.

'''''Georgia Today''''' is an [[English language]] newspaper published in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia Profile|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1102477.stm#media|accessdate=10 October 2013|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is published twice a week in two different versions - ''Georgia Today'' and ''Georgia Today Business''.&lt;ref name=qua&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia Today ReBranded: Quality Designed with our Readers in Mind!|url=http://georgiatoday.ge/news/1810/Georgia-Today-ReBranded%3A-Quality-Designed-with-our-Readers-in-Mind%21|work=Georgia Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haroldson Lafayette''' "'''H. L.'''" '''Hunt Jr.''' (February 17, 1889 &amp;ndash; November 29, 1974), known throughout his life as '''H. L. Hunt''', was a Texas [[Petroleum|oil]] tycoon and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political activist. By trading poker winnings for oil rights, he ultimately secured title to much of the [[East Texas Oil Field]], one of the world's largest oil deposits. From it and his other acquisitions, he accrued a fortune that was among the world's largest; at the time of his death, he was reputed to have the highest net worth of any individual in the world. His personal life, which featured many children by three wives, was among the chief inspirations for the television series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', whose most famous character [[J. R. Ewing]] was largely based on popular perceptions of Hunt.

==Life==
Hunt was born near [[Ramsey, Illinois|Ramsey]], in [[Carson Township, Fayette County, Illinois|Carson Township]], [[Fayette County, Illinois]], the youngest of eight children. He was named after his father, Haroldson Lafayette Hunt, who was a prosperous farmer-entrepreneur; his mother was Ella Rose (Myers) Hunt.

Hunt was educated at [[Home schooling|home]]. As a teenager, Hunt traveled to various places before settling in [[Arkansas]], where he was running a [[cotton plantation]] by 1912. He had a reputation as a math prodigy and was a gambler. It was said that after his cotton plantation was flooded, he turned his last $100 into more than $100,000, gambling in [[New Orleans]]. With his winnings, he purchased oil properties in the neighborhood of [[El Dorado, Arkansas]]. He was generous to his employees, who in turn were loyal to him, informing him of rumors of a massive oil field to the south, in East Texas—the East Texas Oil Field. In negotiations over cheese and crackers, at the [[Adolphus Hotel]] in [[Dallas]], with the wild-catter who discovered the field—[[Columbus Marion Joiner|"Dad" Joiner]]—Hunt secured title to what was then the largest known oil deposit in the world, having agreed to pay only $1,000,000, and protect Mr. Joiner from liability for his many fraudulent transactions surrounding the property. In 1957 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' estimated that Hunt had a fortune of between [[United States dollar|U.S.]] $400 million and $700 million ($4.5 billion in 2011, adjusted for inflation),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the eight [[Wealthiest Americans (1957)|richest people]] in the United States. [[J. Paul Getty]], who was considered at the time to be the richest private citizen in the world, said of Hunt: "In terms of extraordinary, independent wealth, there is only one man—H. L. Hunt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lohr|first=Steve|title=Books of the Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/20/books/books-of-the-times-books-of-the-times.html|accessdate=June 13, 2012|work=The New York Times|date=August 20, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Hunt had fifteen children by three wives.

He married Lyda Bunker of [[Lake Village, Arkansas]] in November 1914, and remained married to her until her death in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley H. Brown, H. L. Hunt (Chicago: Playboy, 1976) 40,191.&lt;/ref&gt;  His seven children by her were: [[Margaret Hunt Hill|Margaret]] (1915-2007), Haroldson ("Hassie," 1917-2005), [[Caroline Rose Hunt|Caroline]] (1923–2018), Lyda (born and died in 1925), [[Nelson Bunker Hunt|Nelson Bunker]] (1926-2014), [[William Herbert Hunt|William Herbert]] (1929), and [[Lamar Hunt|Lamar]] (1932-2006). Their home on [[White Rock Lake]] in Dallas was styled after [[Mount Vernon]] though much larger.

His first son, Hassie, who was expected to succeed him in control of the family business, was [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]] in response to increasingly erratic behavior. He outlived his father. Lamar founded the [[American Football League]] and created the [[Super Bowl]], drawing on the assistance of his children in selecting the game's name. Two other children, Herbert and Bunker, are famous for their purchasing much of the world's silver, in an attempt to corner the market. They ultimately owned more silver than any government in the world, before their scheme was discovered and undone. Bunker Hunt was briefly one of the wealthiest men in the world, having discovered and taken title to the Libyan oil fields, before [[Muammar Gaddafi]] nationalized the properties.

While still married to Lyda, H. L. Hunt is said to have married Frania Tye of [[Tampa, Florida]] in November 1925, using the name Franklin Hunt. Frania claimed to have discovered the bigamous nature of her marriage in 1934, and in a legal settlement in 1941, Hunt created trust funds for each of their four children and she signed a document stipulating that no legal marriage between them had ever existed. About the same time, she briefly married then divorced Hunt's employee, John Lee, taking the last name Lee for herself and her four children.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley H. Brown, H. L. Hunt (Chicago: Playboy, 1976) 78-79, 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; Her four children by Hunt were: Howard (born 1926), Haroldina (1928), Helen (1930), and Hugh ("Hue," 1934). Frania Tye Lee died in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Burrough, The Big Rich (New  York: Penguin, 2009) 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt supported and had children by Ruth Ray of [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], whom he met when she was a secretary in his Shreveport office. They married in 1957 after the death of Hunt's wife Lyda. His four children by her were: Ray (born 1943), [[June Hunt|June]] (1944), [[Helen LaKelly Hunt|Helen]] (1949), and [[Swanee Hunt|Swanee]] (1950).&lt;ref&gt;Stanley H. Brown, H. L. Hunt (Chicago: Playboy, 1976) 192-193.&lt;/ref&gt; His youngest son, [[Ray Lee Hunt|Ray Lee]], ultimately inherited the business, and was a major supporter of President [[George W. Bush]].

A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that he had had a hidden [[bigamy|bigamous]] relationship, with his second wife living in New York.&lt;ref name="HOT: Hunt"&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | name=Hunt, Haroldson Lafayette | id=fhu59 | author=Palmer, Jerrell Dean | retrieved=October 24, 2009}} Texas State Historical Association&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, Hunt was a member of the [[First Baptist Church (Dallas)|First Baptist Church of Dallas]], and was a major financial contributor toward the establishment of the conservative Christian evangelical [[Criswell College]] in Dallas, Texas.

H. L. Hunt died, aged 85, in Dallas, Texas, and was buried in the [[Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery]] there.

'''Hans Peter Kraus''' (October 12, 1907 – November 1, 1988), also known as '''H. P. Kraus''' or '''HPK''', was an [[Austria]]n-born [[book dealer]] described as "without doubt the most successful and dominant rare book dealer in the world in the second half of the 20th century"&lt;ref&gt;William S. Reese, [http://www.reeseco.com/papers/abr19.htm The End of H.P. Kraus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705104850/http://www.reeseco.com/papers/abr19.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a league with other rare book dealers such as [[Bernard Quaritch]], [[Guillaume Debure|Guillaume de Bure]] and [[A.S.W. Rosenbach]]. Kraus specialized in medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[incunabulum|incunables]] (books printed before 1501), and rare books of the 16th and 17th centuries, but would purchase and sell almost any book that came his way that was rare, valuable and important. He prided himself in being "the only bookseller in history...to have owned a [[Gutenberg Bible]] and the [[Psalter]]s of 1457 and 1459&lt;ref&gt;These are the two earliest psalters printed by Gutenberg's successors, [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schoeffer]]. See Margaret Stillwell, 'The Beginning of the World of Books', 1450 to 1470, nos. 18 &amp; 27.&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously," stressing that "'own' here is the correct word, as they were bought not for a client's account but for stock."&lt;ref&gt;H.P.Kraus, ''A Rare Book Saga'', [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]], New York (1978) (hereinafter "RBS") p. 227. {{ISBN|0-399-12064-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Kraus was born on October 12, 1907, in [[Vienna]]. After working for R. Lechner in Vienna and Ernst Wasmuth in [[Berlin]], he started his own rare book business in 1932, which prospered despite the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. In 1938, after the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]], Kraus was arrested for being Jewish and sent to the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. After several months, he was transferred to [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]. After eight months in Buchenwald, he was released, returned to Vienna and ordered to leave Austria within two months.&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 59-72. Kraus does not explain in his autobiography exactly how he came to be released.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraus abandoned his business and stock of 100,000 books, although he had previously shipped some books and valuables to [[Switzerland]], and traveled to [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. He arranged to have his mother join him there; she arrived just two days before [[World War II]] began. In September he obtained a visa and sailed for [[New York City]], arriving on October 12, 1939, where he arrived with the 1494 Vérard Columbus letter gaining him his first piece of publicity as a bookdealer in America: a newspaper column on the Columbus letter arriving on Columbus Day.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kraus Saga'', The Book Collector, 1983, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks of arrival, he met Hanni Zucker, also from Vienna, whom he subsequently married.&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 73-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bookseller extraordinaire==
Kraus restarted his rare book business in New York, which soon began to prosper. His first important sale was to [[Lessing J. Rosenwald]], a major book collector, who ultimately donated his collection of early printed books to the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Kraus bought and sold major medieval illuminated manuscripts, incunables and assorted rare books and manuscripts. Among his most important sales were the [[Anhalt Gospels]],&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; the finely illuminated [[Hours of Catherine of Cleves]] now reunited with its other half at the [[Morgan Library]], the Arthur Houghton copy of the Gutenberg Bible for $2.5 million,&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 236-137.&lt;/ref&gt; three copies of [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s first edition of the Canterbury Tales,&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; and the original manuscript of the proclamation of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], signed by [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; He also purchased the enigmatic [[Voynich manuscript]] in 1961 for $24,500, and after seven years of unsuccessfully attempting to sell it for as much as $160,000 ultimately donated it to the [[Beinecke Library]] at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;RBS pp. 218-222.&lt;/ref&gt; Kraus also sold the magnificent manuscript [[Giant Bible of Mainz]] to Lessing J. Rosenwald who donated it the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, Kraus initiated a practice of buying up entire libraries or collections at a discounted price and then selling the items individually or in smaller groups, carefully researched and catalogued, for a great profit.&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp.40, 45-50, 77, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued that practice after he moved to the United States, for example, buying in 1949 some 20,000 volumes of the [[Prince Liechtenstein]] library for a "rock bottom" price,&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 151-156.&lt;/ref&gt; the entire [[Frederick Baldwin Adams, Jr.|Frederick Adams]] collection of early communist, radical and anarchistic literature and ephemera,&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 the remainder of the great manuscript collection of the 19th-century bibliomaniac [[Sir Thomas Phillipps]], which after the better part of a century of auction sales, still consisted of 2,000 manuscript volumes and 130,000 manuscript letters and documents.&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-dating the Gutenberg Bible?==
In 1952, Kraus purchased a copy of an extremely rare incunabula, the [[Constance Missal]], then known in only two copies. Bearing no date, it was printed with type nearly identical to, but seemingly more primitive than, that used in the 1457 and 1459 Psalters, and some scholars believed that it might be the first printed book, pre-dating the Gutenberg Bible. Kraus sold it as a major bibliographical prize to the [[Morgan Library]]. Several years later, [[Allan Stevenson]], by a brilliant and painstaking comparison of the different states of wear in the watermarks in the Constance Missal with those in dated books, conclusively established that it was printed in 1473, nearly 20 years after the Gutenberg Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Stevenson, ''The Problem of the Missale Speciale'', London, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the definitive proof to the contrary, Kraus still professed that, "Speaking for myself, I believe that the Constance Missal is earlier than the Gutenberg Bible."&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sale catalogs==
Kraus regularly issued printed catalogs of books for sale, which contained extensive detailed descriptions of the books and manuscripts. Totaling at least 223,&lt;!-- This is the most recent I can find, it's called England/Ireland/Scotland/Wales. --&gt; they are prized today as reference works. Some of the catalogs contained full color illustrations of bindings and illustrations, and a few were issued hardbound. Kraus had "the largest and most complete reference library of books on the subject of bibliography ever put together by a book dealer anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;Selby Kieffer, quoted in Wendy Moonan [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802EFDD1438F937A25752C1A9659C8B63 "Time to Write Finis For a Book Trove"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businessman and collector==
Kraus quite understandably was very proud of his success as a businessman, amassing a fortune from the rare book and manuscript trade. He described his "philosophy of success in business" as: "Push on, hit hard, follow through."&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being the only dealer to own, as inventory, the Gutenberg Bible and the 1457 and 1459 Psalters at the same time, he "owned most of the major incunabula,"&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; and "bought and sold more Caxtons than any other living bookseller."&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 245-246.&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography is full of stories where he bought some rare manuscript or book at a low price and turned around and sold it for a much greater price. He also lamented a number of instances where he narrowly failed to secure some book or collection including some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]],&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; or where he sold a very rare item too cheaply.

Kraus acknowledged that his autobiography might leave the reader with "the impression that [he was] interested only in making money."&lt;ref&gt;RBS, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had a deep love of books and was himself a serious collector. One area of particular interest for Kraus was books relating to [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]. He eventually wrote a biography of Drake, based on materials in his collection, a collection that he later donated to the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;RBS pp. 344-349. See also [http://memory.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkoverview.html The Sir Francis Drake Collection] and [http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml The Kraus Collection of Sir Francis Drake.]&lt;/ref&gt; Kraus also put together a collection of important manuscripts concerning colonial [[New Spain|Spanish America]], particularly Mexico, including a letter from [[Amerigo Vespucci]]. Kraus donated that collection to the Library of Congress in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;RBS pp. 361-366. See also [https://www.loc.gov/rr/mss/coll/139.html Hans P. Kraus Collection; Documents relating to colonial Spanish America.] and [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2004/ms004019.pdf A Register of the Collection.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Kraus published his autobiography ''A Rare Book Saga''.

==Journals and reprints==
Over the years, Kraus purchased large collections of technical and academic journals, which he was able to resell to libraries at great profit.&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 48, 77, 101-103.&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, he opened a second business, Kraus Periodicals Inc., to specialize in the sale of runs of scholarly journals, and soon made an en bloc purchase of over 300,000 issues.&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after he had received multiple orders for the same journals, Kraus formed a business that reprinted scientific and scholarly journals and reference books.&lt;ref&gt;RBS, pp. 367-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the business==
Kraus died on November 1, 1988, in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]], after which the business was carried on by his widow Hanni and their daughter and son-in-law, Mary Ann and Roland Folter.&lt;ref&gt;"H.P. Kraus, Internationally Prominent Rare Book Dealer", ''AB Bookman's Weekly'' (Mar. 20, 1989) pp. 1284-1285.&lt;/ref&gt; The business subsequently closed, and its remaining inventory and reference works were sold by [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref&gt;William S. Reese, [http://www.reeseco.com/papers/abr19.htm   The End of H.P. Kraus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705104850/http://www.reeseco.com/papers/abr19.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2708">'''Hartman Bache''' (September 3, 1798 – October 8, 1872) was an [[United States|American]] [[engineer]] who participated in the construction of many of the earliest [[lighthouse]]s on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].  He made a number of sketches of these lighthouses and light stations which have since become an important resource in the study of American lighthouses.  He was also involved in the construction of [[railroad]]s, [[canal]]s, and [[defense (military)|defenses]].

Hartman Bache was the youngest son of journalist [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]] (who died a week after his birth) and the great grandson of [[Benjamin Franklin]].  He graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1818. Despite his low class rank (19th out of 23), he was immediately commissioned as a Captain in the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. In 1829 he married Maria del Carmen Meade, the daughter of merchant [[Richard Worsam Meade I|Richard W. Meade]] and sister of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general [[George Meade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Thomas P.|date=1895|title=American Ancestry: Giving the Name and Descent, in the Male Line, of Americans Whose Ancestors Settled in the United States Previous to the Declaration of Independence, A. D. 1776|url={{GBurl|Myk9AQAAMAAJ}}|volume=X|pages=110–111|location=Albany, N.Y.|publisher=Joel Munsell's Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861, Bache was a lighthouse engineer with the rank of Major. Shortly afterwards, he succeeded [[John James Abert]] as Chief of Topographical Engineers, spending much of the war serving on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. He was brevetted to [[Brigadier General]] in March 1865, and retired in March 1867. Bach died in his hometown of [[Philadelphia]], and was buried in [[Woodlands Cemetery]].

'''Invensys Rail Group''' was a division of [[Invensys]], a UK-based multinational engineering company. It was a designer, manufacturer and integrator of railway equipment, including automation, [[Railway signalling|signalling]] and controls.  The group was headquartered in [[Chippenham]], Wiltshire, and {{asof|2005|lc=on}}, had over 2750 employees in 14 locations internationally. 
It operated through four companies: 
* Invensys Rail Dimetronic (Spain, Portugal and Latin America); 
* [[Westinghouse Rail Systems]] (UK); and 
* Invensys Rail Systems Australia incorporating Westinghouse Signals Australia and Foxboro Transportation, now known collectively as WRSA (Westinghouse Rail Systems Australia).

Westinghouse Rail Systems Ltd (WRSL) (UK) was previously known as Westinghouse Signals Ltd and before that was part of [[Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company]], named after inventor [[George Westinghouse]].

The other part of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company, Westinghouse Brakes Ltd, was sold by Invensys to [[Knorr-Bremse]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Invensys]] investor relations news release, 25 April 2000 ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060314205854/http://www.invensys-investor.com/isys/news/2000/2000-04-25/ Invensys Sells Westinghouse Brakes to Knorr-Bremse]''.  Retrieved from the [[Internet Archive]] on 30 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and has since left the Chippenham site to set up in the nearby town of [[Melksham]].

On 28 November 2012, Invensys agreed to sell its rail arm to [[Siemens]] AG for £1.7bn; the sale was completed 2 May 2013.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/siemens-completes-invensys-rail-acquisition.html Railwail gazette], Sale of Invensys rail to Siemens AG.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Main Street Programs''' aim to revitalize their downtowns and commercial districts through preservation-based economic development and community revitalization. The project commenced in 1977 with a pilot involving 3 towns: [[Galesburg, Illinois]], [[Madison, Indiana]], and [[Hot Springs, South Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the National Main Street Center|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/about-main-street/the-center/history.html|website=Main Street America|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the program has been expanded to include many other towns. These may be statewide or regional "coordinating programs" or "local programs." Programs determined to be "Designated" follow best-practices established by the National Main Street Center and/or statewide or regional coordinating programs. A [[main street manager]] is appointed to implement the program locally.

'''Microdispensing''' is the technique of producing liquid media dosages in volumes of less than one microlitre. The continuing miniaturization in almost all technical areas creates constant challenges for industry, development and research facilities. Microdispensing is one of those challenges. Ever smaller amounts of adhesive, liquid, oil, grease and a multitude of other media must be dispensed reliably and accurately in dosage and placement with short cycle times.  The precise positioning and quantity of fluids such as glue, reagents or any other substance has a great influence on the overall quality of a medical device. A few examples are:
* Micro-dosing systems with a quantity as small as 50 picolitres
* Volumetric systems for use with adhesives and spraying systems for silicone coating needles and other surfaces

Microdispensing is also used in non-medical applications, like on-demand soda flavoring (the [[Coca-Cola Freestyle]] and [[Pepsi Spire]]), [[inkjet printing]], and [[3-D printing]].

==Dispensing techniques==
There are two basic types of dispensing techniques: classic contact dispensing and non-contact dispensing.

===Contact dispensing===
In contact dispensing, the drop forms at the exit of a nozzle, and is deposited by contact, while the drop is still on the nozzle. The technique is as old as the wish to divide a medium, stored in a big container, into smaller amounts. A good example for this is applying adhesive with a tube: To apply the adhesive requires contact between the tip of the tube and the part for the bead of adhesive to be transferred. This method has disadvantages:
* Slow dispensing
* Part has to be touched
* Part could be damaged
* Adhesive forms threads
* Adhesive is not in the expected place
* Adhesive amounts are difficult to reproduce

Despite all of these disadvantages, contact dispensing is still used in the majority of automated processes today, because  of:
* A lack of knowledge regarding non-contact dispensing systems
* Few manufacturers for non-contact dispensing systems
* No direct access to dispensing area (e.g. undercuts)
* Medium can not be dispensed without contact
* Dispensing without stress to Medium is possible
* More precise dispensing especially at bead dispensing
* Simple to clean in most cases

===Typical technologies for contact dispensing===
Gear pump
* high-frequency pulsation
* high performance
* always valves
* no solids possible 
Pressure-time systems
* many components
* pragmatic evaluation of quantity and control
* add. power source: air
* volume flow depends on pressure, time and temperature

===Non-contact dispensing (Jetting)===

In non-contact dispensing, the drop also forms at the end of a nozzle, but far enough away from the target area that the drop separates from the nozzle before it hits. This, too, is a very old technique, as old as squirting liquid from a tube.

Because of increasing requirements in regards to cycle time and accuracy in almost all areas of production, non-contact dispensing is constantly gaining importance. A good example for this is the attachment of very small electronic parts (SMD parts) onto printed circuit boards and substrates. For this, the part carrier only needs to be positioned in one plane - after that the adhesive can be transferred without contact. The following examples show the advantages of non-contact dispensing:
* Removal of a feed motion to the part
* Time saving through ejection of adhesive
* No contact with part (no damage)
* Even spread of adhesive topography independent of part topography and surface structure

Non-contact dispensing can be divided in two different methods:
* Jet-forming dispensing
* Dynamic drop dispensing

==Jet-forming dispensing==
&lt;br /&gt;Jet-forming dispensing exists when the flow velocity of a medium at the nozzle exit is high enough that the effects of gravitation and surface tension on the separation of the fluid from the nozzle are of secondary importance. This state is characterized by the [[Weber number]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{We} = \frac{\rho v^2 D}{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;||: Fluid [[density]] ([[kilogram|kg]]/[[meter|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;||: Jet [[velocity]] (m/[[second|s]])
|-
|&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;||: Nozzle diameter (m)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;||: [[Surface tension]] ([[newton (unit)|N]]/m)
|}
The physical border line between drop- and jet-forming is around a Weber-number of 8. At this point the dynamic pressure of the flowing medium exceeds the pressure from the surface tension of the drop, which therefore sticks to the nozzle. This transitional stage can be demonstrated at a water tap by gradually increasing the flow, going from the dropping status until a continuous water jet has formed. The Weber-number in this case is, however, clearly above 8, because of the jet exit conditions of the nozzle.

By using the Weber-number, the theoretical lower limit of the mass flow can be found for the jet-forming conditions. In actual applications, to assure a safe dispensing process, the real Weber-numbers chosen should be between 20 and 50.

For a calculated estimation of the fluid flow velocity in the nozzle, for fluids with Newtonian flow behavior, the formula for capillary fluid flow according to the [[Hagen–Poiseuille law]] has been proven.

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{\Delta P \pi r^4}{8 \mu L}&lt;/math&gt;
{|
|&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;||: Volumetric flow rate
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt;||: Pressure difference between nozzle entrance and nozzle exit
|-
|&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;||: Nozzle radius
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;||: Dynamic viscosity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;||: Length of the nozzle
|}
To avoid atomizing of the fluid at the nozzle exit, the fluid flow in the nozzle must be laminar, which is the case as long as the [[Reynolds number]] (Re) of the nozzle is smaller than the [[Reynolds number#Transition and turbulent flow|critical Reynolds-number]] of the nozzle:

: &lt;math&gt;Re &lt; Re_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;

Reynolds-number of the nozzle:
: &lt;math&gt; Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
{|
|&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;||: Dynamic viscosity
|}

Critical Reynolds-number of the nozzle:
: &lt;math&gt;1800 \lessapprox Re_{crit} \lessapprox 2400&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the theoretical range of the jet-forming dispension is enclosed at its lower limit by the Weber-number and at its upper limit by the critical Reynolds-number. For practical applications, a high kinetic energy in the fluid jet is not desirable, because the jet probably would burst and spatter tiny droplets around the target point. Jet-forming dispensing systems are therefore usually operated in the area of lower Weber-numbers.

In practice, the calculation of the Weber-number becomes more complicated when fluids with additives are used, which demonstrate a non-Newtonian (i.e. thixotropic) flow behavior and therefore the viscosity during the flow through the nozzle is different.

==Dynamic drop dispensing==
&lt;br&gt;Dynamic drop dispensing is characterised by separation of a drop from the nozzle exit through a dynamic process, because the static pressure of the liquid medium is insufficient for forming a fluid jet.

A well-known example is [[inkjet printing]]. In this application, the volume of a small dispensing chamber with adjoining nozzle becomes reduced through a short impulse, whereby the ink is ejected through the nozzle. Nozzle chamber, nozzle and ink reservoir are hereby fluidically connected without any valve in between. During the dispensing process, some of the medium is also flowing in the reverse direction (back into the reservoir). The surface tension of the fluid at the nozzle exit prevents air being sucked in and fluid from exiting the nozzle when the dispensing chamber is filled up again. The principle of this process is only useful for low-viscosity fluids and this principle is not applicable with higher fluid pressures.

Ink-jet systems have the following inherent properties:

•	Very small single-drop volumes are achievable (8 picolitres)&lt;br /&gt;
•	High dispensing frequencies can be realised (some kHz)&lt;br /&gt;
•	Low costs for mass production&lt;br /&gt;
•	Only certain low-viscosity media are dispensable (i.e. no volatile media)&lt;br /&gt;
•	Principally not leak-proof

For industrial production, the dispensing amounts and the range of viscosity spectra of ink-jet systems for most applications are too small.&lt;!--I'm just guessing at what this originally nonsensical sentence was supposed to mean --&gt; In these fields of production, specially-designed valves with tappet drives of high dynamic are used instead. These microdispensing systems are characterised by the following properties:

•	Single drop volumes from 10 to 200 nanolitres&lt;br /&gt;
•	Dispensing frequencies up to 100&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;br /&gt;
•	Dispensing accuracy &lt; 1%&lt;br /&gt;
•	Media viscosities up to 200 Pa·s (thixotropic)&lt;!-- originally "200.000 mPas" which I took to mean 200000 milli-Pascal-seconds since the source appears to be European --&gt;

'''Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)''' are a key policy initiative of the [[Government of India]] to improve the country’s logistics sector by lowering overall freight costs, reducing vehicular pollution and congestion, and cutting warehousing costs. The government’s [[Ministry of Road Transport and Highways]] (MoRTH) is developing multi-modal logistics parks at selected locations in the country under its Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP).&lt;ref&gt;IANS. 2017. Government to develop 15 multi-modal logistics parks for Rs 33,000 cr. Business Standard. 16 May. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/government-to-develop-15-multi-modal-logistics-parks-for-rs-33-000-cr-117051501161_1.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; India is burdened with high logistics costs, which account for about 13% of the value of goods sold in the economy compared with 8% in other major economies. The average cost to export/import one container in India is about 72% higher than in China.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;R. Arora. 2017. Government Approves Plan to Build 34 Mega Multi-Modal Logistics Parks at an Investment of Rs2 Lakh Cr. The Economic Times. 21 July. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/government-approves-plan-to-build-34-mega-multi-modal-logistics-parks-at-an-investment-of-rs-2-lakh-cr/articleshow/59690653.cms&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

LEEP, which is spearheaded by the MoRTH and the [[National Highways Authority of India]] (NHAI), aims to enhance freight transport in India by reducing costs and time, and improving the tracking and traceability of consignments through infrastructural, procedural, and information technology interventions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2016. Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP). Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government defines an MMLP as a freight-handling facility encompassing a minimum area of 100 acres (40.5 hectares), with various modes of transport access, and comprising mechanized warehouses, specialized storage solutions such as cold storage, facilities for mechanized material handling and inter-modal transfer container terminals, and bulk and break-bulk cargo terminals.&lt;ref&gt;Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2017. Draft Policy Document: Development of Multimodal Logistics Parks. Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; Logistics parks will further provide value-added services such as customs clearance with bonded storage yards, quarantine zones, testing facilities, and warehousing management services. Provisions will also be made for late-stage manufacturing activities such as kitting and final assembly, grading, sorting, labelling and packaging activities, re-working, and returns management (Arora, 2017).

== Background ==
Keeping pace with India’s rapid economic growth is the expansion of the country’s logistics sector. The movement of freight in the country nearly doubled to around 2,300 billion ton-kilometers in fiscal year 2015 from 1,200 billion ton-kilometers in fiscal year 2008.&lt;ref&gt;A ton-kilometer is a unit of transport measurement equivalent to moving 1 ton of cargo a distance of 1 kilometer.&lt;/ref&gt; The government expects freight movement in the country to continue its growth trajectory, with expected annual growth of 8%–10% over the next 10 years. The logistics sector as a whole, according to a study commissioned by MoRTH, is poised to expand at roughly 1.2 times the rate of India’s gross domestic product growth through 2032, by which time it is expected to generate $360 billion in value added, up from $115 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;H.Y. Jeong. 2017. What Multimodal Parks Can Do for Logistics in India. 27 September. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://blogs.adb.org/blog/what-multimodal-parks-can-do-logistics-india&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, India managed to improve its performance in the [[Logistics Performance Index]] (LPI), a ranking published by the [[World Bank]] to measure the logistics performance of countries.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. 2016. Connecting to Compete 2016: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy—The Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators. Washington: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; India’s LPI ranking rose to 35th in 2016, up from 46th in 2012. India’s ranking, however, still lags behind some of its economic peers, including other Asian countries. The best logistics performer in Asia is Singapore, which was ranked 5th in 2016, followed by Hong Kong, China (9th); Japan (12th); the Republic of Korea (24th); and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (27th). Among the grouping of so-called [[BRICS]]—comprising Brazil, Russia, India, the PRC, and South Africa—aside from the PRC, South Africa also outperformed India in 2016 with a ranking of 20th (World Bank, 2016).

However, there remain significant challenges to the sector’s development. Logistics costs are high in India relative to costs in developed countries. Logistics costs as a percentage of gross domestic product stood at approximately 13% in 2015. In comparison, the logistics cost in developed countries is approximately 8%–10%. In more specific terms, India’s road freight cost per ton-kilometer, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is ₹1.90 ($0.03), which is almost double that of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2017. Concept Note: Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP)—Development of Multimodal Logistics Parks. Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher logistics costs in India are primarily driven by five key factors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One is an unfavorable inter-modal mix, with 60% of freight movement skewed toward road transport despite the lower freight cost of rail transport. Second is India’s inefficient fleet mix, which is characterized by smaller, inefficient trucks. Third is the underdeveloped material handling infrastructure that is characterized by a fragmented industry consisting largely of small, unorganized warehouses with limited mechanization. Fourth is the underdeveloped road infrastructure with a limited presence of 4- and 6-lane national highways. Lastly, the lack of a national logistics policy, institutional and regulatory bottlenecks, such as complicated documentation and procedures related to toll collections, adversely impact logistics costs in India.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Government policy initiatives ==
Along with its initial efforts, including the [[Make in India]] program and improvements in infrastructure, Government of India has made a number of decisions aimed at transforming the country’s logistics sector. According to R. Goyal and S. Singh, adviser and young professional in the infrastructure–connectivity vertical section of [[NITI Aayog]], the government is committed towards an integrated development of logistics sector through policy amendments, infrastructural development, tax reforms and technology adoption.&lt;ref&gt;R. Goyal and S. Singh. 2018. Indian Logistics Sector: On the Path of Transformation. Government of India, NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India). &lt;nowiki&gt;http://niti.gov.in/content/indian-logistics-sector-path-transformation&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These decisions include the nationwide imposition of a goods and services tax (GST), which came into effect 1 July 2017. This levy on the supply of goods and services, which replaced many indirect tax laws that previously existed in India, should expedite the conversion of informal logistics operations into formal ones and speed up freight movement at interstate borders as check posts are dismantled. The government further established a new logistics division in the Department of Commerce to coordinate integrated development of the sector via policy changes, improvement in existing procedures, identification of bottlenecks and gaps, and introduction of technology-based interventions. The [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Ministry of Commerce and Industry]] is aiming to develop an integrated logistics portal to connect buyers, logistics service providers and relevant government agencies. The logistics sector has been reclassified by the government with its inclusion under the Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure Subsector. With this, the logistics sector can access long-term credit, the approval process for the construction of MMLPs is simplified, and investments by debt and pension funds into recognized logistics projects would be encouraged by the regulated sector’s market accountability (Goyal &amp; Singh, 2018).

== Purpose and design ==
The development of MMLPs is envisaged as a key policy measure to reduce logistics costs and help address three of the five constraining issues identified above. Specifically, these include an unfavorable modal mix, inefficient fleet mix, and underdeveloped material handling infrastructure. In July 2017, the Government of India approved a plan to build 35 MMLPs. State governments will provide the land needed for the projects, which will then be taken up through public–private partnerships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to MoRTH, these MMLPs are expected to serve five key functions: freight aggregation and distribution, multi-modal freight transport, integrated storage and warehousing, information technology support, and value-added services.

== ADB role and support ==
In 2017, the Government of India launched a program to develop 35 multi-modal logistics parks across the country over the succeeding years and invited [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) to become a lead partner and provide the necessary support (Jeong, 2017). ADB then conducted a pre-feasibility study to assess the suitability of MMLP locations and identify the requisite infrastructure, connectivity, and regulatory reforms in two selected locations: [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]] in Karnataka and [[Guwahati]] in Assam.

In this regard, the state government identified Dabaspete as the site for the park for Bengaluru in Karnataka. Bengaluru is ideally located for an MMLP in south India, with good connections via rail and road networks, and proximity to 17 million potential consumers in Chennai. ADB sees the Bengaluru MMLP as having the potential to become a model for other multimodal logistics parks in India. ADB also supported the pre-feasibility study for a MMLP in [[Jogighopa]], Assam, which incorporates rail, road, and inland-waterway connectivity. The proposed site is located along [[National Waterway 2]] and on the Indo-Bangladesh road route, making it suitable for the MMLP with multi modal access.&lt;ref&gt;K. Rathi. 2018.

'''Nitya Gopal Kundu''' (3 December 1935 – 15 September 2006) was a Bangladeshi artist, sculptor and entrepreneur. He founded the furniture company [[Otobi]].&lt;ref name=pass&gt;{{cite news |date=16 September 2015 |title=Artist Nitun Kundu passes away |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/09/16/d6091601044.htm |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kundu was born in [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur district]] to his parents Gnanendranath Kundu and Binapani Kundu. He was the fourth among seven siblings. Kundu was married to Phalguni Kundu and had a daughter Amity and a son Animesh.

==Education and early career==
Kundu graduated from Dhaka Art College (now the Institute of Fine Arts) in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hossain |first1=Takir |title=Liberation War in art |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=118388 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years leading up to 1971, he worked at the [[United States Information Agency|United States Information Service]] (USIS) in [[Dhaka]] designing exhibits and graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kristula |first=Michael |date=December 2012 |title=Nitun Kundu: A Success |url=http://www.afsa.org/sites/default/files/flipping_book/1212/files/assets/seo/page34.html |journal=Foreign Service Journal |page=34 |access-date=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberation War==
During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], Kundu worked with the artist [[Quamrul Hassan]] at the public relations department of the Bangladesh Government-in-Exile at [[Mujibnagar]]. In collaboration with Hassan and a group of notable artists namely [[Debdas Chakraborty]], Nasir Biswas, Pranesh Mandal and Biren Shome; Kundu worked on numerous posters and works of art aimed at arousing the newly formed [[Mukti Bahini]] liberation army and also raising awareness of the genocide being unleashed by the [[Pakistan Army]] on the people of Bangladesh.

It was during this period he designed two posters which became among the most recognized&lt;ref name="Nitun Kundu: Our role model"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nitun Kundu: Our role model |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=202741 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
works of art produced during the war. They were titled ''Sada Jagrata Banglar Mukti Bahini'' and ''Banglar Hindu, Banglar Bouddha, Banglar Christian, Banglar Musalman; Amra Sabai Bangali''.

The Liberation War was the inspiration for Kundu's most famous work, the sculpture ''[[Shabash Bangladesh]]'', a tribute to the fallen freedom fighters of the Mukti Bahini. This is situated on the campus of [[Rajshahi University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mirdha |first=Refayet Ullah |title=The 75,000 taka bed |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=24994 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneur==
In the 1975, following a brief stint at Bitopi advertising agency, Kundu established his own company, a furniture store featuring his own designs, [[Otobi]]. Within a relatively short period, Otobi became the most prominent Bangladeshi furniture brand. He started the company with an initial investment of 5000 taka.&lt;ref name="Nitun Kundu: Our role model"/&gt;

==Works==

'''Nova''' (formerly '''Nova Group''') is a large  [[eikaiwa school]] (private [[English (language)|English]] [[language education|teaching company]]) in Japan. It was by far the largest&lt;ref name=mktshare&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; company of this type until its widely publicized collapse in October 2007. Before its [[bankruptcy]], Nova employed approximately 15,000 people across a group of companies that supported the operations of and extended out from the "Intercultural Network" of its language schools. The scope of its business operations reached its peak in February 2007 following a rapid expansion of its chain to 924 Nova branches plus a Multimedia Center located in [[Osaka]].

&lt;/ref&gt; The impending financial crisis facing Nova related to a rapid increase in refund claims, significant drops in sales figures, and deterioration of its reputation, came to the fore in September 2007 when Nova began to delay payment of wages and [[Performance-related pay|bonuses]] to staff. The [[National Union of General Workers|NAMBU Foreign Workers Caucus]] in Tokyo estimated that up to 3,000 staff had not received their salaries on time.  A solution for Nova's failure to pay wages was promised by 19 October in a fax sent to branch schools. On 23 October the Osaka Labor Standards office accepted a demand by [[Trade union|unionized]] Nova instructors to investigate criminal charges against Nova President and founder, [[Nozomu Sahashi]], over delayed and unpaid [[wage]]s, but Sahashi was ultimately not charged.

It took roughly eight months for the company to reach the point where it filed for bankruptcy protection on 26 October 2007 whereupon the trading of its stock was suspended and was delisted on 27 November 2007. On 6 November 2007 court-appointed receivers announced that [[Nagoya]]-based [[G.Communication]] would sponsor Nova.  Initial plans by G.com were to start with reopening up to 30 schools in various locations including Tokyo and Osaka by the end of November 2007. G.com later sold off its 490 Nova and 167 GEOS English schools on 1 October 2010 to Inayoshi Holdings, with 50 of the GEOS schools slated to join the Nova group under the name "Nova x Geos"&lt;ref&gt;Retooled English school chains set to launch Nova x Geos brand http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/business/T101014003658.htm Retrieved 16 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 November 2010. As of 1 February 2012 Nova is owned by Jibun Mirai Associe Co. Ltd.&lt;ref name="Jibun Mirai website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jibun Mirai website|url=http://www.jibunmirai.co.jp/|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2013 Jibun Mirai established a wholly owned subsidiary called Nova and fully reinstated the name Nova.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/09/04/business/nova-reinstated-as-name-of-english-language-school-chain/ Nova reinstated as name of English-language school chain 4 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2014 Nova operates 310 branches,&lt;ref name="スクール検索"&gt;{{cite web|title=スクール検索|url=http://www.nova.co.jp/schools/|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 66,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2013/11/03/general/six-years-following-bankruptcy-nova-boosts-the-brand/ Six years following bankruptcy, Nova boosts the brand 3 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Each year, Nova hired between 2,500 and 2,600 foreign teachers to replace those who had left.&lt;ref name=NovaSite&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Although instructors were not required to have actual educational training, the company provided a salary bonus for teachers with an accredited [[TEFL]] certificate, any master's degree, or a degree in education. Teachers were admitted directly after university graduation with any degree that allowed them to obtain a work visa. Instructors from participating countries&lt;ref name=MOFA&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; who can obtain a [[Working Holiday Visa]] were admitted without a degree. They worked fewer hours and earned less pay than full-time instructors.

Sahashi originally established the company with two high school graduates from Sweden and Canada whom he met via a friend who was studying abroad in Paris. They opened the first classroom in Shinsaibashi, Osaka. The name ''[[Nova]]'' (an astronomical term for a stellar explosion) was chosen by Sahashi as he felt it would appeal to prospective students.&lt;ref name=slippingsales&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 1996, Nova's [[initial public offering]]&lt;ref name="corpprofile"/&gt; was met with several demonstrations in front of [[Nomura Securities]] and the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. A complaint filed by The [[National Union of General Workers|Nova Union]] stated that the company was violating Japanese exchange laws by falsely stating that there were no unions at Nova, nor pending litigation, and that labor relations between the company and its employees were amicable and untroubled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaunion.com/zet/UB8.html Media Critical of Nova in Wake of Public Stock Offering]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaunion.com/zet/M6.html "Union, management speak two tongues"] The Japan Times (31 January 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaunion.com/zet/M4.html "Nova is accused of lying in stock-listing prospectus"] The Japan Times, 19 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, Nova steadily expanded the number of its schools as its business grew, going from 239 schools to 623 in 2004.&lt;ref name="corpprofile"/&gt; By 2002, Nova had captured 50% of total market share by revenue (61.5 billion yen) and in 2003, Nova had gained a 66% market share by number of students, some 410,000 students in total. However 2005 saw Nova lose ground in total sales revenue.&lt;ref name=newsales&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events after the collapse===
The announcement of court protection and the admission that operations at all Nova branches would be temporarily shut down shocked the estimated 420,000 Nova students as some of them had paid their tuition in advance and feared their money might not be refunded. The [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] asked the [[Japan Association for the Promotion of Foreign Language Education]], an industry body, to call on its member schools to accept Nova students. METI also requested consumer credit companies not to seek loan repayments from the 20% of Nova students who paid their tuition with loans because Nova has ceased operations and they could not take lessons.&lt;ref name=kyodo11&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Nova President [[Nozomu Sahashi]], missing since before his dismissal, was officially replaced by three board members, including co-founder [[Anders Lundqvist]]. The Osaka Labor Bureau, a local branch of the [[Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare]], launched a consulting counter with five interpreters for foreign Nova instructors.&lt;ref name=desperate&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate effect of collapse of Nova was the sudden unemployment of approximately 4,500 foreign teaching staff and 2,000 Japanese workers. The desperate situation of many of the foreign teachers raised concerns over an apparent lack of an adequate safety net for foreign workers in Japan. Some teachers could not even afford a plane ticket home.&lt;ref name=desperate&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The collapse led to huge increases in union membership, particularly in [[National Union of General Workers|NUGW Tokyo Nambu]] (future Tozen Union) and in Osaka's [[General Union]].  The unions had a chance to appeal their case to the public thanks to extensive coverage on TV, radio and newspaper.
The unexpected influx of ex-Nova teachers on the job market led to immense numbers of applicants vying for a much smaller number of employment opportunities. Language education companies, even some outside Japan, attempted to tap into this labor force.&lt;ref name=vulch&gt;

The publicity, generated by the collapse in Japan and in other countries, also threatened to damage the reputation of Japan's foreign language industry although the Japanese government attempted to minimize the damage by pledging non-specific support despite remaining essentially uninvolved in the chaotic collapse. The government did set up a special consultation booth briefly at the [[Hello Work]] public employment office in Shinjuku in Tokyo for Nova instructors seeking advice&lt;ref name=stranded/&gt; but maintained its distance as its position was that the bankruptcy of Japan's biggest foreign language school chain was a private sector matter.&lt;ref name=kyodo11/&gt;

Although Nova was unable to successfully attract a corporate partner to stave off the bankruptcy, twelve companies quickly applied for sponsorship to rebuild Nova Corp, some of which made specific proposals to turn around the company.&lt;ref name=vulch2&gt;

===Restructuring===
On 7 November 2007, [[G.Communication]], a Nagoya-based operator of cram schools, language schools and restaurant chains announced it had been unofficially selected to take over part of the operations of failed Nova Corp before any official decision by the board of trustees had been released. G.Education Co, a subsidiary of G.communication, would take over part of Nova's operations in addition to the  chain of [[EC Inc]] English conversation schools of Hokkaido it runs. Nova Corp assets not absorbed by G.communication would be liquidated by court appointed administrators. The administrators claimed they had to select a sponsor quickly even before the court approved Nova's reconstruction program as value of Nova corporate assets were eroding each day as employees and students left.&lt;ref name=restructure2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial plans by G.communication were to start with reopening the Nova Kurokawa school in Nagoya's Kita Ward with the intention to reopen up to 30 schools in various locations including Tokyo &amp; Osaka by the end of November 2007. G.communication held several briefing sessions for Nova employees and foreign teachers about their reemployment. Although many of the foreign teachers were not subsequently re-employed, G.communication has opened 465 schools as of January 2010.&lt;ref name=restructure1&gt;

G.communication Co. sold off the Nova and Geos chains of English schools on 1 October 2010.  An investment company led by Masaki Inayoshi, who formerly served as chairman of G.communication, purchased the subsidiary of the Nagoya-based firm that ran both GEOS and Nova.&lt;ref&gt;Geos, Nova English schools change ownership once again http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/business/T101005004522.htm Retrieved 16 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of sale, Nova had 490 locations and Geos 167.

Nova changed ownership again in 2012, being purchased by Jibun Mirai Associe Co. Ltd. However G.communication continues to operate some Nova schools through its subsidiaries G.networks and G.taste, under license from Jibun Mirai Associe.&lt;ref name="Jibun Mirai website"/&gt;

Many Nova branches were (and still are) located near [[train station]]s, and the company used the term ''ekimae ryūgaku'' ("study abroad near the train station": 駅前留学) in its promotional materials. The catch phrase helped Nova to become the nation's biggest chain of English language schools.&lt;ref name="zeal"&gt;{{cite web

Nova's success was also attributed to its promises of a foreign teacher, smaller class sizes than its rivals, and an appointment system that allowed students to schedule and attend class at their convenience.&lt;ref name="disappear"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1997, 18 students filed a [[grievance]] with the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] claiming they were unable to make lesson appointments when they wanted, despite the school's advertisements that its students could reserve classes "at any time". The students said they had purchased hundreds of tickets when joining the school, but found it impossible to use them all by the expiry date due to inflexible scheduling procedures. Nova agreed to a proposal by the Damage Relief Committee to repay a total of 3.8 million yen
and said the dispute had been the result of a misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaunion.com/zet/M9.html "Nova to refund 3.8 million yen for students' unused lessons"] The Japan Times 13 June 1997. Reprinted with permission by Nova Union. Retrieved on 11 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug testing===
In 1994, after two instructors were arrested on drug charges in August and September, Nova asked all 3,100 instructors to sign an agreement to have a mandatory drug test, the results of which would be reported to the police. The drug test only applied to foreign staff.&lt;ref name="seeklegal"&gt;{{cite web

===Shakai hoken===
In March 2005, after NUGW Tokyo Nambu and the [[National Union of General Workers|General Union]] filed a complaint, Nova and other English schools in Japan were investigated by the [[Social Insurance Agency]] for not enrolling employees in {{nihongo |Social Insurance|[[:ja:社会保険|社会保険]],| Shakai Hoken }}. The law stipulates that companies with full-time workers who have been in Japan for more than two months must enroll them in the system. Payment is split between employer and employee, each paying about half the monthly premium amount.&lt;ref name="japantimesprobe"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, Nova amended its working times for instructors and standardized lesson length to 40 minutes, with two minutes either side for lesson planning and student evaluation, resulting in a total lesson time of 44 minutes. Six to eleven minutes of unpaid time was left between classes. As a result of changes to working hours, regular non-titled teachers whose work weeks were reduced to slightly under 30 hours became ineligible for ''shakai hoken'', giving an estimated savings to the company of over one billion yen in annual premium payments. Such employees can register for [[National Health Insurance (Japan)|National Health Insurance]] (a different system to Shakai Hoken), although this system does not offer coverage for time taken off work due to illness. Nova also offered its own private insurance program.&lt;ref name=Japantimeshealth/&gt;

=== Anti-fraternization policy ===
After six employees were fired for violating a clause in their contracts that forbade interaction between students and instructors outside the classroom, a complaint was filed with the [[Attorney at law (Japan)|Osaka Bar Association]] by two employees who were members of the General Union, one of whom had been dismissed as a result of the policy. The two instructors claimed the policy violated their human rights and argued it was racial discrimination since it only applied to foreigners. The clause in Nova's labor contract stated that foreign teachers "should not have a relationship with customers outside the workplace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?nn20030301b8.htm Nova's ban on dating violates rights: teachers] The Japan Times (1 March 2003) retrieved 1 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Osaka Bar Association subsequently issued a non-binding recommendation that the company drop the clause, saying that it restricted instructors' freedom of association and discriminated between foreign and Japanese staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040226b4.html Nova, let teachers date students: bar] The Japan Times (26 February 2004).

=== Contested dismissals ===
In November 2004, union supporters gathered outside Nova's Shinjuku Honko school, protesting dismissals of five teachers, three of whom had been working at Nova for more than 10 years. All were members of the Nova union (a branch of the [[National Union of General Workers|NUGW]]). The union alleged they were dismissed due to their union activities.&lt;ref name=Classaction&gt;

Under Nova's system, students bought points in advance to pay for their lessons. The larger number of points they bought, the smaller the individual class fee became. The case taken to the top court involved a former student who had purchased 600 points at a rate of 1,200 yen per lesson. The student canceled the contract after using 386 points, Nova offered a refund based on a calculation that 300 points were bought, resulting in a price of 1,750 yen per lesson.&lt;ref name=asahildp&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200706120415.html LDP lawmaker vouched for Nova] The Asahi Shimbun 13 June 2007. Retrieved on 13 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Nova said the value of the used points should be calculated as having been bought in smaller lots.&lt;ref name=asahiministry&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200706130249.html Ministry to order Nova to halt part of its operations] The Asahi Shimbun 13 June 2007. Retrieved on 1 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Asahi Shimbun'' cites an example of a contract for 100 lessons, which would cost 230,000 yen in advance, for a per-lesson fee of 2,300 yen. A contract for 600 lessons would require an advance payment of 720,000 yen, or 1,200 yen per class. But if a person with a contract for 600 lessons canceled after taking only 100 classes, Nova would apply the fee of 2,300 yen per lesson, and the student would receive a refund of 490,000 yen. Such students say the contract for 1,200 yen per lesson should have applied in these cases, which would result in a refund of 600,000 yen.&lt;ref name=asahicontract/&gt;

===Supreme Court appeal rejected===
On 4 April 2007, Nova's appeal on two lower court rulings was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] which described Nova's refund policy as invalid and in violation of specified commercial transaction law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200704040097.html "Top court: Nova's refund tactic illegal"] The Asahi Shimbun 4 April 2007.

On 13 June 2007, LDP Lower House member [[Yasuhide Nakayama]] acknowledged he was accompanied by Sahashi and vouched for the company during a meeting  with Osaka Mayor Junichi Seki on the morning of 22 May 2006, during the court dispute over the company's refund system. Nakayama, who was elected from an Osaka constituency (of which Sahashi was a member of the lawmaker's support organization) recalled saying at the time that it was "not right by social norms that Nova's refund rule is unacceptable" and explained "it is a politician's job to help out when a supporter is in trouble." Nakayama stated it was not his intention to exert pressure and Mayor Seki said he did not think the judgment of city officials was swayed by the lawmaker's visit.&lt;ref name=asahildp/&gt;

Industry minister [[Akira Amari]] also admitted on 22 June 2007 that he met with Yasuhide Nakayama earlier that year in February shortly after his ministry began investigating the school. Nakayama sought a meeting with Amari to express concern that the ministry might discipline the school over its fee discount system. Amari stated that Nakayama did not try to sway him from punitive action.&lt;ref name=amari&gt;

===Business restrictions imposed===
On 13 June 2007, the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] imposed a six-month ban on Nova from soliciting, accepting or finalizing new contracts for long-term courses that last for over a year or 70 hours.&lt;ref name=rulebreak&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The six months suspension order did not affect those who had already signed up for lessons, meaning that Nova's students were able to continue taking classes.&lt;ref name=barred/&gt;

The ministry also said that Nova failed to comply with a "cooling-off" system provided for in the specified commercial transaction law. Under this system, consumers can cancel a contract without conditions if the cancellation is made within eight days from when the contract was signed. At Nova, potential students first registered their name, address and other data before finalizing their contracts. An official application to the school was made several days later, after the details of the contract are decided upon. Nova told students who wanted to quit that they could not use the cooling-off system, claiming that the day students registered their data was the first day of the contract.&lt;ref name=asahiministry/&gt;

On 15 June 2007, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare]] said that Nova's English language courses would no longer qualify for government subsidies for those engaged in educational training authorized by the welfare ministry to improve the abilities of the unemployed and other people. In 1999, Nova's 32 courses were approved for the subsidies program. In fiscal 2006, about 4,700 people received a total of 560 million yen in subsidies under the program. Since 1999, around 71,000 Nova students received a total of about 16.1 billion yen in such subsidies.&lt;ref name=jtshares&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5Q0Q2xKsk?url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/409644 Nova eyes new share issuance to dispel market concerns after gov't terminates subsidies] Kyodo News via Japan Today (16 June 2007) Retrieved on 16 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nova submitted a business improvement plan to the Tokyo government in late June 2007 as required by the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry|METI]] conditions. Originally instructed to submit the plan on 10 June, Nova postponed the submission until 24 June.&lt;ref name=postpone6&gt;

A fax sent to branches after 9&amp;nbsp;pm on Friday 12 October informed all instructors that salaries would not be met on 15 October as scheduled.&lt;ref name=1stOctober2007wagedelay&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The fax promised a solution for 19 October, the day Nova was required to submit its new business plan to JASDAQ after its previous plan was rejected by the Securities Exchange on 5 October for being insufficient.&lt;ref name=JASDAQ-Oct5-NOVA_business_plan_rejected&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071006p2a00m0na034000c.html |title=Jasdaq rejects NOVA report on improvement measures |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=Mainichi Daily News |date=24 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010123111/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071006p2a00m0na034000c.html |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

When salaries were not disbursed on 15 October, union representatives from both Tokyo based NAMBU Foreign Workers Caucus and the Osaka-based General Union approached the Labor Standards Inspection Office to file a report and request an inquest in unpaid wages. The Unions estimated that about 4,000 foreign teachers to salary went unpaid of which about 2,000 employees were still awaiting wages from the previous month that had been delayed since 27 September. The Unions also filed complaints reporting that Nova had withheld member's rent payment and the landlords had tried ask teachers to leave repeatedly.&lt;ref name=inquestrequest&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

By 20 October there had been both union organized and wildcat strikes over the unpaid wages. The numerous delays of wages also led individual teachers also to boycott classes.&lt;ref name=strikes&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October, the Osaka Labor Standards office accepted a demand by Nova instructors to investigate criminal charges against Sahashi over delayed and unpaid wages.&lt;ref name="Labor Standards-Oct23-Criminal_charges_sought"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071023p2a00m0na003000c.html |title=Labor standards office questions Nova staff |accessdate=24 October 2007 |publisher=Mainichi Daily News |date=24 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023182348/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071023p2a00m0na003000c.html |archivedate=23 October 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the employment fallout after the collapse was the experience of small private school in Higashinari Ward of Osaka, which said 400 people applied in October for a single job opening. The collapse caught some former teachers in such dire financial straits that they had to rely on their former students to feed them.&lt;ref name=fallout&gt;

===Sahashi's removal===
On 26 October 2007, Nova's stock was delisted and all branches closed, following an emergency board meeting that removed Sahashi from his position as head of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date= 26 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, after a volunteer questioning with Osaka Prefectural Police, a warrant was served and Sahashi was arrested on charges of [[embezzlement]]. Sahashi denied charges of wrongdoing and insisted that the 320 million yen reserve fund personally created through a firm affiliated with Nova effectively under Sahashi's control had been set up to refund tuition fees to students who had canceled their lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Former Nova chief arrested – Sahashi grilled over misuse of ¥320 million in worker benefits | publisher = The Japan Times| date = 25 June 2008| url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080625a1.html | accessdate =30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonpayment of employee housing rent ===
Foreign staff risked losing company-sponsored housing after Nova stopped paying their rent, which they did well before the official announcements of impending bankruptcy. Paul Dorey, an official of the General Union, said: "Some teachers have already received eviction notices. It’s a total mess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Lawsuits==
The parents of a Nova employee who committed [[suicide]] in 2004 filed a suit against the company on 31 August 2007. Their son, age 28 at the time, was employed by Nova to design and supervise the construction of new classrooms. During that period Nova was engaged in a rapid expansion meant to increase the number of Nova branches by 300 in an attempt to reach a total of 1,000. The parents' suit alleges that their son was required by Nova to work up to 80 hours of overtime in one month, and even through the night on seven occasions, despite his inexperience. At one point he had requested to be relieved but was persuaded to stay, which eventually led to overwhelming stress shortly before his suicide.&lt;ref name=suicide1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2007, an Osaka woman filed suit against Nova over a refund related issue. Unlike previous complaints about how Nova adjusted the value of unused lesson points on which the Supreme Court ruled in June 2007, this suit contested Nova's decision not to refund lesson points that were extended after the woman purchased additional points.&lt;ref name=HSsuit1&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The woman claims that while Nova explained that her unused points (worth approximately 400,000 yen) from the first contract would carry over after signing a new contract, she was not told that they could not be refunded if she chose to cancel.&lt;ref name=HSsuit2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, approximately a year after the collapse, 24 former students filed a class action lawsuit against accounting firms KPMG AZSA &amp; Co, former Nova president Sahashi, and five of the directors of the company claiming that the rapid expansion was pursued in a reckless manner, and that upfront lesson fees were being misappropriated.&lt;ref name=JT345&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The suit further claims that Sahashi and his directors were negligent in their duties to fulfill obligations to customers. It also accuses five directors and two accounting firms of participating in the bankruptcy of Nova by allowing it to continue to use illicit accounting practices. Those accused allegedly inflated profit reports by recording 45% of the paid-in-advance tuition fees as part of its sales. The suit seeks a total of 16 million yen in compensation.&lt;ref name=asahi778&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1233">In [[law]], the '''ordinary course of business''' covers the usual transactions, customs and practices of a certain business and of a certain firm. This term is used particularly to judge the validity of certain transactions.  It is used in several different sections of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] of the United States.

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/article1.htm#s1-201 Section 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code] defines a "Buyer in the ordinary course of business" by a four-part test:

# a person that buys goods in [[good faith]],
# without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;e.g. a [[security interest]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
# and in the ordinary course from a person, other than a [[pawnbroker]], '''in the business of selling goods of that kind'''.
# A person buys goods in the ordinary course if the sale to the person '''comports with the usual or customary practices''' in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller's own usual or customary practices.

'''P.H. Hanes Knitting Company''' is a historic [[textile mill]] complex located at [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[Forsyth County, North Carolina]].  The complex includes three buildings.  The Knitting Building or North Building was built in 1920-1921, and is a six-story, [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style concrete and steel building sheathed in brick.  The Mill Building or East Building was built in 1928, and is a five-story-plus-basement building of concrete, brick, and steel construction.  The Warehouse and Shipping Building was built in 1940, and is a six-story steel frame building sheathed in brick.  The P.H. Hanes Knitting Company was founded in 1901 by Pleasant H.

Automatic '''process control''' in [[Continuous production|continuous production processes]] is a combination of [[control engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]] disciplines that uses [[industrial control system]]s  to achieve a production level of consistency, economy and safety which could not be achieved purely by human manual control. It is implemented widely in industries such as oil refining, pulp and paper manufacturing, chemical processing and power generating  plants.

There is a wide range of size, type and complexity, but it enables a small number of operators to manage complex processes to a high degree of consistency. The development of large automatic process control systems was instrumental in enabling the design of large high volume and complex processes, which could not be otherwise economically or safely operated.

The applications can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel, to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand [[control loop]]s.

==History==
Early process control breakthroughs came most frequently in the form of water control devices. Ktesibios of Alexandria is credited for inventing float valves to regulate water level of water clocks in the 3rd Century BC. In the 1st Century AD, Heron of Alexandria invented a water valve similar to the fill valve used in modern toilets.&lt;ref name="Young etal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=William Y|last2=Svrcek|first2=Donald P|last3=Mahoney|first3=Brent R|title=A Real Time Approach to Process Control|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Chichester, West Sussex, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1119993872|pages=1–2|edition=3|chapter=1: A Brief History of Control and Simulation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later process controls inventions involved basic physics principles. In 1620, Cornlis Drebbel invented a bimetallic thermostat for controlling the temperature in a furnace. In 1681, Denis Papin discovered the pressure inside a vessel could be regulated by placing weights on top of the vessel lid.&lt;ref name = 'Young etal'/&gt; In 1745, Edmund Lee created the fantail to improve windmill efficiency; a fantail was a smaller windmill placed 90° of the larger fans to keep the face of the windmill pointed directly into the oncoming wind.

With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 1760s, process controls inventions were aimed to replace human operators with mechanized processes.  In 1784, Oliver Evans created a water-powered flourmill which operated using buckets and screw conveyors. Henry Ford applied the same theory in 1910 when the assembly line was created to decrease human intervention in the automobile production process.&lt;ref name = 'Young etal'/&gt;

For continuously variable process control it was not until 1922 that a formal control law for what we now call [[PID control]] or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by [[Russian American]] engineer [[Nicolas Minorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=J. Amer. Soc. Naval Eng. |year=1922 |volume=34 |pages=280–309 |issue=2 |ref=harv |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy and based his analysis on observations of a [[helmsman]]. He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error, but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=VD_b81J3yFoC&amp;pg=PA67 p. 67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.&lt;ref name="ben96"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to [[#Steady-state error|steady-state error]]), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.

==Development of modern process control operations==
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|A modern control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated as they can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process.

With the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control system was born.

The introduction of DCSs allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

==Hierarchy==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation.]]
The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels in a large process using processor and computer-based control.

Referring to the diagram;

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors (process value readings - PV), and final control elements (FCE), such as [[control valve]]s
* Level 1 contains the industrialised Input/Output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collate information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

==Control model==

To determine the fundamental model for any process, the inputs and outputs of the system are defined differently than for other chemical processes.&lt;ref name="Bequette"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bequette|first1=B. Wayne|title=Process control: Modeling, Design, and Simulation|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=978-0133536409|pages=57–58|edition=Prentice-Hall International series in the physical and chemical engineering science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance equations are defined by the control inputs and outputs rather than the material inputs. The control model is a set of equations used to predict the behavior of a system and can help determine what the response to change will be.

*State Variable (x) - This is a measurable variable that is a good indicator of the state of the system, such as temperature (energy balance), volume (mass balance) or concentration (component balance). 
*Input Variable (u) - This is a specified variable that commonly include flow rates. It's important to note that the entering and exiting flows are both considered control inputs. The control input can be classified as a manipulated, disturbance, or unmonitored variable.
*Parameters (p) - The parameters are usually a physical limitation and something that is fixed for the system, such as the vessel volume or the viscosity of the material.
*Output (y) - The output is the metric used to determine the behavior of the system. The control output can be classified as measured, unmeasured, or unmonitored.

==Types==
Processes can be characterized as one or more of the following forms:

*Batch –  Some applications require that specific quantities of raw materials be combined in specific ways for particular duration to produce an intermediate or end result.  One example is the production of adhesives and glues, which normally require the mixing of raw materials in a heated vessel for a period of time to form a quantity of end product. Other important examples are the production of food, beverages and medicine. Batch processes are generally used to produce a relatively low to intermediate quantity of product per year (a few pounds to millions of pounds).
*Continuous – Often, a physical system is represented through variables that are smooth and uninterrupted in time.  The control of the water temperature in a heating jacket, for example, is an example of continuous process control. Some important continuous processes are the production of fuels, chemicals and plastics. Continuous processes in manufacturing are used to produce very large quantities of product per year (millions to billions of pounds). Such controls use [[feedback control|feedback]] such as in the [[PID controller]] A PID Controller includes proportional, integrating, and derivative controller functions.
*Hybrid - Applications having elements of batch and continuous process control are often called ''hybrid'' applications.

==Control loops==
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Example of a continuous flow control loop. Signalling is by industry standard 4-20 mA current loops, and a "smart" [[control valve|valve positioner]] ensures the [[control valve]] operates correctly.]]
The fundamental building block of any industrial control system is the [[control loop]], which controls just one process variable. An example is shown in the accompanying diagram, where the flow rate in a pipe is controlled by a PID controller, assisted by what is effectively a cascaded loop in the form of a valve servo-controller to ensure correct valve positioning.

Some large systems may have several hundreds or thousands of control loops. In complex processes the loops are interactive, so that the operation of one loop may affect the operation of another. The system diagram for representing control loops is a [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]].

Commonly used controllers are [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC), [[Distributed Control System]] (DCS) or [[SCADA]].

[[File:Auxostat schematic.svg|thumb|Example of level control system of a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]]. The flow control into the tank would be cascaded off the level control. ]]

A further example is shown. If a control valve were used to hold level in a tank, the level controller would compare the equivalent reading of a level sensor to the level setpoint and determine whether more or less valve opening was necessary to keep the level constant. A cascaded flow controller could then calculate the change in the valve position.

==Economic advantages==
The economic nature of many products manufactured in batch and continuous processes require highly efficient operation due to thin margins. The competing factor in process control is that products must meet certain specifications in order to be satisfactory. These specifications can come in two forms: a minimum and maximum for a property of the material or product, or a range within which the property must be.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=C L|title=Process Control for the Process Industries - Part 2: Steady State Characteristics|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress|date=March 2017|pages=67–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; All loops are susceptible to disturbances and therefore a buffer must be used on process set points to ensure disturbances do not cause the material or product to go out of specifications. This buffer comes at an economic cost (i.e. additional processing, maintaining elevated or depressed process conditions, etc.).

Process efficiency can be enhanced by reducing the margins necessary to ensure product specifications are met.&lt;ref name =smith/&gt; This can be done by improving the control of the process to minimize the effect of disturbances on the process. The efficiency is improved in a two step method of narrowing the variance and shifting the target.&lt;ref name =smith/&gt; Margins can be narrowed through various process upgrades (i.e. equipment upgrades, enhanced control methods, etc.). Once margins are narrowed, an economic analysis can be done on the process to determine how the set point target is to be shifted. Less conservative process set points lead to increased economic efficiency.&lt;ref name = smith/&gt; Effective process control strategies increase the competitive advantage of manufacturers who employ them.

Commander '''Raymond Richard Guest''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (November 25, 1907 – December 31, 1991) was an American businessman, [[thoroughbred]] [[race horse]] owner and [[polo]] player. From 1965 to 1968, he was [[United States Ambassador to Ireland]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life==
Guest was born on November 25, 1907, in [[Manhattan]] to [[Frederick Edward Guest]] (1875–1937), a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Cabinet minister]] and his American wife, Amy Phipps (1873–1959). Guest's siblings were [[Winston Frederick Churchill Guest]] (1906–1982), also a polo-player whose second wife was [[C. Z. Guest]] (1920–2003), the actress and socialite, and [[Diana Guest Manning]] (1909–1994).  He attended [[Phillips Andover]] and graduated from [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1931.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

His maternal grandfather was [[Henry Phipps, Jr.]] (1839–1930), [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s business partner in [[Carnegie Steel Company]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  His paternal grandfather was [[Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne]]&lt;ref name="PolkGuestNYTWedding"/&gt; (1835–1914) and his great-grandfather was [[John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough|John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]], therefore, making Guest a second cousin of Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].

==Career==
===Military career===
During [[World War II]] he served with the [[United States Navy]]. He served on [[Minesweeper (ship)|mine sweeper]]s and was made head of the Navy section of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] in [[London]], [[England]]. By the time he left the military in 1946, he had risen to the rank of [[Commander]]. He was awarded  the [[Bronze Star]] and a [[Legion of Merit]], both with combat devices; the [[Croix de Guerre]] with star; the [[Order of the British Empire]];  the [[Norwegian Cross]]{{Clarify|date=September 2011}}, and the [[Danish Defense Medal]]{{Clarify|date=September 2011}}.

===Political career===
Guest was a member of the [[Senate of Virginia]] from 1947 to 1953, and served as the [[United States Ambassador to Ireland]] from 1965 to 1968.

===Thoroughbred racing===
In the United States, members of his mother's family have been major figures in the sport of thoroughbred racing for many decades. In England, Raymond Guest's sister, [[Diana Guest Manning]], owned and raced a horse she named [[Be My Guest (horse)|Be My Guest]] who was a [[conditions races|conditions race]] winner in England and Ireland as well as the [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1982. Raymond Guest also owned thoroughbreds which he raced in England, Ireland, France and the United States.  In Ireland his flat racehorses were trained by [[Vincent O'Brien]] and his [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]] horses by [[Dan Moore (horse racing)|Dan Moore]]. His racing colours were chocolate, pale blue hoops and cap. Guest is one of only four owners to win both [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] and the [[Grand National]], the others being [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], when [[Prince of Wales]], [[Dorothy Paget]] and Jim Joel.

The [[British flat racing Champion Owner]] in 1968, among Guest's successful horses in [[flat racing]] were [[Larkspur (horse)|Larkspur]], winner of the 1962 [[Epsom Derby]]; [[Sir Ivor]], winner of the 1968 [[2,000 Guineas Stakes|2,000 Guineas]], [[Epsom Derby]] and the [[Washington, D.C.

'''Robert Blincoe''' (c. 1792–1860) was an English author and former [[child labour]]er. He became famous during the 1830s for his popular autobiography, ''A Memoir of Robert Blincoe'', an account of his childhood spent in a [[workhouse]]. However, there are some doubts about whether this detailed observation of Blincoe's early life can be considered 'autobiography'. According to John Waller, in his book ''The Real Oliver Twist'', his life story was told to a John Brown, who wrote the manuscript of a biography of Blincoe before committing suicide later the same year.  But Brown had given his manuscript to a friend, Robert Carlile, who published the resulting book, ''A Memoir of Robert Blincoe'', in five episodes in his magazine ''The Lion'' in 1832.

== Early life ==
Robert Blincoe was born around 1792. By 1796 he was an orphan and living in the St. Pancras workhouse in London. His parents are unknown. At the age of six he was sent to work as a chimney boy, an assistant of a [[chimney sweeper]], but his master soon returned him to the workhouse.

In August 1799, at the age of seven, he was sold to work as a [[mule scavenger]] in the Gonalston Mill, a [[cotton mill]] of C.W. and F. Lambert in [[Lowdham]], near [[Nottingham]]. According to his later memoirs, he was one of the 80 seven-year-old children the St. Pancras workhouse sold to "[[indenture]]" as parish apprentices. They travelled there in wagons for five days. Ostensibly they were supposed to be schooled to better their lives, but that never happened.

Blincoe and the others lived in a dormitory, and their food consisted of [[porridge]] and black bread. They worked 14 hours a day, six days a week. Blincoe's first job was to pick up loose cotton waste from the spinning frames when the machine was working, even in the face of injury. He lost half a finger. Overseers beat the children on the slightest provocation. Blincoe later stated that he contemplated suicide many times. When Blincoe ran away and tried to flee to London, a tailor who sometimes worked for the mill recognized him and dragged him back.

In 1802, when Lowdham Mill was closed, Blincoe and others were sent to [[Litton Mill]] in Derbyshire. Treatment remained the same.

== Life later on ==
Blincoe completed his effective apprenticeship in stock weaving in 1813 and worked as an adult worker until 1817. He then left to found his own cotton-spinning business. In 1819, he married a woman named Martha.

== Writing ==
In 1822, journalist John Brown met Blincoe and interviewed him for an article about [[child labour]]. Brown decided to write Blincoe's biography and gave it to social activist [[Richard Carlisle]]. In 1828, Carlisle decided to publish the tale in his newspaper ''The Lion'' in five weekly episodes between 25 January and 22 February and ''The Poor Man's Advocate''. The book exposed the poor conditions in the cotton mills, and just after the reprint in 1832, the government investigated the mills.

Blincoe's spinning machinery was destroyed in a fire in 1828. Destitute and unable to pay his debts, he was imprisoned in [[Lancaster Castle]] for some time. After his release, he became a cotton-waste dealer. This business was finally successful, and he was able to pay for his three children's education.

In 1832, John Doherty published ''A Memoir of Robert Blincoe'' in a [[pamphlet]] form. In an interview of Employment of Children in Manufactories Committee in 1832, he stated that he'd rather see his children [[penal transportation|transported]] to Australia than put them to work in factories.

== Death and legacy ==
Blincoe died of bronchitis in his daughter's house in 1860.

Historian John Waller has asserted that [[Charles Dickens]] based his character [[Oliver Twist]] on Blincoe, but no firm documentary or anecdotal evidence exists that Dickens had heard of Blincoe.

'''Rosa Parks Transit Station''' is an [[intermodal transit]] station in [[Downtown Jacksonville|Downtown]] [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. It is operated by the [[Jacksonville Transportation Authority]] and serves as Jacksonville's main city [[bus station]] as well as a station for the [[Jacksonville Skyway]] elevated [[people mover]] and the [[First Coast Flyer]] [[bus rapid transit]] system. It is located on Hogan Street between State Street and Union Street, and is the Skyway's northern terminus. It is across the street from the Downtown campus of [[Florida State College at Jacksonville]].

==History==
The station was built in 1997 to serve as both a new [[bus station]] and the northern terminus of the new north-south segment of the [[Jacksonville Skyway]], allowing access to the state college. Construction on the Skyway extension began in 1993, and coincided with the system's switch from [[Matra]] to [[Bombardier Transportation]] technology. The station became operational on December 15, 1997.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jtbell.net/transit/Jacksonville/ |title= Jacksonville, Florida: The Skyway |last1= Bell |first1= Jon |date= December 22, 2014 |website= www.jtbell.net |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stripped book''' is a [[mass market paperback]] that has been stripped of its cover in order to be [[Pulping|pulped]] and [[Paper recycling|recycled]] as a result of lack of sales. The covers are returned to the publisher as evidence that the books have been destroyed and the books are discarded or recycled into paper or cardboard products. However, some stripped books end up back on the marketplace, and are sold at places like [[flea markets]].

==Release==
[[File:Trust FX.png|thumb|right|175px|Promotional poster.]]

===Marketing===
On January 9, 2018, FX released the first official trailer for the series.&lt;ref name="FirstTrailer"/&gt;

===Controversy===
On March 16, 2018, it was reported that [[Ariadne Getty]], John Paul Getty III's sister, was considering legal action against FX and the producers of the series. Her attorney Martin Singer released a statement calling the series a "wildly sensationalized false portrayal" of the Getty family and that "It is ironic that you have titled your television series ''Trust''. More fitting titles would be ''Lies'' or ''Mistrust'', since the defamatory story it tells about the Gettys colluding in the kidnapping is false and misleading." In the statement, Singer went on to explain how his client objects to the alleged portrayal of the family as having played a role in the kidnapping themselves and that he considers it to be defamatory to falsely accuse someone of a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chmielewski|first1=Dawn C.|title=Getty Family Member Calls FX’s ‘Trust’ "Wildly Sensationalized False Portrayal", Warns Of Legal Action|url=http://deadline.com/2018/03/fx-trust-getty-family-warning-marty-singer-letter-1202339639/|website=Deadline|accessdate=March 17, 2018|date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nakamura|first1=Reid|title=Getty Lawyer Accuses FX's 'Trust' of 'Cruel and Mean-Spirited' Defamation|url=https://www.thewrap.com/getty-lawyer-accuses-fxs-trust-cruel-mean-spirited-defamation/|website=The Wrap|accessdate=March 17, 2018|date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cullins|first1=Ashley|title=Getty Family Member Says FX Series 'Trust' Is Defamatory, Threatens Legal Action|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/getty-family-member-says-fx-series-trust-is-defamatory-threatens-legal-action-1095172|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries|Eldridge Industries, LLC]]|accessdate=March 17, 2018|language=en|date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Beaufoy has stated that his decision to depict Getty as complicit in his own kidnapping was justified by his research into the matter, though none of the written biographies explicitly reach that conclusion. He stated that while reading Charles Fox's 2013 biography of Paul III, ''Uncommon Youth'', "It became clear, reading in between the lines... that he actually kidnapped himself..."&lt;ref name="Julie Miller"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/trust-fx-john-paul-getty-kidnapping| title=Trust: Did Paul Getty Really Stage His Kidnapping, as 'Trust' Suggests?| author=Julie Miller| publisher=Vanity Fair| date=2018-04-08| access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his theory, the plot then spiraled out of Paul's control when his grandfather refused to pay, causing several of his captors to sell their interest to a syndicate of more ruthless Mafiosi.&lt;ref name="Julie Miller"/&gt;

===Renewal plans===
On January 5, 2018, the series' producers appeared at the annual [[Television Critics Association]]'s winter press tour during a panel discussion of the show. Simon Beaufoy spoke about the tentative plans for a potential second season, saying, "The idea is to go back to the 1930s to discover how John Paul Getty I became this extraordinary person with this huge hole in his soul." He went on to add that FX was pleased with how the first season had turned out and that he would be interested in returning for subsequent seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Alessandro|first1=Lisa de Moraes,Anthony|title=‘Trust’ EP/Screenwriter Gives Glimpse Of Season 2 Details On J.

==Reception==
The first season of ''Trust'' has been met with a positive reception from critics. On the [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season holds a 75% approval rating with an average rating of 6.62 out of 10, based on 40 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, "Donald Sutherland delivers a powerful turn as the titular Getty in ''Trust'', yet another telling of the affluent family's saga."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/trust/s01/|title=Trust: Season 1|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 67 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/trust|title=Trust: Season 1|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matt Zoller Seitz]], reviewing for the pop-culture website [[Vulture magazine|Vulture]], called the show a "decadent true-crime with an acidic sense of humor" that "alternates satire, drama, kookiness, and shocking violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Seitz|first=Matt Zoller|authorlink=Matt Zoller Seitz|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/trust-fx-review.html|title='Trust' is decadent true-crime with an acidic sense of humor|website=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Media LLC]]|date=March 25, 2018|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' complimented the quality of the casting, noting that "Sutherland is predictably solid, but Fraser is the surprise, in what's perhaps his big comeback vehicle."
