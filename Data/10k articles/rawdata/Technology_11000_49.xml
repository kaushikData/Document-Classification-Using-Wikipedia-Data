'''AbioCor'''  was a total [[artificial heart]] (TAH) developed by the [[Massachusetts]]-based company [[AbioMed]]. It was fully implantable within a patient, due to a combination of advances in miniaturization, biosensors, [[plastics]] and energy transfer. The AbioCor ran on a [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable source of power]]. The internal battery was charged by a [[transcutaneous energy transmission]] (TET) system, meaning that no wires or tubes penetrated the skin, reducing the risk of infection. However, because of its size, this heart was only compatible with men who had a large frame. It had a product life expectancy of 18 months.&lt;ref name="HN_NMP188"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.healthnet.com/static/general/unprotected/pdfs/national/policies/TotalArtificialHeart.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Medical Policy - NMP188 |publisher=HealthNet |pages=17 |date=September 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Regence52"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blue.regence.com/trgmedpol/surgery/sur52.pdf |format=PDF |title=Medical Policy Manual - Policy No: 52 |publisher=Regence |pages=22 |date=December 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THIAbioCor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasheart.org/Research/Devices/abiocor.cfm |title=Heart Assist Devices - AbioCor Implantable |publisher=Texas Heart Institute |accessdate=15 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307073407/http://www.texasheart.org/research/devices/abiocor.cfm |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMAbioCorArch07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abiomed.com/products/product_details.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521005214/http://www.abiomed.com/products/product_details.cfm |title=Product Details |publisher=AbioMed |date=2007 |archivedate=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DowlingCurrent01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Current status of the AbioCor implantable replacement heart |journal=The Annals of Thoracic Surgery |author =Dowling, R.D. |author2 =Etoch, S.W. |author3 =Stevens, K.A. |author4 =Johnson, A.C. |author5 =Gray Jr., L.A. |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=S147–S149 |year=2001 |doi=10.1016/S0003-4975(00)02615-1 |pmid=11265850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AbioCor was surgically introduced into 15 total patients, 14 of them during a clinical trial and one after FDA approval. However, due to insufficient evidence of its efficacy, AbioMed abandoned further development of the product.&lt;ref name="LeprinceTotal15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eacts.org/media/245551/dailynews6oct15.pdf |format=PDF |title=Total artificial heart: What's new? |author=Leprince, P. |work=Daily News - EACTS |page=7 |publisher=European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery |date=6 October 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315225303/http://www.eacts.org/media/245551/dailynews6oct15.pdf |archivedate=March 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PalominoTheHeart15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/4/9665902/artificial-heart-transplant-cedars-sinai-clinical-trials |title=The Heart is Just a Pump: Inside the 50-year quest to build a mechanical organ |author =Palomino, J. |editor=Lopatto, E. |editor2=Zelenko, M. |work=The Verge |publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]] |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SC7Things14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.syncardia.com/2014-multimedia-releases/7-things-about-artificial-hearts-that-you-should-know/itemid-1715.html |title=7 Things About Artificial Hearts That You Should Know |publisher=SynCardia Systems, Inc. |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
AbioMed, Inc. began development of the AbioCor device in the 1990s, beginning animal studies in 1998 in preparation to demonstrate readiness for formal clinical trials in humans.&lt;ref name="DowlingCurrent01" /&gt; On January 30, 2001, the FDA granted AbioMed an investigational device exemption (IDE) for implantation into humans via a clinical trial.&lt;ref name="CastellucciAbiomed01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/786770 |title=Abiomed gets FDA approval to implant total artificial heart in humans |author =Castellucci, L. |work=Medscape |publisher=Medscape, Inc. |date=30 January 2001 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened the door for the first implantation of the AbioCor into [[Robert Tools]] on July 2, 2001. He lived for 151 days before having a fatal [[cerebrovascular accident]].&lt;ref name="THIAbioCor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMAbioCorReplaceArch07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abiomed.com/products/heart_replacement.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615022011/http://www.abiomed.com/products/heart_replacement.cfm |title=Heart Replacement |publisher=AbioMed |date=2007 |archivedate=June 15, 2007 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HamiltonAbioCor01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1936165_1936238,00.html |title=Abiocor Artificial Heart |author =Hamilton, A. |work=Time - Best Inventions of 2001 |publisher=Time, Inc. |date=19 November 2001 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time magazine awarded the AbioCor its Invention of the Year award in late 2001.&lt;ref name="HamiltonAbioCor01" /&gt;

The second patient, Tom Christerson, who was given less than a 20 percent chance of surviving 30 days at the time of his surgery, lived for 512 days after receiving the AbioCor, dying on February 7, 2003 due to the wearing out of an internal membrane of the AbioCor.&lt;ref name="IAHPTom03"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heartpioneers.com/releases/020703.html |title=Tom Christerson, World's Second Artificial Heart Patient, Passes Away February 7, 2003 |publisher=The Implantable Artificial Heart Project |date=7 February 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 12 patients had the device implanted into 2004, resulting in an average life span of less than five months among all 14 patients. In some cases the device extended survival by several months, allowing the patients to spend valuable time with family and friends. In two cases, the device extended survival by 10 and 17 months respectively, and one patient was discharged from the hospital to go home. For a patient to be eligible for implantation with the AbioCor, the person must have had severe [[heart failure]] (with failure of both [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s) and had to be likely to die within two weeks without [[heart transplantation|transplantation]].&lt;ref name="HN_NMP188" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Regence52" /&gt;

Though the device was initially rejected by FDA Circulatory System Devices Panel in 2005 for [[Humanitarian Device Exemption]] (HDE) status,&lt;ref name="HN_NMP188" /&gt; it was eventually approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] on September 5, 2006 for HDE status.&lt;ref name="IAHPAbiomed06"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heartpioneers.com/releases/090506.html |title=Abiomed Receives FDA Approval of The AbioCor, The World's First Completely Self-Contained, Implantable Artificial Heart |publisher=The Implantable Artificial Heart Project |date=5 September 2006 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only one patient received the AbioCor after approval, a "76-year-old man with congestive heart failure, who did not qualify for a heart transplant."&lt;ref name="RothmanSurgeons09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/06/first_artificial_heart_implant.html |title=Surgeons perform first artificial heart implant in New Jersey |author =Rothman, C. |work=NJ.com |publisher=New Jersey On-Line, LLC |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, key AbioCor researcher and developer David Lederman died from pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref name="HevesiDavid12"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/health/research/david-lederman-pioneer-of-artificial-heart-dies-at-68.html |title=David Lederman, Pioneer of Artificial Heart, Dies at 68 |author =Hevesi, D. |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=28 August 2012 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also had plans to improve the AbioCor with a second version based upon the AbioCor ventricles and the [[Penn State]] energy converter. It was expected to last for five years, more than triple the life expectancy of AbioCor. The company stated it would be 30 percent smaller than the original model, and it could be implanted in smaller men and women. Additional modifications were planned to reduce the patient's risk of stroke, which was a concern of the FDA.&lt;ref name="AMAbioCorReplaceArch07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AbioCorFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abiomed.com/assets/2010/11/AbioCor-FAQ-FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |title=AbioCor: Frequently Asked Questions |pages=2 |publisher=AbioMed, Inc. |date=November 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317223307/http://www.abiomed.com/assets/2010/11/AbioCor-FAQ-FINAL.pdf |archive-date=March 17, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|March 2016}}, AbioCor II has not come to fruition, however. Additionally, the AbioCor product has been removed from the AbioMed website, with several news agencies reporting in 2015 that the company had quietly abandoned further development of the device.&lt;ref name="LeprinceTotal15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PalominoTheHeart15" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
The AbioCor heart is featured in the 2009 film ''[[Crank: High Voltage]]'', when it is transplanted into the main character [[Chev Chelios]]'s ([[Jason Statham]]) chest after he had been abducted by Chinese mobsters in the very beginning of the movie. However, the heart depicted in the film has a much lower battery life but gives Chev [[superhuman]] athleticism when fully charged (for dramatic purposes).&lt;ref name="PSCrank"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siol.net/tv/naj_gledano/2012/08/adrenalin_2.aspx |title=Adrenalin 2: Visoka napetost (Crank: High Voltage) |work=PlanetSiol.net |publisher=TSmedia, medijske vsebine in storitve, d.o.o. |date=7 August 2012 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the heart in the movie is called AviCor.

'''Alice Ann Cornwell''' or '''Alice Whiteman''' or '''Alice Robinson''' (1 January 1852 – 7 January 1932) was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] goldmining industrialist and newspaper proprietor. She made her fortune from gold and floated her company on the London Stock Exchange. She was a confident business person investing in several companies including owning the [[Sunday Times]]

==Life==
Cornwell was born in [[West Ham]] in 1852 to Jemima and [[George Cornwell]]. She and her family emigrated to New Zealand when she was nine.&lt;ref name=cornodnb/&gt; Her father was an engineer.

Her first marriage was with the much older John Whiteman. He was a politician and publican. This marriage resulted in a legal separation before she left for England, but it was not ended until Whiteman died. 

Her fortune was made when she returned from England after education at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] to Australia. Her father was a successful engineer who was then prospecting but he was not making a profit. Cornwell studied his ground and convinced others that a major find lay beneath his land. Shafts were created where she had indicated and gold was reputedly found within 30 centimetres of where she had said it would be.&lt;ref name=cornodnb&gt;Griffiths, D. (2004-09-23). Cornwell [other married names Whiteman, Robinson], Alice Ann (1852–1932), gold-mining industrialist and newspaper proprietor. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 9 Dec. 2017, see [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-56583 link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 she returned to London as a reputed millionaire, although this may have been an exaggeration. Despite not being able to enter London's club's because of her gender she floated the "Midas Mine" on the London Stock Exchange. Moreover she also created the British and Australian Mining Trust and Investment Company. The purpose of this company was to allow people to invest money directly in Australian mines.&lt;ref name="aus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/alice-cornwell-fergus-hume-on-our-mysterious-madame-midas/news-story/0ab201c802e04c7db743c926183d516a|title=Woman with the golden touch|date=2017-01-27|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cornwell bought the [[Sunday Times]] in 1887 from Colonel [[George FitzGeorge]] who an illegitimate member of the Royal Family.&lt;ref name="Negev2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eilat Negev|title=The First Lady of Fleet Street: The Life, Fortune and Tragedy of Rachel Beer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvitAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT126|date=6 September 2012|publisher=Biteback Publishing|isbn=978-1-84954-460-3|pages=126–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her purpose was promote her new company and it was a gift to her lover Frederick Stannard (‘Phil’) Robinson.&lt;ref name=cornodnb/&gt; In 1888 her friend [[Fergus Hume]] wrote a novel, "Madame Midas" about a "Mrs Villiers" which was obviously based on Cornwell.&lt;ref name="aus"/&gt;

Cornwell sold the "Sunday Times" in 1893 to Frederick Beer, who already owned ''[[The Observer|Observer]]''. Beer appointed his wife, [[Rachel Beer|Rachel Sassoon Beer]], as editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Pearl of Days|author=Hobson, Harold, Knightley, Phillip and Russell, Leonard|year=1972|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|isbn=0 241 02266 5 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornwell's estranged first husband died in 1893&lt;ref&gt;[http://earlyphotographers.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/bardwell-william-h.html Bush Advocate cited by earlyphotographers], Volume IX, Issue 729, 19 January 1893, Page 2
&lt;/ref&gt; and she married Robinson in 1894.&lt;ref name=cornodnb/&gt;

Cornwell died in 1932 in [[Hove]].&lt;ref name=cornodnb/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2425">[[File:Autographic Register.jpg|thumb|right|Autographic Register - National Cash Register Company, 1898]]
An '''Autographic Register''' is a business machine invented in 1883 by James C. Shoup.  The device consisted two separate rolls of paper interleaved with [[carbon paper]]. Usually one or both of the rolls would be preprinted with form information. To operate the machine the user would write, for example, a sales receipt and the machine automatically produced a copy. The crank on the machine ejected the records and moved a blank form into view.  The original receipt produced would go to the user and the copy was filed.&lt;ref name=BusRef&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Register Co.|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/4/Standard-Register-Co.html|website=Reference for Business|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoup founded the Autographic Register Company in [[Hoboken, NJ]] to manufacture his invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoboken.pastperfectonline.com/bysearchterm?keyword=Autographic+Register+Company|website=Hoboken Historical Museum Online Collections Database|title=Autographic Register Company|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Autographic Register was an advance over use of separate forms and carbon paper as it guaranteed that the copy was made and kept the forms in relative alignment. A number of advancements were soon made, including the use of sprocket-fed paper, invented by Theodore Schirmer. This helped avoid slippage and misalignment of forms, allowing more copies to be produced simultaneously. In 1912 Schirmer founded the [[Standard Register Industrial|Standard Register Company]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Standard Register|title=100 Years of Innovation|url=http://media.standardregister.com/standard-register/docs/company/Centennial-Whitepaper.pdf|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of sprocket-fed paper later found use in computer printers.

Although the Autographic Register has been largely replaced by newer technology it remains in use as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portable Register - Plastic Register for 4 x 6 Forms|url=https://www.deluxe.com/shopdeluxe/pd/portable-register-plastic-register-for-4-x-6-forms/_/A-D924|website=Deluxe Enterprise Operations|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bidji''' project is a set of tools for data transformation and code generation.

The project is a mix between [[Apache Ant]] and the [[FreeMarker]] template engine. They combine together very well to offer maximum flexibility for code generation for any computer language (java, php, c++, etc.) or text documentation (docbook, markdown, plantuml, graphviz, etc.).

==Background==
The groundwork for the billionaire space race and [[NewSpace]] was arguably laid by [[Peter Diamandis]], an American entrepreneur. In the 1980s, he founded an American national student space society, the [[Students for the Exploration and Development of Space]] (SEDS). Later, [[Jeff Bezos]] became a chapter president of SEDS. In the 1990s, Diamandis, dissolute with the state of space development, decided to spur it on and spark the suborbital space tourism market, by initiating a prize, the [[X Prize]]. This led to [[Paul Allen]] becoming involved in the competition, creating the [[Scaled Composites Tier One]] platform of [[SpaceShipOne]] and [[White Knight One]] which won the [[Ansari X-Prize]] in the 2000s. The technology of the winning entrant was then licensed by [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Group]] as a basis to found [[Virgin Galactic]]. The base techniques of Tier One also form the basis for [[Stratolaunch Systems]] of [[Vulcan Aerospace]].&lt;ref name=WashPost-2016-09-19&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-billionaire-space-barons-and-the-next-giant-leap/2016/08/19/795a4012-6307-11e6-8b27-bb8ba39497a2_story.html |title= The renegade whose dream started the latest space race |author= Vivek Wadhwa |date= 19 September 2016 |publisher= Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISBN 1594206724"&gt;{{cite book |title= How to Make a Spaceship: A Band of Renegades, an Epic Race, and the Birth of Private Spaceflight |author= Julian Guthrie |date= 2016 |isbn= 978-1594206726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The billionaire space race shows the aims of billionaires extend beyond just fulfilling government contracts, with their own gilding of the [[space age]], in extending capabilities and their own luster. Elon Musk has expressed excitement for a new space race.&lt;ref name=Guardian-2018-02-09&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/09/new-space-race-billionaires-elon-musk-jeff-bezos |title= The new space race: how billionaires launched the next era of exploration |author= Alan Yuhas |date= 9 February 2018 |publisher= The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Rivalries==
{{expand section|date=April 2017}}

===SpaceX vs Blue Origin===
[[SpaceX]] and [[Blue Origin]] have had a long history of conflict.&lt;ref name=TheWeek-2016-09-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost-2016-08-19/&gt; There is a vision of a hare versus a tortoise, for the two respectively, from Blue Origin's standpoint.&lt;ref name=INverse-2016-04-15&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.inverse.com/article/14059-the-mystery-behind-blue-origin-s-turtle-friendly-coat-of-arms |title= The Mystery Behind Blue Origin's Turtle-Friendly Coat of Arms |author= Lauren J. Young |date= 15 April 2016 |publisher= inVERSE }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Origin and SpaceX have had dueling press releases that compete with each other's announcements and events.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg-2017-03-08&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-08/spacex-reflying-rocket-this-month-in-step-toward-cheap-launches |title= SpaceX Will Launch Its First Reused Rocket Later This Month |author= Dana Hull |date= 8 March 2017 |publisher= Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gizmodo-2017-03-31&gt;{{cite news |url= https://gizmodo.com/is-blue-origins-tourist-capsule-sexier-than-spacexs-1793906303 |title= Is Blue Origin's Tourist Capsule Sexier Than SpaceX's? |author= Rae Paoletta |date= 31 March 2017 |publisher= Gizmodo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SpaceX and Blue Origin battled for the right to lease [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|SLC 39A]], the rocket launch platform that was used to launch the Apollo moon missions. SpaceX won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed suit in court against that. It is currently in the hands of SpaceX, while Blue Origin rented [[SLC 36]] instead.&lt;ref name=WashPost-2016-08-19/&gt;

SpaceX filed suit against Blue Origin to invalidate their patent on landing rockets aboard ships at sea. They won their court fight in 2014. SpaceX had been attempting to land rockets at sea since 2014, finally succeeding in 2016, before Blue Origin ever even built a sea-going platform to land rockets onto.&lt;ref name=WashPost-2016-08-19/&gt;

SpaceX and Blue Origin got into a Twitter battle about the meaning of a used rocket, landed rocket, spacerocket, at the end of 2015, when [[New Shepard]] successfully landed, after a suborbital jaunt into space. SpaceX had previously launched and landed its [[SpaceX Grasshopper|Grasshopper]] rocket multiple times without reaching space. Then SpaceX landed a [[Falcon 9]] first stage, which had been used to launch a satellite into orbit, prompting more Twitter battle at the start of 2016.&lt;ref name=WashPost-2016-08-19/&gt;

In late 2016, Blue Origin announced the [[New Glenn]], directly competing against SpaceX's [[Falcon Heavy]], with a larger rocket but lower payload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.cnet.com/news/new-glenn-rocket-from-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-to-compete-with-spacex/ |title= Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to take on SpaceX with supersized rocket New Glenn |author= Eric Mack |date= 12 September 2016 |publisher= cNet news }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2016 [[International Astronautical Congress]] in Guadalajara, Mexico, Blue Origin President Rob Meyerson elaborated on the Bezos vision previously outlined in the New Glenn announcement. The Blue Origin [[New Armstrong]] would be similar in function to the SpaceX [[Interplanetary Transport System]] that Elon Musk unveiled at the same conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.geekwire.com/2016/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-mars-moon/ |title= Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin space venture sets its sights on trips to Mars and the moon |author= Alan Boyle |date= 27 September 2016 |publisher= GeekWire }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue Origin vs Virgin Galactic===
[[Blue Origin]] and [[Virgin Galactic]] are in the same market, [[suborbital]] [[space tourism]], with [[New Shepard]] and [[SpaceShipTwo]] ([[Scaled Composites Tier 1b|Tier 1b]]), respectively. They are in a race to be first to launch paying customers on short spaceshots, with rival technological philosophies of [[space capsule]]s and [[spaceplane]]s, respectively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sciencealert.com/virgin-galactic-just-got-awarded-their-operating-license |title= Virgin Galactic is finally licensed to take tourists into space |author= Josh Hrala |date= 4 August 2016 |publisher= Science Alert }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/19/news/companies/blue-origin-rocket-landing-fourth-mission/ |title= Blue Origin successfully crash tests space-tourism capsule |author= Jackie Wattles |date= 20 June 2016 |publisher= CNN Money }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMail-2016-08-01&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3718927/Virgin-Galactic-space-race-FAA-gives-Richard-Branson-s-firm-operating-license-space-tourism.html |title= Virgin Galactic is back in the space race: FAA gives Richard Branson's firm operating license for space tourism |author= Mark Prigg |date= 1 August 2016 |publisher= Daily Mail (London) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyBeast-2016-06-19&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/19/jeff-bezos-ready-to-beat-richard-branson-in-the-billionaire-space-race.html |title= Jeff Bezos Ready to Beat Richard Branson in the Billionaire Space Race |date= 19 June 2016 |author= Clive Irving |publisher= The Daily Beast }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortune-2016-11-15/&gt;

===Virgin Galactic vs SpaceX===
[[Virgin Galactic]] and [[SpaceX]] support competing communications satellite constellations. Each would launch their satellites on their own launchers, [[LauncherOne]] and [[Falcon 9]]/[[Falcon Heavy]] respectively. The satellite systems would compete for the same market and same bandwidth and go head-to-head at the [[International Telecommunications Union|ITU]] for satellite frequency licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://spacenews.com/spacex-opening-seattle-plant-to-build-4000-broadband-satellites/ |title= SpaceX To Build 4,000 Broadband Satellites in Seattle |author= Peter B. de Selding |date= 19 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.satellitetoday.com/launch/2016/04/27/launcherone-to-start-test-missions-in-2017/ |title= LauncherOne to Start Test Missions in 2017 |author= Caleb Henry |date= 27 April 2016 |publisher= Satellite Today |work= Via Satellite }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratolaunch vs Virgin Galactic===
[[Vulcan Aerospace]] subsidiary [[Stratolaunch Systems]] plans to air-launch satellite launcher rockets, the same profile as planned by [[Virgin Galactic]] for its [[LauncherOne]] operations. While LauncherOne is already under development and launch aircraft procured (once [[White Knight Two]], now 747 [[Cosmic Girl (airplane)|Cosmic Girl]]), the [[Scaled Composites]] "Roc" [[Scaled Composites Model 351|Model 351]] is still being developed and the rocket to mate to it has yet to be selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2016/0620/Paul-Allen-vs.-Elon-Musk-a-different-approach-to-satellite-launches |title= Paul Allen vs. Elon Musk: a different approach to satellite launches |author= Max Lewontin |date= 20 June 2016 |publisher= Christian Science Monitor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on the space sector==
The billionaire space race and the rise of Space 2.0 has impacted on "Old Space", the old space hands of the pre-existing aerospace sector. The disruptive forces of NewSpace may wash away some of the standing members of the community. In particular SpaceX and Blue Origin represent existential threats to the old boys club and staid storied enterprises of aerospace. SpaceX challenges all members of the old guard with the pricing of its launch vehicles, being lower than the previous low cost leader, the Chinese launch services. It greatly undercuts the monopolistic leader of the European and American space launch services sectors, respectively, [[ArianeSpace]] and [[United Launch Alliance]] (an alliance of [[Boeing]] and [[Lockheed Martin]]). The position of Blue Origin is that of a future threat. Both SpaceX and Blue Origin put forth reusable launch vehicles, forcing ULA and Ariane to design next generation rockets with partial reusability features to attempt to reduce costs to be competitive with the new twin threats, using the [[ULA Vulcan|Vulcan]] and [[Ariane 6]] respectively. Boeing has also fired shots across the bow of SpaceX (and others) in the race to Mars, intending to arrive first. Boeing and SpaceX both are exploring sub-orbital transport with hypersonic rocket transports, SpaceX basing it on reusable Falcon 9 technology, which would compete with transcontinental and transoceanic air travel.&lt;ref name=Fortune-2016-10-26&gt;{{cite news |url= http://fortune.com/spacex-ula-lockheed-boeing-rocket-race/ |title= The Great Rocket Race |author= Clay Dillow |date= 26 October 2016 |publisher= Fortune }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired-2011-04-18&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/2011/04/china-wonders-about-spacexs-rock-bottom-prices/ |title= China Wonders About SpaceX’S Rock Bottom Prices |author= Jason Paur |date= 18 April 2011 |publisher= Wired }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SatLight-2011-05-04&gt;{{cite news |url= http://satellite.tmcnet.com/topics/satellite/articles/171190-spacex-defends-its-cheaper-than-china-launchers-cost.htm |title= SpaceX Defends its 'Cheaper than China' Launchers, Cost Structure |author= Doug Mohney |publisher= Satellite Light |date= 4 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MotleyFool-2016-05-01&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/01/could-europes-ariane-6-rocket-beat-spacexs.aspx |title= Could Europe's Ariane 6 Rocket Beat SpaceX's? |author= Rich Smith |date= 1 May 2016 |publisher= The Motley Fool }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSMon-2016-10-10&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/1010/Did-Boeing-s-CEO-just-kick-off-a-billionaires-space-race |title= Did Boeing's CEO just kick off a billionaires' space race? |author= Ben Rosen |date= 10 October 2016 |publisher= Christian Science Monitor }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MotleyFool-2016-10-15&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/15/boeing-boasts-well-beat-spacex-to-mars.aspx |title= Boeing Boasts: We'll Beat SpaceX to Mars! |author= Rich Smith |date= 15 October 2016 |publisher= Motley Fool }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biotechnology consulting''' (or biotech consulting) refers to the practice of assisting organizations involved in research and commercialization of [[biotechnology]] in improving their methods and efficiency of production, and approaches to [[R&amp;D]]. This assistance is usually provided in the form of specialized technological advice and sharing of expertise. Both start-up and established organizations would hire biotechnology consultants mainly to receive an independent and professional advice from key opinion leaders, individuals with extensive knowledge and experience in a particular area of biotechnology or [[biological science]]s, and, often, to outsource their projects for implementation by well qualified individuals. Large management consulting firms would often be able to provide technological advice as well, depending on the qualifications of their consulting team. With the growth of [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]], biotechnology consulting has recently developed into an industry of its own and separated from the [[management consulting]] industry that traditionally also provides technological advice on R&amp;D projects to various industries. This has also been fueled by the impact various conflicts of interests can have on [[commercialization]] when biotechnology organizations contract services from [[academic institution]]s or government scientists&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Fox. Biotech consulting, investing by NIH scientists curbed. Nature Biotechnology. (2005) 23, 274. [http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n3/abs/nbt0305-274.html ] {{doi|10.1038/nbt0305-274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is exemplified by the successful emergence of a large number of consulting companies dedicated exclusively to servicing the biotech industry. Occasionally, [[university professor]]s and Phd students engage in biotechnology consulting, either commercially or free of charge.

A special type of consulting is [[patent]] strategy and management consulting or simply '''patent consulting''' which specifically emphasizes on the scope of [[patent rights]] versus R&amp;D in industry. It also assets successful commercialization of patentable matter. The primary aim of patent consulting company is to assist various small, medium and large corporation in realizing their research project toward successful patent registration with minimized danger of infringement and other risks that patent registrations may be subjected to prior to commercialization. One example of patent consulting firm is ''The Patent World''.

'''Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc.'''(CPI), doing business as Guidant Cardiac Rhythm Management, manufactured implantable cardiac rhythm management devices, such as [[pacemaker]]s and [[defibrillator]]s. It also sold insulin pumps controlled by microprocessors and various equipments to regulate heart rhythm. In addition, Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. developed therapies for the treatment of irregular heartbeats. The company was founded in 1971 and is based in St. Paul, Minnesota. Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of [[Boston Scientific Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4223331|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition &amp; Mergers==
CPI was a highly successful start up venture, increasing sales from zero in 1972 to over $47 million and highly profitable when it was acquired by [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in 1978 for $127 million. During the 1970s, Lilly acquired other medical device companies including IVAC of San Diego, Physio Control of Redmond WA, and Advanced Cardiovascular Systems of Santa Clara, CA. These companies formed the core product/therapy areas of the Medical Devices Division of Eli Lilly and Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneers of the Medical Device Industry|website=www.mnhs.org/collections/medTech/org_cardiac_pacemakers.php|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World's first use of the lithium battery==
CPI designed and manufactured the worlds first pacemaker with a lithium anode and a lithium-iodide electrolyte solid-state battery. An improved heart pacer including the conventional combination of a pulse generator, electrode means, and electrode leads coupling the pulse generator to the electrodes, wherein the battery power source of the pulse generator is a solid-state battery with a lithium anode and a lithium-iodide electrolyte.(see [[Wilson Greatbatch]], ed.). The pacer structure is enclosed in a hermetically sealed metallic enclosure, with means being provided in the enclosure for passing electrode leads in sealed relationship therethrough. The outer surface of the casing is polished metal*, and is continuous in all areas. In certain instances, the continuity may be with the exception of the zone through which the external electrode leads pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal-enclosed cardiac pacer with solid-state power source|website=www.google.com/patents/US3822707?dq=3822707|publisher=US3822707 A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CPI Pacemaker.jpg|thumb|World's first lithium battery powered pacemaker]] Lithium-iodide or lithium anode cells became the standard for future pacemaker designs.

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

In the [[Ecommerce|e-commerce]] industry, '''conversion as a service''' is a method of online [[conversion optimization]] that is a customized intersection of art and technology that combines [[analytics]], [[behavioral targeting]], [[software]], style, and business rules to exact success.&lt;ref name="What Are Some Top Strategies For Conversion Optimization?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johns|first=Andy|title=What Are Some Top Strategies For Conversion Optimization?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/03/28/what-are-some-top-strategies-for-conversion-optimization/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach advocates a holistic approach to achieve an improvement in [[Conversion rate|online conversion]].&lt;ref name="Conversion Optimization In The New Marketing Landscape"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brinker|first=Scott|title=Conversion Optimization In The New Marketing Landscape|url=http://searchengineland.com/conversion-optimization-in-the-new-marketing-landscape-88234|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversion as a Service (Caas) allows clients to take advantage of the accumulated expertise of a [[Vendor (supply chain)|vendor]], rather than either developing and maintaining the expertise in-house or [[outsourcing]] the expertise through a third-party services firm. Opting for vendor expertise ensures a knowledge base for the lifetime of the relationship and real-time program optimization.

CRO is a process of improving the performance of your website using user feedback and visitor analytics. There are some metrics on your website which you want to improve, normally called as key performance indicators. These factors can be improved via CRO.  Most of the time these metrics are associated with acquisition of new customers, downloads, sign up’s etc.In short,it is a process of improving the percentage of  passive visitors  into valuable consumers.

In the process of CRO, what visitors are searching and looking while they surf your site is found out  and that information to provide to them. Depending on what metrics you want to improve CRO may take varied forms.An example would  be placing strong call to actions on a high traffic but under optimized page. In some cases, it refers to removal of unnecessary and complicated steps from conversion funnel which hinder conversions.

== Key Characteristics ==

=== Pay-For-Performance Models ===
Performance measurement is key to Conversion as a Service. In [[pay to play|pay-for-performance]] models, the success or failure of a solution is not based on whether providers successfully deploy software, but on whether or not the solution delivers desired measurable results. In this model, providers and clients align their efforts to meet a set of agreed-upon metrics that determine whether or not the relationship is valuable.&lt;ref name="Are You Optimizing Your Website for Conversions?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilgore|first=Craig|title=Are You Optimizing Your Website for Conversions?|url=http://www.business2community.com/online-marketing/are-you-optimizing-your-website-for-conversions-0133423|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the metrics used in [[Electronic commerce|online commerce]] revolve around gains in incremental revenue directly attributable to a solution provider. The specific metric can vary, whether it is an increase in average order value, [[Upselling|up-sell]], or [[customer satisfaction]] or a decrease in cart abandonment or [[call center]] traffic, the solution provider must be able to demonstrate that an increase in revenue can be tied to the presence of their solution.

=== Goals ===
There are three goals for clarity in Pay-For-Performance Models:

;Transparency: Pay-for-performance models require a level of transparency on the part of the vendor to share with clients both the process for collecting the data and for measuring the results. Also, the calculations should be kept simple and the ability to inspect the data readily available.

;Alignment: Organizations often use metrics to define success for groups and individuals, to guide their activities, and to grade their performance. Similarly, vendors should be committed to meet the [[Strategic planning|business objectives]] of an organization through goals. In most pay-for-performance models, vendors define the metrics by which they will be graded. While this model forces vendors to perform, it does not guarantee that success will directly align with business needs. The models result from negotiations between vendors and clients to define the metrics and describe success.&lt;ref name="When It Comes To PR, Pay For Performance, Not Time"&gt;{{cite web|last=Konanykhin|first=Alexander|title=When It Comes To PR, Pay For Performance, Not Time|url=http://advertising.about.com/od/publicrelationsresources/a/guestprperform.htm|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Value: The goal of most online business is to generate [[revenue]]. If the system for measurement is transparent and the vendor goals are aligned with client objectives, then the amount of incremental revenue generated by a vendor becomes the final metric for success.&lt;ref name="The Power Of The Pay-For-Performance Model"&gt;{{cite web|last=Taulli|first=Tom|title=The Power Of The Pay-For-Performance Model|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2011/02/28/the-power-of-the-pay-for-performance-model/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Export of cryptography from the United States==
{{main|Export of cryptography from the United States}}

===Cold War era===
In the early days of the [[Cold War]], the U.S. and its allies developed an elaborate series of export control regulations designed to prevent a wide range of Western technology from falling into the hands of others, particularly the [[Eastern bloc]]. All export of technology classed as 'critical' required a license. [[CoCom]] was  organized to coordinate Western export controls.

Two types of technology were protected: technology associated only with weapons of war ("munitions") and dual use technology, which also had commercial applications. In the U.S., dual use technology export was controlled by the [[Department of Commerce]], while munitions were controlled by the [[State Department]]. Since in the immediate post WWII period the market for cryptography was almost entirely military, the encryption technology (techniques as well as equipment and, after computers became important, crypto software) was included as a Category XIII item into the [[United States Munitions List]]. The multinational control of the export of cryptography on the Western side of the cold war divide was done via the mechanisms of CoCom.

By the 1960s, however, financial organizations were beginning to require strong commercial encryption on the rapidly growing field of wired money transfer. The U.S. Government's introduction of the [[Data Encryption Standard]] in 1975 meant that commercial uses of high quality encryption would become common, and serious problems of export control began to arise. Generally these were dealt with through case-by-case export license request proceedings brought by computer manufacturers, such as [[IBM]], and by their large corporate customers.

===PC era===
Encryption export controls became a matter of public concern with the introduction of the [[personal computer]]. [[Phil Zimmermann]]'s [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] [[cryptosystem]] and its distribution on the [[Internet]] in 1991 was the first major 'individual level' challenge to controls on export of cryptography.  The growth of [[electronic commerce]] in the 1990s created additional pressure for reduced restrictions.&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-undercover-war-on-your-internet-secrets-how-online-surveillance-cracked-our-trust-in-the-web/ | title=The undercover war on your internet secrets: How online surveillance cracked our trust in the web | last=Ranger | first=Steve | work= | publisher=TechRepublic  | date=24 March 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612190952/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-undercover-war-on-your-internet-secrets-how-online-surveillance-cracked-our-trust-in-the-web/ | archive-date=2016-06-12| access-date=2016-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]]'s [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] technology was widely adopted as a method for protecting credit card transactions using [[public key cryptography]].

SSL-encrypted messages used the [[RC4 (cipher)|RC4]] cipher, and used 128-bit [[key (cryptography)|keys]]. U.S. government export regulations would not permit crypto systems using 128-bit keys to be exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/ssl-basics/index.html#a3|title=SSL by Symantec - Learn How SSL Works - Symantec|work=verisign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage Western governments had, in practice, a split personality when it came to encryption; policy was made by the military cryptanalysts, who were solely concerned with preventing their 'enemies' acquiring secrets, but that policy was then communicated to commerce by officials whose job was to support industry.

The longest [[key size]] allowed for export without individual license proceedings was [[40-bit encryption|40 bits]], so Netscape developed two versions of its [[web browser]]. The "U.S. edition" had the full 128-bit strength. The "International Edition" had its effective key length reduced to 40 bits by revealing 88 bits of the key in the SSL [[protocol (cryptography)|protocol]].  Acquiring the 'U.S. domestic' version turned out to be sufficient hassle that most computer users, even in the U.S., ended up with the 'International' version,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www26.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html?cp=hom01tdow |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990916095715/http://www26.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html?cp=hom01tdow# |archive-date=1999-09-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose weak [[40-bit encryption]] could be broken in a matter of days using a single personal computer. A similar situation occurred with Lotus Notes for the same reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government—Saving Privacy in the Digital Age]],'' Steven Levy, Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernstein v. United States|Legal challenges]] by [[Peter Junger]] and other civil libertarians and privacy advocates, the widespread availability of encryption software outside the U.S., and the perception by many companies that adverse publicity about weak encryption was limiting their sales and the growth of e-commerce, led to a series of relaxations in US export controls, culminating in 1996 in President [[Bill Clinton]] signing the [[Executive order (United States)|Executive order]] 13026&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/13026.pdf|format=PDF|title=Administration of Export Controls on Encryption Products|website=Federalregister.gov|accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferring the commercial encryption from the Munition List to the [[Commerce Control List]]. Furthermore, the order stated that, "the software shall not be considered or treated as 'technology'" in the sense of [[Export#United States|Export Administration Regulations]]. This order permitted the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to implement rules that greatly simplified the export of proprietary and [[Open-source software|open source]] software containing cryptography, which they did in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Current status===
As of 2009, non-military cryptography exports from the U.S. are controlled by the Department of Commerce's [[Bureau of Industry and Security]].&lt;ref name=cclsup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/pdf/ccl5-pt2.pdf|title=Regulations|author=Robin Gross|work=gpo.gov|access-date=2014-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203042133/http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/pdf/ccl5-pt2.pdf#|archive-date=2010-12-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some restrictions still exist, even for mass market products, particularly with regard to export to "[[rogue states]]" and [[terrorism|terrorist]] organizations. Militarized encryption equipment, [[TEMPEST]]-approved electronics, custom cryptographic software, and even cryptographic consulting services still require an export license&lt;ref name=cclsup/&gt; (pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7). Furthermore, encryption registration with the BIS is required for the export of "mass market encryption commodities, software and components with encryption exceeding 64 bits" ({{Federal Register|75|36494}}).

==Export of cryptography from the UK==
Until 1996, the UK government withheld export licenses from exporters unless they used weak ciphers or short keys, and generally discouraged practical public cryptography.&lt;ref name="ukpolicy"&gt;https://youtube.com/watch/LWwaVe1RF0c?t=1210&lt;/ref&gt; A debate about cryptography for the NHS brought this out in the open.&lt;ref name="ukpolicy" /&gt;

==Mobile phone signals==

===Clipper Chip===
[[File:Sink_Clipper_campaign.gif|thumb|right|[[RSA Security]] campaigned against the Clipper Chip backdoor, creating this memorable poster which became an icon of that debate.]]
{{main|Clipper chip}}
The Clipper chip was a chipset for mobile phones made by the NSA in the 1990s, which implemented encryption with a backdoor for the US government.&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"/&gt; The US government tried to get phone manufacturers to adopt the chipset, but without success, and the program was finally defunct by 1996.

===A5/1 (GSM encryption)===
{{main|A5/1}}
'''[[A5/1]]''' is a [[stream cipher]] used to provide over-the-air communication [[privacy]] in the [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] [[Cell phone|cellular telephone]] standard.

Security researcher [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] reported in 1994 that "there was a terrific row between the [[NATO]] [[SIGINT|signal intelligence agencies]] in the mid-1980s over whether GSM encryption should be strong or not. The Germans said it should be, as they shared a long border with the [[Warsaw Pact]]; but the other countries didn't feel this way, and the algorithm as now fielded is a French design."&lt;ref name="Ross94"&gt;{{cite newsgroup

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to professor Jan Arild Audestad, at the standardization process which started in 1982, A5/1 was originally proposed to have a key length of 128 bits. At that time, 128 bits was projected to be secure for at least 15 years. It is now estimated that 128 bits would in fact also still be secure as of 2014. Audestad, Peter van der Arend, and [[Thomas Haug]] say that the British insisted on weaker encryption, with Haug saying he was told by the British delegate that this was to allow the British secret service to eavesdrop more easily. The British proposed a key length of 48 bits, while the West Germans wanted stronger encryption to protect against East German spying, so the compromise became a key length of 56 bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/Sources-We-were-pressured-to-weaken-the-mobile-security-in-the-80s-7413285.html#.UtBeNpD_sQs|title=Sources: We were pressured to weaken the mobile security in the 80's|work=Aftenposten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DES Challenges==
{{main|DES Challenges}}
The widely used [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] encryption algorithm was originally planned by IBM to have a key size of 128 bits;&lt;ref&gt;Stallings, W.: ''Cryptography and network security: principles and practice.'' Prentice Hall, 2006. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; NSA lobbied for a key size of 48 bits. The end compromise were a key size of 64 bits, 8 of which were parity bits, to make an effective key security parameter of 56 bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/stanford-select/keeping-secrets-84a7697bf89f|title=Keeping Secrets|author=Stanford Magazine|work=Medium}}&lt;/ref&gt; DES was considered insecure as early as 1977&lt;ref name="dh-exh"&gt;{{cite journal

The [[DES Challenges]] were a series of [[brute force attack]] contests created by [[RSA Security]] to highlight the lack of security provided by the [[Data Encryption Standard]]. As part of the successful cracking of the DES-encoded messages, EFF constructed a specialized DES cracking computer nicknamed [[EFF DES cracker|Deep Crack]].

The successful cracking of DES likely helped gather both political and technical support for more advanced encryption in the hands of ordinary citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ce_nUNxdKV8C&amp;pg=PA277&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;dq=%22deep+crack%22+des+NIST&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ukGJWNH8wD&amp;sig=H_GWzRjuFILmwGvYn_kUUGnBIGU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D9NKVOSdDITmyQP854CwCA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22deep%20crack%22%20des%20NIST&amp;f=false|title=Brute Force|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, NIST began a [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|competition to select a replacement for DES]], resulting in the publication in 2000 of the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/g00-176.cfm Commerce Department Announces Winner of Global Information Security Competition].

==Snowden and NSA's bullrun program==
{{main|Bullrun (decryption program)}}
Fearing widespread adoption of encryption, the NSA set out to stealthily influence and weaken encryption standards and obtain master keys&amp;mdash;either by agreement, by force of law, or by computer network exploitation ([[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]).&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html|title=N.S.A. Able to Foil Basic Safeguards of Privacy on Web|date=6 September 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''New York Times'': "But by 2006, an N.S.A. document notes, the agency had broken into communications for three foreign airlines, one travel reservation system, one foreign government’s nuclear department and another’s Internet service by cracking the virtual private networks that protected them.  By 2010, the Edgehill program, the British counterencryption effort, was unscrambling VPN traffic for 30 targets and had set a goal of an additional 300."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

As part of Bullrun, NSA has also been actively working to "Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices used by targets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html|publisher=New York Times|title=Secret Documents Reveal N.S.A. Campaign Against Encryption}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' has reported that the random number generator [[Dual_EC_DRBG]] contains a back door from the NSA, which would allow the NSA to break encryption relying on that random number generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/new-york-times-provides-new-details-about-nsa-backdoor-in-crypto-spec/|title=New York Times provides new details about NSA backdoor in crypto spec|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Dual_EC_DRBG was known to be an insecure and slow random number generator soon after the standard was published, and the potential NSA backdoor was found in 2007, and alternative random number generators without these flaws were certified and widely available, [[RSA Security]] continued using Dual_EC_DRBG in the company's [[BSAFE toolkit]] and [[Data Protection Manager (RSA Security)|Data Protection Manager]] until September 2013. While RSA Security has denied knowingly inserting a backdoor into BSAFE, it has not yet given an explanation for the continued usage of Dual_EC_DRBG after its flaws became apparent in 2006 and 2007,&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/rsa-warns-developers-against-its-own.html|title=RSA warns developers not to use RSA products|author=Matthew Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it was reported on December 20, 2013 that RSA had accepted a payment of $10 million from the NSA to set the random number generator as the default.&lt;ref name="RSApaid"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/20/us-usa-security-rsa-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220 | title=Exclusive: Secret contract tied NSA and security industry pioneer | date=December 20, 2013 |publisher=Reuters | accessdate=December 20, 2013 | author=Menn, Joseph | location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters in San Francisco |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/20/nsa-internet-security-rsa-secret-10m-encryption |title=$10m NSA contract with security firm RSA led to encryption 'back door' &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked NSA documents state that their effort was “a challenge in finesse” and that “Eventually, N.S.A. became the sole editor” of the standard.

By 2010, the NSA had developed “groundbreaking capabilities” against encrypted Internet traffic. A GCHQ document warned however “These capabilities are among the Sigint community’s most fragile, and the inadvertent disclosure of the simple ‘fact of’ could alert the adversary and result in immediate loss of the capability.”&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Another internal document stated that “there will be NO ‘[[need to know]].’”&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Several experts, including [[Bruce Schneier]] and [[Christopher Soghoian]], have speculated that a successful attack against [[RC4]], a 1987 encryption algorithm still used in at least 50 per cent of all SSL/TLS traffic is a plausible avenue, given several publicly known weaknesses of RC4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/06/nsa_cryptobreaking_bullrun_analysis/|title=That earth-shattering NSA crypto-cracking: Have spooks smashed RC4?|work=theregister.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have speculated that NSA has gained ability to crack 1024-bit [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] and [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange|Diffie–Hellman]] public keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2064960/google-strengthens-its-ssl-configuration-against-possible-attacks.html|title=Google strengthens its SSL configuration against possible attacks|author=Lucian Constantin|date=19 November 2013|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of researchers have pointed out that there is wide reuse of a few non-ephemeral 1024 bit primes in Diffie–Hellman implementations, and that NSA having done precomputation against those primes in order to break encryption using them in real time is very plausibly what NSA's "groundbreaking capabilities" refer to.&lt;ref name=imperfectfs&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adrian |first1=David |last2=Bhargavan |first2=Karthikeyan |last3=Durumeric |first3=Zakir |last4=Gaudry |first4=Pierrick |last5=Green |first5=Matthew |last6=Halderman |first6=J.

The Bullrun program is controversial, in that it is believed that NSA deliberately inserts or keeps secret vulnerabilities which affect both law-abiding US citizens as well as NSA's targets, under its [[NOBUS]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-06/dear-nsa-thanks-for-making-us-all-insecure|title=Dear NSA, Thanks for Making Us All Insecure|first=David|last=Meyer|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, NSA has two jobs: prevent vulnerabilities that affect the US, and find vulnerabilities that can be used against US targets; but as argued by Bruce Schneier, NSA seems to prioritize finding (or even creating) and keeping vulnerabilities secret. Bruce Schneier has called for the NSA to be broken up so that the group charged with strengthening cryptography is not subservient to the groups that want to break the cryptography of its targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/02/breaking_up_the.html|title=Schneier on Security|work=Schneier.com|accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encryption of smartphone storage==
As part of the Snowden leaks, it became widely known that intelligence agencies could bypass encryption of data stored on Android and iOS smartphones by legally ordering Google and Apple to bypass the encryption on specific phones. Around 2014, as a reaction to this, Google and Apple redesigned their encryption so that they did not have the technical ability to bypass it, and it could only be unlocked by knowing the user's password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/10/why-cant-apple-decrypt-your-iphone.html|title=A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering|author=Matthew Green|work=cryptographyengineering.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-national-security-free-speech/keeping-government-out-your-smartphone|title=Keeping the Government Out of Your Smartphone|work=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various law enforcements officials, including the [[Obama administration]]'s Attorney General [[Eric Holder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/30/us-usa-smartphones-holder-idUSKCN0HP22P20140930|title=U.S. attorney general criticizes Apple, Google data encryption|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; responded with strong condemnation, calling it unacceptable that the state could not access alleged criminals' data even with a warrant. One of the more iconic responses being the chief of detectives for Chicago’s police department stating that "Apple will become the phone of choice for the pedophile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2014/09/25/68c4e08e-4344-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html|title=FBI blasts Apple, Google for locking police out of phones|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington Post posted an editorial insisting that "smartphone users must accept that they cannot be above the law if there is a valid search warrant", and after agreeing that backdoors would be undesirable, suggested implementing a "golden key" backdoor which would unlock the data with a warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/compromise-needed-on-smartphone-encryption/2014/10/03/96680bf8-4a77-11e4-891d-713f052086a0_story.html|title=Compromise needed on smartphone encryption|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141006/01082128740/washington-posts-braindead-editorial-phone-encryption-no-backdoors-how-about-magical-golden-key.shtml|title=Washington Post's Clueless Editorial On Phone Encryption: No Backdoors, But How About A Magical 'Golden Key'?|work=Techdirt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI Director James Comey cited a number of cases to support the need to decrypt smartphones. Interestingly, in none of the presumably carefully handpicked cases did the smartphone have anything to do with the identification or capture of the culprits, and FBI seems to have been unable to find any strong cases supporting the need for smartphone decryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/17/draft-two-cases-cited-fbi-dude-dumb-dumb/|title=The FBI Director's Evidence Against Encryption Is Pathetic - The Intercept|work=The Intercept}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Schneier]] has labelled the right to smartphone encryption debate ''Crypto Wars II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/10/more_crypto_war.html|title=Schneier on Security|work=schneier.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cory Doctorow]] called it ''Crypto Wars redux''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/09/crypto-wars-redux-why-the-fbis-desire-to-unlock-your-private-life-must-be-resisted|title=Crypto wars redux: why the FBI's desire to unlock your private life must be resisted|date=October 9, 2014|author=Cory Doctorow|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2016, no bills have been passed.

In February 2016 the FBI obtained a court order demanding that Apple create and [[digital signature|electronically sign]] new software which would enable the FBI to unlock an [[iPhone 5c]] it recovered from [[Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik#Rizwan Farook|one of the shooters]] in the 2015 terrorist [[2015 San Bernardino attack|attack in San Bernardino, California]]. Apple has challenged the order. In the end the FBI hired a third party to crack the phone. ''See'' [[FBI–Apple encryption dispute]].

In April 2016, [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Richard Burr]] sponsored an overly vague bill that would be likely to criminalise all forms of [[strong encryption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-encryption-legislation-idUSL2N17B1FT|title=Leak of Senate encryption bill prompts swift backlash|author=Dustin Volz and Mark Hosenball|date=April 8, 2016|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/encryption-backdoors-legislation-richard-burr-diane-feinstein/|title=Senate bill effectively bans strong encryption|work=The Daily Dot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/leaked-burr-feinstein-encryption-bill-is-a-threat-to-american-privacy|title='Leaked' Burr-Feinstein Encryption Bill Is a Threat to American Privacy|work=Motherboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Messengers with end-to-end encryption and responsible encryption ==

In October 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called for responsible encryption&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/as-doj-calls-for-responsible-encryption-expert-asks-responsible-to-whom/&lt;/ref&gt; as a solution to the ongoing problem of "going dark".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbi.gov/services/operational-technology/going-dark&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to wiretapping court orders and police measures increasingly becoming ineffective as strong end-to-end encryption are increasingly added to widespread messenger products. Responsible encryption means that companies need to introduce [[key escrow]] that allows them to provide their customers with a way to recover their encrypted data if they forget their password, so that it is not lost forever. According to Rosenstein's reasoning, it would be irresponsible to leave the user helpless in such a case. As a pleasant side effect, this would allow a judge to issue a search warrant instructing the company to decrypt the data, which the company would then be able to comply with. In contrast to previous proposals, the decentral storage of key recovery material by companies instead of government agencies would be an additional safeguard.

== Front doors ==
In 2015 the head of the NSA, Admiral Michael S. Rogers suggested to further decentralize the key escrow by introducing "front doors" instead of back doors into encryption.&lt;ref name=front&gt;https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/203275-the-nsa-wants-front-door-access-to-your-encrypted-data&lt;/ref&gt; This way, the key would be split into two halves, with one half being kept by the government authorities and the other by the company responsible for the encryption product. Thus, the government would still have to get a search warrant to obtain the other half of the key from the company, and the company would be unable to abuse the key escrow to access the user's data, since it would lack the other half of the key kept by the government. Experts were not impressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Dennis |title=Crypto ‘Front Door’ Debate Likely to Go On For Years |url=https://threatpost.com/crypto-front-door-debate-likely-to-go-on-for-years/112350/ |accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=Threatpost |date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=front/&gt;

== Lightweight encryption ==
In 2018, the NSA promoted the use of "lightweight encryption", in particular its ciphers [[Simon (cipher)|Simon]] and [[Speck (cipher)|Speck]], for [[Internet of Things]] devices.&lt;ref name=Beaulieu2015&gt;{{cite web

==2015 UK call for outlawing non-backdoored cryptography==
Following the 2015 [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], a terrorism attack, former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] called for outlawing non-backdoored cryptography, saying that there should be no "means of communication" which "we cannot read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30794953|title=BBC News - Can the government ban encryption?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/uk-prime-minister-wants-backdoors-into-messaging-apps-or-hell-ban-them/|title=UK prime minister wants backdoors into messaging apps or he’ll ban them|work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; US president Barack Obama sided with Cameron on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-39944|title=Obama Sides with Cameron in Encryption Fight|author=Danny Yadron|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1934">A '''de-asphalter''' is a unit in a crude [[oil refinery]] or [[Upgrader|bitumen upgrader]] that separates [[asphalt]] from [[crude oil]] or [[bitumen]]. 

The de-asphalter unit is usually placed after the vacuum distillation tower. It is usually a solvent de-asphalter unit, SDA. The SDA separates the asphalt from the feedstock because light hydrocarbons will dissolve [[aliphatic]] compounds but not [[asphaltene]]s. The output from the de-asphalter unit is de-asphalted oil ("DAO") and [[asphalt]]. 

DAO from [[propane]] de-asphalting has the highest quality but lowest yield, whereas using [[pentane]] may double or triple the yield from a heavy feed, but at the expense of contamination by metals and carbon residues that shorten the life of downstream cracking catalysts.&lt;ref name="McKetta_1992"&gt;{{cite book |author=John J. McKetta |title=Petroleum Processing Handbook |publisher=CRC Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-8247-8681-6 |page=536 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xlqsr_K59mcC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=McKetta,+John+J.+Petroleum+Processing+Handbook.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[solvent]] is [[butane]] the unit will be referred to as a [[butane de-asphalter]] ("BDA") and if the solvent is [[propane]], it will be called a [[propane de-asphalter]] ("PDA") unit.

==History==
Founded in 1930, The Fire Equipment Manufacturers’  FEMA is an international, non-profit [[trade association]] dedicated to manufacturing commercial fire protection equipment to serve as the first line of defense against fire in its early stages. The association centers its efforts around the key premise that safety to life is best achieved through the implementation of a “balanced fire protection design” – a concept in which a proactive safety plan does not rely on any single safeguard.

The Fire Equipment Manufacturers' Association works in conjunction with the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA), [[International Code Council]], local, state, national officials to advance positive [[fire code|fire]] and [[building code]]s, laws and [[Underwriters Laboratories| Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.]] regarding relevant safety standards.

==Mission==
Member companies unite to save lives and protect property through education and awareness, advancement
of the fire equipment marketplace and improvement in regulatory requirements.

==Divisions==
The Fire Equipment Manufacturers’ Association is organized into three divisions:
* Interior Equipment/[[Standpipe (firefighting)|Standpipe]][[fire hose]]
* Portable [[fire extinguisher]]
* Pre-engineered [[fire suppression system]]

Member companies work in smaller product-specific teams, as well as collectively, to impact
industry issues and outcomes.

'''Fire art''' is a piece of art that uses active [[Fire|flames]] as an essential part of the piece. The piece may either use flame effects as part of a sculpture, or be a choreographed performance of fire effects as the piece burns; the latter being almost a type of [[performance art]]. 

Fire can be a compelling medium for artists and viewers. It has a direct effect on its surroundings, consuming materials and giving heat and light. It is constantly moving and can appear to be alive. There is also the inherent perceived danger of fire.

Fire artists use various [[fuel]]s and colorants to achieve desired effects. The choice of fuel is largely dependent on the effects desired. In large stationary pieces, [[propane]] gas is a popular fuel. Gas escaping from its container can be set alight. Different plumbing, pressures, nozzles alter the nature of the flames. Controlling how the propane mixes with the oxygen in the air is important. 

Liquid fuels like [[alcohol]], [[methanol]], [[kerosene]], mixes of kerosene and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], and others, can produce spectacular results. Extra precautions must be taken with liquids because they fall and splash, while gasses usually dissipate. 

Most colorants are solids ground into a powder. As the powder is heated, it begins to [[oxidize]] and burns a color particular to the chemical used. Some colorants can be dissolved in alcohol or water or other liquids to facilitate their dispersion in the fire. Some colorants are toxic and should not be used in proximity to people.

The '''Ground Combat Infantry Fighting Vehicle''' was an [[infantry fighting vehicle]] being developed for the [[U.S. Army]]. The program originated as the lead vehicle of the U.S. Army's [[BCT Ground Combat Vehicle Program|Ground Combat Vehicle]] program coordinated by [[TACOM]] and spawned a parallel program coordinated by [[DARPA]]. The purpose of the program was to replace existing [[armored personnel carriers]] and infantry fighting vehicles in U.S. Army service. &lt;!--The TACOM project aims to produce a [[prototype]] by 2015 and begin fielding by 2018 and --&gt; The DARPA project aimed to have the vehicle designed by 2015.&lt;ref name="Crains resubmit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contractors to resubmit bids for revamped military vehicle program|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20100926/SUB01/309269952/contractors-to-resubmit-bids-for-revamped-military-vehicle-program|publisher=Crain Communications Inc.  |accessdate=27 September 2010|author=Chad Halcom|date=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derivatives of the vehicle based on a common [[chassis]]—such as tanks and [[ambulance]]s—were expected to be manufactured.

== Design ==

The Army emphasized affordability, rapid deployment, and low risk technology for the GCV. The Army required that all aspects of the Ground Combat Vehicle be at [[technology readiness level]] 6.&lt;ref name="Greg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Army Wants Tough GCV Battle|url=http://www.dodbuzz.com/2010/03/05/army-wants-tough-gcv-competition/|publisher=Military Advantage|accessdate=11 August 2010|author=Greg Grant|date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contracting.tacom.army.mil"&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|url=http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/gcv/attach/Attch%200001_GCV%20IFV%20Statement%20of%20Work_RFP%20Amendments.pdf|title=Ground Combat Vehicle Infantry Fighting Vehicle Statement of Work|work=[[United States Army]]|publisher=|date=March 15, 2009|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortfalls of rapid deployment would be mitigated through an incremental addition of components as technology matures.&lt;ref name=Optimizing /&gt; The Army provided details from the Manned Ground Vehicle effort to utilize on the GCV.&lt;ref name="contracting.tacom.army.mil"/&gt; The GCV was required to have better protection than any vehicle in the military's inventory.&lt;ref name="Industry day 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry day #1|url=http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/gcv/ID_1_Master_19Oct091.pptx|accessdate=19 September 2010|author=MT Kash|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722183427/http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/gcv/ID_1_Master_19Oct091.pptx#|archive-date=2011-07-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Peter W. Chiarelli]] said that the "four main fundamentals" of the vehicle were: The ability to carry 12 soldiers and operate in all forms of combat; have significant protection; and deliver the first production vehicle by 2018.&lt;ref name="$462 million" /&gt;

The IFV would be [[Modular design|modular]] and [[BCT Network|networked]] and offer improved survivability, mobility, and power management functions. The GCV family would use technologies pioneered with the IFV lead vehicle effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://defense-update.com/newscast/0909/news/220909_ground_combat_vehicle.html|title=U.S. Army Defines  Ground Combat Vehicles (GCV) Priorities |work= [[Defense Update]] |publisher= |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mounted Soldier System cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mounted Soldier System]] will be standard wear for GCV crew members.]]
The [[Mounted Soldier System]] (MSS) was being developed for GCV crew members.&lt;ref name="Industry day 1" /&gt; MSS worked as a [[Force multiplication|force multiplier]] enhancing [[situation awareness]], comfort, and safety.&lt;ref name="MSS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mounted Soldier System (MSS) |url=https://peosoldier.army.mil/FactSheets/PMSWAR/SWAR_MSS_MSS.pdf |accessdate=9 August 2010 |date=May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dismounted leaders will utilize the Ground Soldier Systems.&lt;ref name="Industry day 1" /&gt;

=== Network ===

The IFV would be operable with the current Battle Command Control and Communications Suite but would gradually use a more revolutionary networked integration system. The system would support integration with unmanned systems, and dismounted soldiers, providing adaptive access points and connectivity.&lt;ref name=GCVspecs&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://defense-update.com/features/2010/january/gcv_army_details_100110.html |title=U.S. Army Outlines Ground Combat Vehicles Priorities |publisher=Defense update |accessdate= January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new network concept called for [[decentralization]] of decision making.&lt;ref name="Future Operational Concepts"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ground Combat Vehicle In the Conduct of Future Operational Concepts|url=http://www.bctmod.army.mil/GCV_focus/GCV%20CONOPS.pdf|accessdate=17 August 2010|date=August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011202739/http://www.bctmod.army.mil/GCV_focus/GCV%20CONOPS.pdf#|archive-date=2010-10-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mounted Soldier System was to enhance situational awareness through wireless communications and input from vehicle sensors and external sources such as other vehicles.&lt;ref name=MSS /&gt;

=== Electrical power ===

The IFV would provide exportable electrical power, and battery charging capability for soldier systems.&lt;ref name=GCVspecs/&gt;

=== Countermeasures ===

Thermal management and acoustic noise reduction would be utilized to avoid detection. The vehicle would be able to avoid threats by laying [[Smoke screen|obscurants]]. An array of [[Active protection system|hit avoidance systems]] would be leveraged and the Army offered the various [[active protection system]]s developed for the manned ground vehicle program.&lt;ref name="Industry day 1" /&gt; The GCV enabled the detection and neutralization of mines at standoff ranges.&lt;ref name="mine neutalizer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Towards a Comprehensive Vehicle Strategy|url=http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2009combatvehicle/GeneralVane.pdf|date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was also to be equipped with an engagement detection system. The Army required the IFV to have the passive blast protection level equal to the [[MRAP (armored vehicle)|MRAP]].&lt;ref name=GCVspecs/&gt; The Army made available the composition of the armor of the manned ground vehicle program. A [[transparent armor]] shield would provide protection for the vehicle commander when exposed through the turret. Personnel would leverage harnesses and restraints to mitigate trauma. In addition, a Vehicle Health Management System would provide vehicle diagnostic monitoring systems for commanders. A fire suppression system and ammunition detonation protection would be utilized for damage control.&lt;ref name="Industry day 1" /&gt;

The Mounted Soldier System would protect crew members from ballistic, thermal, and [[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|CBRN]] threats. The Mounted Soldier System incorporated [[fire retardant]] systems such as the Improved Combat Vehicle Crewman Coverall and undergarments, facewear, gloves, and [[tanker boot|footwear]]. Ballistic protection would come from the Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet, eyewear, a [[Ballistic face mask|maxillofacial shield]], and improvements to body armor.&lt;ref name=MSS /&gt; A secondary squad egress was to be provided for the squad to exit in emergencies.&lt;ref name="Industry day 1" /&gt;

== Tactics ==
The Infantry Fighting Vehicle variant was intended to fill the infantry transport role in [[Brigade Combat Team#Heavy brigade combat team|Heavy Brigade Combat Teams]] replacing the aging [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113 APC]], [[M2 Bradley]], and [[M1126 Infantry Carrier Vehicle]].&lt;ref name=replace/&gt;&lt;ref name=Optimizing /&gt; It was the U.S. Army's intention that the IFV replace the M113 APC in the near term, and the M2 Bradley and M1126 ICV in the midterm.&lt;ref name=Optimizing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bctmod.army.mil/GCV_focus/GCV%20Narrative.pdf |title=The ground combat vehicle strategy: Optimizing for the future |publisher=U.S. Army |accessdate=December 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430044607/http://www.bctmod.army.mil/GCV_focus/GCV%20Narrative.pdf |archivedate=April 30, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Cox |url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4271063&amp;c=AME&amp;s=LAN |title=U.S. Army Details Ground Combat Vehicle Plans |work=[[Defense News]] |publisher=Army Times Publishing Company |date=September 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. Army, as part of the ongoing restructuring, [[Brigade Combat Team#Heavy brigade combat team|Heavy Brigade Combat Team]] Brigades would have an arsenal of 62 IFV's, [[battalion]]s would have 29, and [[platoon]]s would have 4.&lt;ref name="Future Operational Concepts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GCV PROGRAM PLAN" /&gt; Platoons were to be led by platoon leader GCV which would be accompanied by platoon medic, [[Artillery observer|forward observer]], Radio Transmission Operator, and other attachments and would command three other GCVs.&lt;ref name="Future Operational Concepts" /&gt;

The Army placed importance on the GCV's ability to carry a full nine-man squad.  Numerous Army studies have concluded that a squad, containing two [[fireteam]]s, should be composed of nine to eleven soldiers.  These numbers allow the squad to accomplish the [[Fire and Movement|fire and maneuver]] doctrine, and for squad resilience, lethality, and leader span of control.  The M2 Bradley cannot carry a complete squad from one vehicle, creating risk when transitioning from mounted to dismounted operations.  The Bradley's lower carrying capacity was accepted for greater (than previous vehicles) mounted lethality and cost savings, leading to squads being broken apart for transport.  A GCV with a nine-man squad would have allowed the squad leader to control and communicate with the squad while mounted, simplify the transition to dismounted operations in complex terrain, and allow the squad to conduct independent fire and maneuver immediately upon dismount.  Replacing the Bradley on a one-for-one basis would have four GCVs per mechanized infantry platoon carrying one full nine-man squad in a single vehicle, with three vehicles carrying squads and one carrying the platoon's organic and attached enablers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR184.html Understanding Why a Ground Combat Vehicle That Carries Nine Dismounts Is Important to the Army] - Rand.org, 11 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

;Projections
The Technology Development Phase (or Milestone A) was to begin with the award of up to three vehicle contracts awarded in late Fiscal Year 2010 under the Technology Development Phase Contract. A Preliminary Design Review would follow in mid FY 2012.&lt;ref name="GCV PROGRAM PLAN"&gt;{{cite web|title=GCV PROGRAM PLAN|url=http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/gcv/attach/Attch%200008_GCV%20Program%20Schedule.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2010|date=29 January 2010}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. military planned to spend $7.6 billion during Milestone A.&lt;ref name="Lucrative contracts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contractors vie for lucrative vehicle work|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/112959-top-contractors-vie-for-lucrative-vehicle-work|publisher=Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.|accessdate=6 August 2010|author=Roxana Tiron|date=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase (or Milestone B) was to begin with two prototype development contracts awarded in the beginning of Fiscal Year 2013 under the Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development Contract. Shortly thereafter, an Interim Critical Design Review would follow in Mid-FY 2013. After a nearly two-year manufacturing period the first prototypes would be manufactured Mid-FY 2015 after which a Critical Design Review and a Production Readiness Review would occur in FY 2015 and FY 2016 respectively.&lt;ref name="GCV PROGRAM PLAN" /&gt;

The Low Rate Initial Production Phase (or Milestone C) was to begin with a low-rate production contract awarded in mid Fiscal Year 2016 under the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract. Less than two years after the contract award LRIP would begin. After more testing a [[battalion]]-sized team would be attained in FY 2018 followed by a [[brigade]]-sized arsenal in FY 2019.&lt;ref name="GCV PROGRAM PLAN" /&gt;

If a Full-Rate Production Decision was attained, full-rate production would begin. The U.S. military planned on procuring 1,450 IFVs at a total program cost of $40 billion.&lt;ref name="GCV PROGRAM PLAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name=1,450/&gt;

;Milestone C
A Milestone C decision could have been made in 2019.&lt;ref name="weight"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Matt|title=Army: GCV Needs to Be Big and Tracked|url=http://defensetech.org/2013/02/21/army-gcv-needs-to-be-big-and-tracked/|publisher=DefenseTech|accessdate=February 26, 2013|date=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weight issues====
In November 2012, estimates of the GCV's weight, depending on armor packages, put the General Dynamics entry vehicle at 64–70 tons, and the BAE Systems entry vehicle at 70–84 tons. This made the planned infantry fighting vehicle designs heavier than the [[M1 Abrams]] tank. The reason was the vehicle had to have enough armor to protect a squad of nine troops from all battlefield threats (from [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s to [[Improvised explosive device| IED]]s) as good as or better than other vehicles can protect against specific threats individually.  This worked against the vehicle; as weight increases, cost goes up and maneuverability goes down. The contractors worked to bring the weight down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://defense.aol.com/2012/11/08/bradley-offspring-gcv-may-top-84-tons-hheavier-than-m1-tank/ | title = Bradley Offspring, GCV, May Top 84 Tons, Heavier Than M1 Tank | newspaper = Defense | publisher = AOL | date = November 8, 2012 | access-date = 2012-11-13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121112072248/http://defense.aol.com/2012/11/08/bradley-offspring-gcv-may-top-84-tons-hheavier-than-m1-tank# | archive-date = 2012-11-12 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Army maintained that heavy armor was needed to protect the squad from acceleration forces that come with an underside blast, and that thicker underbelly plates and [[V-hull| V-shaped hulls]] do not give enough protection.  More armor would come from the vehicle being larger for more internal space for the soldiers, and to allow for features such as floating floors for blast deflection and extra headroom.  The Army also said heavy weight would not affect deployability because the Bradley it was planned replace already requires [[Airlift#Strategic airlift| strategic airlift]] [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]].&lt;ref name = "weight "/&gt;

Both contractors claimed their designs were below the 70–84 tons expectation of what the GCV will weigh.  BAE's vehicle weighed 60–70 tons, based on modular armor package, and a 20 percent margin for weight increase the Army had planned for future upgrades would bring it up to 84 tons.  General Dynamic's vehicle with a diesel engine weighed 62 tons in its most heavily armored configuration, which increased to 76 tons with the 20 percent future upgrade margin.  Removing protection for easier air transportation would have reduced it to 56 tons.  The Army's consideration to slow down the GCV development program gave time to the companies to refine their designs and reduce weight.  One way would have been to reduce squad size.  A nine-man squad has been identified as best for being able to fight with the possibility of taking casualties with single-vehicle transportability.  With a three-man crew, the GCV had to carry 12 men.  A greater number of lighter IFVs that carry fewer soldiers would have similar carrying capacity and combined costs and weight to planned GCV numbers.  Another way would be an advance in armor designs.  Lighter and stronger armor materials had not made radical progressions in recent history, and domestic active protection intercept systems were not yet mature.  Foreign systems like the Israeli [[Trophy (countermeasure) | Trophy]] had seen combat but cannot yet intercept tank shells.  The GCV program originally included an APS, but was then delayed as a feature for later upgrades.  The last effort to replace the Bradley was with [[Future Combat Systems]], which developed a vehicle that relied on sensors to avoid danger and an APS in place of heavy armor.  It was too ambitious for the time and the vehicle's weight had grown from 19 tons to 30 tons by the time it was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://breakingdefense.com/2013/11/bae-general-dynamics-we-can-get-weight-down-on-army-gcv/ | title = BAE, GD: We Can Cut Weight From Army’s GCV | newspaper = Breaking defense | date = 27 November 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicles==

===BAE Systems===
The [[BAE Systems]] Ground Combat Vehicle design had a steel-core hull and an integrated electronic network capability with embedded intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance equipment. Its turret was unmanned.  The centerpiece of the vehicle was its simplified drive train.  It was propelled by a Hybrid Electric Drive (HED), which was developed by [[Northrop Grumman]], that produced 1,100&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity.  Advantages to it are fewer components and lower volume and weight compared to current power plants.  The transmission was 40 percent smaller and the drive train had half the moving parts.  The hybrid drive train cost 5 percent more than a mechanical system, but had a 20 percent reduction in life-cycle cost.  The electric drive allows for smoother low-speed operation and less noise.  The vehicle burned 20 percent less fuel while running, with 4.61 gallons (17.45 liters) per hour used while stationary.  It had a top speed of 43&amp;nbsp;mph (70&amp;nbsp;km/h), could go from 0 to 20&amp;nbsp;mph (32.18&amp;nbsp;km/hr) in 7.8 seconds, and had a range of {{convert|186|mi|km|abbr=on}} with a 255-gallon fuel capacity.  Disadvantages to the BAE design included a weight of 70 tons and fuel efficiency of only 0.73 mpg.  It was argued that big, heavy vehicles are not practical in urban combat and that the infrastructure of urban and third-world countries should limit the vehicle's weight to 45 tons.  Others said that urban warfare tactics have become so lethal that only vehicles of this size can survive.&lt;ref name="BAE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/bae-gcv-hybrid-tank/25113/ BAE Systems releases details of hybrid tank] - Gizmag.com, November 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; BAE integrated the [[Artis, LLC|Artis]] [[Iron Curtain active protection system]] to defeat incoming rockets and missiles before they can hit the vehicle.  The Army conducted tests on the system in April 2013, and the it successfully passed all tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defense-update.com/20130429_iron-curtain-tested.html|title=Iron Curtain Successful in Firing Tests|publisher=Defense Update |date=April 29, 2013|accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A prototype system for the vehicle to drive in low visibility conditions was also tested.  A Humvee with blacked-out windows drove through a smoke-filled mock town with the system safely, even though visibility was completely obscured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1245 Undeterred By Possible Delays, BAE Continues Ground Combat Vehicle Development] - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, 28 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, the BAE GCV's hybrid electric drive completed 2,000 miles of testing on a fully integrated “Hotbuck” mobility platform.  The Hotbuck is a stationary test stand that simulates real-life environments and terrain and puts actual miles on the HED system. Under BAE's own timeline, the testing was completed four months ahead of schedule.  Developing and testing actual hardware was not a program requirement for the Technology Development (TD) phase, but BAE Systems chose to demonstrate the fuel efficiency and performance of a hybrid system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armyrecognition.com/august_2013_defense_industry_military_army_news_uk/bae_systems_ground_combat_vehicle_hybrid_electric_drive_successfully_completed_2000_miles_testing.html BAE Systems Ground Combat Vehicle Hybrid Electric Drive successfully completed 2000 miles testing] - Armyrecognition.com, 27 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Although dramatic funding cuts for the GCV program in January 2014 put the very completion of the acquisition effort in jeopardy, funding remained for research on a hybrid-electric propulsion system.  The BAE GCV's hybrid-electric engine is more fuel efficient, has fewer moving parts, and has faster acceleration than ordinary engines.  While powering a vehicle concept that reached 70 tons proved impractical, its benefits of providing power for onboard electronics, silent overwatch, and short, stealthy movements are still promising.  BAE has pledged to support future Army developmental efforts with technologies from their GCV entry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2014/01/22/hopes-dim-for-baes-green-combat-vehicle/ Hopes Dim for BAE’s ‘Green’ Combat Vehicle] - DoDBuzz.com, 22 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2014, BAE Systems was awarded a $7.9 million study contract for technical, cost, and risk assessments to utilize the GCV TD phase integrated hybrid-electric propulsion and mobility subsystems Automotive Test Rig (ATR) and the hybrid-electric integrated propulsion subsystem (Hotbuck) for the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV) effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/army-attempts-to-salvage-gcv-technology-advances/ Army Attempts to Salvage GCV Technology Advances] - Defensemedianetwork.com, 25 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/2014/08/gcv-ffv-technologies.html Army asks BAE Systems and General Dynamics to recycle GCV vetronics for Future Fighting Vehicle] - Militaryaerospace.com, 18 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Dynamics GCV===
On 31 October 2013, General Dynamics successfully completed a preliminary design review of their GCV IFV design.  Subsystem and component design reviews were held from August to October of that year and led to the four-day PDR.  General Dynamics demonstrated their vehicle met Tier 1 affordability, reliability, and other requirements.  The success of the PDR meant that the General Dynamics GCV IFV could be expected to be operationally effective and suitable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131109162004/http://www.armyrecognition.com/november_2013_defense_industry_military_news_uk/general_dynamics_completed_preliminary_design_revuiew_of_gcv_ground_combat_vehicle_design_0911132.html General Dynamics completed Preliminary Design Review of Ground Combat Vehicle design] - Armyrecognition.com, 9 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Wildlife tracking|other methods of wildlife tracking|animal migration tracking|and|History of wildlife tracking technology}}
'''GPS wildlife tracking''' is a process whereby [[biologists]], scientific researchers or conservation agencies can remotely observe relatively fine-scale movement or [[wikt:migration|migratory]] patterns in a free-ranging wild animal using the [[Global Positioning System]] and optional environmental sensors or automated data-retrieval technologies such as [[Argos system|Argos]] satellite uplink, [[Circuit Switched Data|mobile data telephony]] or [[GPRS]] and a range of analytical software tools.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Gail et al., "Novel GPS tracking of sea turtles as a tool for conservation management", ''Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology'' 347 (2007) 58–68&lt;/ref&gt;

A GPS-enabled device will normally record and store location data at a pre-determined interval or on [[interrupt]] by an environmental sensor. These data may be stored pending recovery of the device or relayed to a central data store or internet-connected computer using an embedded [[cellular network|cellular]] ([[GPRS]]), [[radio]], or [[satellite]] modem. The animal's location can then be plotted against a map or chart in near real-time or, when analysing the track later, using a [[GIS]] package or custom software. 

While GPS tracking devices may also be attached to [[domestic animals]] such as [[pets]], [[purebred|pedigree]] [[livestock]] and [[working dogs]], and similar systems are used in [[fleet management]] of vehicles, wildlife tracking can place additional constraints on size and weight and may not allow for post-deployment recharging or replacement of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] or correction of attachment.

As well as allowing in-depth study of animal behaviour and migration, the [[high-resolution]] tracks available from a GPS-enabled system can potentially allow for tighter control of animal-borne [[Infectious disease|communicable diseases]] such as the [[H5N1]] strain of [[avian influenza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1547 USGS Release: Satellites Help Scientists Track Migratory Birds: GPS the Latest Tool in Fight Against Avian Influenza (9/6/2006 9:38:16 AM)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attachment==
===Collar attachment===
[[Image:Jaguar (Panthera onca palustris) male Rio Negro 2.JPG|thumb|A [[jaguar]] wearing a tracking collar]]
Collar attachment is the primary attachment technique where the subject has a suitable body type and behaviour. [[Tracking collar]]s would normally be used on the animal's neck (assuming the head has a larger circumference than the neck)&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6188482.stm BBC NEWS | Technology | Snow leopard fitted with GPS tag&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but also on a limb, perhaps around an ankle. Suitable animals for neck attachment would include primates, large cats, some bears etc. Limb attachment would work well in animals such as [[kiwi]], where the foot is much larger than the ankle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Harness attachment===
Harness attachments may used in situations where collar attachment is not suitable, such as animals whose neck diameter may exceed that of the head. Examples of this type of animal may include pigs, [[Tasmanian devils]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} 
Large, long-necked, birds such as the [[greylag goose]] may also need to be fitted with a harness to prevent removal of the tag by the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csl.gov.uk/aboutCsl/scienceGroupsAndTeams/ebg/gooseProject/tagging.cfm CSL - Goose Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702233724/http://www.csl.gov.uk/aboutCsl/scienceGroupsAndTeams/ebg/gooseProject/tagging.cfm |date=2007-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct attachment===
Direct attachment is used on animals where a collar cannot be used, such as birds, reptiles and [[marine mammals]]. 

In the case of birds, the GPS unit must be very lightweight to avoid interfering with the bird's ability to fly or swim. The device is usually attached by gluing or, for short deployments, taping&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Ryan, S. L. Petersen, G. Peters and D. Grémillet, "GPS tracking a marine predator: the effects of precision, resolution and sampling rate on foraging tracks of African Penguins" in Marine Biology,
International Journal on Life in Oceans and Coastal Waters, Volume 145, Number 2, August 2004, pp. 215-223
&lt;/ref&gt; to the bird. The unit will then naturally fall off when the bird next moults.

In the case of reptiles such as [[crocodile]]s and [[turtle]]s, gluing the unit onto the animal's skin or [[carapace]] using [[epoxy]] (or similar material) is the most common method and minimises discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Godley, B.J., et al., "Post-nesting movements and submergence patterns of loggerhead marine turtles in the Mediterranean assessed by satellite tracking", ''Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology'' 287 (2003) p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

In deployments on marine mammals such as [[Earless seal|phocids]] or [[Eared seal|otariids]], the device would be glued to the fur and fall off during the annual [[moult]]. Units used with turtles or marine animals have to resist the corrosive effects of sea water and be waterproof to pressures of up to 200bar.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Other attachment methods===
Other applications include [[rhinoceros]] tracking, for which a hole may be drilled in the animal's horn and a device implanted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Compared to other methods, implanted transmitters may suffer from a reduced range as the large mass of the animal's body can absorb some transmitted power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

There are also GPS implants for large snakes, such as ones offered by [https://www.telemetrysolutions.com Telemetry Solutions].

==Software==
===Embedded===
[[Duty Cycle]] Scheduling - GPS devices typically record data about the animal's exact location and store readings at pre-set intervals known as duty-cycles.
By setting the interval between readings, the researcher is able to determine the lifespan of the device - very frequent readings drain battery power more rapidly, whereas longer intervals between readings might provide lower resolution but over a longer deployment.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Ryan, S. L. Petersen, G. Peters and D. Grémillet, "GPS tracking a marine predator: the effects of precision, resolution and sampling rate on foraging tracks of African Penguins" in Marine Biology,
International Journal on Life in Oceans and Coastal Waters, Volume 145, Number 2, August 2004, pp. 215-223
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Release Timers - Some devices can be programmed to drop off at a set time/date rather than requiring recapture and manually retrieval. Some may also be fitted with a low-power radio receiver allowing a remote signal to trigger the automatic release. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Analytical===
Locational data provided by GPS devices can be displayed using GIS packages such as the [[open-source]] [[GRASS GIS|GRASS]] or plotted and prepared for display on the World Wide Web using packages such as [[Generic Mapping Tools|Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)]], [https://github.com/PnEcrins/FollowDem FollowDem] (developed by Ecrins national Park to track ibex) or [http://www.seaturtle.org/maptool/ Maptool].

Statistical software such as [[R (programming language)|R]] can be used to display and examine data and may reveal behavioural patterns or trends.

==Data retrieval==
===Argos===
GPS tracking devices have been linked to an Argos Platform Transmitter Terminal (PTT) enabling them to transmit data via the [[Argos System]], a scientific satellite system which has been in use since 1978. Users can download their data directly from Argos via [[telnet]] and process the raw data to extract their transmitted information.&lt;ref&gt;FANCY,  S. G., L. F.  PANK,  D. C. DOUGLAS,  C. H. CURBY,  G. W. GARNER,  S. C. AMSTR AND  W. L.  REGELIN.  1988. Satellite telemetry:  A  new  tool for wildlife research and management. US. Fish  and Wildlife Service, Resource Publication  172. 54 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where satellite uplink fails due to antenna damage, it may be possible to intercept the underpowered transmission locally using a satellite uplink receiver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6159767.stm BBC NEWS | Technology | Snow Leopard Diary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===GSM===
GPS location data can be transmitted via the [[GSM]] mobile/cell phone network, using [[SMS]] messages or [[internet protocols]] over a [[GPRS]] session.&lt;ref&gt;Mcconnell et al., (2004) "Phoning Home - A New GSM Mobile Phone Telemetry System To Collect Mark-Recapture Data", ''Marine Mammal Science'' 20 (2), pp.274–283&lt;/ref&gt;. The [http://www.EPASTO.eu EPASTO]  GPS is dedicated to follow and locate cow.

===UHF/VHF===
GPS data may be transmitted via short-range radio signals and decoded using a custom receiver.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

{{wiktionary|handle}}
A '''handle''' is a part of, or attachment to, an object that can be moved or used by hand.  The design of each type of handle involves substantial [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] issues, even where these are dealt with intuitively or by following tradition. Handles for [[tools]] are an important part of their function, enabling the user to exploit the tools to maximum effect. [[Package handle]]s allow for convenient carrying of packages.
[[File:Claw-hammer.jpg|275px|thumb|A modern claw hammer with [[rubber]] handle]]

== General design criteria ==
[[Image:Tool-pliers.jpg|thumb|Flat-nose pliers with [[thermoplastic]] handles]]
The three nearly universal requirements of are:
# Sufficient strength to support the object, or to otherwise transmit the force involved in the task the handle serves.
# Sufficient length to permit the hand or hands gripping it to reliably exert that force.
# Sufficiently small [[circumference]] to permit the hand or hands to surround it far enough to grip it as solidly as needed to exert that force.

== Specific needs ==
Other requirements may apply to specific handles:
* A sheath or coating on the handle that provides [[friction]] against the hand, reducing the gripping force needed to achieve a reliable grip.
* Designs such as recessed car-door handles, reducing the chance of accidental operation, or simply the inconvenience of "snagging" the handle.
* Sufficient circumference to distribute the force comfortably and safely over the hand.  An example where this requirement is almost the sole purpose for a handle's existence is the handle that consists of two pieces: a hollow wooden cylinder about the diameter of a finger and a bit longer than one hand-width, and a stiff wire that passes through the center of the cylinder, has two right angles, and is shaped into a hook at each end. This handle permits comfortable carrying, with otherwise bare hands, of a heavy package, suspended on a tight string that passes around the top and bottom of it: the string is strong enough to support it, but the pressure the string would exert on fingers that grasped it directly would often be unacceptable.
* Design to thwart unwanted access, for example, by children or thieves. In these cases many of the other requirements may have reduced importance. For example, a child-proof doorknob can be difficult for even an adult to use.

==Pull handles==
[[Image:Drawer handle.jpg|thumb|Many drawers use pull handles.]]
One major category of handles are ''pull'' handles, where one or more hands grip the handle or handles, and exert force to shorten the distance between the hands and their corresponding shoulders. The three criteria stated above are universal for pull handles.

Many pull handles are for lifting, mostly on objects to be carried.

Horizontal pull handles are widespread, including [[drawer pull]]s, handles on latchless doors and the outside of car doors.  The inside controls for opening car doors from inside are usually pull handles, although their function of permitting the door to be ''pushed'' open is accomplished by an internal unlatching linkage.

Pull handles are also a frequent host of common [[Door Handle Bacteria|door handle bacteria]] such as [[Escherichia coli|e-coli]], fungal or other viral infections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthywaukesha.com/door-handles-can-spread-germs Door Handles Can Spread Germs] retrieved November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Two kinds of pull handles may involve motion in addition to the hand-focused motions described:
* Pulling the starting cord on a small internal-combustion engine may, besides moving the hand toward the shoulder, also exploit simultaneously pushing a wheeled vehicle away with the other hand, stepping away from the engine, and/or standing from a squat.
* Some throwing motions, as in a [[track and field|track-and-field]] [[hammer throw]], involve pulling on a handle against centrifugal force (without bringing it closer), in the course of accelerating the thrown object by forcing it into circular motion.

==Twist handles==
[[Image:Door handle.jpg|thumb|Many doors use twist handles.]]
Another category of hand-operated device requires grasping (but not pulling) and rotating the hand and either the lower arm or the whole arm, about their axis.  When the grip required is a fist grip, as with a [[door handle]] that has an arm rather than a knob to twist, the term "handle" unambiguously applies.  Another clear case is a rarer device seen on mechanically complicated doors like those of airliners, where (instead of the whole hand moving down as it also rotates, on the door handles just described) the axis of rotation is between the thumb and the outermost fingers, so the thumb moves up if the outer fingers move down.

==Handles for wide-range motion==
The handles of [[bicycle|bicycle grip]]s, [[club (weapon)|club-style weapon]]s, [[shovel]]s and spades, [[axe]]s, [[hammer]]s, mallets and [[hatchet]]s, [[baseball bat]]s, [[racquet|racket]]s, [[golf club (equipment)|golf club]]s, and [[croquet]] mallets involve a greater range of [[ergonomic]] issues.

== History ==
As early as the 1920s, the concept of using hot water and alkali catalysts to produce oil out of biomass was proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production of Oil from Plant Material|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/99/2573/309|journal = Science|date = 1944-04-21|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 17737216|pages = 309–312|volume = 99|issue = 2573|doi = 10.1126/science.99.2573.309|first = E.|last = Berl|bibcode = 1944Sci....99..309B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the foundation of later HTL technologies that attracted research interest especially during the 1970s oil embargo. It was around that time that a high-pressure (hydrothermal) liquefaction process was developed at the Pittsburgh Energy Research Center (PERC) and later demonstrated (at the 100&amp;nbsp;kg/h scale) at the Albany Biomass Liquefaction Experimental Facility at Albany, Oregon, US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; In 1982, Shell Oil developed the HTU™ process in the
Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; Other organizations that have previously demonstrated HTL of biomass include Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg, Germany, SCF Technologies in Copenhagen, Denmark, EPA’s Water Engineering Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, and Changing World Technology Inc.

== Chemical reactions ==
In hydrothermal liquefaction processes, long carbon chain molecules in biomass are thermally cracked and oxygen is removed in the form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (dehydration) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (decarboxylation). These reactions result in the production of high H/C ratio bio-oil. Simplified descriptions of dehydration and decarboxylation reactions can be found in the literature (e.g. Asghari and Yoshida (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in sub-critical water over heterogeneous zirconium phosphate catalysts|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008621506003363|journal = Carbohydrate Research|date = 2006-10-16|pages = 2379–2387|volume = 341|issue = 14|doi = 10.1016/j.carres.2006.06.025|first = Feridoun Salak|last = Asghari|first2 = Hiroyuki|last2 = Yoshida}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Snåre et al.

==Process==
Most applications of hydrothermal liquefaction operate at temperatures between 250-550&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and high pressures of 5-25 MPa as well as catalysts for 20–60 minutes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; although higher or lower temperatures can be used to optimize gas or liquid yields, respectively.&lt;ref name="ToorReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toor|first1=Saqib Sohail|last2=Rosendahl|first2=Lasse|last3=Rudolf|first3=Andreas|title=Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|journal=Energy|date=May 2011|volume=36|pages=2328–2342|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At these temperatures and pressures, the water present in the biomass becomes either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the conditions, and acts as a solvent, reactant, and catalyst to facilitate the reaction of biomass to bio-oil.

The exact conversion of biomass to bio-oil is dependent on several variables:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Feedstock composition
* Temperature and heating rate
* Pressure
* Solvent
* Residence time
* Catalysts

===Feedstock===

Theoretically, any biomass can be converted into bio-oil using hydrothermal liquefaction regardless of water content, and various different biomasses have been tested, from forestry and agriculture residues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Ramirez|first2=Jerome|last3=Jablonsky|first3=Michal|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Rainey|first6=Thomas|title=Energy and chemical conversion of five Australian lignocellulosic feedstocks into bio-crude through liquefaction|journal=RSC Advances|date=24 May 2017|volume=7|issue=44|page=27707-27717|doi=10.1039/C7RA02335A|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/RA/C7RA02335A}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sewage sludges, food process wastes, to emerging non-food biomass such as algae.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview"/&gt; The composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, protein, and lignin in the feedstock influence the yield and quality of the oil from the process.

===Temperature and Heating Rate===
Temperature plays a major role in the conversion of biomass to bio-oil. The temperature of the reaction determines the depolymerization of the biomass to bio-oil, as well as the repolymerization into char.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the ideal reaction temperature is dependent on the feedstock used, temperatures above ideal lead to an increase in char formation and eventually increased gas formation, while lower than ideal temperatures reduce depolymerization and overall product yields.

Similarly to temperature, the rate of heating plays a critical role in the production of the different phase streams, due to the prevalence of secondary reactions at non-optimum heating rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Secondary reactions become dominant in heating rates that are too low, leading to the formation of char. While high heating rates are required to form liquid bio-oil, there is a threshold heating rate and temperature where liquid production is inhibited and gas production is favored in secondary reactions.

===Pressure===
Pressure (along with temperature) determines the super- or subcritical state of solvents as well as overall reaction kinetics and the energy inputs required to yield the desirable HTL products (oil, gas, chemicals, char etc.).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Residence Time===
Hydrothermal liquefaction is a fast process, resulting in low residence times for depolymerization to occur. Typical residence times are measured in minutes (15 to 60 minutes); however, the residence time is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, including feedstock, solvent ratio and temperature. As such, optimization of the residence time is necessary to ensure a complete depolymerizaiton without allowing further reactions to occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Catalysts===
While water acts as a catalyst in the reaction, other catalysts can be added to the reaction vessel to optimize the conversion.&lt;ref name="DuanCatalyst"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Peigao|last2=Savage|first2=Phillip E.|title=Hydrothermal Liquefaction of a Microalga with Heterogeneous Catalysts|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=2011|volume=50|pages=52–61|doi=10.1021/ie100758s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously used catalysts include water-soluble inorganic compounds and salts, including KOH and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as transition metal catalysts using [[Nickel|Ni]], [[Palladium|Pd]], [[Platinum|Pt]], and [[Ruthenium|Ru]] supported on either [[carbon]], [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] or [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. The addition of these catalysts can lead to an oil yield increase of 20% or greater, due to the catalysts converting the protein, cellulose, and hemicellulose into oil. This ability for catalysts to convert biomaterials other than fats and oils to bio-oil allows for a wider range of feedstock to be used.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental Impact==
Biofuels that are produced through hydrothermal liquefaction are [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon neutral]], meaning that there are no net carbon emissions produced when burning the biofuel. The plant materials used to produce bio-oils use photosynthesis to grow, and as such consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The burning of the biofuels produced releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but is nearly completely offset by the carbon dioxide consumed from growing the plants, resulting in a release of only 15-18 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh or energy produced. This is substantially lower than the releases rate of fossil fuel technologies, which can range from releases of 955 g/kWh (coal), 813 g/kWh (oil), and 446 g/kWh (natural gas).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recently, Steeper Energy announced that the [[Emission intensity|Carbon Intensity (CI)]] of its Hydrofaction™ oil is 15 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ according to [http://www.ghgenius.ca/ GHGenius model] (version 4.03a), while diesel fuel is 93.55 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://steeperenergy.com/news/milestones-and-activities|title = Milestones &amp; Activities|date = Q3 2015|accessdate = 3 Sep 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Steeper Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrothermal liquefaction is a clean process that doesn't produce harmful compounds, such as ammonia, NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, or SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Instead the [[heteroatom]]s, including nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, are converted into harmless byproducts such as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and inorganic acids that can be neutralized with bases.

==Compare with Pyrolysis and other [[Biomass to liquid|BtL]] technologies==
The HTL process differs from [[pyrolysis]] as it can process wet biomass and produce a bio-oil that contains approximately twice the energy density of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis is a related process to HTL, but biomass must be processed and dried in order to increase the yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridgwater|first1=A.V|last2=Peacocke|first2=G.V.C|title=Fast pyrolysis processes for biomass|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=March 2000|volume=4|pages=1–73|doi=10.1016/s1364-0321(99)00007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of water in pyrolysis drastically increases the heat of vaporization of the organic material, increasing the energy required to decompose the biomass. Typical pyrolysis processes require a water content of less than 40% to suitably convert the biomass to bio-oil. This requires considerable pretreatment of wet biomass such as tropical grasses, which contain a water content as high as 80-85%, and even further treatment for aquatic species, which can contain higher than 90% water content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The HTL oil can contain up to 80% of the feedstock carbon content (single pass).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; HTL oil has good potential to yield bio-oil with "drop-in" properties that can be directly distributed in existing petroleum infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544211001691|journal = Energy|date = 2011-05-01|pages = 2328–2342|volume = 36|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013|first = Saqib Sohail|last = Toor|first2 = Lasse|last2 = Rosendahl|first3 = Andreas|last3 = Rudolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-02/au-hl020613.php|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction -- the most promising path to a sustainable bio-oil production|last = AARHUS UNIVERSITY|first = |date = 6 Feb 2013|work = |access-date = 3 Sep 2015|via = http://www.eurekalert.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISM was originally produced in tandem with the [[XM8 rifle|XM8 Assault Rifle]], with the intention of becoming a standard attachment. However, even as the XM8 project was cancelled, Insight continued development of the ISM sight until it was released in early 2007. The ISM can fit any MIL-STD 1913 rail.&lt;ref name="Sweeney2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|authorlink=Patrick Sweeney (gunsmith)|title=Gun Digest Book of the AR-15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4pv0YLUjxIC&amp;pg=PA248|date=26 April 2012|publisher=F+W Media|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-2876-6|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet Security Alliance''' (ISAlliance) was founded in 2001 as a non-profit collaboration between the [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] (EIA), a federation of trade associations, and [[Carnegie Mellon]] University's [[CyLab]], focussing on cyber security. The ISAlliance is a forum for information sharing and leadership on [[information security]], and it lobbies for corporate security interests.&lt;ref name="About the ISAlliance"&gt;{{cite web|first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=About the ISAlliance |url=http://www.getcujo.com/iot/about-the-isalliance/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703051107/http://www.getcujo.com/iot/about-the-isalliance/ |work= |publisher= |location= |doi= |date=2009-10-29 |month= |year= |archivedate=July 3, 2015 |accessdate=2009-10-29 |quote= |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
* Work with legislative and regulatory bodies to ensure that market incentives are at the forefront of policy
* Promote greater corporate responsibility on information security issues
* Facilitate executive-to-executive communications about solutions to threats and emerging trends
* Conducts research leading to identification and resolution of root causes to information security problems
* Develop training programs across the gamut of corporate information security issues
* Provide a coordination point for industry dialogue on self-regulation issues such as market incentives, [[IT risk management]] and privacy
* Develop organizationally viable models for integration and adoption of security best practices
* Educate senior management and boards, linking information security throughout the enterprise operations
* Conduct timely seminars on emerging security issues
* Provide early warning of emerging security threats and in-depth reports on vulnerabilities and threats&lt;ref name="About the ISAlliance"/&gt;

The ISAlliance has proposed a "Cybersecurity Social Contract"&lt;ref&gt;

==International operations==
While the ISAlliance is physically based in the United States, its membership operates internationally and the goal is international security for all its trusted partners. The ISAlliance has member companies on four continents. There has always been a non-U.S. based company on the Executive Committee. The ISAlliance believes the international communication it fosters is critical to the long-term success of achieving greater information security. Moreover, international representation and voice more realistically addresses the many difficult problems which face all users of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:fkiss.png|thumb|300px|Screenshot of a KiSS set being displayed]]
'''Kisekae Set System''' (commonly known as '''KiSS''') is a blending of art with computers originally designed to allow creation of virtual "[[paper doll]]s". Kisekae is short for "kisekae ningyou"; a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term meaning "dress-up dolls". Unlike "[[computer art]]" which creates or displays traditional art via a computer, KiSS uses the computer as the medium, allowing the art to be not only [[animation|animated]], but also interactive.

==Availability==

KiSS is an [[Open standard]] which has to some extent been implemented on many platforms, including several [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s.{{CN|date=May 2017}} It has also been implemented in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and on the web.

==History==

KiSS originated in [[Japan]] in 1991 with "dolls" based on [[shōjo manga]] characters.

The original dolls, a series of simple, static images, could be moved about and layered on top of one another to look as if the doll image was wearing the clothing. Using computer graphics had the advantage over traditional paper dolls in allowing multiple layers to move in unison, including visually separate pieces, giving an illusion of depth not possible with physical paper.

The initial viewer software was designed for [[NEC PC-9801|NEC PC-9800 series]] using a palette of 16 colours to display the doll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.anime.info/msg/003078ef9df41f68 |title=Kiss Frequently Asked Questions version 0.32a |date=1994-03-17 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, an enhanced standard was put forward ('''General Specification 2''' known as 'KiSS/GS2') which included support for VGA cards and 256 or multiple 16 colour palettes. This standard is still the basis of KiSS, but several additional specifications have been incorporated into viewers since then, in particular "French KiSS", generally called FKiSS, for controlling interactivity and animation and "Cherry KiSS" (i.e. CKiSS) for 32-bit "true" colour support.

By the late 1990s KiSS had spread from the Japanese BBS communities internationally via the Internet with artists creating "dolls", programmers creating support tools, and fans appearing worldwide.

Note that although KiSS sets are often referred to generically as 'dolls' they are not confined to dress-up — in fact they can be anything and there are "build-your-own" faces, wedding cakes, dollhouses, battleships, as well as puzzles, games and much more. Nonetheless such "unusual" sets are sometimes referred to as ''aberrant'' KiSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610114208/http://www.jan.jacob.easynet.be/abkiss/ |title=The Aberrant Kiss Page |archivedate=2004-06-10 |url=http://www.jan.jacob.easynet.be/abkiss/ |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==

A KiSS set consists of many files of a number of different formats. These are packaged for distribution as a single set or 'doll' in [[LHA (file format)|LZH]] format (a preferred archive format in Japan) which viewer programs can read as a whole to obtain the individual files.

Most files are 'cel' files which are raw, uncompressed graphics data analogous to [[animation cel]]s. KiSS/GS2 specification cels also require a KCF (KiSS Colour File) as a palette, but CKiSS specification cels do not. A KCF also can control background colour and contain multiple palettes that can be swapped for lighting and colour change effects. All KiSS binary files (KCF, standard and CKiSS cels) since KiSS/GS2 share a common 32 byte binary header record identifying the size, type and format of KiSS data they contain.

A configuration file is also required to control field size, layering, cel position, use of palettes, and interaction and animation events.

In addition [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|Midi]] files for music and WAV files for sound clips may be used, and generally some form of text documentation is included by the artist.

===Expansions===

KiSS sets are allowed to acquire resources from other KiSS sets by a process called 'Expansion'. This allows new versions of a doll without incorporating the original cells into the new set, meaning that earlier versions did not have to be replaced, and different artists could add to the doll without confusion as to who the original artist was. This dates from some of the earliest viewers, but the details of loading an expansion set remain somewhat viewer dependent.

==Extensions==

A number of features have been added to KiSS but never formally incorporated into the main KiSS format. For compatibility and to hide them from viewers that don't support them they are disguised as comments in the configuration file. Each type of extension (except user grouping) was initially introduced in Japan, however all (except Cherry KiSS) have later been extended by international viewers.

===French KiSS===

'French' KiSS (or 'FKiSS') is an event driven scripting language created as an experimental add-on to the KiSS/GS2 specifications. It was introduced in Japan to allow animation and greater interactivity in KiSS. It was the first extension, and intended only for testing but it proved so popular that it became entrenched as is. All FKiSS directives appear preceded in the first column of their configuration line by:
 ;@
The ";" normally indicates the beginning of a comment, which originally hid the directive if a viewer didn't handle FKiSS although it is now standard in all viewers.

FKiSS itself has been extended several times:
* 'FKiSS2' was first implemented by a group of international programmers creating viewers for alternate platforms. It adds collision detection, relative movement and some simple condition tests. This Level of FKiSS is supported by all but the very oldest viewers. This was the last Level supported in Japan.
* 'FKiSS3' added variables, math and flow control, making it more nearly a full scripting language.
* 'FKiSS4' simplifies and extends FKiSS capabilities, particularly with support for user groupings, but there are so far few viewers that support it.

===Initialization Tags===

These are additions to the cell definitions to control start up properties. They appear as a comment at the end of the cell definition that immediately starts with a '''%''' and a code.  The first ('''%t''' - to control initial transparency) was added when the first level of FKiSS was finalized. Other properties added with FKiSS4 include display status ('''%u'''), clickability ('''%g''') and offset overrides ('''%x''' and '''%y''').

===Pragmas===

These are comment added to the configuration to suggest to the viewer program how best to automatically display the set. Originally used in Japan to indicate other KiSS sets of which the current one is an expansion (''';INCLUDE''' -- i.e. where to find referenced resources not included in the set), later viewers use them to indicate optimal settings for the set being loaded (''';HINT''').

===Cherry KiSS===

Commonly called 'CKiSS', this is an extension to the binary data header record, and unlike other extensions makes no changes to the configuration file. It is a specification allowing a cell file to contain raw 24-bit colour data and an 8 bit alpha channel for variable transparency. CKiSS cells tend to use a lot of disk space compared to palette-based cels, and do not compress well, so they are used sparingly by most artists.

===Groupings===

User groupings were added along with FKiSS4 to simplify controlling large numbers of cells (or uniquely identify specific cells) for testing and animation.

==Creating KiSS==

There are many programs on most platforms which can convert from standard graphics formats (most commonly BMP, GIF or PSD files) to KiSS cel and KCF files, allowing the artist to create the original images with any freeware or proprietary graphics program. In addition, [[GIMP]] is a fully featured graphics program which can open and save CEL files directly, leaving no need for conversion.

The configuration file is written with a text editor (standard as part of any Operating System software). Once the basic files are created a KiSS viewer is used to display and fine tune the set, then an archiver with LZH capability is used for packaging. All the software needed is freely available on the internet, as are detailed tutorials for KiSS creation.

==Community==

The modern KiSS community on the internet resembles the [[dollz|dolling community]] with which there is a degree of overlap, though the two are distinct and each is protective of its own art. However, since KiSS art is more specialized the KiSS community is centralized around the largest archive of dolls on the internet, the BiG KiSS Page. Unfortunately in recent years bandwidth costs have forced the BKP to allow most doll downloads by subscription only, which has had negative impacts on the size of the active community.

Because being able to dress a doll implies being able to '''''un'''''dress as well there has always been a subgenre of 'adult' KiSS which exists independently of the main community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2054">The 2018 '''LG K10''' is an upcoming mid-range [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phone developed and manufactured by [[LG Electronics]] and was announced on [[Mobile World Congress]] in February 2018, alongside the 2018 [[LG K8 (2018)|LG K8]]. The phone will be released in April 2018. Notable changes compared to the predecessor include a redesigned form factor and some hardware upgrades. The model will be sold with three variants, namely the base LG K10, the low-end '''LG K10α''' ('''K10 Alpha''') and the high-end '''LG K10+'''.

==Features==
===Hardware===
The 2018 model sports a metal design, compared to the [[LG K10 (2017)|predecessor]]. Similar to the previous model, it has the same processor and 720p screen.

'''MacMinute ''' was the name of a web site that provided news and information focused on [[Apple Inc]] and the [[Macintosh]] [[Operating system]]. It was founded by [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman Stan Flack in 2001 to "keep you up-to-date on everything that is going on in the world of Macintosh as soon as it happens". On the opening day, May 9, 2001 [http://www.macminute.com/2001/05/9/], the update to the Mac OS X to 10.0.3 was announced.

Prior to creating MacMinute Stan Flack founded the [[MacCentral]] news website which he sold to [[MacWorld]] on June 1, 1999.[http://db.tidbits.com/article/5425][http://www.mactech.com/news/] This website was eventually folded into the MacWorld brand name and the last vestiges of [[MacCentral]] disappeared with the incorporation of the [[MacCentral]] Forum into the [[MacWorld]] forums in December 2007.

MacMinute was noted for its up to the minute digest of current breaking news about everything connected to the Macintosh and Apple products but one of its more important functions was to serve as a forum for the Macintosh community. This [http://www.macminute.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/wwwthreads.pl?Cat=&amp;C=1 MacMinute Reader Café] is an eclectic mix of Macintosh users who provide and share expertise in all aspects of the Macintosh platform.

Mr. Flack died of natural causes, from complications to a [[pre-existing condition]], in his home on Prince Edward Island, Canada on April 14, 2008.

On May 22, 2008, the Flack family announced the closing of the Macminute website and forums. Some forum members decide to move to [http://maccentralcafe.com/forums/ MacCentral Cafe] as it reminds them of the single forum Stan Flack started with at the MacCentral news website.

On June 5, 2008 it is announced on the Macminute news site that [[MacTech]]'s Community News Scan and Macsimum News will act as caretakers to the archives of MacMinute News and Forums. They also announced they would continue to host the [http://forums.mactech.com/ MacMinute Forums] which are now up and running smoothly as of November 2008. [http://forums.mactech.com/ Stan's Lounge] is crowded with [[MacCentral]] and MacMinute faithful in honor of Stan Flack and all that he did for the Macintosh community.

[[Image:Machette kos.pg.jpg|right|thumb|425px|Older machete from Latin America]]

A '''machete''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|t|i}}; {{IPA-es|maˈtʃete}}) is a broad blade used either as an implement like an [[axe]], or in combat like a short [[sword]]. The blade is typically {{convert|32.5|to|45|cm|in}} long and usually under {{convert|3|mm|in}} thick. In the [[Spanish language]], the word is a diminutive form of the word ''macho'', which was used to refer to sledgehammers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=machete|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[English language]], an equivalent term is '''''matchet''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/matchet |title=matchet |work=Dictionary/thesaurus |publisher=The Free Dictionary |access-date=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is less commonly used. In the English-speaking Caribbean, such as Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1481752359 Blair, Teresa P. ''A-Z of Jamaican Patois (Patwah),'' Page 49, Google Books Result]&lt;/ref&gt; Barbados, Guyana, and Grenada and in Trinidad and Tobago, the term ''[[cutlass]]'' is used for these agricultural tools.&lt;ref name= "Klein"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Klein | first=John | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/what-is-a-machete-anyway/280705/ | title=What Is a Machete, Anyway? | work=''The Atlantic'' | date=21 October 2013 | access-date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Agusti¦ün Cruz Tinoco working.jpg|thumb|[[Agustín Cruz Tinoco]] of [[San Agustín de las Juntas]], [[Oaxaca]] uses a machete to carve wood]]

===In agriculture===
In various tropical and subtropical countries, the machete is frequently used to cut through [[rainforest]] undergrowth and for agricultural purposes (e.g. cutting [[sugar cane]]).&lt;ref name="FranzRogers2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franz|first1=Carl|last2=Rogers|first2=Carl Franz, Lorena Havens, Steve|last3=Havens|first3=Lorena|title=The People's Guide to Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2YZgJJXj1YC&amp;pg=PA278|date=11 December 2012|publisher=Avalon Travel Publishing|isbn=978-1-61238-049-0|pages=277–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, in [[Latin America]] a common use is for such household tasks as cutting large foodstuffs into pieces&amp;mdash;much as a [[cleaver (knife)|cleaver]] is used&amp;mdash;or to perform crude cutting tasks, such as making simple wooden handles for other tools.&lt;ref name="FranzRogers2012"/&gt; It is common to see people using machetes for other jobs, such as splitting open [[coconut]]s, yard work, removing small branches and plants, chopping animals' food, and clearing bushes.&lt;ref name="FranzRogers2012"/&gt;

Machetes are often considered tools and used by adults. However, many [[hunter–gatherer]] societies and cultures surviving through [[subsistence agriculture]] begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including machetes, before their first birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/09/bad_parenting_ideas_that_are_actually_good_for_some_babies.html|title=Give Your Baby a Machete|last=Day|first=Nicholas|date=9 April 2013|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a weapon===
Because the machete is common in many tropical countries, it is often the weapon of choice for [[uprising]]s. For example, the [[Boricua Popular Army]] are unofficially called ''[[Los Macheteros|macheteros]]'' because of the machete-wielding laborers of sugar cane fields of past [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Martin2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Gus|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Terrorism, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_jh4VBi_HYC&amp;pg=PA490|date=15 June 2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-8016-6|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the killings in the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]] were performed with machetes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Verwimp | first1 = P. | title = Machetes and Firearms: the Organization of Massacres in Rwanda | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 43| issue = 1 | pages = 5&amp;ndash;22| year = 2006 | doi = 10.1177/0022343306059576| url = http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/43/1/5.full.pdf+html| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were the primary weapon used by the [[Interahamwe]] militias there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary |last=Braid |title=The Jungle Massacre: African rebels who revel in their machete genocide |work=[[The Independent]] |date=3 March 1999 |accessdate=6 February 2009 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-jungle-massacre-african-rebels-who-revel-in-their-machete-genocide-1077954.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machetes were also a distinctive tool and weapon of the [[Haiti]]an ''[[Tonton Macoute]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haitianmedia.com/index.php/46 |title=Tonton Macoute |work=Haiti History |publisher=Haitian Media |accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] invaded [[Cuba]] in the [[Battle of Havana (1762)|Battle of Havana]], and peasant guerrillas led by [[Pepe Antonio]], a [[Guanabacoa]] councilman, used machetes in the defense of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cubanow.net/articles/why-did-english-take-over-havana |title=Why Did The English Take Over Havana? |first=Mildrey |last=Ponce |year=2007 |publisher=Cuba Now |accessdate=6 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143344/http://www.cubanow.net/articles/why-did-english-take-over-havana |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The machete was also the most iconic weapon during the [[History of Cuba#Antislavery and independence movements|independence wars]] in that country (1868–1898), although it saw limited battlefield use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Lawrence |last=Tone |title=War and Genocide in Cuba, 1895-1898 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8078-3006-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OxRVaAPpeCsC |chapter=Chapter 10: Mal Tiempo and the Romance of the Machete |pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]], owner of the [[sugar refinery]] ''La Demajagua'' near [[Manzanillo, Cuba|Manzanillo]], freed his slaves on 10 October 1868. He proceeded to lead them, armed with machetes, in revolt against the Spanish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cuba

The machete was (and still is) a common [[side arm]] and tool for many ethnic groups in [[West Africa]]. Machetes in this role are referenced in [[Chinua Achebe]]'s ''[[Things Fall Apart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/things/summary.html |title=Plot Overview |work=Things Fall Apart |publisher=[[SparkNotes]] |accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries have a name for the blow of a machete; the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''machetazo'' is sometimes used in English.&lt;ref name="Sturges2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturges|first=James Walter|title=Machetes in the Trunk: Three Weeks in Panama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plSb1MoA0hQC&amp;pg=PA31|date=August 2010|publisher=James Sturges|isbn=978-1-4404-8664-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Barbados]], Saint Lucia, and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the word ''planass'' means to hit someone with the flat of the blade of a machete or cutlass.&lt;ref name="Allsopp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage |first=Richard |last=Allsopp |publisher=[[University of the West Indies Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-976-640-145-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmvSk13sIc0C |pages= 184, 442–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; To strike with the sharpened edge is to "chop". Throughout the [[Caribbean]], the term 'cutlass' refers to a laborers' cutting tool.&lt;ref name="Allsopp"/&gt;

The [[Brazilian Army]]'s [[Centro de Instrução de Guerra na Selva|Instruction Center on Jungle Warfare]] developed a machete with a blade {{convert|10|in|cm}} in length and a very pronounced [[Blade#Knife_patterns|clip point]]. This machete is issued with a 5-inch [[Bowie knife]] and a [[sharpening stone]] in the scabbard; collectively called a "jungle kit" (''Conjunto de Selva'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]); it is manufactured by Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil ([[IMBEL]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snstecnologia.com.br/imbel3/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=117 |title=Conjunto de Selva |work=Produtos |publisher=[[IMBEL|Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil]] |accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fictitious slashers have used it as a weapon in horror movies, the most notorious being [[Jason Voorhees]], from the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' movie series]].

== Cultural variations ==
[[File:Tsakat-togh.jpg|thumb|325px|Tsakat, an Armenian tool used much like a machete.]]
[[File:Bolo ni Maximino.jpg|thumb|325px|''[[Bolo knife|Bolo]]'' or ''iták'']]
[[File:Mexican machete.JPG|right|thumb|325px|Mexican machete, from Acapulco, 1970. Horn handle, hand forged blade taper (hammer marks visible.). Has been sharpened by owner. Rust marks visible.]]

The tsakat is used primarily in southern [[Armenia]] and [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] when clearing areas or hiking.  It's especially well suited for clearing the plentiful blackberry plants in these regions.

The ''panga'' or ''tapanga'' is a variant used in [[East Africa|East]] and [[Southern Africa]]. This name may be of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] etymology; not to be confused with the [[Panga fish]]. The ''panga'' blade broadens on the backside and has a length of {{convert|16|to|18|in|cm}}. The upper inclined portion of the blade may be sharpened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Farm Implements for Small-scale Farmers in Tanzania |first=Björn |last=Mothander |author2=Finn Kjærby |author3=Kjell J. Havnevik  |publisher=Nordic Africa Institute |year=1989 |isbn=978-91-7106-290-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0N0mJ8cvM2gC |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tool has been used as a weapon: during the [[Mau Mau Uprising]]; in the Rwandan Genocide; in [[South Africa]] particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s when the former province of [[Natal Province|Natal]] was wracked by conflict between the [[African National Congress]] and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]]-nationalist [[Inkatha Freedom Party]].&lt;ref name="Cavaleri2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavaleri|first=David P.|title=The Law of War: Can 20th Century Standards Apply to the Global War on Terrorism?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq820_ESKXgC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2005|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4379-2301-8|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], the ''[[Bolo knife|bolo]]'' is a very similar tool, but with the blade swelling just before the tip to make the knife even more efficient for chopping. Variations include the longer and more pointed ''iták'' intended for combat; this was used during the [[Philippine Revolution]] against the Spanish colonial authorities, later becoming a signature weapon of guerrillas in the [[Philippine–American War]]. Filipinos still use the ''bolo'' for everyday tasks, such as clearing vegetation and chopping various large foodstuffs. These are also commonly found in most Filipino kitchens, with some sets displayed on the walls and other sets for less practical use. The ''bolo'' is also used in training in ''[[eskrima]]'', the indigenous [[Filipino martial art|martial art]] of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Wilson2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Frederick T.|title=A Sailor's Log: Water-tender Frederick T. Wilson, USN, on Asiatic Station, 1899–1901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pb7vSZgl5BYC&amp;pg=PA130|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Kent State University Press|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-87338-782-8|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other similar tools include the ''[[parang (knife)|parang]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armor in All Countries and in All Times: In All Countries and in All Times
|first=George Cameron |last=Stone |author2=Donald J.

The Nepalese ''[[kukri]]'' is a curved blade that is often used for similar tasks.

In [[Thailand]], more variations exist, such as the ''e-nep'', or ''nep'', which translates as "leaf" (มีดเหน็บ). It may resemble some forms of Muslim blades like the ''jambiya'', or the Nepali ''khukuri'', having aspects of both with the up-swept tip and protruding belly. Another design found in Thailand is the ''e-toh'', which is prominent in Southern China, Laos, and other northern parts of South East Asia. Generally, ''e-tohs'' must have forward weighted tips, and are used around the home for splitting stove wood or chopping bone. The Chinese ''dao'', with its triangular tip, is found in Thailand as the ''hua-tad'' (หัวแตด), which translates roughly as "head chopper." The most common blade in Thailand is called the ''pra'', (พร้า) it can describe long straight designs, or billhook designs. The primary purpose of a ''pra'' is farm work and clearing vegetation.

In the various regions of [[Ecuador]], it is still used as an everyday tool in agricultural labors, such as clearing, chopping, cutting and felling. In the Pacific coast region, the machete has a long history of use and can be seen as part of the everyday dress of the rural male inhabitants, especially in the provinces of [[Manabí Province|Manabi]], [[Los Ríos Province|Los Rios]] and [[Guayas Province|Guayas]]. In its day, the machete and the skills related to it were seen as a token of manliness, and it was carried, sword-like, in ornamented sheaths made out of leather or in sashes around the waist. Its use was not limited to agriculture: it also had a double role as a ready-to-hand weapon for self-defense or attack. Although modern laws in Ecuador now prohibit its use as a weapon, there are still cases of vicious fighting or intimidation related to it. Being a part of the male dress, it also has a part in the cultural expressions of the coastal rural regions of Ecuador, such as dances, horse taming contests and skill exhibitions.

In the southern [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the machete made by Spanish is largely used. It is used to clear paths through the bush, and was used to fight against the Brazilian Empire in the [[Ragamuffin War]]. There, the machete is called ''facão'' or ''facón'' (literally "big knife"). Today, this region has a dance called the ''dança dos facões'' (machetes' dance) in which the dancers, who also always men, knock their machetes while dancing, simulating a battle. ''[[Maculelê (dance)|Maculelê]]'', an [[Afro-Brazilian]] dance and martial art, can also be performed with ''facões''. This practice began in the city of [[Santo Amaro, Bahia]], in the northeastern part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Lowell |last=Lewis |title=Ring of Liberation: Deceptive Discourse in Brazilian Capoeira |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-226-47683-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcB_1E8dKv8C |chapter=3: Capoeira in Salvador |pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]] it is widely used to clear bush and often hundreds of ''macheteros'' are contracted to assist in clearing paths for the construction of new roads or structures. Many people in the rural regions own machetes to clear the constant overgrowth of jungle bush. In the recent drug cartel wars of the region, many homicides and decapitations are suspected of being committed with machetes or similar tools.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Russian Survival Machete.jpg|thumb|right|Russian taiga]] --&gt;
The ''taiga'' is a machete of Russian origin that combines the functions of machetes, axes, knives, saws, and shovels into one tool. It is easily distinguished by the large swell at the end of the blade to facilitate chopping. The ''taiga'' is used by military air and special forces, including the ''Spetsnaz''.

== Similar historical tools and weapons ==
The modern machete is very similar to some forms of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[falchion]],&lt;ref name="Klein"/&gt; a short [[sword]] popular from the 13th century onwards. The cutting edge of the falchion is curved, widening toward the point, and has a straight, unsharpened back edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Edelman |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2000
|isbn=978-0-485-11546-8 |title=Shakespeare's Military Language: A Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cpk3nT5FCaoC |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machete differs from the falchion mainly in the lack of a [[hilt#Guard|guard]] and a simpler hilt, though some machetes do have a guard for greater hand protection during work.

The ''[[kopis]]'' is an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] weapon comparable to the machete. The ''[[makhaira]]'' is also similar, but was intended primarily to be a weapon rather than a tool.

The ''[[seax]]'' is a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] weapon that is also similar in function, although different in shape.

The ''[[kukri]]'' is a Nepalese curved blade used for many purposes similar to the machete.

The ''[[Parang (knife)|parang]]'' is a Malaysian knife that many machetes are based on.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

The ''[[grosse messer]]'' is a large ''medieval'' [[knife]], employed both as a tool and as a weapon.

The ''[[Dao (sword)|dao]]'' is a traditional Chinese weapon resembling the machete. It is also known as "The General of All Weapons". {{cn|date=January 2018}}

The [[fascine knife]] is a somewhat similar tool and weapon used by European armies throughout the late 18th to early 20th centuries. The [[Spanish Army]] called its fascine knives ''machetes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA8AAAAAMAAJ |first=C.

They differ from machetes in that they generally have far thicker, tapered blades optimized for chopping European vegetation (the thin, flat blade of the machete is better for soft plants found in tropical environments), sword-like hilts and guards, and sometimes a sawback-blade.&lt;ref name="1802-43" /&gt; Some later models could be fixed to [[rifle]]s as [[bayonet]]s as well.&lt;ref name="1843-07" /&gt;

The [[katana]], typically acquired through trade, was used by the Ainu people in a machete-like fashion rather than a weapon as it was originally intended to be.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Both the materials used and the shape of the machete itself are important to make a good machete. In the past, the most famous manufacturer of machetes in [[Latin America]] and the Spanish-speaking [[Caribbean]] was Collins Company of [[Collinsville (Canton, Connecticut)|Collinsville]], [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FK8RAAAAYAAJ |first=Chester Lloyd |last=Jones |title=The Consular Service of the United States: Its History and Activities |year=1906 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |location=[[Philadelphia]] |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded as Collins &amp; Company in 1826 by [[Samuel W. Collins]] to make [[axe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry J. |last=Kauffman |title=American Axes: A Survey of Their Development and Their Makers |chapter=III: The Nineteenth Century |publisher=Masthof Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-1-883294-12-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5ZiYCZRdHwC |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first machetes were sold in 1845&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collins' Machetes and Bowies, 1845-1965 |first=Daniel Edward |last=Henry |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-87341-403-6 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became so famous that all good machetes were called "un Collins".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Oliver |last=La Farge |title=A Pictorial History of the American Indian |publisher=Crown Publishers |year=1956 |page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English-speaking Caribbean, Robert Mole &amp; Sons of Birmingham, England, was long considered the manufacturer of agricultural cutlasses of the best quality. Some Robert Mole blades survive as souvenirs of travelers to Trinidad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/6121694|title=1566: Vintage Trinidad Machete in Leather Sheath : Lot 1566|work=liveauctioneers.com|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamaica, and, less commonly, St. Lucia.

Since the 1950s, however, manufacturing shortcuts have resulted in a quality decline of machetes. Today, most modern factory-made machetes are of very simple construction, consisting of a blade and full-length [[Tang (tools)|tang]] punched from a single piece of flat steel plate of uniform thickness (and thus lack a [[primary grind]]), and a simple [[hilt#Grip|grip]] of two plates of wood or plastic bolted or [[rivet]]ed together around the tang. Finally, both sides are ground down to a rough edge so that the purchaser can sharpen the blade to their specific geometry using a file. These machetes are occasionally provided with a simple cord loop as a sort of [[lanyard]], and a [[canvas]] [[scabbard]]&amp;mdash;although in some regions where machetes are valuable, commonly used tools, the users may make decorative [[leather]] scabbards for them.

[[Toughness]] is important because of the twisting and impact forces that the relatively thin blade may encounter, while edge retention is secondary. Medium to high [[Carbon steel|carbon]] [[spring steel]]s, such as [[SAE steel grades|1050]] to [[SAE steel grades|1095]], are well suited to this application (with better machetes using the latter), and are relatively easy to sharpen. Most [[stainless steel]] machetes should be avoided, as many high-carbon stainless-steel machetes cannot stand up to repeated impacts, and will easily break if abused.

In comparison to most other knives, which are commonly heat treated to a very high degree of hardness, many machete blades are [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] to maximum toughness, often nearly spring tempered. This results in a tougher blade, more resistant to chipping and breaking, with an edge that is easier to sharpen but does not retain sharpness as well, due to its lower hardness.

A properly constructed machete will have a convex or flat primary bevel from the spine to the edge, which is formed by a secondary bevel. Better machetes will also have a slight [[Blade geometry#Taper|distal taper]].

[[Colombia]] is the largest exporter of machetes worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2014/04/12/activos/190612|title=Colombia líder - La Prensa|date=12 April 2014|website=laprensa.com.ni|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Angola.svg|thumb|The [[Flag of Angola]]]]

== Other uses==
The [[flag of Angola]] features a machete, along with a [[cog-wheel]].

The machete is also a performance weapon used in variations of the Brazilian martial dance called ''[[Maculelê (dance)|maculelê]]'', often practiced by practitioners of ''[[capoeira]]''. In the Mexican state of [[Durango]], the folkloric dance called ''Danza de los Machetes'' consists of blind-folded dancers juggling machetes and pitching them at increasing speeds between one another.

Traditional forms of fencing with machetes include [[Colombian grima]] in Colombia, ''[[Juego del garrote]]'' in Venezuela, and ''[[tire machèt]]'' in Haiti.

In photography, '''manual focus override''', also known as '''full-time manual focus''', allows manual intervention in the [[autofocus]] acquisition process simply by turning the [[focus ring]] on a photographic lens.

There are a number of technologies used to implement this feature. [[Pentax]] uses the trademark ''[[Quick Shift]]'' to refer to its implementations of manual focus override.

'''Michell structures''' are structures that are optimal based on the criteria defined by [[Anthony Michell|A.G.M. Michell]] in his seminal 1904 paper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Michell|Michell, A. G. M.]] (1904) ''The limits of economy of material in frame-structures'', Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 8(47), p. 589-597.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Michell|Michell]] states that ''“a frame (today called truss) (is optimal) attains the limit of economy of material possible in any frame-structure under the same applied forces, if the space occupied by it can be subjected to an appropriate small deformation, such that the strains in all the bars of the frame are increased by equal fractions of their lengths, not less than the fractional change of length of any element of the space.”''

The above conclusion is based on the Maxwell load-path theorem:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{} l_p f_p - \sum_{} l_q f_q = C&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; is the tension value in any tension element of length &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_q&lt;/math&gt; is the compression value in any compression element of length &lt;math&gt;l_q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant value which is based on external loads applied to the structure.

Based on the Maxwell load-path theorem, reducing load path of tension members &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{} l_p f_p&lt;/math&gt; will reduce by the same value the load path of compression elements&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{} l_q f_q&lt;/math&gt;  for a given set of external loads. Structure with minimum load path is one having minimum compliance [[Topology_optimization#Structural_compliance|compliance]] (having minimum weighted deflection in the points of applied loads weighted by the values of these loads). In consequence Michell structures are minimum compliance trusses.

==Special cases==

'''1. All bars of a truss are subject to a load of the same sign (tension or compression).'''

Required volume of material is the same for all possible cases for a given set of loads. Michell defines minimum required volume of material to be:
&lt;math display="inline"&gt; V_m=\frac{\sum_{} l f}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the allowable stress in the material.

'''2. Mixed tension and compression bars'''

More general case are frames which consist of bars that both before and after the appropriate deformation, form curves of orthogonal systems. A two-dimensional orthogonal system remains orthogonal after stretching one series of curves and compressing the other with equal strain if and only if the inclination between any two adjacent curves of the same series is constant throughout their length. This requirement results with the perpendicular series of cures to be either:

a) systems of tangents and [[involute]]s or

b) systems of intersecting [[logarithmic spiral]]s.

Note that straight line or a circle are special cases of a [[logarithmic spiral]].

==Examples==

Michell provided several examples of optimum frames:

==Prager trusses==
In recent years a lot of studies have been done on discrete optimum trusses.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Prager|Prager W.]], A Note on Discretized Michell Structures, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Vol. 3, pp. 349-355, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Prager|Prager W.]] Optimal layout of cantilever trusses, Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications (1977) 23: 111. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00932301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Prager|Prager W.]] Nearly optimal design of trusses, Computers &amp; Structures, ISSN: 0045-7949, Vol: 8, Issue: 3, Page: 451-454, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Michell trusses being defined for continuum (infinite number of members) these are sometimes called Michell trusses as well. Significant contribution to the topic of discrete optimum trusses had [[William Prager]] who used the method of the circle of relative displacements to arrive with optimal topology of such trusses (typically cantilevers). To recognize [[William Prager|Prager’s]] contribution discrete Michell trusses are sometimes called Prager trusses. Later geometry of cantilevered Prager trusses has been formalized by Mazurek, [[William F. Baker (engineer)|Baker]] and Tort &lt;ref&gt;Mazurek, A., [[William F. Baker (engineer)|Baker W.F.]]  &amp; Tort, C., Geometrical aspects of optimum truss like structures, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (2011) 43: 231. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-010-0559-x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazurek, A., Geometrical aspects of optimum truss like structures for three-force problem, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (2012) 45: 21. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-011-0679-y&lt;/ref&gt; who noticed certain geometrical relationships between members of optimal discrete trusses for 3 point or 3 force problems.

'''NCL Eclipse''' is a plugin for [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]] aiming at supporting the development of [[Nested Context Language]] applications. NCL is the declarative standard language for [[ISDB-T International|ISDB-Tb]] (International System for Digital Broadcast Terrestrial Brazilian) and also is [[ITU-T]] standard for [[IPTV]] systems. NCL Eclipse was first developed by [http://laws.deinf.ufma.br Laws Lab] and it is currently jointly maintained by [http://laws.deinf.ufma.br  Laws] and [http://www.telemidia.puc-rio.br  TeleMídia] Labs.

''NCL Eclipse'' is free software, available at [http://www.softwarepublico.gov.br/ Brazilian Public Software Portal] under [[GPL#Version 2|GNU GPLv2]] license.

As an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]] plug-in NCL Eclipse can be easily integrated with others plug-ins---for instance, those supporting other ISDB-Tb and ITU-T standard languages (such as [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]).

==NCL Eclipse Historical Evolution==

===NCL Eclipse 1.0 ===
The first stable version of NCL Eclipse was named "NCL Eclipse 1.0". This version has included support to syntax highlighting, folding (which allows the author to hide parts of source code according with his needs), wizards to create simple documents, auto-formatting, document, marking error validation, contextual content suggestion and an outline view (which shows the document content as a tree). To provide the marking error validation, all NCL Eclipse versions uses the [[NCL Validator]] (validation framework of NCL documents). This first version was very well accepted by the community of NCL developers, which gave several feedbacks. The NCL Eclipse evolution is strongly based on these feedbacks.

===NCL Eclipse 1.4 ===
The NCL Eclipse 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 have focused mainly on fixing bugs from the previous version. The next big changes came with 1.4 version of NCL Eclipse. That version brings program visualization, media previews and hypertext navigation. Additionally, a new plug-in aimed to integrate NCL Eclipse with NCL Club was included in the same package. As pointed out before, the integration with NCL Club allows for beginners to start learning NCL based on real-world examples. The internationalization support for English, Spanish and Portuguese was also included in this version.

===NCL Eclipse 1.5 ===
The latest stable, and current version, is "NCL Eclipse 1.5". This version contains some improvements in source code. As new feature, this version came with support to semi-automatic error correction and option to run the NCL document, provided by a virtual machine running the Ginga-NCL emulator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3453">'''National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences''' (NARSS) is the pioneering [[Egypt]]ian institution in the field of [[satellite]] [[remote sensing]].

==History==
NARSS is an outgrowth of [[Remote Sensing Center]], established in 1971 as an American-Egyptian joint project, they were affiliated with the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology. In 1994 the authority was established as an organization under the State Ministry of Scientific Research to promote the use of state of the art [[space technology]] for the development of the country and introducing High Tech capabilities to [[regional planning]] and other applications.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narss.sci.eg/about|title=About NARSS|access-date=October 27, 2016|website=National Authority for Remote Sensing &amp; Space Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NARSS includes two major sectors: Remote Sensing and [[Space science|Space Sciences]]. The sector of remote sensing works on the use of data provided by [[earth observation satellite]]s and various airborne sensors to produce maps and spatial data for the evaluation and monitoring of [[natural resource]]s, natural hazards and management environmental. The sector of space sciences is concerned with the development of sensors for earth observation to be mounted on satellites and with all the problems involved with monitoring communication with satellites and retrieving the information for processing, and ultimately on launching an Egyptian remote sensing satellite.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Facilities==

Both the headquarters and the New Cairo space control station are located in Cairo. The receiving station is located in Aswan.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Satellites==
[[EgyptSat 1]] was a remote sensing satellite that was launched on 17 April 2007 at [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]. Control and communication was lost July 2010.The satellite weighed 100 kg and contained a multi-spectral imager for Earth observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2007-012A|title=EgyptSat1|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=October 27, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329165838/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2007-012A|archivedate=March 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nokia Pop-Port.jpg|thumb|Pop-Port on [[Nokia 6680]]]]

The '''Pop-Port''' interface (originally code-named "[[Tomahawk (axe)|Tomahawk]]"){{fact|date=February 2008}} was a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] plug-in port for accessories and data synchronisation, available with many [[Nokia]] [[mobile phone]]s. The port consists of one metal pin on either end, and a plastic tab containing thirteen contacts. Pop-Port-like interfaces first appeared in Nokia phones since circa 1996, but the Pop-Port was standardised as a single interface in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chip.de/artikel/Nokias-Pop-Port-Schnittstelle_140041433.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2007 the Pop-Port was fully replaced by the industry standard [[USB]] (miniUSB, and later by microUSB) sockets for data services and a 4-part 2.5mm or 3.5mm "standard" [[TRS connector#Mobile phones|TRRS socket]] for audio. Nokia had been equipping certain devices with one of these connectors as alternatives from about 2004.{{fact|date=February 2008}}

Nokia filed "Pop-Port" as a [[trademark]] in the [[United States]] on September 3, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4808:vv0grj.3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The port carries signals for hands-free microphone, stereo speakers, [[FBus]] Rx/Tx or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] signals for the phones supporting them, power output for feeding the accessories that do not have their own batteries, and the Accessory Control Interface (ACI), a bidirectional serial control bus for connection and authentication of phone accessories, with a specific [[ASIC]] inside accessories and a [[proprietary protocol]]. It is also used to upgrade [[USB]]-enabled phones' software using a specific USB data cable and the [[Nokia Software Updater]]. Earlier cables connected to [[RS-232]] but later was replaced by USB.

==Criticisms==
A common problem with Pop-port was that contacts often lost connection, thus resulting in drop-outs in audio (when a hands-free device is used) or an unstable data connection (when a USB cable is used). This was a common problem when listening to music from the phone while the phone was in a pocket. The more stable 2.5 mm and 3.5 mm audio sockets aren't prone to such problems.

The contacts are exposed to dust and dirt, more so than those of a [[TRS connector#Mobile phones|TRRS socket]]. This, combined with the small size of the contacts, prevented connections in some cases. Also, the plug's 'hook' tended to lose its hooking capability, making it even easier to accidentally lose connection. The data cables had to be original in most cases.

==Available Pop-Port plug-ins==
* [[Camera]]
* [[FM radio]]
* [[Headphones]]
* LCD display remote controller
* [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cable
* 3.5mm [[stereo plug]] adapter
* [[Flash (photography)|Flash]]
* [[8P8C]] (RJ-45) cable (CA-41)

Numerical manipulation of Doppler parameters obtain during routine [[Echocardiography]] has been extensively utilized to non-invasively estimate intra-cardiac pressures, in many cases removing the need for invasive cardiac catheterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3366997 | volume=11 | title=Prediction of the severity of aortic stenosis by Doppler aortic valve area determination: prospective Doppler-catheterization correlation in 100 patients | year=1988 | journal=J.

Echocardiography uses ultrasound to create real-time anatomic images of the [[heart]] and its structures.  [[Doppler echocardiography]] utilizes the Doppler principle to estimate intracardiac velocities. Via the modified [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli equation]], velocity is routinely converted to pressure gradient for use in clinical cardiology decision making.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wikiecho.org/wiki/Aortic_stenosis&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad discipline of mathematical modeling of intracardiac velocity parameters for pulmonary circulation and aortic Doppler for [[aortic stenosis]] have been investigated.  [[Diastolic heart failure|Diasatolic dysfunction]] algorithms use complex combinations of these numeric models to estimate intra-cardiac filling pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scalia | first1 = Gregory M. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = Neil L. | last3 = McCarthy | first3 = Patrick M. | last4 = Thomas | first4 = James D. | last5 = Vandervoort | first5 = Pieter M. | year = 1997 | title = Non-Invasive Assessment of the Ventricular Relaxation Time Constant (?) in Humans by Doppler  Echocardiography | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 151–5 | doi=10.1161/01.cir.95.1.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scalia | first1 = G.M. | last2 = Burstow | first2 = D.J. | year = 1999 | title = Color M-mode and Doppler-derived tau (?) as practical  advances in clinical diastology - the TauCoMM project | url = | journal = Heart, Lung and Circulation | volume = 9 | issue = 3| page = A13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24054048 | doi=10.1016/j.echo.2013.08.001 | volume=26 | title=Measurement of pulmonary pressures and pulmonary resistance: is Doppler ready for prime time? | date=Oct 2013 | journal=J Am Soc Echocardiogr | pages=1178–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shunt defects have been studied using the [[Relative Atrial Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = Natalie F | last2 = Walters | first2 = Darren | last3 = Hourigan | first3 = Lisa | last4 = Burstow | first4 = Darryl J | last5 = Scalia | first5 = Gregory M | year = 2010 | title = The Relative Atrial Index (RAI) – A Novel, Simple, Reliable and Robust Transthoracic Echocardiographic Indicatory of Atrial Defects | url = | journal = J Am Soc Echocardiogr | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 275–81 | doi=10.1016/j.echo.2009.11.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenDoc''' is a multi-platform [[software componentry]] framework standard created by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for [[compound document]]s, intended as an alternative to [[Microsoft]]'s [[Object Linking and Embedding]] (OLE).&lt;ref name="appleWordperfectAnnounce"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wohl.com/g0014.htm | title=Apple and WordPerfect Announce OpenDoc | author=Amy D. Wohl | date=June 1993 | work=Amy D. Wohl' Opinions | accessdate=April 24, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061109195319/http://www.wohl.com/g0014.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = November 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active development was discontinued in March 1997.&lt;ref name=cnet97 /&gt;&lt;ref name=techCrunch97 /&gt;

The core idea of OpenDoc is to create small, reusable components, responsible for a specific task, such as text editing, bitmap editing, or browsing an [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server. OpenDoc provides a framework in which these components can run together, and a document format for storing the data created by each component. These documents can then be opened on other machines, where the OpenDoc frameworks substitute suitable components for each part, even if they are from different vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.byte.com/art/9403/sec9/art1.htm | title=A Close-Up of OpenDoc | first=Kurt | last=Piersol | date=March 1994 | work=Byte.com | accessdate=April 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way users can "build up" their documents from parts. Since there is no main application and the only visible interface is the document itself, the system is known as ''document centered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gregmaletic.wordpress.com/2006/11/12/opendoc/ | title=OpenDoc | author=Greg Maletic | date=November 12, 2006 | work=Greg Maletic’s Blog | accessdate=April 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its inception, it was envisioned that OpenDoc would allow smaller, third-party developers to enter the then-competitive office software market, able to build one good editor instead of having to provide a complete suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech-insider.org/mac/research/acrobat/Mac/950829.pdf|title=Macintosh vs Windows 95|quote=Application developers will be able to focus on writing small programs that do specific things, rather than creating entire suites. This will make it much easier for small, innovative software companies to get back in the industry....OpenDoc applications will be sold the way applications are sold today, and through the same channels. But as with any new technology, additional channels will evolve to capitalize on the technology’s strengths. It is likely that over time on-line component warehouses will be used to distribute some OpenDoc applications.  Interesting new on-line applications and services will be enabled by OpenDoc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
=== Early efforts ===
OpenDoc was initially created by Apple in 1992, after [[Microsoft]] approached Apple asking for input on a proposed OLE II project. Apple had been experimenting with software components internally for some time, based on the initial work done on its [[Publish and Subscribe (Mac OS)|Publish and Subscribe]] linking model and the [[AppleScript]] [[scripting language]], which in turn was based on the [[HyperCard]] programming environment. Apple reviewed the Microsoft prototype and document and returned a list of problems they saw with the design. Microsoft and Apple, who were very competitive at the time, were unable to agree on common goals and did not work together.

At about the same time, a group of third-party developers had met at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC '91) and tried to hammer out a standardized document format, based conceptually on the [[Electronic Arts]] [[Interchange File Format]] (IFF). Apple became interested in this work, and soon dedicated some engineers to the task of building, or at least documenting, such a system. Initial work was published on the WWDC CDs, as well as a number of follow-up versions on later developer CDs. A component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use, and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort.  The format quickly changed from a simple one using tags to a very complex [[Object-oriented programming|object oriented]] persistence layer called [[Bento (file format)|Bento]].

Initially the effort was codenamed "Exemplar", then "Jedi", "Amber", and eventually "OpenDoc".

=== Competing visions ===
Apple was also involved in the [[Taligent]] project during some of this period, which offered somewhat similar functionality although based on very different underlying mechanisms.  While OpenDoc was still being developed, Apple confused things greatly by suggesting that it should be used by people porting existing software only, and new projects should instead be based on Taligent since that would be the next OS. Taligent was considered the future of the Mac platform, and work on other tools like [[MacApp]] were considerably deprioritized. When Taligent died in 1995, Apple was left with no major ongoing efforts along these lines, and OpenDoc became the future of Mac development.

Starting in 1992, Apple had also been involved in an effort to replace MacApp development framework with a cross-platform solution known as [[Bedrock (framework)|Bedrock]], from [[Symantec]]. Symantec's [[Think C]] was rapidly becoming the tool of choice for development on the Mac. Apple had been working with them to port their tools to the [[PowerPC]] when they learned of Symantec's internal porting tools. Apple proposed merging existing MacApp concepts and code with Symantec's to produce an advanced cross-platform system. Bedrock began to compete with OpenDoc as "the" solution for future development.

As OpenDoc gained currency within Apple, the company started to push Symantec into including OpenDoc functionality in Bedrock. Symantec was uninterested in this, and eventually gave up on the effort, passing the code to Apple. Bedrock was in a very early state of development at this point, in spite of 18 months of work, as the development team at Symantec suffered continual turnover. Apple proposed that the code would be used for OpenDoc programming, but nothing was ever heard of this again, and Bedrock disappeared.

As a result of Taligent and Bedrock both being the "next big thing", little effort had been expended on updating MacApp. As these two projects died, this left Apple with only OpenDoc as a modern OO-based programming system.

=== Partnerships ===
The development team realized in mid-1992 that an industry coalition was needed to promote the system, and created the ''Component Integration Laboratories'' ("CI Labs") with [[IBM]] and [[WordPerfect]]. IBM introduced the [[System Object Model]] (SOM) [[Library (computer science)|shared library]] system to the project, which became a major part of Apple's future efforts, in and out of OpenDoc.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In 1996 the project was adopted by the [[Object Management Group]], in part due to SOM's use of [[Common Object Request Broker Architecture]] (CORBA), maintained by the OMG.

OpenDoc was one of Apple's earliest experiments with [[open standards]] and collaborative development methods with other companies. Apple and its partners never publicly released the source code, but did make the complete source available to developers for feedback and for testing and debugging purposes.

=== Release ===
OpenDoc was initially released to run on [[classic Mac OS]] [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7.5]]. From [[IBM]]’s involvement in [[Taligent]], there was an implementation of OpenDoc in [[OS/2]] Warp 4.

== Products implementing OpenDoc ==
The [[WAV (word processor)|WAV]] [[word processor]] was a semi-successful OpenDoc [[word processor]] from [[Digital Harbor LLC|Digital Harbor]]; the [[Numbers &amp; Charts]] package was a spreadsheet and 3D real-time charting solution from [[Adrenaline Software]]; and the [[Cyberdog]] web browser was created by Apple as an OpenDoc application. Lexi from Soft-Linc, Inc. was a linguistic package containing a spell checker, thesaurus and a simple translation tool which WAV and other components used. The [[Nisus Writer]] software by Nisus incorporated OpenDoc, but its implementation was hopelessly buggy. [[Bare Bones Software]] tested the waters by making its [[BBEdit Lite]] freeware text editor available as an OpenDoc editor component. [[RagTime (computer program)|RagTime]], a completely integrated office package with spreadsheet, publishing and image editing was ported to OpenDoc shortly before OpenDoc was cancelled. Apple's 1996 release of ClarisWorks 5.0 (the predecessor of [[AppleWorks]]) was planned to support OpenDoc components, but this was dropped.

=== Educational products ===
Another OpenDoc container application, called "Dock'Em", was written by MetaMind Software under a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] and commissioned by The Center for Research in Math and Science Education, headquartered at [[San Diego State University]]. The goal was to allow multimedia content to be included in documents describing curriculum.

A number of [[physics]] [[simulation]]s were written by MetaMind Software and by Russian software firm Physicon ([[OpenTeach]]) as OpenDoc parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gregmaletic.wordpress.com/2006/11/12/opendoc/#comment-368 | title=OpenDoc - Comment by Arni McKinley | author=Arni McKinley | date=December 19, 2006 | work=Greg Maletic’s Blog | accessdate=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physics curricula for high school and middle school used them as their focus. With the demise of OpenDoc, the simulations were rewritten as Java [[applet]]s and are still available from the Center under the title of "[http://cpuproject.sdsu.edu/ The Constructing Physics Understanding (CPU) Project]" by Dr. Fred Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpuproject.sdsu.edu/default.html|title=Constructing Physics Understanding|last=The CPU Project|date=February 2001|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Components of the [http://e-slate.cti.gr E-Slate educational microworlds' platform] were originally implemented as OpenDoc parts in [[C++]] on both MacOS and Windows, reimplemented later on (after the demise of OpenDoc) as [[Java applets]] and eventually as [[JavaBeans]].

== Problems ==
{{Original research|date=October 2015}}

OpenDoc's flexibility came at a cost. OpenDoc components were invariably large and slow. For instance, opening a simple text editor part would often require 2 [[megabyte]]s of [[random access memory|RAM]] or more, whereas the same editor written as a standalone application could be as small as 32 KB. This initial overhead became less important as the number of documents open increased, since the basic cost was for shared libraries which implemented the system, but it was large compared to entry level machines of the day. Many developers felt that the extra overhead was too large, and since the operating system did not include OpenDoc capability, the memory footprint of their OpenDoc based applications appeared unacceptably large. In absolute terms, the one-time library overhead was approximately 1 megabyte of RAM, which at the time was nearly half of a low-end desktop computer's entire RAM complement.

Another issue was that OpenDoc had little in common with most "real world" document formats, and so OpenDoc documents could really only be used by other OpenDoc machines. Although one would expect some effort to allow the system to export to other formats, this was often impractical because each component held its own data. For instance, it took significant effort for the system to be able to turn a text file with some pictures into a [[Microsoft Word]] document, both because the text editor had no idea what was in the embedded objects, and because the proprietary Microsoft format was undocumented and required reverse engineering.

Another problem was the fact that each part saved its data within Bento (the former name of an OpenDoc compound document file format) in its own internal binary format, and it was very common to find one component could not open a document created by another, even though the internal data represented similar objects (spreadsheet data for instance). OpenDoc attempted to solve this problem by allowing developers to store multiple formats to represent the same document object. For instance, it was both possible and encouraged to store a common format like [[JPEG]] along with editable binary format, but in practice few developers followed this recommendation. This problem was not unique to OpenDoc, and in fact was also experienced by the Microsoft equivalent, [[Object Linking and Embedding]] (OLE). Indeed, many years later, [[XML]] documents which attempt to perform embedding of other XML formats also encounter similar issues.

It also appears that OpenDoc was a victim of an oversold concept, that of compound documents. Only a few specific examples are common, for instance most [[word processor]]s and [[Desktop publishing|page layout]] programs include the ability to include graphics, and [[spreadsheet]]s are expected to handle charts.

But certainly the biggest problem with the project was that it was part of a very acrimonious competition between OpenDoc consortium members and Microsoft. The members of the OpenDoc alliance were all trying to obtain traction in a market rapidly being dominated by [[Microsoft Office]]. As the various partners all piled in their own pet technologies in hopes of making it an industry standard, OpenDoc grew increasingly unwieldy. At the same time, Microsoft used the synergy between the OS and applications divisions of the company to make it effectively mandatory that developers adopt the competing OLE technology. In order to obtain a Windows 95 compliance logo from Microsoft, one had to meet certain interoperability tests which were quite difficult to meet without adoption of OLE technology, even though the technology was largely only useful in integrating with [[Microsoft Office]]. OpenDoc was forced to create an interoperability layer in order to allow developers to even consider adoption, and this added a great technical burden to the project.

== Cancellation ==
OpenDoc had several hundred developers signed up but the timing was poor. Apple was rapidly losing money at the time and many in the industry press expected the company to fail.

OpenDoc was soon discontinued, with [[Steve Jobs]] (who had been at [[NeXT]] during this development) noting that they "put a bullet through [OpenDoc's] head", and most of the [[Apple Advanced Technology Group]] was laid off in a big reduction in force in March 1997.&lt;ref name=cnet97&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-lays-off-thousands/ | title=Apple lays off thousands | author=Dawn Kawamoto |author2=Anthony Lazarus | date=March 14, 1997 | work=CNET News.com | accessdate=April 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techCrunch97&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/06/jobs-focus-is-about-saying-no/ | title=Jobs:Focus Is About Saying, No | author=Erick Schonfeld | date=October 6, 2011 | work=TechCrunch.com | accessdate=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources noted that Microsoft hired away three ClarisWorks developers who were responsible for OpenDoc integration into ClarisWorks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bob/clarisworks.php#oregon | title=A Brief History of ClarisWorks : Oregon | author=Bob Hearn | year=2003 | work=Bob Hearn's website | accessdate=April 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AppleShare|AppleShare IP Manager]] from versions 5.0 to 6.2 relied on OpenDoc, but AppleShare IP 6.3, the first Mac OS 9 compatible version (released in 1999), eliminated the reliance on OpenDoc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=60659 | title=AppleShare IP 6.3 Does Not Require OpenDoc | author=Apple | date=December 18, 2003 | work=Apple Support | accessdate=April 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple officially relinquished the last trademark on the name '''OpenDoc''' on June 11, 2005.

'''Pedialyte''' is an oral [[electrolyte]] solution manufactured by [[Abbott Laboratories]] and marketed for use in children. It was invented by Dr. Gary Cohen of [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]], [[Massachusetts]].

==Description==
Pedialyte is designed to promote rehydration and electrolyte replacement in ill children. It "meets the requirements of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) Committee on Nutrition to help prevent dehydration in infants and children."&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.abbottnutrition.com/cms-prod/abbottnutrition.com/img/pedialyte-dehydration-prevention-new.pdf Dehydration Prevention Reference Guide.] Abbott Laboratories. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedialyte is lower in sugars than most sports drinks, containing 100 calories per liter compared to approximately 240 in [[Gatorade]]. It contains more [[sodium]] (1,035 milligrams per liter vs. 465 mg/L in Gatorade) and [[potassium]] (780 milligrams per liter vs. 127 mg/L in Gatorade). Pedialyte does not contain [[sucrose]], because this sugar has the potential to make diarrhea worse by drawing water into the intestine, increasing the risk of dehydration. In its flavored formulations, Pedialyte uses the synthetic sweeteners [[sucralose]] and [[acesulfame potassium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pedialyte® Liters|url=http://abbottnutrition.com/Products/pedialyte-liters|publisher=Abbott Nutrition|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedialyte has become a [[Fluid replacement|hydration]] alternative to sports drinks for some [[athletes]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Athletes, migrants drinking Pedialyte - UPI.com|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2007/12/26/Athletes_migrants_drinking_Pedialyte/UPI-60661198689475/|publisher=United Press International, Inc|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|hangover}}Pedialyte has become a popular drink for people suffering from [[hangover]]s, with one third of its sales coming from adults. There has been a 57% increase in its use by adults since 2012. As a result, Pedialyte has begun a marketing campaign promoting the use of Pedialyte by hungover adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/got-hangover-pedialyte-says-it-has-cure-n358796 Got a Hangover?

Pedialyte is similar to rehydration fluids used by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) such as "New Oral Rehydration Solution" ([[Oral rehydration therapy|N-ORS]]), that are used during the outbreak of illnesses such as [[cholera]] and [[rotavirus]]. Similar products include Lytren, NormaLyte, Gastrolyte, Ricelyte, Resol, and Drip Drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reyes|first=Nancy|title=» Cholera stalks Harare - Blogger News Network|url=http://www.bloggernews.net/117643|publisher=Blogger News Network|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
RCS has been used in automated manufacturing, robotics, and automated vehicle research at NIST.  The software consists of a C++ library and GUI and configuration tools written a variety of software languages. The Software Library is offering the following RCS tools:&lt;ref name="NIST09"/&gt;
* ''RCS Java-based Diagnostics Tool'' : A tool written as a java applet that allows programmers to see the status and send commands to any RCS module.
* ''RCS Java-based Diagnostics Tool Instructions'' : Instructions on how to build applications for use with the diagnostics tool.
* ''RCS-Design Tool'' : A tool written as a java applet that allows programmers to create RCS applications graphically and generates source code.
* ''RCS-Design Tool Instructions'' : Instructions on how to build applications with the RCS-Design tool.
* ''RCS Data Plotter'' : A Java applet which plots data on a cartesian or polar graph, read either in real-time or from a text file.
* ''Socket Interface to NML'' : ''Describes how to connect to an NML server using sockets directly. This information should also be useful for other languages where the C++ NML client interface is not available.''
* ''RCS Posemath Library'' : A library of classes for representing positions, rotations, and translations in a variety of coordinate systems and the functions to add/subtract/multiply/divide/convert them. For more info on posemath you may also want to check out: Karl Murphy's Posemath Examples
* ''RCS Library Lower Level Utilities'' : Describes many of the lower level utilities used to create the NODE, CMS, and NML components of the RCS Library but which may be useful on their own. Includes timers, semaphores, linked-lists, printing, and windows functions.
* ''RCS Library Installation Instructions'' : Provides instructions for getting and making the RCS Library.
* ''RCS Library Version Functions'' : Documentation for some functions for determining at run-time which version of the RCS library your using.

== RCS applications ==
* [[Robocrane]] - RCS controlled a [[crane (machine)|crane]] having six [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. It incorporated tactile, proximity and vision [[sensors]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16895">A '''real-time operating system''' ('''RTOS''') is an [[operating system]] (OS) intended to serve [[real-time computing|real-time]] applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays.  Processing time requirements (including any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of time.
A real time system is a time bound system which has well defined fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined constraints or the system will fail.  
They either are event driven or time sharing. Event driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities while time sharing systems switch the task based on clock interrupts. Most RTOS’s use a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.

A key characteristic of an RTOS is the level of its consistency concerning the amount of time it takes to accept and complete an application's [[Task (computing)|task]]; the variability is ''[[jitter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=chibios:articles:jitter | title = Response Time and Jitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''hard'' real-time operating system has less jitter than a ''soft'' real-time operating system.  The chief design goal is not high [[throughput]], but rather a guarantee of a [[Real-time computing#Criteria for real-time computing|soft or hard]] performance category.  An RTOS that can usually or ''generally'' meet a ''deadline'' is a soft real-time OS, but if it can meet a deadline [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministically]] it is a hard real-time OS.&lt;ref name="Tanenbaum"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tanenbaum|first=Andrew|title=Modern Operating Systems|year=2008|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-600663-3|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An RTOS has an advanced algorithm for [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]]. Scheduler flexibility enables a wider, computer-system orchestration of process priorities, but a real-time OS is more frequently dedicated to a narrow set of applications. Key factors in a real-time OS are minimal [[interrupt latency]] and minimal [[thread switching latency]]; a real-time OS is valued more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the amount of work it can perform in a given period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=chibios:articles:rtos_concepts | title = RTOS Concepts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See the [[comparison of real-time operating systems]] for a comprehensive list.  Also, see the [[list of operating systems]] for all types of operating systems.

== Design philosophies ==

The most common designs are
* Event-driven – [[Context switch|switches tasks]] only when an event of higher priority needs servicing; called [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive priority]], or priority scheduling.
* Time-sharing – switches tasks on a regular clocked interrupt, and on events; called [[Round-robin scheduling|round robin]].

[[Time sharing]] designs switch tasks more often than strictly needed, but give smoother [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]], giving the illusion that a process or user has sole use of a machine.

Early [[CPU design]]s needed many cycles to switch tasks during which the CPU could do nothing else useful. For example, with a 20&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 68000|68000]] processor (typical of the late 1980s), task switch times are roughly 20 microseconds. (In contrast, a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz [[ARM architecture|ARM]] CPU (from 2008) switches in less than 3 microseconds.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, early OSes tried to minimize wasting CPU time by avoiding unnecessary task switching.

== Scheduling ==
In typical designs, a task has three states:
# Running (executing on the CPU);
# Ready (ready to be executed);
# Blocked (waiting for an event, I/O for example).

Most tasks are blocked or ready most of the time because generally only one task can run at a time per CPU. The number of items in the ready queue can vary greatly, depending on the number of tasks the system needs to perform and the type of scheduler that the system uses. On simpler non-preemptive but still multitasking systems, a task has to give up its time on the CPU to other tasks, which can cause the ready queue to have a greater number of overall tasks in the ready to be executed state ([[resource starvation]]).

Usually the data structure of the ready list in the scheduler is designed to minimize the worst-case length of time spent in the scheduler's critical section, during which preemption is inhibited, and, in some cases, all interrupts are disabled.  But the choice of data structure depends also on the maximum number of tasks that can be on the ready list.

If there are never more than a few tasks on the ready list, then a [[doubly linked list]] of ready tasks is likely optimal. If the ready list usually contains only a few tasks but occasionally contains more, then the list should be sorted by priority.  That way, finding the highest priority task to run does not require iterating through the entire list. Inserting a task then requires walking the ready list until reaching either the end of the list, or a task of lower priority than that of the task being inserted.

Care must be taken not to inhibit preemption during this search. Longer critical sections should be divided into small pieces.  If an interrupt occurs that makes a high priority task ready during the insertion of a low priority task, that high priority task can be inserted and run immediately before the low priority task is inserted.

The critical response time, sometimes called the flyback time, is the time it takes to queue a new ready task and restore the state of the highest priority  task to running.  In a well-designed RTOS, readying a new task will take 3 to 20 instructions per ready-queue entry, and restoration of the highest-priority ready task will take 5 to 30 instructions.

In more advanced systems, real-time tasks share computing resources with many non-real-time tasks, and the ready list can be arbitrarily long. In such systems, a scheduler ready list implemented as a linked list would be inadequate.

=== Algorithms ===
Some commonly used RTOS scheduling algorithms are:
* [[Cooperative Scheduling|Cooperative scheduling]]
* [[Preemption (computing)|Preemptive scheduling]]
** [[Rate-monotonic scheduling]]
** [[Round-robin scheduling]]
** [[Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling]], an implementation of [[Time slice|preemptive time slicing]]
** Fixed-Priority Scheduling with Deferred Preemption
** Fixed-Priority Non-preemptive Scheduling
** Critical section preemptive scheduling
** Static time scheduling
* [[Earliest deadline first scheduling|Earliest Deadline First]] approach
* [[Stochastic]] [[Directed graph|digraphs]] with [[Thread (computer science)|multi-threaded]] [[Tree traversal|graph traversal]]

== Intertask communication and resource sharing ==
A multitasking operating system like [[Unix]] is poor at real-time tasks. The scheduler gives the highest priority to jobs with the lowest demand on the computer, so there is no way to ensure that a time-critical job will have access to enough resources. Multitasking systems must manage sharing data and hardware resources among multiple tasks. It is usually unsafe for two tasks to access the same specific data or hardware resource simultaneously.&lt;ref name="phraner1984fall"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-09/1984_09_BYTE_09-09_Guide_to_the_IBM_PCs#page/n61/mode/2up |title=The Future of Unix on the IBM PC |last=Phraner |first=Ralph A. |date=Fall 1984 |magazine=BYTE |pages=59–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three common approaches to resolve this problem:

=== Temporarily masking/disabling interrupts ===
General-purpose operating systems usually do not allow user programs to mask (disable) [[interrupt]]s, because the user program could control the CPU for as long as it wishes.  Some modern CPUs don't allow [[user mode]] code to disable interrupts as such control is considered a key operating system resource.  Many embedded systems and RTOSs, however, allow the application itself to run in [[kernel mode]] for greater [[system call]] efficiency and also to permit the application to have greater control of the operating environment without requiring OS intervention.

On single-processor systems, an application running in kernel mode and masking interrupts is the lowest overhead method to prevent simultaneous access to a shared resource.  While interrupts are masked and the current task does not make a blocking OS call, the current task has ''exclusive'' use of the CPU since no other task or interrupt can take control, so the [[critical section]] is protected.  When the task exits its critical section, it must unmask interrupts; pending interrupts, if any, will then execute.  Temporarily masking interrupts should only be done when the longest path through the critical section is shorter than the desired maximum [[interrupt latency]].  Typically this method of protection is used only when the critical section is just a few instructions and contains no loops.  This method is ideal for protecting hardware bit-mapped registers when the bits are controlled by different tasks.

=== Mutexes ===
When the shared resource must be reserved without blocking all other tasks (such as waiting for Flash memory to be written), it is better to use mechanisms also available on general-purpose operating systems, such as a [[mutex]] and OS-supervised interprocess messaging.  Such mechanisms involve system calls, and usually invoke the OS's dispatcher code on exit, so they typically take hundreds of CPU instructions to execute, while masking interrupts may take as few as one instruction on some processors.

A (non-recursive) mutex is either '''locked''' or unlocked.  When a task has locked the mutex, all other tasks must wait for the mutex to be unlocked by its '' owner'' - the original thread. A task may set a timeout on its wait for a mutex.  There are several well-known problems with mutex based designs such as [[priority inversion]] and [[deadlock]]s.

In [[priority inversion]] a high priority task waits because a low priority task has a mutex, but the lower priority task is not given CPU time to finish its work.  A typical solution is to have the task that owns a mutex at, or 'inherit,' the priority of the highest waiting task. But this simple approach gets more complex when there are multiple levels of waiting: task ''A'' waits for a mutex locked by task ''B'', which waits for a mutex locked by task ''C''. Handling multiple levels of inheritance causes other code to run in high priority context and thus can cause starvation of medium-priority threads.

In a [[deadlock]], two or more tasks lock mutex without timeouts and then wait forever for the other task's mutex, creating a cyclic dependency.  The simplest deadlock scenario occurs when two tasks alternately lock two mutex, but in the opposite order.  Deadlock is prevented by careful design.

=== Message passing ===
The other approach to resource sharing is for tasks to send messages in an organized [[message passing]] scheme.  In this paradigm, the resource is managed directly by only one task. When another task wants to interrogate or manipulate the resource, it sends a message to the managing task.  Although their real-time behavior is less crisp than semaphore systems, simple message-based systems avoid most protocol deadlock hazards, and are generally better-behaved than semaphore systems.  However, problems like those of semaphores are possible. Priority inversion can occur when a task is working on a low-priority message and ignores a higher-priority message (or a message originating indirectly from a high priority task) in its incoming message queue.  Protocol deadlocks can occur when two or more tasks wait for each other to send response messages.

== Interrupt handlers and the scheduler ==
Since an interrupt handler blocks the highest priority task from running, and since real time operating systems are designed to keep thread latency to a minimum, interrupt handlers are typically kept as short as possible. The interrupt handler defers all interaction with the hardware if possible; typically all that is necessary is to acknowledge or disable the interrupt (so that it won't occur again when the interrupt handler returns) and notify a task that work needs to be done. This can be done by unblocking a driver task through releasing a semaphore, setting a flag or sending a message. A scheduler often provides the ability to unblock a task from interrupt handler context.

An OS maintains catalogues of objects it manages such as threads, mutexes, memory, and so on. Updates to this catalogue must be strictly controlled. For this reason it can be problematic when an interrupt handler calls an OS function while the application is in the act of also doing so. The OS function called from an interrupt handler could find the object database to be in an inconsistent state because of the application's update. There are two major approaches to deal with this problem: the unified architecture and the segmented architecture. RTOSs implementing the unified architecture solve the problem by simply disabling interrupts while the internal catalogue is updated. The downside of this is that interrupt latency increases, potentially losing interrupts. The segmented architecture does not make direct OS calls but delegates the OS related work to a separate handler. This handler runs at a higher priority than any thread but lower than the interrupt handlers. The advantage of this architecture is that it adds very few cycles to interrupt latency. As a result, OSes which implement the segmented architecture are more predictable and can deal with higher interrupt rates compared to the unified architecture.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Similarly the [[System Management Mode]] on x86 compatible Hardware can take very much time before it returns control to the operating system. It is generally wrong to write real-time software for x86 Hardware.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Memory allocation ==
[[Memory allocation]] is more critical in a real-time operating system than in other operating systems.

First, for stability there cannot be [[memory leak]]s (memory that is allocated but not freed after use).  The device should work indefinitely, without ever needing a reboot. For this reason, [[dynamic memory allocation]] is frowned upon.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  Whenever possible, all required memory allocation is specified statically at compile time.

Another reason to avoid dynamic memory allocation is memory fragmentation.  With frequent allocation and releasing of small chunks of memory, a situation may occur where available memory is divided into several sections and the RTOS is incapable of allocating a large enough continuous block of memory, although there is enough free memory.  Secondly, speed of allocation is important. A standard memory allocation scheme scans a linked list of indeterminate length to find a suitable free memory block,&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/sp2012/lectures/08-malloc.pdf CS 241, University of Illinois]&lt;/ref&gt; which is unacceptable in an RTOS since memory allocation has to occur within a certain amount of time.

Because mechanical disks have much longer and more unpredictable response times, swapping to disk files is not used for the same reasons as RAM allocation discussed above.

The simple fixed-size-blocks algorithm works quite well for simple [[embedded system]]s because of its low overhead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">[[Image:NASA-apollo11-AS11040-5904.jpg|right|thumb|An accidental exposure from the Hasselblad lunar surface data camera showing the Réseau crosses.]] A Réseau plate is a transparent sheet of glass or plastic engraved with a grid of crosshatches called [[Fiducial marker|fiducial markers]]. It was commonly used in film cameras (before the advent of digital media) for scientific and technical photography. The plate is placed at the focal plane of the camera just in front of the film. When the frame is exposed the fiducial markers scatter incoming light, creating a permanent shadow on the negative. 

The fiducial markers on a Réseau plate are sometimes called reticles. The Latin root of fiducial means ''trust, confidence''; fiducial markers are trustworthy reference points. The Latin root of reticle means ''small meshwork bag, small net''; a grid of reticles has a net-like appearance.

==Purpose and Function==
If the film negative is properly [[Photographic printing|printed]] the fiducial markers will be evenly spaced on the positive image. Uneven spacing reveals that the image has been distorted. Identical spacing on adjacent images (i.e. from a series of aerial photos) ensures that printing magnification is consistent. Irregularities in the grid can also result from incorrect positioning of the film in the camera, physical distortion of the film media in the development process, and (if digitally scanned) the nonlinearity of the image scanner. These errors may be visually imperceptible but limit the precision of measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcovision.com/e_elco_reseau.html|title=The Réseau Measurement in ELCOVISION 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the position of the marks is very precisely known, the image can easily be corrected to account for these effects. When used for [[photogrammetry]], multiple images can be combined using the fiducial marks and knowledge of the camera geometry to enable measurement of distances between objects in the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crosshairs|url=http://www.clavius.org/photoret.html|publisher=Moon Base Clavius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use on lunar cameras==
The [[Hasselblad lunar surface data camera]] was fitted with a Réseau plate. The Réseau plate was made of glass and was fitted to the back of the camera body, extremely close to the film plane. The plate was 5.4 × 5.4&amp;nbsp;cm in the film plane, which was the useful exposure area on the 70&amp;nbsp;mm film.

The Réseau plate was engraved with a 5 × 5 grid of crosses. The intersections of the crosses were 10&amp;nbsp;mm apart and accurately calibrated to a tolerance of 0.002&amp;nbsp;mm. Except for the double-sized central cross, each of the four arms on a cross was 1&amp;nbsp;mm long and 0.02&amp;nbsp;mm wide. The crosses (also known as [[Fiducial marker|fiducial]]s) were recorded on every exposed frame and provided a means of determining [[angular distance]]s between objects in the field-of-view.

When the Hasselblad lunar surface data camera was fitted with a 60&amp;nbsp;mm lens, the images of the Réseau crosses on the film have an apparent separation of 10.3 degrees. With a 500&amp;nbsp;mm lens fitted, the apparent separation is 1.24 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Markus Mehring |author2=Phill Parker |author3=David Woods |author4=Eric Jones  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Réseau Plate|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-reseau.html|work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sex machine''', also known as a '''fucking machine''', is a mechanical device used to simulate human [[sexual intercourse]] or other [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref name="leung"&gt;Leung, Isaac (2009). The Cultural Production of Sex Machines and the Contemporary Technosexual Practices. In Grenzfurthner, J. et al., eds. ''Do androids sleep with electric sheep? Critical perspectives on sexuality and pornography in science and social fiction.''  [[RE/SEARCH]], {{ISBN|978-1-889307-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devices can be penetrative or extractive. A typical penetrative machine works by the transfer of rotational or reciprocating force from a motor to a directional motion on a shaft, which is tipped by a [[dildo]].&lt;ref name="farrell2007"&gt;Farrell, Lauralee (2007). Dream Machine. In ''The Best American Erotica 2007'', p. 2077. ff., [[Susie Bright]], ed. Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-8962-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hand-held modified [[reciprocating saw]] device is sometimes called a '''fucksaw''',&lt;ref name="clark-flory"&gt;Clark-Flory, Tracy (March 3, 2011). [http://www.salon.com/life/sex_education/?story=/mwt/feature/2011/03/03/sex_ed The "live sex show" professor speaks.] [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; a hand-held modified [[drill motor]] rotating device is sometimes called a '''drilldo''',&lt;ref name="arnott"&gt;Arnott, Stephen (2010). ''Sex: A User's Guide.'' Random House Digital, Inc., {{ISBN|978-0-440-33437-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a modified [[Jigsaw (power tool)|jigsaw]] is called a '''jillsaw'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vikaas|first1=Kashif|title=The jillsaw!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRGWYgVFdgc|website=YouTube|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extractive device works like a [[milking machine]] and can be attached to the penis, breast, or other body part.&lt;ref name="browne"&gt;Browne, Ray Broadus (1982). ''Objects of special devotion: fetishism in popular culture'', p. 49 Popular Press, {{ISBN|978-0-87972-191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and use==
[[File:SeeSawSexMachinesMuseum.jpg|thumb|History]]
The [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]] was originally invented for the treatment of [[hysteria]] in Victorian women through medical orgasm induced by [[clitoris|clitoral massage]].  These early mechanical devices were much larger and more powerful than the modern vibrators and were first used by physicians and became popular in bath houses in Europe and the US towards the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria," the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction|first = Rachel|last = Maines|authorlink = Rachel Maines|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 1999|isbn = 0-8018-6646-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More compact, electrically powered versions later briefly appeared as health aids in department store catalogs.

Modern automated erotic stimulation devices differ from vibrators because they penetrate as well as throb. These devices are sometimes used as part of [[auto-erotic]] or partnered [[bondage play]]. [[Teledildonics]] combine use of various sex machines and a [[web interface]], used remotely by a partner.&lt;ref name="blue2006"&gt;Blue, Violet (2006). ''The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Sex Toys.'' Cleis Press, {{ISBN|978-1-57344-254-1}}, chapter 6: Teledildonics toys: online sex for two&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sex machines on the market include vacuum pumps, instruments that deliver calibrated electrical shocks to the nipples and genitals, and life size inflatable male and female dolls with penetrable and vibrating orifices.

'''The Sustainable Land Use Forum (SLUF)''' is a local Ethiopian [[non-governmental organization]] established in 1995 in [[Addis Ababa]]. It is a network of like-minded organizations under the name “[[NOVIB]] Partners Forum on Sustainable Land Use in Ethiopia and Eritrea”. The organisation was established due to data received from a 1994 study exposing severe [[land degradation]] and unsustainable population dynamics in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. Partnerships with Eritrean organizations were discontinued due to the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|war]] between the two countries in 1998. 

[[NOVIB]] has been gradually expanding the scope, geographic locations and diversity of its programs in Ethiopia, paving the way for SLUF in February 2002 and renamed as Sustainable Land Use Forum. In accordance with the Charities and Societies Proclamation No. 621/2009, SLUF was re-registered as an Ethiopian Residents Charities Consortium with certificate no. 0523 on November 2009.

SLUF is a membership organization where membership is open to all organizations engaged in Sustainable Land Use and Natural Resources Management. As of 2014 it had 29 members consisting of 3 international and 26 local NGOs. One of the international NGOs is an Honorary Member.

'''''The Middle''''' is&lt;!-- Do NOT change this to "was"! Per WP:TVNOW, television series are always referred to in the present tense. They still exist even after they have been cancelled! --&gt; an American [[sitcom]] about a [[lower middle class]] family living in [[Indiana]] facing the day-to-day struggles of home life, work, and raising children. The series premiered on September 30, 2009, on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network and concluded on May 22, 2018. The series features ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' actress [[Patricia Heaton]] and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' actor [[Neil Flynn]].&lt;ref name="pilot"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1444191|title="The Middle" Pilot (2009)|work=IMDb|accessdate=2010-01-17|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqdMpXAz?url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1444191/|archivedate=January 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Middle'' was created by former ''[[Roseanne]]'' and ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' writers Eileen Heisler and DeAnn Heline of Blackie and Blondie Productions. The show is produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and Blackie and Blondie Productions. ''The Middle'' was praised by television critics and earned numerous award nominations.

A spin-off of the series centered around Eden Sher's character Sue Heck was set to launch in 2019.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/middle-spinoff-gets-title-adds-brock-ciarelli-as-series-regular-1149473|title='The Middle' Spinoff Gets Title, Adds Brock Ciarlelli as Series Regular (Exclusive)|website=Hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pilot was passed on by ABC, but is being shopped to other networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/21/the-middle-sue-heck-spinoff-canceled/|title='The Middle' spin-off focused on Sue Heck is no longer happening|website=Ew.com|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
The series features Frances "Frankie" Heck ([[Patricia Heaton]]), a [[middle class]], [[middle-age]]d, [[Midwest]]ern&lt;ref&gt;hulu summary is "Middle-aged, working class and living in the middle of the country"&lt;/ref&gt; woman and her husband Mike ([[Neil Flynn]]), who reside in the small fictional town of Orson, [[Indiana]] based on the real town of [[Jasper, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theindychannel.com/entertainment/abc-s-the-middle-loaded-with-hoosier-connections|title=ABC's 'The Middle' Loaded With Hoosier Connections|date=2012-05-09|newspaper=RTV6|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the parents of three children, Axl ([[Charlie McDermott]]), Sue ([[Eden Sher]]), and Brick ([[Atticus Shaffer]]).&lt;ref name="greenlight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-abcgreenlightsheatonsmiddle,0,1657354.story|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqcPOB6O?url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-abcgreenlightsheatonsmiddle,0,1657354.story|title=ABC Puts Patricia Heaton in 'The Middle'|accessdate=2010-01-17|archivedate=January 17, 2010|date=November 19, 2008|work=Zap2it|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is narrated by Frankie, initially an under-performing [[salesperson]] at a used-car dealership and later a [[dental assistant]]. Her stoic husband Mike manages a local [[quarry]] and serves as a stabilizing influence in the family, though Frankie complains about his lack of affection at times. The kids are quite different from one another: oldest son Axl, a popular but lazy teenager, does well in sports but not in academics; daughter Sue is an enthusiastic young teen but chronically unsuccessful and socially awkward; and youngest son Brick is an intelligent but [[introvert]]ed compulsive reader with odd behavioral traits loosely hinted to derive from [[Asperger syndrome]].

== Development and production ==
The series was originally developed in the 2006–07 development cycle for ABC and was to star [[Ricki Lake]] as Frankie.&lt;ref name="greenlight" /&gt; [[Atticus Shaffer]] was the only actor to retain his role when the show was re-developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/devwatch/middle-2006/|title=Shows A-Z – middle, the (2007 version) on abc – TheFutonCritic.com|work=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC later ordered a second, cast-contingent  pilot order tied to Patricia Heaton being cast in the leading role for the 2008-09 development cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=ABC aims to put Heaton in "The Middle"|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heaton/abc-aims-to-put-heaton-in-the-middle-idUSN2436763520080724|website=Reuters.com|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was created by Eileen Heisler and DeAnn Heline (who is from [[Muncie, Indiana]])&lt;ref name=Thomlison /&gt; and the pilot was directed by [[Julie Anne Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;The original cast can be viewed [http://thetvpage.com/2014/02/25/middle-meet-original-heck-family/ here].&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was originally set to take place in [[Jasper, Indiana]], though the setting was changed to the fictional Orson, Indiana on the advice of attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Ryan|title=Roll credits: New ABC sitcom won't use 'Jasper, Ind.' after all|url=http://archive.courierpress.com/features/roll-credits-new-abc-sitcom-wont-use-jasper-ind-after-all-ep-447490987-324702281.html/|website=Evansville Courier &amp; Press|publisher=Evansville Courier &amp; Press|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Orson is based on, and presumed to be located near Jasper. The show was filmed in Stage 31 at the [[Columbia Ranch|Warner Bros. Ranch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaffer|first1=Atticus|title=Twitter.com|url=https://twitter.com/AtticusShaffer2/status/905261527506157568|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the house's exterior on the ranch's Blondie Street. Set director Julie Fanton shops at traditionally mid-western places, such as [[Target (store)|Target]] and [[Kohl's]], so the show appears to have a realistic middle-class look.&lt;ref name=Thomlison&gt;{{cite web|url= http://decoy.tvpassport.com/q_a/q-can-you-tell-me-where-they-film-middle-hecks-house-looks-it-real-street?subid=national-00001|title=Q&amp;A|last=Thomlison|first=Adam|publisher=TV Media|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
''The Middle'' has received positive reviews from critics, citing its unique and original characters along with critics praising the show's consistent standard and its realistic portrayal of lower-middle-class families. It holds a score of 71 out of 100 on the review aggregator website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-middle|title=The Middle – Season 1 Reviews, Ratings, Credits and More|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics praise the show's good timing, writing, and acting, with Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' saying, "...This series seems to more assuredly offer a first-class version of what so many viewers say they want: a humorous, heartfelt, realistic look at middle-class, middle-America family life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bianco |first=Robert |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2010-10-06-returnees06_ST_N.htm |title=These TV series are back, but are they better than ever? |website=Usatoday.com |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The praise has been, so far, consistent, with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Ken Tucker saying that, in season two, ''The Middle'' continues to be "...a rock-solid show, the saga of a family struggling to keep their heads above the choppy economic waters..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Tucker |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20459145,00.html |title=The Middle Review &amp;#124; TV Reviews and News |website=Ew.com |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009–2010 season, ''The Middle'' ranked number six on Metacritic's "Best Reviewed New Network Show" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/best-and-worst-tv-shows-2009-2010-season |title=Best and Worst TV Shows of the 2009–2010 Season |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airing behind the quickly cancelled ''[[Hank (2009 TV series)|Hank]]'' during its first season, ratings were not initially impressive, averaging fewer than 7 million viewers. At the start of the 2010/2011 season, ABC moved the show to the beginning of its prime time block (8:00 pm EDT) and ratings increased substantially, with the show usually ranking second in its time slot to CBS's ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.

In 2016, Bob Sassone of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' published an article called "''The Middle'' Is the Best TV Show You're Not Watching" where he expresses the dissatisfaction of the series not having received nominations for several awards and not receiving the deserved attention of the critics, saying that "''The Middle'' is the finest American sitcom on TV right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bob Sassone|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a45181/the-middle-is-the-best-tv-show-youre-not-watching/|title=The Middle Is the Best TV Show You're Not Watching|website=Esquire.com|date=May 24, 2016|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ABC confirmed that the ninth season of The Middle would be the last, Devon Ivie of [[Vulture.com|Vulture]] published that "''The Middle'' Is One of TV’s Most Underrated Gems" saying that "I’ll miss the midwestern comfort of The Middle tremendously" and gave five reasons why readers should give to the show a chance to charm them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Devon Ivie|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/the-middle-abc-sitcom-appreciation.html|title=The Middle Is One of TV’s Most Underrated Gems|website=Vulture.com|date=October 3, 2017|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
On May 30, 2018, it was reported by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that a spin-off was being eyed following the cancellation of ''[[Roseanne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Otterson |first1=Joe |title=ABC Eyes ‘The Middle’ Spinoff Starring Eden Sher |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/the-middle-spinoff-eden-sher-abc-1202825482/ |website=Variety |accessdate=30 May 2018 |date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost two months later, on July 20, 2018, in an interview with [[TVLine]]'s Michael Ausiello, Sher revealed that ABC had ordered a pilot for the potential series.&lt;ref name="SueSpinoff"/&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ausiello |first1=Michael |title=Middle Spinoff Update: Eden Sher Confirms, 'We're Shooting a Pilot!' |url=https://tvline.com/2018/07/20/the-middle-spinoff-pilot-sue-video-eden-sher/ |website=TVLine |accessdate=20 July 2018 |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that the potential spin-off would be set a few years after the parent series ended, and follow Sue Heck as an adult.&lt;ref name="SueSpinoff"/&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The spin-off was officially ordered on August 13, 2018, and will follow "the twentysomething adventures of eternal optimist Sue Heck as she leaves the small town of Orson to navigate the ups and downs of a career and young adulthood in the big city of [[Chicago]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hibberd |first1=James |title=Breaking: 'The Middle' spin-off pilot about Sue Heck has been greenlit |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/13/the-middle-spin-off-sue-heck/?__twitter_impression=true |website=EW.com |accessdate=13 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 5, 2018, the pilot was being filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PatriciaHeaton/status/1048258668116889600|title=Patricia Heaton on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was originally to be titled ''Sue Sue in the City'',&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/&gt; but this decision was later reversed and the series remains untitled for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/the-middle-spinoff-chris-diamantopoulos-eden-sher-sue-heck-spinoff-1202481252/|title=‘The Middle’ Spinoff: Chris Diamantopoulos Joins As Sue’s Boss|first=Denise|last=Petski|date=11 October 2018|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 21, 2018, TV Line reported that the proposed spin-off would not be moving forward at ABC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1407">'''UsiXML''' ('''USer Interface eXtensible Markup Language''') is an [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]]-based markup language for defining [[user interface]]s on computers.

UsiXML is a specification language for user interface design. It allows the designer to describe a user interface at different levels of abstraction. In other words, you can specify a UI in terms of: functionality ([[task analysis]]), the object it manipulates, or in a more concrete way, user interface.

The UsiXML language is currently being submitted for a standardisation plan to the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]].

Another work with the same purpose is [[UIML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uiml.org/|title = UIML.org|accessdate = 2006-07-21|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719171715/http://www.uiml.org/|archive-date = 2011-07-19|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tool support ==
There are plenty of tools that can be found for UsiXML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.usixml.org/|title = UsiXML.org|accessdate = 2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They include: a translator from UsiXML specification to Flash (FlashiXML), a tool for drawing/sketching user interfaces (SketchiXML), a tool for task analysis (idealXML).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2288">'''Well services''' is a department within a [[oil company|petroleum production company]] through which matters concerning existing [[oil well|wells]] are handled.  Having a shared well services department for all (or at least multiple) assets operated by a company is seen as advantageous as it allows the pooling of talent, experience and resources for managing wells.

The term may sometimes be used to encompass the larger section of the [[oil industry|industry]] responsible for wells including the [[List of oilfield service companies|supplier companies]] as well the operating company's wells department.

==Remit==
A well is initially drilled and completed under the control of the drilling and completions department operating under the request of the asset.  Once the well is completed, control is transferred to the asset's production team, who will operate the well as appropriate for their purposes.  Should any issues of well integrity or any requirement for [[well work]] arise, the asset will refer the issue to the well services.  During interventions, control of affected well is handed over from production to the well services crew at the well site, a practical action involving transferring control lines from the production control panel to the well services control panel.

==Structure==

===Offshore/Well site===
When [[well work]] is required, it is the responsibility of the WOE to assemble the team and arrange their dispatch to the well site.  The team will consist of a well services supervisor and other operators.  The well services supervisor is a dedicated worker who is sent to oversee well services operations at well sites and take responsibility for all well services personnel.  At offshore sites, there will commonly be two, to cover both day shift and night shift.  The other operators will usually consist of personnel from [[List of oilfield service companies|supplier companies]], who are trained in the relevant field, such as [[Wireline (cabling)|wireline]], [[coiled tubing]], [[wellhead]] maintenance, etc.

'''Zero waste agriculture''' is a type of [[sustainable agriculture]] which optimizes use of the five natural kingdoms, i.e. [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] and [[algae]], to produce biodiverse-food, energy and [[nutrient]]s in a synergistic integrated cycle of profit making processes where the waste of each process becomes the feedstock for another process.

[[Image:Simple ZWA system small.png|left]]

==History==
The integration of shallow microaglal oxidisation ponds was demonstrated by Golueke &amp; Oswald in the 1960s. The widespread global implementation of these systems can be largely credited to Prof George Lai Chan (02 March 1924 Mauritius-08 October 2016 Mauritius) from ZERI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeri.org Zero Emissions Research &amp; Initiatives] ''ZERI''&lt;/ref&gt;  Zero waste agriculture is now practiced in China (ecological farming), Columbia (integrated food &amp; waste management systems) &amp; Fiji (integrated farming systems), India (integrated biogas farming), South Africa (BEAT Coop &amp; African Agroecological Biotechnology Initiative) and Mauritius. The Brazilian government has adopted integrated farming system as a major social technology for the uplifting of marginalized and subsistence farmers through coordination with TECPAR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tecpar.br/area.php?id=428 Paraná Technology Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102101617/http://www.tecpar.br/area.php?id=428 |date=January 2, 2009 }} ''TECPAR''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zero waste agriculture combines mature ecological farming practices that delivers an integrated balance of job creation, poverty relief, food security, energy security, water conservation, climate change relief, land security &amp; stewardship.

==Practice==
Zero waste agriculture is optimally practiced on small 1-5 ha sized family owned and managed farms and it complements traditional farming &amp; animal husbandry as practiced in most third world communities. Zero Waste Agriculture also preserves local indigenous systems and existing agrarian cultural values and practices.

Zero waste agriculture presents a balance of economically, socially and ecologically benefits as it:
# optimizes food production in an ecological sound manner
# reduces water consumption through and recycling and reduced evaporation
# provides energy security through the harvesting of biomethane (biogas) and the extraction of biodiesel from micro-algae all of which from as a by-products of food production
# provides climate change relief through the substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from both traditional agriculture practices and fossil fuel usage
# reduces the use of pesticides through biodiverse farming

==Oil and biodiesel from algae==
In sunny climates, a one hectare zero waste farm can produce over 1000 litres of oil in a year from the [[chlorella]] microalgae grown on biogas digester effluent in a 500m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; shallow pond. The nutritive high protein waste from the oil extraction process can be used as an animal feed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
