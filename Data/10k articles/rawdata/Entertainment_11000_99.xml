      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2785">[[Image:2-pop_1frame_of_1khz.png|480px|right|Waveform of one frame (1/30th of a second) of 1kHz sound |thumb]]
Used in [[television production]] and [[filmmaking]] [[post-production]], a '''2-pop'''  is a 1 kHz tone that is one [[film frame|frame]] long and placed 2 seconds before the start of program. It is a simple and effective method of ensuring synchronization between sound and picture in a video or film.

A 2-pop is typically placed at the end of a visual [[Film leader|countdown]]. Only the first frame of the "2" is shown, and the remainder of the 2 seconds prior to the program is black. This provides a unique point of reference where the frame-long image and frame-long sound should align, similar to the way a film [[clapperboard]] is used to generate a synchronization point.

For example, in a television or video program the first frame of action (FFOA) starts at one hour (typically [[SMPTE_time_code|timecode]] of 01:00:00:00 in the US, and 10:00:00:00 in the UK), preceding that, 1 frame (or the 2-pop) of tone would be placed at timecode 00:59:58:00 or exactly 2 seconds before first picture. Alternately, in film post-production the leader starts at 01:00:00:00 (or 0+00 feet if using feet and frames as is common in the United States), the 2-pop starts at 01:00:06:00 (or 9+00), and the first frame of action (FFOA) starts at 01:00:08:00 (or 12+00). 

A 2-pop is useful whenever picture and sound are handled separately. For example, projecting work-in-progress in the pre-video days involved a film projector linked to a magnetic [[Reel-to-reel_audio_tape_recording|dubber]], onto which the separate soundtrack reel was loaded. Aligning them by the 2-pop would ensure proper synchronization during playback. A modern scenario would involve sending a soundtrack to a separate facility for a sound mix. The returned product is a computer audio file which then needs to be synchronized again with the picture.

== Sample sound ==
{{Listen|filename=2-pop_1frame_of_1khz.ogg|title=1 frame of 1 khz audio|description=2-pop's sound frequency and duration|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Whereas laying down [[bars and tone]] prior to program start establishes video and audio [[calibration]] levels on the tape, the 2-pop is primarily used for picture and sound [[synchronization]].  Therefore, while the [[loudness]] of the 2-pop may be the same as the [[bars and tone]] audio level in use, this is not a requirement. The loudness level should be sufficient to be heard clearly.

'''Ajoka Theatre''' ([[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|اجوکا ناٹک}}, literal translation of ''Ajoka'': "today/present") is a [[Pakistan]]i [[not-for-profit arts organization]] based in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], with focus on producing and performing social theatrical stage productions, founded in 1984.&lt;ref name="DSB"&gt;Singh Bajeli, Diwan (2 February 2007) [http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/02/02/stories/2007020201230300.htm ''A voice for peace and amity''], The Hindu&lt;/ref&gt; The group was formed by director, actress and playwright, [[Madeeha Gauhar]] at peak of the tensions during the state of emergency under the regime of General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]].&lt;ref name="DSB" /&gt; Ajoka Theatre received the prestigious [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]]&lt;ref&gt;(16 December 2003) [http://www.dawn.com/news/223580/madeeha-gauhar-gets-dutch-award ''Madeeha Gauhar gets Dutch awards''], Dawn News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Claus Awards, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/programmes/awards award winners of 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006 and the [[Theatre Pasta Theatre Awards|International Theatre Pasta Award]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Theatre Pasta (16 July 2008) [http://theatrepasta.com/?p=81 interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219114602/http://theatrepasta.com/?p=81 |date=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the group have staged many popular society critical pieces in theatres, on the streets and in public spaces, as well as in productions for television and on video. Ajoka Theatre has not only performed in Pakistan, but has also in the [[South Asia]]n region, in countries like [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], as well as in [[Europe]] and [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name="PCA"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/241 profile]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group focuses on promotion of a [[justice|just]], [[Humanism|humane]], [[Secularity|secular]] and [[Egalitarianism|equal]] society, alongside the subject of [[women's rights]] in a society that is greatly dominated by men.&lt;ref name="DSB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

The groups first ever theatrical performance was ''Jaloos (Procession)'' written by veteran Indian playwright [[Badal Sarkar]].&lt;ref name="DSB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Sher (14 May 2014) [http://tribune.com.pk/story/708368/30-years-of-ajoka/ ''30 years of Ajoka''], The Express Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; The style of Ajoka's performances can be characterised as an elaboration on the [[oral tradition]] of [[Bhand]] and [[Nautanki]] that found a flourishing base in the area that currently overlaps the province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. In spite of the Western education of Gauhar, she does not limit herself to classical Western theatre techniques. Instead, she mixes authentic Pakistani elements, combining it with contemporary sentiments.&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

==History==
Gauhar was born in 1956 in [[Karachi]]. After she obtained a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[English literature]], she moved to [[England]] where she obtained another master's degree, in [[theatre]] sciences at the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="DSB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FR"&gt;Rashed, Fariha (16 October 2005) [https://archive.is/20130408022347/http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/images/archive/051016/images1.htm ''The Ajoka awakening'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, after returning to [[Lahore]], Gauhar and her husband [[Shahid Nadeem]] founded Ajoka Theatre, the first theatre group of significance there. 
 
In 2007, Ajoka performed a piece that was written and directed by Gauhar, called ''[[Burqavaganza]]'' (''[[Burqa]]-vaganza''), which led to great controversy. Actors dressed in burkas put themes on the stage like sexual discrimination, intolerance and fanaticism. From a Western perspective, the piece was a rather innocent performance on hypocrisy of a society that bathes in corruption. In her own country though, Members of Parliament called for a ban of it, and the Minister of Culture threatened with sanctions when it would be staged any longer. In spite of the ban, [[non-governmental organisation]]s and [[women's rights]] activists had the theatre piece translated into English and staged performances internationally as an sign of support to Ajoka.&lt;ref&gt;Rehman, Sonya (20 June 2008) [http://sonyarehman.wordpress.com/2008/06/20/viva-ajoka/ ''Viva Ajoka!''], Sonya Rehman's Archive ~ Of Most Things Pakistani&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borah, Prabalika M.

'''''Antichamber''''' is a [[puzzle-platform game]] created by Australian developer Alexander "Demruth" Bruce. Many of the puzzles are based on phenomena that occur within [[impossible object]]s created by the game engine, such as passages that lead the player to different locations depending on which way they face, and [[Multistable perception|structures that seem otherwise impossible within normal three-dimensional space]]. The game includes elements of psychological exploration through brief messages of advice to help the player figure out solutions to the puzzles as well as adages for real life. The game was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] on January 31, 2013,&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt; a version sold with the [[Humble Bundle|Humble Indie Bundle 11]] in February 2014 added support for [[Linux]] and [[OS X]].

In ''Antichamber'', the player controls the unnamed protagonist from a [[first person (video games)|first-person perspective]]&lt;ref name="Kotaku"/&gt;  as they wander through levels.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"&gt;{{cite web |author=JC Fletcher |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/07/06/indie-game-hazard-the-journey-of-life-is-now-antichamber/ |title=Indie game 'Hazard: The Journey of Life' is now Antichamber |publisher=Joystiq |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding typical notions of [[Euclidean space]], Bruce has stated that "breaking down all those expectations and then remaking them is essentially the core mechanic of the game".&lt;ref name="Kotaku"/&gt;

The player starts in an [[antechamber]] that contains four walls. One is a [[Diegesis|diegetic]] menu to set the various game options as well as a countdown timer starting at ninety minutes. A second wall provides a map of the game's space that will fill in as the player visits specific rooms, highlighting passages the player has yet to explore, and allows the player, upon return to this room, to jump to any room they've visited before. A third wall shows a series of cartoonish iconographs and obfuscated hint text that are added as the player finds these on walls of the puzzle space. The fourth wall is a window, showing the ultimate goal, the exit from the space, which the player must figure out how to get to.

Puzzle elements in various chambers involve maneuvering themselves around the spaces, where level elements can change after passing certain points, or even based on which direction the player is facing when traversing the level. Laser beams are used as mechanisms to control various doors; these may either require the beams to be blocked or unblocked, and many doors require multiple beams to be in their proper state to open. Initially, the player can trigger these themselves. Later, the player gains access to a series of colored "guns", each which helps the player access more of the space. Initially, the gun can pick up any number of small cubes, storing them, and then place them on surfaces; these can be used to block the aforementioned laser beams, or used as platforms for the player to get over obstacles. Other guns can be used to "grow" new blocks by placing blocks out in specific patterns, to direct a connected series of blocks towards an objective point, and to mass create and fill an area with blocks; later guns retain the abilities of the earlier ones. Certain areas in the space are dead zones that remove any blocks stored in the gun or prevent blocks from moving through them. After most puzzles are signs with the forementioned iconographs which can be activated to give a hint about the just-completed puzzle. At any point, the player can jump back to the first room, and use the map to navigate to other areas; this resets any progress made on specific puzzles though the player retains the guns they have obtained.

Upon completing a core set of puzzles, the player can then access the exit door, upon which they start to chase down a black cloudlike shape, using all the solving techniques they have learned before. Eventually they are able to capture the cloud as a black cube within their gun, and enter a final, more expansive area, where they return the shape to a waiting shell. The shell creates a structure around it – similar to the game's logo – and then sucks everything around it into its center, sending the screen to black and ending the game.

==Development==
''Antichamber'' started as early as 2006 as Bruce's idea for an arena combat game based on expanding the mechanics of the game ''[[Snake (video game)|Snake]]'' into a multiplayer experience. Full development of the game, initially called ''Hazard'', did not start until 2009 and continued into 2010.&lt;ref name="gsw interview"/&gt; Bruce developed the game using [[UnrealScript]] with the [[Unreal Engine]] 3.&lt;ref name="gsw interview"/&gt; As Bruce iterated through its design, he dropped the combat portion and chose to focus more on a single-player puzzle game along with the psychology of the puzzles, eventually adding the subtitle "The Journey of Life" in 2009.&lt;ref name=Joystiq/&gt;&lt;ref name="gsw interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/02/road_to_the_igf_alexander_bruc.php |title=Road To The IGF: Alexander Bruce's Hazard: The Journey Of Life |first=Simon |last=Carless |publisher=[[Game Set Watch]] |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/01/antichamber-how-a-game-of-impossible-spaces-came-together/ |title=Antichamber: How a game of impossible spaces came together |author=Jessica Conditt |publisher=[[Engadget]] |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this change came about how he was able to create Impossible Object spaces within the Unreal Engine, which came about as a result of a "rookie error" in coding.&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{cite web |title=How do you run and jump in warped space? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/03/how-do-you-run-and-jump-in-warped-space.html |publisher=CultureLab |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce recognized that there was a single-player game behind creating spaces and puzzles where the player would have to work out how the rules work, and expanded the game in that direction.&lt;ref name="gsw interview"/&gt; Bruce said in a 2011 interview with Kotaku that "the game started off as being all about geometry...I needed to find a way to represent that [non-physical geometry] to players...so I needed to work out why we would need this non-physical geometry in the world and it took me a couple years but after combining geometry and space and perception, I realized that the real reason that this game is interesting and is working is because it's about psychology."&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5835439/8-12-minutes-of-antichamber-my-favorite-game-of-pax-2011-its-first+person-escher |title=8 1/2 Minutes of Antichamber My Favorite Game of PAX 2011. It's 'First-Person Escher.' |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- this and the quote above were both said in the video at this link --&gt; As he worked out puzzles, he found that injecting philosophical ideas helped to lead to puzzle designs or otherwise augment established puzzles, and made that part of ''Antichamber'''s approach.&lt;ref name="gsw interview"/&gt; The game's simple art style was partially to distinguish the game from other Unreal Engine games, while also to aid in masking the work behind the inverse lighting system used in the game.&lt;ref name="gsw interview"/&gt;

On April 2, 2012, ''Antichamber'' became the seventh game to receive funding from the [[Indie Fund]] with Bruce citing the award as "finishing funds" to ensure the game can be released in 2012, and was ultimately released in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indie-fund.com/2012/04/indie-fund-now-backing-antichamber/ |title=Indie Fund Now Backing Antichamber « Indie Fund |publisher=Indie-fund.com |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/04/09/antichamber-and-indie-fund-a-match-made-in-m-c-eschers-baseme/ |title=Antichamber and Indie Fund: A match made in M.C.

===Music===
The soundtrack for Antichamber consists of [[ambient music]] composed by Siddhartha Barnhoorn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sidbarnhoorn.com/ |title=Siddhartha Barnhoorn &amp;#124; Composer for Film &amp;#124; Sound Designer |publisher=Sidbarnhoorn.com |date= |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music evolves over the course of the game, starting with nothing more than one ambient layer in the first level and gradually progressing into a complex soundscape. In an interview with IndieGames.com, Barnhoorn revealed that the soundtrack comprises sounds from various guitars, the [[shakuhachi]], the [[Koto (instrument)|koto]], and [[Pad (music)#Synth pad|synth pads]]. In addition, Barnhoorn stated that the non-synth sounds are digitally manipulated "here and there in order to make the sounds a bit longer than they would appear naturally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://indiegames.com/2012/02/siddhartha_barnhoorn_antichamber.html |title=The Weblog Siddhartha Barnhoorn Q&amp;A: Antichamber Suite |publisher=IndieGames.com |date=February 27, 2012 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Antichamber Suite'', a track consisting of music from the game, was released via Bandcamp on February 13, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=/ |url=http://siddharthabarnhoorn.bandcamp.com/track/antichamber-suite |title=Antichamber Suite &amp;#124; Siddhartha Barnhoorn |publisher=Siddharthabarnhoorn.bandcamp.com |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was also featured in the Nubuwo Debut Bundle released March 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jeriaska/nubuwo-debut-bundle-adventures-in-videogame-audio |title=Nubuwo Debut Bundle: adventures in videogame audio by Jeriaska ジェリアスカ — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full soundtrack was released on February 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siddharthabarnhoorn.bandcamp.com/album/antichamber |title=Antichamber; Siddhartha Barnhoorn |publisher=Siddharthabarnhoorn.bandcamp.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most reviewers praised the level design and puzzles in the game. ''[[Game Informer]]'' wrote that "I rarely ever felt stuck or frustrated by a lack of progress – a testament to Antichamber's pacing and design",&lt;ref name = "GI"/&gt; and [[GameTrailers]] said "The true star of Antichamber is its level design."&lt;ref name = "GT"/&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' described the game as hosting "moments of transcendent beauty and vignettes that engage your brain on a level few games attempt"&lt;ref name = "PCGUS"/&gt; and [[IGN]] called the puzzles "expertly crafted and wonderfully inventive challenges."&lt;ref name = "IGN"/&gt;

'''Apala''' (or Akpala) is a [[musical genre]], originally derived from the [[Yoruba people]] of [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |title=Africa, Europe and the Middle East
 |publisher=Rough Guides
 |year=1999
 |ISBN=1-85828-635-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a [[percussion instrument|percussion]]-based style that developed in the late 1930s, when it was used to wake worshippers after fasting during the [[Islam]]ic holy month of [[Ramadan]]. The rhythms of apala grew more complex over time, influenced by [[music of Cuba|Cuban music]] and eventually became quite popular in Kannada. It has grown less religious centered over time.

Instruments include a rattle ([[sekere]]), thumb piano ([[agidigbo]]) and a [[bell (instrument)|bell]] ([[agogô]]), as well as two or three [[talking drum]]s.

[[Haruna Ishola]] is undoubtedly the best-known performer of apala in Nigerian history. Others may hold a contrary view that [[Ayinla Omowura]] is better known, and the most successful musician of Apala. Both of them played an integral role in the popularization of the genre, and it is distinct from, older than, and much more difficult to master than [[fuji music]]. Although Ayninla Omowura died in his forties in 1980, he recorded more than 20 LPs and remarkably, all are very successful.

Although Fuji music remains the most important form of traditional music amongst Yorubas in Nigeria, apala is still very popular amongst Muslims of the Yoruba tribe. Special mention must be given to Haruna Ishola's son, Musiliu Haruna Ishola, who is often credited with revitalizing the apala genre and spearheading the apala-resurgence of the 2000s.

With his 2000 album (entitled Soyoyo), Musiliu has succeeded in bringing apala music to a wider, younger audience, thus breathing new life to the genre and keeping the tradition (and his father's legacy) alive. He is credited with re-popularizing a genre that was fast becoming the preserve of older Muslims of the Yoruba tribe. The success of his Soyoyo album meant that a younger (often Christian or Animist) generation of Yorubas have now demonstrated a renewed interest in apala music. His songs can often be heard on popular radio stations across Yorubaland.

'''Beyond the Tesseract''' is a [[text based adventure game]] developed in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]] by David Lo for the [[TRS-80]]. The game was notable for its unique take on the genre and approach to mathematical entities and abstract concepts.&lt;ref name="moby games"/&gt;
In one section the player must navigate a text adventure game, inside the text adventure game. In another the player, while asleep, derives a proof using physical representations of various symbolic logic components.&lt;ref name="moby games"/&gt;

The game is intentionally [[vague]] using a [[Verb|VERB]] [[Noun|NOUN]] gameplay mechanic with a [[vocabulary]] of just 200.&lt;ref name="Dave Lo"/&gt;

In 1988 the game was ported to [[Atari ST]], [[MS-DOS]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] environments and, in 2003, to interactive fiction standard of machine-independent [[Z-machine|Z-code]].

== Original Release Notes &lt;ref name="Dave Lo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lo|first=Dave|title=Dave Lo's Hobbies|url=http://www.davelo.net/play.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

'''Scenario:'''
You have reached the final part of your mission.  You have
gained access to the complex, and all but the last procedure has
been performed.  Now comes a time of waiting, in which you must
search for the hidden 12-word message that will aid you at the
final step. But what choice will you make when that time comes?

The scenario for the adventure is meant to be vague.  Once the
adventure has been completed, the scenario will hopefully become
clear.

'''Instructions:'''
This adventure recognizes the standard commands for moving
(N,E,S,W), taking inventory (I), maninpulating objects (GET,
DROP, LOOK), and saving games (SAVE, LOAD), as well as many
others.  Use 2-word 'verb noun' commands, such as 'use stack' or
'get all'.  Only the first four letters of each word are
significant.  The adventure recognizes about 200 words, so if
one word doesn't work, try another.

'''Notes:'''
The "stack" is an acroynym for Space Time Activated Continuum
Key. You will find this object very useful.  Try the command
"use stack".

This adventure is abstract and a bit on the technical side.
Basic knowledge of the names of interesting mathematical objects
would be a definite asset in solving the puzzles.  However,
detailed knowledge of the technical background is not necessary,
although it will make the adventure more enjoyable and reduce
the amount of comments of the form "Was that supposed to be funny
or what?  I don't get it."

There is no carry limit, no death traps, and over 200 words in
the program's vocabulary, so you can hopefully concentrate on
solving the adventure instead of solving the program.  The map
of the adventure can be draw on a grid.  All it takes is a
little experimenting to put all the subsets of locations
together "logically".

'''History:'''
The idea of a mathematically abstract adventure came about
during the summer of 1983, when I was reading the book "Godel,
Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid".  I had just read an
article on writing adventures, and I thought about doing my own
article on adventure writing.  I did start on the article, and
one of the examples of how varied puzzles can be is a
mathematical adventure where the player has to "use a
probability function to cross a field of improbability to get to
a vortex."  Sadly the article was never finished, although
remnants of it can be found in the ADV.DOC file. I started
thinking more and more about a mathematically abstract
adventure, and Tesseract was born!

The very first adventure that I wrote was in 1982, titled "Hall
of the Mountain King" (find the Crystal of Light).  Tesseract
Version 1.0 was the second of the three TRS-80 BASIC adventures
that I wrote in a two-month adventure-frenzy during the summer
of 1983.  The first was "Project Triad" (defuse the bomb on the
space station), and the third was "Codename Intrepid" (deliver a
package to another agent).

== Original Annotated Solution &lt;ref name="Dave Lo"/&gt; ==

(spoiler alert)

Tesseract was meant to be a sequel to Project Triad, but when it was
finished I found that it had no solid relation to Triad.  The program
started from an example I used when I tried to write an article on how
to write an adventure. The example, as far as I could remember it, was
"using a definitive function to get by a field of improbability."
 
The word play in Tesseract is the acrostic.  The first letter of the
important words in the hidden message form the word "tesseract."  Since
the message also contains the word "tesseract", the message can be
thought of as self-containing.  The "hint" to an acrostic is the stack
(Space-Time Activated Continuum Key).  The 12-word message is:

  "The Eternal Soul
  Seeks the Exact
  Reasons and Answers
  of Countless Tesseracts"

The message is divided into 4 lines, with each line being presented at
the end of its puzzle.

1. Book World
-------------
  put disk in projector
  kick projector
  push 4
  read tombstone (1)

The fractals worlds used to be vegetables beings (nursery/peach baby,
"Gather No Moss" Concert/asparagus youth, hyper-lab/potato assistant,
lettuce scientist) performing tasks that the player needs use in
solving the puzzles.  There was some humour/logic to the selection of
the vegetables and beings, but the reason is so obtuse it makes the
Far Side look logical.

    - Peach is like a baby, pink and fuzzy.  The baby was spinning a
      one-sided toy.

    - Asparagus is an aphrodisiac, and youths are hormone-filled.  The
      youth was wearing an audio apparatus.

    - Lettuce is a head, hence an egghead/brainy scientist.  The
      scientist did nothing.

    - Potato is also called spud, and Spud seems to be a good
      low-ranking name.  The assistant was Y'ing polyhedrons.

I was going to have dust on the mountain, then melt the snowflake to
grow a fractal plant, which is the prequel to the plant-being in the
mirror world.

2. Prism
--------
  break prism
  read tetrahedron at spectrum (2)

3. Dream World
--------------
  prove supposition with postulates to get lemma
  prove hypothesis with axiom (and lemma) to get theorem
  give theorem to math (or wake math with theorem on ground)
  at words of fire (4)

This provides a foreshadowing of the ending.

4. Plant Being
--------------
  roll dice 3 times and add numbers
  y dice to get 4-D solid

  y strip to get bottle
  melt solid at plasma to get 4-D liquid
  fill bottle with liquid
  water alien
  (or cool coil, spin coil at monopoles, get plasma, then either melt
  solid at plant, or melt solid anywhere and fill bottle etc.)

  get function
  get improbability (use sum of numbers, or .# of voices in fugue)
  use improbability at certainty
  solve integral with function
  insert singularity in earphones
  wear earphones
  listen to plant (8)

The TRS-80 version didn't use _Y_, which was my internal notation.
The _'s were replaced with random consonants (e.g. byk, tyv, etc.) at
run-time.

The function and integral is analogous to a weapon v.s. monster puzzle
(the sword has many sharp points, and the monster is vicious.)  During
the translation, I thought of using a glider gun and a dragon curve,
but somehow that was replaced by the function and integral.
Originally there was no integral or function.  Instead, there was a
one-sided polygon that you spin to get a mono-filter.

'''Cherry Capri''' (born 1969) is a quirky red-haired American pop-culture icon, author and performance artist whose work explores and celebrates [[Mid Century Modern]] style, healthy homemaking and manners. The image she portrays is similar to an eccentric [[Auntie Mame]] mixed with [[Mary Poppins]]. She has been called "a mix between [[Martha Stewart]] and [[Pee Wee Herman]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prx.org/pieces/173008/transcripts/371974&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been called "America's Mistress of Modernism, Manners &amp; Mirth."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prx.org/series/34242-dear-cherry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Performance career===
[[File:Cherry Capri, Queen of the 2004 Pasadena Doo Dah Parade.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Cherry Capri, Queen of the 2004 Pasadena [[Doo Dah Parade]]]]

As a performer, Capri has headlined three [[Mondo Lounge]] weekenders &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mondolounge.com/history/the-first/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mondolounge.com/history/mondo-atomic/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mondolounge.com/history/mondo-lounge-iii/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mondo Tiki event at the Las Vegas [[Hard Rock Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1UTRBte5WQ&lt;/ref&gt; She has sung at [[Tiki Oasis]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tikioasis.com/event-history/&lt;/ref&gt; and tiki clubs across the country. 
In 2005, she was a featured performer in the cult classic movie by [[Tony Marsico]], ''[[Camp Burlesque]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0850263/&lt;/ref&gt; Capri has made appearances on television talk shows including the ''[[Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jay Leno]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtf6G05oRQA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 she was featured on the full-length album ''[[Creamy Cocktails &amp; Other Delights]]'' with a cover that paid a fun homage to the classic album cover ''[[Whipped Cream and Other Delights]]'' by [[Herb Alpert]]. Her title song from this album was included as the main anthem in the [[same-sex marriage]] rights movie, ''[[I Want to Get Married]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1779814/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, she was approached to star in a MidMod home-improvement lifestyle show called ''[[Lotta Living]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midmodsquad.com/projects/lotta-living/&lt;/ref&gt; based on the website of the same name. The series ultimately failed to progress past development stages.

In 2016 she was considered for a children's television show reprising a [[Fred Rogers]]-style lead in an updated version of ''[[Mr. Roger's Neighborhood]]''.

Over the years, Capri has supported various charitable organizations through performances and appearances, including the [[Los Angeles Conservancy]] Modern Committee, Palm Springs Modern Committee and Lightbringer Project. In 2004, she was crowned the queen of the [[Pasadena Doo Dah Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/be-queen-for-a-zippity-doo-dah-day/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidesocal.com/doodah/2011/01/11/light-bringer-project-shares-d/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11013219.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine art career===
[[File:Sculpture by Cherry Capri in front of SHAG store in Palm Springs, CA.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sculpture by Cherry Capri in front of SHAG store in Palm Springs, CA, posing with artist Josh Agle]]

Capri is also a sculptor and painter, and has exhibited in Hollywood, Las Vegas, Palm Springs and San Francisco in group shows and alongside [[Shag (artist)|Shag]], [[Mark Ryden]], [[Tim Biskup]] and other luminaries of the Southern California [[Pop Surrealist]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;http://mmoderngallery.blogspot.com/2006/01/shag-josh-agle-book-signing-blonde.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaltravelerblog.com/2006/01/art-gallery-show-at-m-modern-gallery_15.html&lt;/ref&gt; Capri's artwork brings an appreciation for matchbook artwork, like [[Andy Warhol]] provided recognition for packaging (soup cans) in the 1960s. Her work also specifically serves to excite viewers about the preservation of Mid-Century Modern architecture and signage. Her work was featured in the first seminal ''[[Tiki Art Now]] - Volume One'' book by [[Otto von Stroheim]],&lt;ref name=Stroheim83&gt;Otto Von Stroheim, ''Tiki Art Now!: A Volcanic Eruption of Art'', Last Gasp, 2004, p83. {{ISBN|0-86719-627-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen in the background of the movie ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]''.

She had a one-woman show, "Come for Sun Swim Fun", at [[M Modern Gallery]], featuring the work of classic Palm Springs establishments such as the [[Caliente Tropics]] motel and the now demolished [[Palm Springs Spa Hotel]]. Her one-woman show "Sparkles in Quick Sand" in Studio City featured works inspired by-gone iconic Las Vegas hotels such as the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes Hotel and Casino]] and the [[Sands Hotel]].

Her artwork is in the collections of casino magnate [[Steve Wynn]], as well as the late greats, [[Merv Griffin]] and [[Huell Howser]]. Her sculpture was featured at the [[SHAG Store]] for the 2012 [[Palm Springs Modernism Weekend]].

===Author and "Dear Cherry" advice column===
In 2015, Capri released he first retro [[raw food]] recipe book, ''[[Eat Like Eve]] – Irresistible Recipes for Nude Food''. Like the ''Creamy Cocktails'' CD, Capri provided a provocative cover. The interior pages were inspired by the vintage [[Culinary Arts Academy]] cookbooks from the 1950s, and include a few recipes from her "Dear Cherry" advice column.

Capri is best known for her critically acclaimed "Dear Cherry" retro [[Dear Abby]]-style advice columns, which have appeared in ''[[CA-Modern]] Magazine'' since 2005, in addition to columns in ''[[Tiki Magazine]]'' and ''[[Bachelor Pad Magazine]]''. Her writing combines the best of historic references with updated healthy living tips and advice for today's technology-minded world.

Her recent ''[[Dear Cherry]]'' interstitial radio show for [[Public Radio Exchange]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prx.org/series/34242-dear-cherry&lt;/ref&gt; loosely based on her print columns and co-produced by [[Mary-Margaret Stratton]], [[Cary Stratton]] and [[Jason Croft]] aka 'Java', has been picked up as far away as Australia.&lt;ref&gt;https://cocktailnation.net/?s=cherry+capri&lt;/ref&gt;

===Image and lifestyle===
Capri is noted for her outrageous recycled wardrobe, an eccentric style of dress which generally utilizes bright colors and loud patterns and pink polyester pantsuits.

She has been a champion for family values, showing that challenging outdated concepts of morality and modes of conduct and healthy happy living are not mutually exclusive.

The '''cinema of China''' is one of three distinct historical threads of [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] cinema together with the [[cinema of Hong Kong]] and the [[cinema of Taiwan]].

Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on [[Shanghai]] in the first decades. The first [[sound film]], ''Sing-Song Girl Red Peony'', using the [[sound-on-disc]] technology, was made in 1931. The 1930s, considered the first "golden period" of Chinese cinema, saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement and the dispute between [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] was reflected in the films produced. After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] and the occupation of Shanghai, the industry in the city was severely curtailed, with filmmakers moving to [[Hong Kong]], [[Chongqing]] and other places, starting a "Solitary Island" period in Shanghai, referring to the city's foreign concessions, with the remaining filmmakers working there. ''[[Princess Iron Fan (1941 film)|Princess Iron Fan]]'' (1941), the first [[Chinese animation|Chinese animated]] feature film, was released at the end of this period. It influenced wartime Japanese animation and later [[Osamu Tezuka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "A Wartime Romance: Princess Iron Fan and the Chinese Connection in Early Japanese Animation," in On the Move: The Trans/national Animated Film in 1940s-1970s China.|last = Du|first = Daisy Yan|publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison.|year = May 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 15–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being completely engulfed by the occupation in 1941, and until the end of the war in 1945, the film industry in the city was under Japanese control.

After the end of the war, a second golden age took place, with production in Shanghai resuming, with films such as ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948), named the [[Hong Kong Film Awards#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|best Chinese-language film]] at the [[24th Hong Kong Film Awards]]. After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]] in 1949, previous and some foreign films were banned in 1951, and movie attendance increased sharply. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the film industry was severely restricted, coming almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972. The industry flourished following the end of the Cultural Revolution, including the "scar dramas" of the 1980s, such as ''[[Evening Rain]]'' (1980), ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' (1980) and ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), depicting the emotional traumas left by the period. Starting in the mid to late 1980s, with films such as ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984), the rise of the [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation]] brought increased popularity to Chinese cinema abroad, especially among Western arthouse audiences, with films like ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'' (1987), ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'' (1992) and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) winning major international awards. The movement partially ended after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The post-1990 period saw the rise of the Sixth Generation and post-Sixth Generation, both mostly making films outside the main Chinese film system and played mostly on the international film festival circuit.

Following the international commercial success of films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema has increased and there has been a movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. After ''[[The Dream Factory (film)|The Dream Factory]]'' (1997) demonstrated the viability of the commercial model, and with the growth of the Chinese box office in the new millennium, Chinese films have broken box office records and, as of January 2017, 5 of the top 10 [[List of highest-grossing films in China|highest-grossing films in China]] are domestic productions. ''[[Lost in Thailand]]'' (2012) was the first Chinese film to reach {{CNY|1 billion}} at the Chinese box office, ''[[Monster Hunt]]'' (2015) was the first to reach {{CNY|2 billion}}, ''[[The Mermaid (2016 film)|The Mermaid]]'' (2016) was the first to {{CNY|3 billion}} and ''[[Wolf Warriors 2|Wolf Warrior 2]]'' (2017) is currently the highest-grossing film in China.

In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2016, the gross box office in China was {{CNY|45.71 billion}} ({{USD|6.58 billion}}).

==Beginnings==

[[Motion pictures]] were introduced to China in 1896. The first recorded screening of a motion picture in China occurred in [[Shanghai]] on August 11, 1896, as an "act" on a variety bill.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Chris. "China Before 1949", in ''The Oxford History of World Cinema'', edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Chinese film, a recording of the [[Peking opera]], ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in November 1905 in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name=Geiselmann&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.univie.ac.at/Sinologie/repository/ueLK110_ChinFilmgesch/filmgeschichteSkript.pdf
|title = Chinese Film History - A Short Introduction | accessdate = 2007-07-25 |year=2006 | author = Martin Geiselmann|publisher = The University of Vienna- Sinologie Program|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving [[entrepot]] and the largest city in the [[Far East]].  In 1913, the first independent Chinese screenplay, ''[[The Difficult Couple]]'', was filmed in Shanghai by [[Zheng Zhengqiu]] and [[Zhang Shichuan]].&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nydlzbe2LhEC&amp;pg=PA1945 |title=East Asian Cinema |author= David Carter |publisher=Kamera Books |year= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhang Shichuan then set up the first Chinese-owned film production company in 1916. The first truly successful home-grown feature film was ''Yan Ruisheng'' ([[:zh:閻瑞生|閻瑞生]]) released in 1921. During the 1920s film technicians from the United States trained Chinese technicians in Shanghai, and American influence continued to be felt there for the next two decades.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

It was during this period that some of the more important production companies first came into being, notably [[Mingxing Film Company|Mingxing]] ("Star") and the Shaw brothers' [[Tianyi Film Company|Tianyi]] ("Unique"). Mingxing, founded by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan in 1922, initially focused on comic shorts, including the oldest surviving complete Chinese film, ''[[Laborer's Love]]'' (1922).&lt;ref name=Centennial&gt;{{cite web| url = http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html| title = A Centennial Review of Chinese Cinema| accessdate = 2007-04-26| author = Zhang Yingjin| date = 2003-10-10| publisher = University of California-San Diego| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907160026/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html| archivedate = 2008-09-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/denton2/courses/c505/temp/history/chapter2.html | title = A Brief History of Chinese Film | accessdate = 2007-04-24 | publisher = Ohio State University | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140410062249/http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/denton2/courses/c505/temp/history/chapter2.html | archivedate = 2014-04-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Chris. "China Before 1949", in ''The Oxford History of World Cinema'', edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 409–410.&lt;/ref&gt; This soon shifted, however, to feature-length films and family dramas including ''[[An Orphan Rescues his Grandfather|Orphan Rescues Grandfather]]'' (1923).&lt;ref name=Centennial/&gt; Meanwhile, Tianyi shifted their model towards folklore dramas, and also pushed into foreign markets; their film ''[[Legend of the White Snake (film)|White Snake]]'' (1926){{efn|Bai She Zhuan (1926) 白蛇传 : ''Legend of the White Snake''&lt;ref name="White-Snake:Mirror"&gt;{{cite web|title=《Legend of the White Snake》(1926)|url=http://www.chinesemirror.com/index/2012/03/legend-of-the-white-snake-1926.html|publisher=The Chinese Mirror|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptation of ''[[Legend of the White Snake]]''}} proved a typical example of their success in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=Centennial/&gt; In 1931, the first Chinese [[sound film]] ''Sing-Song Girl Red Peony'' was made, the product of a cooperation between the Mingxing Film Company's image production and [[Pathé Frères]]'s sound technology. However, the sound was [[Sound-on-disc|disc-recorded]], and the first [[sound-on-film]] [[talkie]] made in China was either ''Spring on Stage'' (歌場春色) by Tianyi, or ''Clear Sky After Storm'' by Great China Studio and Jinan Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDRxR-wb-fsC&amp;pg=PT262 |title=A Companion to Chinese Cinema |author= Yingjin Zhang |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 24 - Chinese Cinema and Technology |year=2012 |isbn=978-1444330298 |page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leftist movement===
[[File:LoveandDuty.jpg|left|thumb|20-year-old [[Ruan Lingyu]], a superstar during the silent film era, in ''[[Love and Duty (1931 film)|Love and Duty]]'' (1931).]]
However, the first truly important Chinese films were produced beginning in the 1930s, with the advent of the "progressive" or "left-wing" movement, like [[Cheng Bugao]]'s ''[[Spring Silkworms (film)|Spring Silkworms]]'' (1933), [[Wu Yonggang]]'s ''[[The Goddess (1934 film)|The Goddess]]'' (1934), and [[Sun Yu (director)|Sun Yu]]'s ''[[The Big Road]]'' (1935). These films were noted for their emphasis on class struggle and external threats (i.e. Japanese aggression), as well as on their focus on common people, such as a family of silk farmers in ''Spring Silkworms'' and a prostitute in ''The Goddess''.&lt;ref name=Geiselmann/&gt; In part due to the success of these kinds of films, this post-1930 era is now often referred to as the first "golden period" of Chinese cinema.&lt;ref name=Geiselmann/&gt; The Leftist cinematic movement often revolved around the Western-influenced Shanghai, where filmmakers portrayed the struggling lower class of an overpopulated city.&lt;ref&gt;Laikwan Pang, ''Building a New China in Cinema'' (Rowman and Littlefield Productions, Oxford, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[production company|production companies]] dominated the market in the early to mid- 1930s: the newly formed [[Lianhua Film Company|Lianhua]] ("United China"),{{efn|Lianhua is also sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the "United Photoplay Service"}} the older and larger Mingxing and Tianyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/international/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100802065514/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614559 | archivedate = 2010-08-02 | title = Timeline | accessdate = 2006-05-08 | author = Kraicer, Shelly |date= 2005-12-06| work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Mingxing and Lianhua leaned left (Lianhua's management perhaps more so),&lt;ref name=Geiselmann/&gt; while Tianyi continued to make less socially conscious fare.

[[File:Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm.ogv|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[Children of Troubled Times]]'', a patriotic 1935 Chinese film most famous as the origin of "The March of the Volunteers", the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.]]

The period also produced the first big Chinese movie stars, such as [[Hu Die]], [[Ruan Lingyu]], [[Li Lili]], [[Chen Yanyan]], [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Zhao Dan]] and [[Jin Yan]]. Other major films of the period include ''[[Love and Duty (1931 film)|Love and Duty]]'' (1931), ''[[Little Toys]]'' (1933), ''[[New Women]]'' (1934), ''[[Song of the Fishermen]]'' (1934), ''[[Plunder of Peach and Plum]]'' (1934), ''[[Crossroads (1937 film)|Crossroads]]'' (1937), and ''[[Street Angel (1937 film)|Street Angel]]'' (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.

===Japanese occupation and World War II===

[[File:ZhouXuan1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Zhou Xuan]], an iconic Chinese singer and film actress.]]

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, in particular the [[Battle of Shanghai]], ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except [[Xinhua Film Company]] ("New China") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to [[Hong Kong]], the wartime Nationalist capital [[Chongqing]], and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the "[[Solitary Island]]" period (also known as the "Sole Island" or "Orphan Island"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an "island" of production in the "sea" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director [[Bu Wancang]]'s ''[[Mulan Joins the Army (1939 film)|Mulan Joins the Army]]'' (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war.&lt;ref name=Centennial/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| title = Sole Island Movies| accessdate = 2006-08-18| author = Ministry of Culture Staff| year = 2003| publisher = ChinaCulture.org| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826094341/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_38559.htm| archivedate = 2006-08-26| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on December 7, 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation. With the Shanghai industry firmly in Japanese control, films like the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]-promoting ''[[Eternity (1943 film)|Eternity]]'' (1943) were produced.&lt;ref name=Centennial/&gt; At the end of [[World War II]], one of the most controversial Japanese-authorized company, [[Manchukuo Film Association]], would be separated and integrated into Chinese cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baskett | first = Michael | year = 2008 | title = The Attractive Empire: Transnational Film Culture in Imperial Japan | publisher = [[University of Hawai'i Press]] | location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3223-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4QfrTyvWEC |accessdate= 2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Golden Age==
[[File:New Fisherman's Song.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wang Danfeng]] in the film ''New Fisherman's Song'' (1942)]]

The film industry continued to develop after 1945. Production in Shanghai once again resumed as a new crop of studios took the place that Lianhua and Mingxing had occupied in the previous decade. In 1946, [[Cai Chusheng]] returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the "Lianhua Film Society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/directors_ccwlc.html#cai |title=Chinese Cinema - Cai Chusheng |accessdate=2007-04-25 |author=Zhang Yingjin |date=2007-01-01 |publisher=University of California-San Diego |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307193958/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/directors_ccwlc.html |archivedate=March 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn became [[Kunlun Film Company|Kunlun Studios]] which would go on to become one of the most important studios of the era, putting out the classics ''[[The Spring River Flows East]]'' (1947), ''[[Myriad of Lights]]'' (1948), ''[[Crows and Sparrows]]'' (1949) and ''[[San Mao, The Little Vagabond]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/organisation/13907 | title = Kunlun Film Company| accessdate = 2007-04-25| author = |year= 2004| publisher = British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of these films showed the disillusionment with the oppressive rule of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Nationalist Party. ''The Spring River Flows East'', a three-hour-long two-parter directed by Cai Chusheng and [[Zheng Junli]], was a particularly strong success. Its depiction of the struggles of ordinary Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese war, replete with biting social and political commentary, struck a chord with audiences of the time.

Meanwhile, companies like the [[Wenhua Film Company]] ("Culture Films"), moved away from the leftist tradition and explored the evolution and development of other dramatic genres. Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae. Excellent examples of Wenhua's fare are its first two postwar features, ''[[Unending Emotions]]'' (1947) and ''[[Fake Bride, Phony Bridegroom]]'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;Pickowicz, Paul G. "Chinese Film-making on the Eve of the Communist Revolution", in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'', edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward (2011). BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Another memorable Wenhua film is ''[[Long Live the Missus]]'' (1947), like ''Unending Emotions'' with an original screenplay by writer [[Eileen Chang]]. Wenhua's romantic drama ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948), a film by director [[Fei Mu]] shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hkfaa.com/news/100films.html | title = Welcome to the Hong Kong Film Awards| accessdate = 2007-04-04 | author = |year= 2004| publisher =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, it was precisely its artistic quality and apparent lack of "political grounding" that led to its labeling by the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] as rightist or reactionary, and the film was quickly forgotten by those on the mainland following the [[Chinese Civil War|Communist victory]] in China in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Yingjin, "Introduction" in ''Cinema and Urban Culture in Shanghai, 1922–1943'', ed. Yingjin Zhang (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the China Film Archive's re-opening after the Cultural Revolution, a new print was struck from the original negative, allowing ''Spring of the Small Town'' to find a new and admiring audience and to influence an entire new generation of filmmakers. Indeed, an acclaimed [[Springtime in a Small Town|remake]] was made in 2002 by [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]. ''[[Remorse at Death]]'' (1948), by the same director, was the first Chinese [[Color motion picture film|color film]].

Starting from 1951, pre-1949 Chinese films, [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and Hong Kong productions were banned as the [[Communist Party of China]] sought to tighten control over mass media, producing instead movies centering on peasants, soldiers and workers, such as ''[[Bridge (1949 film)|Bridge]]'' (1949) and ''[[The White Haired Girl (film)|The White Haired Girl]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="Yau, Esther 1997 p. 694"&gt;Yau, Esther.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the production bases in the middle of all the transition was the [[Changchun Film Studio]].

The private studios in Shanghai, including Kunming, Wenhua, Guotai and Datong, were encouraged to make new films from 1949 to 1951. They made approximately 47 films during this period, but soon ran into trouble, owing to the furore over the Kunlun-produced drama ''[[The Life of Wu Xun]]'' (1950), directed by [[Sun Yu (director)|Sun Yu]] and starring veteran Zhao Dan. The feature was accused in an anonymous article in ''[[People's Daily]]'' in May 1951 of spreading feudal ideas. After the article was revealed to be penned by [[Mao Zedong]], the film was banned, a Film Steering Committee was formed to "re-educate" the film industry and within two years, these private studios were all incorporated into the state-run [[Shanghai Film Studio]].&lt;ref name="Yau, Esther 1997 p. 694"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, Julian 2011 p. 88"&gt;Ward, Julian.

The Communist regime solved the problem of a lack of film theaters by building mobile projection units which could tour the remote regions of China, ensuring that even the poorest could have access to films. By 1965 there were around 20,393 such units.&lt;ref name="Yau, Esther 1997 p. 694"/&gt; The number of movie-viewers hence increased sharply, partly bolstered by the fact that film tickets were given out to work units and attendance was compulsory,&lt;ref name="Ward, Julian 2011 p. 88"/&gt; with admissions rising from 47 million in 1949 to 4.15 billion in 1959.&lt;ref name="Bordwell and Thompson 2010 371"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17 years between the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]], 603 feature films and 8,342 reels of documentaries and [[newsreel]]s were produced, sponsored mostly as Communist propaganda by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/film/84966.htm | title = Film Industry in China | accessdate = 2007-02-27 | author = Li Xiao |date= 2004-01-17| publisher = China.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[Guerrilla on the Railroad]]'' (铁道游击队), dated 1956, the Chinese Communist Party was depicted as the primary resistance force against the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese in the war against invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Braester, Yumi.

[[Animations|Animated films]] using a variety of [[Chinese folk art|folk arts]], such as [[Chinese paper art|papercuts]], [[shadow theatre|shadow plays]], [[glove puppetry|puppetry]], and [[Chinese painting|traditional paintings]], also were very popular for entertaining and educating children. The most famous of these, the classic ''[[Havoc in Heaven]]'' (two parts, 1961, 4), was made by [[Wan Laiming]] of the [[Wan Brothers]] and won Outstanding Film award at the [[London International Film Festival]].

The thawing of censorship in 1956–57 (known as the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]]) and the early 1960s led to more indigenous Chinese films being made which were less reliant on their Soviet counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this campaign the sharpest criticisms came from the satirical comedies of [[Lü Ban]]. ''[[Before the New Director Arrives]]'' exposes the hierarchical relationships occurring between the cadres, while his next film, ''[[The Unfinished Comedy]]'' (1957), was labelled as a "poisonous weed" during the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] and Lü banned was from directing for life.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Esther.

The most prominent filmmaker of this era was [[Xie Jin]], whose three films in particular, ''[[Woman Basketball Player No. 5]]'' (1957), ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1961 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'' (1961) and ''[[Two Stage Sisters]]'' (1964), exemplify China's increased expertise at filmmaking during this time. Films made during this period are polished and exhibit high production value and elaborate sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Beijing]] and Shanghai remained the main centers of production, between 1957–60 the government built regional studios in [[Guangzhou]], [[Xi'an]] and [[Chengdu]] to encourage representations of ethnic minorities in films. Chinese cinema began to directly address the issue of such ethnic minorities during the late 1950s and early 1960s, in films like ''[[Five Golden Flowers]]'' (1959), ''[[Third Sister Liu]]'' (1960), ''[[Serfs (1963 film)|Serfs]]'' (1963), ''[[Ashima (poem)|Ashima]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=370–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Esther.

==Cultural Revolution and its aftermath==
During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the film industry was severely restricted. Almost all previous films were banned, and only a few new ones were produced, the so-called "revolutionary model operas". The most notable of these was a [[ballet]] version of the revolutionary opera ''[[The Red Detachment of Women (1970 film)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'', directed by Pan Wenzhan and Fu Jie in 1970. Feature film production came almost to a standstill in the early years from 1967 to 1972. Movie production revived after 1972 under the strict jurisdiction of the [[Gang of Four]] until 1976, when they were overthrown. The few films that were produced during this period, such as 1975's ''[[Breaking with Old Ideas]]'', were highly regulated in terms of plot and characterization.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Yingjin &amp; Xiao, Zhiwei. "Breaking with Old Ideas" in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Film''. Taylor &amp; Francis (1998), p. 101. {{ISBN|0-415-15168-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years immediately following the Cultural Revolution, the film industry again flourished as a medium of popular entertainment. Production rose steadily, from 19 features in 1977 to 125 in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically produced films played to large audiences, and tickets for foreign [[film festival]]s sold quickly. The industry tried to revive crowds by making more innovative and "exploratory" films like their counterparts in the West.

In the 1980s the film industry fell on hard times, faced with the dual problems of competition from other forms of entertainment and concern on the part of the authorities that many of the popular thriller and [[martial art]]s films were socially unacceptable. In January 1986 the film industry was transferred from the [[Ministry of Culture (China)|Ministry of Culture]] to the newly formed [[Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television (China)|Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television]] to bring it under "stricter control and management" and to "strengthen supervision over production."

The end of the Cultural Revolution brought the release of "scar dramas", which depicted the emotional traumas left by this period. The best-known of these is probably Xie Jin's ''[[Hibiscus Town]]'' (1986), although they could be seen as late as the 1990s with [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' (1993). In the 1980s, open criticism of certain past Communist Party policies was encouraged by [[Deng Xiaoping]] as a way to reveal the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the earlier [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], also helping to legitimize Deng's new policies of "[[reform and opening up]]." For instance, the Best Picture prize in the inaugural 1981 [[Golden Rooster Awards]] was given to two "scar dramas", ''[[Evening Rain]]'' ([[Wu Yonggang]], [[Wu Yigong]], 1980) and ''[[Legend of Tianyun Mountain]]'' ([[Xie Jin]], 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Esther. "China After the Revolution", in ''The Oxford history of world cinema'' edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (1997). Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scar dramas were made by members of the Fourth Generation whose own careers or lives had suffered during the events in question, while younger, Fifth Generation directors such as Tian tended to focus on less controversial subjects of the immediate present or the distant past. Official enthusiasm for scar dramas waned by the 1990s when younger filmmakers began to confront negative aspects of the Mao era. ''The Blue Kite'', though sharing a similar subject as the earlier scar dramas, was more realistic in style, and was made only through obfuscating its real script. Shown abroad, it was banned from release in mainland China, while Tian himself was banned from making any films for nearly a decade afterward. After the events of June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square, few if any scar dramas were released domestically in mainland China.

==Rise of the Fifth Generation==
[[File:Qufu Cinema - P1060026.JPG|thumb|A movie theater in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]]]]
Beginning in the mid-late 1980s, the rise of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the [[Beijing Film Academy]] in 1982 and included [[Zhang Yimou]], [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]], [[Chen Kaige]], [[Zhang Junzhao]] and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the [[Cultural Revolution]] and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm | title = The Irresistible Rise of Asian Cinema-Tian Zhuangzhuang: A Director of the 21st Century| accessdate = 2007-04-23 |date= 2002-11-19 | author=Yvonne Ng|publisher = Kinema |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070416073506/http://kinema.uwaterloo.ca/ghy-941.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the so-called [[scar literature]] in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao's ''[[One and Eight]]'' (1983) and Chen Kaige's ''[[Yellow Earth]]'' (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation.{{efn|Notably Zhang Yimou served as cinematographer for both films.}} The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as ''[[King of the Children]]'' (1987), ''[[Ju Dou]]'' (1989), ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) and ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'' (1991), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western [[art film|arthouse]] audience. [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]]'s films, though less well known by Western viewers, were well noted by directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] for ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'', the 1992 [[Golden Lion]] for ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'', the 1993 [[Palme d'Or]] for ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', and three [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] nominations from the Academy Awards.&lt;ref name=Greatfall/&gt; All these award-winning films starred actress [[Gong Li]], who became the Fifth Generation's most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.

Diverse in style and subject, the Fifth Generation directors' films ranged from [[black comedy]] ([[Huang Jianxin]]'s ''[[The Black Cannon Incident]]'', 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige's ''[[Life on a String (film)|Life on a String]]'', 1991), but they share a common rejection of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include [[Wu Ziniu]], [[Hu Mei]], [[Li Shaohong]] and [[Zhou Xiaowen]]. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentary fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people's daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed at exploring issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth along the lines of European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=639–640}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.

These films came with a new style of shooting as well, directors utilized extensive color and [[long shot]]s. As a result of the new films being so intricate, the films were for more educated audiences than anything. The new style was profitable for some and helped filmmakers to make strides in the business. It allowed directors to get away from reality and show their artistic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell and Thompson|title=Film History: An Introduction (Third Edition)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|pages=638–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Generation also returned to prominence. Given their label after the rise of the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. [[Wu Tianming]], in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors under the auspices of the [[Xi'an Film Studio]] (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films like ''[[Old Well (film)|Old Well]]'' (1986) and ''[[The King of Masks]]'' (1996).

The Fifth Generation movement ended in part after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen Incident]], although its major directors continued to produce notable works. Several of its filmmakers went into self-imposed exile: Wu Tianming moved to the [[United States]] (but later returned), Huang Jianxin left for [[Australia]], while many others went into television-related works.

==Main melody dramas==
In 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes "the main melody" (主旋律) to "invigorate national spirit and national pride".&lt;ref&gt;Rui Zhang, ''The Cinema of Feng Xiaogang: Commercialization and Censorship in Chinese Cinema after 1989''. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2008, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; These "main melody" films (主旋律电影), still produced regularly nowadays, try to emulate the commercial mainstream by the use of Hollywood-style music and special effects.
They are often subsidized by the state and have free access to government and military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Braester, Yomi. "Contemporary Mainstream PRC Cinema" in ''The Chinese Cinema Book'' (2011), edited by Song Hwee Lim and Julian Ward, BFI: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August 1st Film Studio]], the film and TV production arm of the [[People's Liberation Army]], is a studio which produces "main melody" cinema. "Main melody" films, which often depict past military engagements or are biopics of first-generation CCP leaders, have won several Best Picture prizes at the [[Golden Rooster Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;Rui Zhang, ''The Cinema of Feng Xiaogang: Commercialization and Censorship in Chinese Cinema after 1989''. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2008, p. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more famous "main melody" dramas include the ten-hour epic ''[[Decisive Engagement]]'' (大决战, 1991), directed by Cai Jiawei, Yang Guangyuan and Wei Lian; ''[[The Opium War (film)|The Opium War]]'' (1997), directed by [[Xie Jin]]; and ''[[The Founding of a Republic]]'' (2009), directed by [[Han Sanping]] and Fifth Generation director [[Huang Jianxin]].&lt;ref&gt;Braester, Yomi.

==Sixth Generation==
The post-1990 era has seen what some observers{{Who|date=July 2011}} term the "return of the amateur filmmaker" as state [[censorship]] policies after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square demonstrations]] produced an edgy underground film movement loosely referred to as the Sixth Generation. Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like [[16 mm film]] and [[digital video]] and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to [[Italian neorealism]] and [[cinéma vérité]] than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation.&lt;ref name=Greatfall&gt;Rose, S. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/01/china.film "The great fall of China"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2002-08-01. Retrieved on 2007-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Fifth Generation, the Sixth Generation brings a more individualistic, anti-romantic life-view and pays far closer attention to contemporary urban life, especially as affected by disorientation, rebellion&lt;ref name="Stephen Teo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sensesofcinema.com/2003/feature-articles/li_yang/|title= "There Is No Sixth Generation!"

The title and subjects of many of these films reflect the Sixth Generation's concerns. The Sixth Generation takes an interest in marginalized individuals and the less represented fringes of society. For example, [[Zhang Yuan (director)|Zhang Yuan]]'s hand-held ''[[Beijing Bastards]]'' (1993) focuses on youth [[punk rock|punk]] [[subculture]], featuring artists like [[Cui Jian]], [[Dou Wei]] and [[He Yong (rock musician)|He Yong]] frowned upon by many state authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/1993/film/reviews/beijing-zazhong-1200433948/|title= Review: ‘Beijing Zazhong’|author= Deborah Young
|date= October 4, 1993|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work= Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Jia Zhangke's debut film ''[[Xiao Wu]]'' (1997) concerns a provincial [[pickpocket]].

As the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's ''[[Platform (2000 film)|Platform]]'' (2000) was funded in part by [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s production house,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2014/05/16/a-touch-of-sin-interview-with-jia-zhangke/|title= A Touch of Sin: Interview with Jia Zhang-ke|author= Pamela Jahn |date= May 16, 2014|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work= Electric Sheep}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his ''[[Still Life (2006 film)|Still Life]]'' was shot on [[High Definition video|HD video]]. ''Still Life'' was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 [[Venice International Film Festival]]. ''Still Life'', which concerns provincial workers around the [[Three Gorges]] region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Promise (2005 film)|The Promise]]'' (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals.

Many Sixth Generation films have highlighted the negative attributes of China's entry into the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[market economy|market]]. [[Li Yang (director)|Li Yang]]'s ''[[Blind Shaft]]'' (2003) for example, is an account of two murderous con-men in the unregulated and notoriously dangerous mining industry of northern China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/movies/filming-the-dark-side-of-capitalism-in-china-578819.html | title = Filming the Dark Side Of Capitalism in China | accessdate = 2008-04-10 | author = Kahn, Joseph|date= 2003-05-07| publisher = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Li refused the tag of Sixth Generation, although admitted he was not Fifth Generation).&lt;ref name="Stephen Teo"/&gt; While Jia Zhangke's ''[[The World (film)|The World]]'' (2004) emphasizes the emptiness of [[globalization]] in the backdrop of an internationally themed amusement park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/festival-reports/new_york2004/ | title = Minimalism and Maximalism: The 42nd New York Film Festival | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | author = Rapfogel, Jared |date= December 2004| publisher = Senses of Cinema |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913090619/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/05/34/new_york2004.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more prolific Sixth Generation directors to have emerged are [[Wang Xiaoshuai]] (''[[The Days (film)|The Days]]'', ''[[Beijing Bicycle]]''), [[Zhang Yuan (director)|Zhang Yuan]] (''[[Beijing Bastards]]'', ''[[East Palace West Palace]]''), [[Jia Zhangke]] (''[[Xiao Wu]]'', ''[[Unknown Pleasures (film)|Unknown Pleasures]]'', ''[[Platform (2000 film)|Platform]]'', ''[[The World (film)|The World]]''), [[He Jianjun]] (''[[Postman (film)|Postman]]'') and [[Lou Ye]] (''[[Suzhou River (film)|Suzhou River]]'', ''[[Summer Palace (2006 film)|Summer Palace]]''). One young director who does not share most of the concerns of the Sixth Generation is [[Lu Chuan]] (''[[Kekexili: Mountain Patrol]]'', 2004; ''[[City of Life and Death]]'', 2010).

==dGeneration Independent Movement==
There is a growing number of independent post-Sixth Generation filmmakers making films with extremely low budgets and using digital equipment. They are the so-called dGeneration (for digital).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1219/719 |title=From D-Buffs to the D-Generation: Piracy, Cinema, and an Alternative Public Sphere in Urban China |website=Talari.com |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These films, like those from Sixth Generation filmmakers, are mostly made outside the Chinese film system and are shown mostly on the international film festival circuit. [[Ying Liang]] and [[Jian Yi]] are two of these dGeneration filmmakers. Ying's ''[[Taking Father Home]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Other Half (2006 Chinese film)|The Other Half]]'' (2006) are both representative of the dGeneration trends of feature film. [[Liu Jiayin]] made two dGeneration feature films, ''[[Oxhide]]'' (2004) and ''[[Oxhide II]]'' (2010), blurring the line between documentary and narrative film. ''Oxhide'', made by Liu when she was a film student, frames herself and her parents in their claustrophobic Beijing apartment in a narrative praised by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutbeijing.com/features/Books__Film-Interviews__Features/28696/100-best-Chinese-Mainland-Films-the-countdown/9/30-21.html |title=100 best Chinese Mainland Films: the countdown |website=Timeoutbeijing.com |date=2014-04-04 |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Documentary Movement==
Two decades of reform and commercialization have brought dramatic social changes in mainland China, reflected not only in fiction film but in a growing documentary movement. [[Wu Wenguang]]'s 70-minute ''[[Bumming in Beijing: The Last Dreamers]]'' (1990) is now seen as one of the first works of this "[[New Documentary Movement]]" (NDM) in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/28/chinas_new_documentary/|title=Dancing with Myself,Drifting with My Camera: The Emotional Vagabonds|publisher=Senses of Cinema|author=Reynaud, Berenice|date=September 2003|accessdate=2007-12-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103202811/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/03/28/chinas_new_documentary.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1998/03/05/STYLE6967.dtl|author=Krich, John|publisher=''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]''|date=March 5, 1998|title=China's New Documentaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bumming'', made between 1988 and 1990, contains interviews with five young artists eking out a living in [[Beijing]], subject to state authorized tasks. Shot using a [[camcorder]], the documentary ends with four of the artists moving abroad after the 1989 Tiananmen Protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chu | first = Yingchu| year = 2007 | title = Chinese Documentaries: From Dogma to Polyphony | publisher = Routledge| pages = 91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dance with the Farm Workers]]'' (2001) is another documentary by Wu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zhang | first = Yingjin| year = 2010 | title = Cinema, Space, and Polylocality in a Globalizing China | publisher = [[University of Hawai'i Press]]| page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another internationally acclaimed documentary is [[Wang Bing (director)|Wang Bing]]'s nine-hour tale of deindustrialization ''[[Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks]]'' (2003). Wang's subsequent documentaries, ''[[Fengming: A Chinese Memoir|He Fengming]]'' (2007), ''[[Crude Oil (film)|Crude Oil]]'' (2008), ''[[Man with no name (film)|Man with no name]]'' (2009), ''[[Three Sisters (2012 film)|Three Sisters]]'' (2012) and ''[[Til madness do us part|Feng ai]]'' (2013), cemented his reputation as a leading documentarist of the movement.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Li Hong (filmmaker)|Li Hong]], the first woman in the NDM, in ''[[Out of Phoenix Bridge]]'' (1997) relates the story of four young women, who moving from rural areas to the big cities like millions of other men and women, have come to Beijing to make a living.

The New Documentary Movement in recent times has overlapped with the dGeneration filmmaking, with most documentaries being shot cheaply and independently in the digital format. [[Xu Xin (filmmaker)|Xu Xin]]'s ''[[Karamay (film)|Karamay]]'' (2010), [[Zhao Liang (filmmaker)|Zhao Liang]]'s [[Behemoth (film 2015)|Behemoth]], [[Huang Weikai]]'s ''[[Disorder (2009 film)|Disorder]]'' (2009), [[Zhao Dayong]]'s ''[[Ghost Town (2009 film)|Ghost Town]]'' (2009), [[Du Haibing]]'s ''[[1428 (film)|1428]]'' (2009), [[Xu Tong]]'s ''[[Fortune Teller (2010 film)|Fortune Teller]]'' (2010) and [[Li Ning (filmmaker)|Li Ning]]’s ''[[Tape (2010)|Tape]]'' (2010) were all shot in digital format. All had made their impact in the international documentary scene and the use of digital format allows for works of vaster lengths.

===Commercial successes===
With China's liberalization in the late 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's ''[[The Horse Thief]]'' (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a [[Tibet]]an horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;''Celluloid China: cinematic encounters with culture and society'', Harry H. Kuoshu, Southern Illinois University Press (2002), p 202&lt;/ref&gt;
Tian's later ''[[The Warrior and the Wolf]]'' (2010) was a similar commercial failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zx.dy.com.cn/content/2009-10-12/20091012185758575,1.shtml 《狼灾记》票房低迷出乎意料 导演的兽性情挑_第一电影网&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905133933/http://zx.dy.com.cn/content/2009-10-12/20091012185758575%2C1.shtml |date=September 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to these, there were examples of successful commercial films in the post-liberalization period. One was the romance film ''[[Romance on Lushan Mountain|Romance on the Lu Mountain]]'' (1980), which was a success with older Chinese. The film broke the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the longest-running film on a [[first run (film)|first run]]. [[Jet Li]]'s cinematic debut ''[[Shaolin Temple (1982 film)|Shaolin Temple]]'' (1982) was an instant hit at home and abroad (in [[Japan]] and the [[Southeast Asia]], for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Celebrity in China |authors= Louise Edwards, Elaine Jeffreys |publisher= Hong Kong University Press |year=2010 |page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another successful commercial film was ''[[Murder in 405]]'' (405谋杀案, 1980), a murder thriller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctv.com/program/ljsy_new/14/56/index.shtml|title=CCTV-电影频道-相聚——《流金岁月》|website=Cctv.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feng Xiaogang]]'s ''[[The Dream Factory (film)|The Dream Factory]]'' (1997) was heralded as a turning point in Chinese movie industry, a ''[[hesui pian]]'' ([[Chinese New Year]]-screened film) which demonstrated the viability of the commercial model in China's [[socialist market economy|socialist market]] society. Feng has become the most successful commercial director in the post-1997 era. Almost all his films made high returns domestically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/02/feng-xiaogang-and-chinese-cinema-boom |title=Feng Xiaogang: the Chinese Spielberg |author= Walsh Megan|date=February 20, 2014|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work=[[New Statesman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he used ethnic Chinese co-stars like [[Rosamund Kwan]], [[Jacqueline Wu]], [[Rene Liu]] and [[Shu Qi]] to boost his films' appeal.

In the decade following 2010, owing to the influx of Hollywood films (though the number screened each year is curtailed), Chinese domestic cinema faces mounting challenges. The industry is growing and domestic films are starting to achieve the box office impact of major Hollywood blockbusters. However, not all domestic films are successful financially. In January 2010 [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' was pulled out from non-3D theaters for [[Hu Mei]]'s biopic ''[[Confucius (2010 film)|Confucius]]'', but this move led to a backlash on Hu's film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-01/29/content_9396402.htm |title=Confucius loses his way |author= Raymond Zhou|date=January 29, 2010|accessdate= April 3, 2015|work=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Yang (director)|Zhang Yang]]'s 2005 ''[[Sunflower (2005 film)|Sunflower]]'' also made little money, but his earlier, low-budget ''[[Spicy Love Soup]]'' (1997) grossed ten times its budget of ¥3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Companion to Chinese Cinema |author= Yingjin Zhang (ed.) |publisher= Blackwell Publishing |year=2012 |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the 2006 ''[[Crazy Stone (film)|Crazy Stone]]'', a [[sleeper hit]], was made for just 3 million HKD/US$400,000. In 2009–11, Feng's ''[[Aftershock (2010 film)|Aftershock]]'' (2009) and [[Jiang Wen]]'s ''[[Let the Bullets Fly]]'' (2010) became China's highest grossing domestic films, with ''Aftershock'' earning ¥670 million (US$105 million)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/feng-xiaogang-remembering-1942-shanghai-338567 |title=Feng Xiaogang Unveils Epic 'Remembering 1942' at the Shanghai Film Festival |author= Karen Chu |date=2012-06-17|accessdate= 2012-07-07|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Let the Bullets Fly'' ¥674 million (US$110 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/so-young-enters-chinas-all-time-top-ten|title=So Young enters China's all-time top ten|author=Stephen Cremin|date=18 May 2013|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|accessdate=April 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319110551/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/so-young-enters-chinas-all-time-top-ten|archivedate=19 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lost in Thailand]]'' (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach [[Renminbi|¥]]1 billion at the Chinese box office and ''[[Monster Hunt]]'' (2015) became the first to reach {{CNY|2 billion}}.

===Other directors===
[[He Ping (director)|He Ping]] is a director of mostly [[Western film|Western]]-like films set in Chinese locale. His ''[[Swordsmen in Double Flag Town]]'' (1991) and ''[[Sun Valley (film)|Sun Valley]]'' (1995) explore narratives set in the sparse terrain of West China near the [[Gobi Desert]]. His [[historical drama]] ''[[Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker]]'' (1994) won a myriad of prizes home and abroad.

Recent cinema has seen Chinese cinematographers direct some acclaimed films. Other than Zhang Yimou, [[Lü Yue]] made ''[[Mr. Zhao]]'' (1998), a [[black comedy]] film well received abroad. [[Gu Changwei]]'s [[minimalism|minimalist]] epic ''[[Peacock (2005 film)|Peacock]]'' (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-[[Cultural Revolution]] era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. [[Hou Yong (cinematographer)|Hou Yong]] is another cinematographer who made films (''[[Jasmine Women]]'', 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing. [[Xu Jinglei]], a popular Chinese actress, has made six movies to date. Her second film ''[[Letter from an Unknown Woman (2004 film)|Letter from an Unknown Woman]]'' (2004) landed her the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]] Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is [[Zhao Wei]], whose directorial debut ''[[So Young (film)|So Young]]'' (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.

The most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly [[Jiang Wen]], who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, ''[[In the Heat of the Sun]]'' (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the [[Golden Horse Film Awards]] held in [[Taiwan]]. His other films, like ''[[Devils on the Doorstep]]'' (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and ''[[Let the Bullets Fly]]'' (2010), were similarly well received. By the early 2011, ''Let the Bullets Fly'' had become the highest grossing domestic film in China's history.&lt;ref name="fba-resurrection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/resurrection-takes-china-bo-record|work=Film Business Asia|title=Resurrection takes China BO record|accessdate=April 3, 2015|author=Cremin, Stephen|date=July 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730010234/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/resurrection-takes-china-bo-record|archive-date=July 30, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.qq.com/a/20110216/000002.htm|title=《让子弹飞》票房7.3亿 姜文成国内第一导演_娱乐_腾讯网|website=Ent.qq.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese international cinema and successes abroad===
[[File:Jia Zhang-Ke Skipcity DCF 2005.jpg|thumb|150px|Director [[Jia Zhangke]] at the Skip City International D-Cinema Festival in Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan, 22 July 2005]]

Since the late 1980s and progressively in the 2000s, Chinese films have enjoyed considerable box office success abroad. Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of [[Ang Lee]]'s period [[wuxia|martial arts]] film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' which won [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the [[wuxia]] genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date ''Crouching Tiger'' remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.

Similarly, in 2002, Zhang Yimou's ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from the Mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including [[Jet Li]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Maggie Cheung]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]]. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, ''Hero'' was a phenomenal success in most of [[Asia]] and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.

Other films such as ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'', ''[[Suzhou River (film)|Suzhou River]]'', ''[[The Road Home (1999 film)|The Road Home]]'' and ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' were critically acclaimed around the world. The [[Hengdian World Studios]] can be seen as the "Chinese Hollywood", with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the [[Forbidden City]].

The successes of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' and ''Hero'' make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between "Mainland Chinese" cinema and a more international-based "Chinese-language cinema". ''Crouching Tiger'', for example, was directed by a [[Taiwan]]-born American director ([[Ang Lee]]) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include Mainland Chinese ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), Hong Kong ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]), Taiwan ([[Chang Chen]]) and [[Malaysia]]n ([[Michelle Yeoh]]) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee's Chinese-language ''[[Lust, Caution]]'' (2007) drew a crew and cast from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]]. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader [[East Asia]] and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include ''[[The Promise (2005 film)|The Promise]]'' (2005), ''[[The Banquet (2006 film)|The Banquet]]'' (2006), ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'' (2006), ''[[The Warlords]]'' (2007), ''[[Bodyguards and Assassins]]'' (2009) and ''[[Red Cliff (film)|Red Cliff]]'' (2008-9). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like [[Hu Jun]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Tang Wei]] and [[Zhou Xun]], obtained Hong Kong residency under the [[Quality Migrant Admission Scheme]] and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?Display=2473 |title=Zhou Xun Obtains Hong Kong Citizenship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2016-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402064516/http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?Display=2473 |archive-date=2012-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crossover''' is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete [[fiction]]al [[fictional character|characters]], [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s, or [[fictional universe|universes]] into the context of a single [[Narrative|story]]. They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant [[copyright]] holders, unauthorized efforts by [[fandom|fan]]s or common corporate ownership.

==Official crossovers==
Crossovers often occur in an official capacity in order for the [[intellectual property]] rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular, established properties. In other cases, the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept derivative of an older one.

Crossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder, but they can, more rarely, involve properties from different holders, provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome. They may also involve using characters that have passed into the [[public domain]] with those concurrently under [[copyright|copyright protection]].

A crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover, such as characters being neighbors (notable examples being the casts from ''[[Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]'') or meeting via [[dimensional rift]] or similar phenomenon (a common explanation for [[science fiction]] properties that have different owners). Some crossovers are not explained at all. Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting, and have to be ignored by the series' respective [[Continuity (fiction)|continuities]]. Still others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing, as with ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'', where each show is fiction in the other.

===Comics===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[X-Men (TV series)]] --&gt;
[[File:SpeedComicsNo32.jpg|thumb|Comic book crossovers may be traced back to the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]], where characters frequently teamed up on the cover (though far more rarely on the inside). ''Speed Comics'' number 32, Artwork by [[Alex Schomburg]].]]

Crossovers of multiple characters owned by one company or [[publishing|published]] by one [[publisher]], have been used to set an established continuity, where characters can frequently meet within one setting. This is especially true of [[comic book publisher]]s, as different characters in various [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[DC Comics|DC]] or [[Valiant Comics|Valiant]] [[comic book]]s frequently interact with one another since they live in a "[[shared universe]]". For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, [[Spider-Man]] has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], just as in the DC Comics Universe, the [[The Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Green Lantern]] often collaborate. In comic book terminology, these "guest star" roles are common enough that they are generally not considered crossovers; rather, this short-term collaboration to fight crime is called a [[team-up]]. A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This has led to "crossover events", in which major occurrences are shown as affecting most or all of the stories in the shared universe.

The earliest such crossover event was [[Gardner Fox]]'s ''Zatanna's Search'', which took place in ''[[Hawkman]]'' #4 (October/November 1964), ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #336 (February 1965), ''[[The Atom]]'' #19 (June/July 1965), ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #42 (January 1966), ''Detective Comics'' #355 (September 1966), and ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #51 (February 1967). This story dealt with [[Zatanna]] attempting to reconnect with her father, [[Zatara]], and seeking the aid of Hawkman, Batman, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], the Atom, Green Lantern, and [[Elongated Man]] along the way.

The first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor-in-Chief at the time, [[Jim Shooter]]. As a way to further toy sales he devised the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' crossover, which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a 12-issue miniseries to battle a common threat. After the threat was dealt with, they all returned to their regular titles. ''Secret Wars'' was hailed as both a critical and commercial success, largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters (such as the introduction of [[Spider-Man]]'s black suit which would later become the villain [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]). [[Jim Shooter]] later perfected his crossover technique at [[Valiant Comics]] with the ''[[Unity (comics)|Unity]]'' event. ''Unity'' brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat [[Mothergod]], but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles (and two bookend special issues). Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title, but far more layered when all were read. Like ''Secret Wars'', the ''Unity'' crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe; most notably the introduction of [[Turok]], the birth of [[Magnus, Robot Fighter]] and the death of a major Valiant hero.

[[Dark Horse Comics]]'s ''Aliens Versus Predator'' comic book franchise was a success that continued into many video games, two movies and even an ''Aliens Versus Predator Versus The Terminator'' comic.

The comic crossovers from [[Raj Comics]] are very famous in India, in which the super heroes meet to fight a common enemy. Many of these crossovers have occurred between [[Nagraj]] and [[Super Commando Dhruva]]. In ''Kohram'', all the heroes in Raj Universe meet to finish ''Haru'', an extremely powerful enemy.

[[Webcomics]] creators sometimes produce crossovers; one of the first was a two-week sequence between [[Christopher Baldwin]]'s ''[[Bruno (webcomic)|Bruno]]'' and Peter Zale's ''[[Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comic Strips Crossover On The Net|last=Menefee|first=Craig|date=March 19, 1998|work=[[New Straits Times]]|quote=lasted two weeks|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Archie Comics released a 12-part crossover of [[Capcom]] character [[Mega Man]] and [[Sega]] character [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] called "[[Worlds Collide (Archie Comics)|Worlds Collide]]". Taking place in issues of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Sonic Universe]]'' and ''[[Mega Man (Archie Comics)|Mega Man]]'' comic series from Archie, the crossover involved [[Dr. Eggman]] and [[Dr. Wily]] forming an alliance to take over both their universes and destroy their respective nemeses. Sonic and Mega Man were briefly tricked into fighting each other, but later joined forces and teamed up with other heroes to battle the doctors' forces, which included virtually every Robot Master introduced in the ''Mega Man'' games. The popularity of this crossover and the books involved led to a second crossover in 2015 entitled "Worlds Unite", which not only reunited Sonic and Mega Man but also featured comics-exclusive characters from both of their books, the ''[[Mega Man X]]'' and ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' spinoff franchises and various other SEGA and Capcom franchises. This crossover was enabled by the conclusion of the first crossover, which saw a reboot to the Sonic books as their universe was drastically rewritten. Aftereffects of this included the Genesis Portals, gateways connecting worlds that would be exploited by ''Mega Man X'' villain Sigma and his minions, forcing a reunion between Sonic and Mega Man and an alliance between heroes of the various franchises involved. "Worlds Unite" spans not only the three series featured in the first crossover, but also includes the ''Sonic Boom'' comic series, which entered publication between the two crossovers.

There are also [[intercompany crossover]]s, where characters owned by two different companies meet, such as those from DC and Marvel.

===Animation===
Cartoon crossovers are not uncommon, and most of them – like comics or live-action TV shows – will often feature characters owned by the same company or network. One example is [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door''. It features five crossovers – ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'', ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', a reference to ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and a quote from ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', which are all licensed Cartoon Network series. The cast of ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien]]'' and ''[[Generator Rex]]'' team up in ''[[Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United]]''. Similarly, characters from ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'' and ''[[Steven Universe]]'' appeared in a crossover episode "Say Uncle". The same occurred with ''[[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' in an episode called "[[TTG v PPG]]". Most of the last episodes of the ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series]]'' (a spinoff of the film ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'') had crossovers with various other [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] cartoons, including ''[[The Proud Family]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', and ''[[American Dragon Jake Long]]''. The ''[[Jimmy Timmy Power Hour]]'' trilogy is another example, in which Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner switch universes. The Disney TV series ''[[Hercules (1998 TV series)|Hercules]]'', based on the [[Hercules (1997 film)|1997 film of the same name]], had an episode titled "[[Hercules and the Arabian Night]]" that had a crossover between the characters of the TV series and film and with the characters of the Disney film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', in which Hades and Jafar each try to get rid of each other's enemies (Hades would try to defeat Aladdin while Jafar would try to defeat Hercules). Another crossover is ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'' in which the [[Rugrats]] are stranded on an island where [[The Wild Thornberrys]] were at the time. In [[Dexter's Laboratory]] "Dial M for Monkey" "Huntor" who tries to hunt Monkey is himself hunted; "Huntor" later makes a cameo crossover in [[Samurai Jack]]'s "Jack vs Mad Jack." 
During the 1970s and 1980s, crossovers were particularly common among the [[Hanna-Barbera]] properties. Some of the earliest examples happened on ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', which featured appearances by characters from ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', ''[[Jeannie (TV series)|Jeannie]]'', ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Batman|Batman and Robin]]'', and ''[[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|The Addams Family]]''. Later, the ''[[Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10]]'' set of movies involved several crossovers, including such combinations as ''[[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones]]''. This was taken to an extreme in the 1977–79 series ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]],'' which was essentially a gathering of the Hanna-Barbera characters for a regular series.

Crossovers are not necessarily composed of characters under common ownership. Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies. Disney's movie ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' had characters from various companies, most notably Disney and [[Warner Bros.]] [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Donald Duck]] made a simultaneous appearance in one scene, in which the two of them exchanged blows during a piano duet. Later in the movie, [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Bugs Bunny]] were shown parachuting together (to keep things from getting too iffy legally, Mickey and Bugs' lines were written so that each of them said exactly the same number of words in the movie).{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The film also includes cameos of characters from [[Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]]. The end of the movie features all the cartoons from all of the animation companies joining together in song, to be concluded by [[Porky Pig]] stuttering his famous "That's All, Folks!" line as [[Tinker Bell#Disney|Tinker Bell]] ends the scene with a magical fade-out.

On February 27, 1998, Fox Kids show, ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'' and ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', had their crossover with the episode "Shell Shocked".

On October 4, 1997, The 2 Kids WB shows, ''Superman: The Animated Series'' and ''The New Batman Adventures'', had their first crossover with the TV movie ''World's Finest'', which was also released on DVD.

Another cartoon crossover would occur in 1990, ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]''. This cartoon featured popular characters from children's Saturday morning cartoons, banding together to promote an anti-drug message. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[NBC]] aired this half-hour special one Saturday morning with characters from all their networks, including [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] (from Disney's ''[[DuckTales]]''), [[Winnie the Pooh]], [[Tigger]], Slimer (from ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' and ''Extreme Ghostbusters''), Michelangelo (from ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''), Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], [[The Smurfs]], ALF (from [[ALF: The Animated Series|his short-lived cartoon spinoff]]), [[Garfield]], and the trio of [[Kermit the Frog|Baby Kermit]], [[Miss Piggy|Baby Piggy]], and [[Gonzo the Great|Baby Gonzo]] (from Jim Henson's ''[[Muppet Babies]]''). Animation companies granted unlimited, royalty-free use of their cartoon characters for this project, a feat that has been unequalled before or since then. This cartoon was also introduced by then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Barbara Bush]], and would be distributed to schools and video stores free of charge nationwide.

[[Manga]] artist [[Leiji Matsumoto]] has been known to cross over the characters of his various stories and characters such as ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', ''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'', and ''[[Queen Millennia]]'', all of which were originally written as separate, self-contained stories. In the ''[[Maetel Legend]]'', Queen Promethium is revealed to be having been Yukino Yaoi, the protagonist from ''Queen Millennia''. Matsumoto has also created various crossovers with ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', an anime on which he served as director, although the rights to Yamato are actually owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki.

The adult parody-oriented series ''[[Drawn Together]]'' features many crossovers; while some are regular cameos, such as [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin]] from ''[[Family Guy]]'', others involve a personality twist, such as the [[murder|homicidal]] version of [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]] from [[Bambi|the eponymous film]] or the [[homosexuality|gay]] version of [[Elmer Fudd]] from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' franchise.

The  Disney/Marvel crossover ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]'' features the Marvel heroes [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the Marvel villains [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]], [[MODOK]], [[Red Skull]], and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], and characters from ''Phineas and Ferb'', where the storyline involves Phineas and Ferb trying to restore power to the Marvel heroes, whose powers were taken away by Doofenshmirtz.

During its 26th season, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' has crossovers with ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]''. In the hour-long ''[[Family Guy]]'' season 13 premiere "[[The Simpsons Guy]]", the Griffins meet the Simpson family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/18/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode|title=TV|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who meet the Planet Express crew in the ''Simpsons'' episode "[[Simpsorama]]".&lt;ref name=ewcc&gt;{{cite web|title='The Simpsons' to join forces with 'Futurama' for crossover episode|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/20/the-simpsons-futurama-crossover-epsidoe/|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Disney]] series ''[[House of Mouse]]'', [[Mickey Mouse]] and friends host a nightclub featuring cameos by other Disney characters.

Webtoons (animated shows from the internet) can also have crossovers with different webtoons, franchises, YouTubers and more. Some examples are when Kate from [[TomSka]]'s ''Crash Zoom'' series makes an appearance in ''[[Eddsworld]]'' as a trick or treater who possesses Matt and Edd in the episode, "Trick or Threat". In addition to this a couple of characters from ''Eddsworld'' make appearances in some ''Crash Zoom'' episodes such as "Orcs and Dorks". Another example is ''[[Death Battle]]'' which is a show where two guys (Whiz and Boomstick) put two characters from different franchises together to battle each other. These characters range from television, movie, video game, or comic franchises. Shows like ''One Minute Melee'', ''Cartoon Fight Club'', and ''Death Battle Exhibitions'' (the spinoff series) have a similar format to ''Death Battle''.

===Video games===
{{Main|Fictional crossovers in video games}}''[[Konami]]'' made the first crossover video game featuring [[Simon Belmont]] from ''[[Castlevania]]'', ''[[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'' Picture's ''[[King Kong]]''  and Mikey from the Warner Bros. Movie ''[[The Goonies]]'' in ''[[Konami Wai Wai World]]'' for the Famicom in 1988. ''[[The King of Fighters]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'', and many other franchises from third-party developers such as [[Capcom]] and [[SNK Playmore|SNK]] bring these licenses together.

The [[2.5D]] fighting game series ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' brings various [[Nintendo]] characters together and allows players to fight against each other as these characters in arenas. The third game in the series, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' introduced two third-party characters with the inclusion of [[Solid Snake]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear]]'' series and [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series respectively. The fourth and fifth installments, [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Super Smash Bros. for Wii U'']], feature characters from the third-party franchises of Capcom's ''[[Mega Man]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter]]'', Sega's ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' and ''[[Bayonetta]]'', Bandai Namco's ''[[PAC-MAN|Pac-Man]]'', and Square Enix's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', in addition to other Nintendo characters from the company's different universes.

The [[Namco]]-developed ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series features characters from outside Namco's titles ([[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from Nintendo's ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, [[Heihachi Mishima]] from ''[[Tekken (series)|Tekken]]'', [[Todd McFarlane]]'s [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]], ''[[Star Wars]]'s'' [[Darth Vader]], [[Yoda]] and [[Starkiller]], [[Lloyd Irving]] from ''[[Tales of Symphonia]]'', and [[Ubisoft Montreal]]'s Ezio Auditore from the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series.

''[[Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'', released in Japan two months before ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', was the first time that [[Mario]] and Sonic (as well as their associated characters) appeared in a game together.

In the RPG ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', Disney and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' characters join forces.

''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' are turn-based strategy games featuring a variety of Japanese [[mecha]] series from many generations, such as ''[[Mazinger Z]]'', ''[[Gundam]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', and ''[[GaoGaiGar]]''.

More recently, there has been a collaboration between Capcom and Namco, which results in ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'' and the upcoming ''[[Tekken X Street Fighter]]''.

[[Warriors Orochi]] is the game that crossover about ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' and ''[[Samurai Warriors]]''.

The Disney film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' features many video game character [[cameo appearance]]s.

Perhaps one of the most notable video game crossovers is ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', which makes use of over 30 different franchises, including DC Comics, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', and more.

===Film===
The first film crossover in a series of [[Universal Studios]] monster films was ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', in 1943. In 2003, ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' was released by [[New Line Cinema]]. In 2004, [[20th Century Fox]] released ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' along with the sequel ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' in 2007. One year later, both [[Dollman vs. Demonic Toys]] and ''[[Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys]]'' were released by [[20th Century Fox]] and Terry Kelley Studios. In 2015, [[Sony]] released ''[[Lake Placid vs. Anaconda]]''.

After the comics publishing house [[Marvel Comics]] ventured into [[Marvel Studios#Production|movie production]], they set of to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, while it all lead to the crossover movie ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012). The same process was repeated for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and all the movies together form the crossover film series referred to as the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Inspired by Marvel's success, [[Warner Bros.]], who hold movie rights for [[DC Comics]]' heroes, announced the production of ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) and further plans to develop the cinematic [[DC Extended Universe]], while [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Hasbro Studios|Allspark Pictures]] announced plans to create a cinematic universe on the [[Transformers]] film series.
[[File:KK v G trailer (1962).png|thumb|Battle sequence in [[King Kong vs. Godzilla]] showing the title characters fighting each other.]]
There have been numerous crossovers in Japanese cinema. The boom of [[kaiju]] films saw a lot of crossovers produced at [[Toho Studios]], with some of the monsters forming teams in numerous movies, much like the Marvel movie franchise. [[Godzilla]], [[Mothra]] and [[Rodan]] (Radon) each first appeared in standalone films before being set against each other or even teaming up against stronger enemies. Their first encounter was in 1964, first in ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' and a few months later of all three in ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]''. In 1962 [[Toho Studios|Toho]] released ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]''. The long running [[Zatoichi]] series sees [[Shintaro Katsu]]'s blind master swordsman face of with [[Toshiro Mifune]] in his iconic role in ''[[Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo]]'' (1970) and also features a unique cross-Asian project ''[[Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman]]'' (1971). This coproduction sees [[Jimmy Wang (actor)|Jimmy Wang]] reprise his famous part of the ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]'' while featuring two different endings for both the Japanese and Hong Kong audiences.

===Literature===
In [[literature]], some authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one. [[Kim Newman]] is another author who frequently uses this device, as does [[Stephen King]]. The works of [[James Branch Cabell]], [[J.D. Salinger]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Margaret Laurence]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Mordecai Richler]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[Robert Heinlein]], and [[Isaac Asimov]] also cross over with each other, linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works. Author [[Rick Riordan]] publishes multiple book series featuring gods of ancient civilizations in the modern day, which have had two crossovers and three references to other series. The first popular crossover in literature was the 1885 Mark Twain novel, ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', which had an important guest appearance by [[Tom Sawyer]].

Brazilian writer [[Monteiro Lobato]] also created solid and imaginative crossovers, using elements and characters from Brazilian folklore such as the [[Cuca (folklore)|Cuca]] and [[Saci (Brazilian folklore)|Saci]], from [[Greek mythology]], from the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', from fairy tales such as Grimm's "[[Snow White]]", Western literature such as [[Peter Pan]], cartoons such as ''[[Popeye]]'' and ''[[Felix the Cat]]'', and Western films.

===Public domain===
It is also common for authors to 'crossover' characters who have passed into the public domain, and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use in other works. ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] is another example of this, as all of the main characters and most of the secondary / background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired, and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe. Many of the works of [[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton family]] sequences (which has also been explored and developed by other authors) also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them (such as a blood-relationship between [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Tarzan]]). [[Roger Zelazny]]'s novel ''[[A Night in the Lonesome October]]'' combines Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, and the Cthulhu Mythos, although he never specifically identifies them as such ("The Count", "The Good Doctor", "Jack", etc.).

Occasionally, authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors (or at least their estates), but who are nevertheless considered iconic or 'mythic' enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named (thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder). A prominent example occurs within ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One]]'', wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr. [[Fu Manchu]] appears as a significant villain; however, as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator [[Sax Rohmer]], he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as 'the Devil Doctor'. Something similar occurs in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', wherein a character named "[[List of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen characters#Jimmy Bond|Jimmy]]" is clearly intended to be [[Ian Fleming]]'s character [[James Bond]], though here he is satirized as being an inept and unfavorable antagonist, likely to parody [[Sean Connery]]'s appearance in the 2003 [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|film adaptation]]. Another example in ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' is when a character is named to be the Anti-Christ, yet, despite never being named, is shown to be an evil [[Harry Potter]].

The TV show ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' is set in a world in which all [[fairy tales]] coexist, including [[Snow White]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], and even [[Alice in Wonderland]]. (As a production of [[The Walt Disney Company]], copyrighted elements from that company's productions have appeared in ''Once Upon a Time''.) The [[Shrek (film series)|''Shrek'']] film series is built on the same concept, and even includes references to then-copyrighted elements like [[Peter Pan]] (often in the form of [[satire]]).

===Television series===

One of the earlier instances of crossovers in TV productions outside the US is the episode ''Unter Brüdern'' (1990), which was produced by [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] and [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk|DFF]] as a crossover between the [[West Germany|West German]] crime series ''[[Tatort]]'' and the [[East Germany|East German]] crime series ''[[Polizeiruf 110]]''. Their respective popular heroes [[Horst Schimanski]] and Peter Fuchs join forces to solve a case in the turmoil of the time after the [[Berlin Wall#The fall|fall of the Berlin Wall]]. The episode was produced during the short transition period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. 

====Between established shows====
Crossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship, but are related by time period, locale or profession. The ''Law and Order'' series, for example, afford a commonality of setting and profession which lends itself to crossovers, both within the franchise and in a wider universe. ''Law &amp; Order: SVU'' has crossed over several times with ''Chicago P.D.'' and ''Chicago Fire'', as well as sharing a common character with ''Homicide: Life on the Street''. ''NCIS'' has crossed over with ''NCIS: Los Angeles'', ''NCIS: New Orleans'' and ''JAG'', while ''NCIS: Los Angeles'' has crossed over with both ''Scorpion'' and ''Hawaii Five-0''. Following the cancellation of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and its high rated finale, several characters crossed over into the network's remaining soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'', remaining in the same timeline as their former show.

The ''CSI'' franchise is another common example of the crossover phenomena, with the original series crossing over with ''CSI: Miami'', ''CSI: Cyber'', ''CSI: NY'' and ''Without a Trace''. ''CSI: NY'' crossed over with fellow CBS series ''Cold Case'', and [[Ted Danson]] appeared as a regular on both ''CSI'' and ''Cyber''. Similarly, ''[[Family Guy]]'' has crossed over with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', while ''The Simpsons'' has crossed over with ''[[The X-Files]]''. ''The X-Files'' has in turn crossed over with ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[The Lone Gunmen]]'' and ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]''. A proposed crossover with ''[[The West Wing]]'' was planned, but was never produced.

There was also an ongoing use of crossover characters between ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'',  ''[[Green Acres]]'', and  ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''.

=====Between related shows=====
Though most common on shows of the same [[production company]] (see, for example, "[[Hurricane Saturday]]"), crossovers have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or [[television network]]. A notable example of this kind of link is that between ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' and ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' These shows were made by different companies, but owned by [[Universal Studios]] and broadcast on [[CBS]]. Another case is that of ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', which share the character of [[List of  Friends characters#Ursula Pamela Buffay|Ursula Buffay]]. Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality, but rather an actress ([[Lisa Kudrow]]), a setting ([[New York City]]) and a schedule (''Friends'' initially followed ''Mad About You'' on [[NBC]]'s [[Must See TV|Thursday night schedule]]).

''Mad About You'' and ''Friends'' share another type of "network crossover". On rare occasions, networks have chosen to theme an entire night's programming around a crossover "event". In one case, a New York City [[Power outage|blackout]] caused by [[Paul Reiser]]'s character on ''Mad About You'' was experienced by the characters on ''Friends'' and ''[[Madman of the People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epguides.com/MadAboutYou/season3.shtml epguides.com listing for ''Pandora's Box'', the episode which kicked off "Blackout Thursday" on NBC.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012135515/http://epguides.com/MadAboutYou/season3.shtml |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such "event nights" can also be linked by a single character's quest across multiple shows on the same evening. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] attempted this kind of "event night" crossover with its [[TGIF (ABC)|Friday night programming]] during the 1997 season. There, they proposed that the title character of ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' should chase her cat, [[Salem Saberhagen|Salem]], through ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', ''[[You Wish (TV series)|You Wish]]'' and ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]'' because it had run away with a "time ball" that was displacing each show through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poobala.com/timeball.html|title=Crossover Event: "The Time Ball"|work=poobala.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC also attempted a "crossover" when four of its sitcoms (''[[Grace Under Fire]]'', ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' and ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'') all went to [[Las Vegas]] during the 1996–1997 season.

[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]] used the show he was producing ''[[Zoey 101]]'' to promote his new show ''[[iCarly]]'' by making characters from ''Zoey 101'' go to ''ICarly.com'' or use the song "Leave It All To Me", the iCarly theme song, as a ringtone. A ''[[Henry Danger]]'' comic book and Gibby's wax head is seen in the ''[[Game Shakers]]'' episode "Lost Jacket, Falling Pigeons", the subway station's lost and found.

=====Narrative rationales=====
On other occasions, crossovers between established shows can occur without a network or production commonality, but simply because there is some narrative rationale for the crossover. The appearance of detective [[John Munch]] (from NBC's ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'') on Fox's ''The X-Files'' happened merely because the episode revolved around a crime scene in Baltimore, a logical place for characters on ''The X-Files'' to have encountered Munch. Munch would also appear on the TV series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' on NBC in which it had one episode which began on that series in New York City and concluded in Baltimore on ''Homicide: Life on the Street''. Later, when ''Homicide'' went off the air in 1999, Detective Munch ends up leaving Baltimore to move to New York, and becoming a permanent character (as New York City Detective Munch) on NBC's ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' until October 2013.

A two-part crossover episode between ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' with ''[[Without a Trace]]'' aired on November 8, 2007. The first hour was on ''CSI'' and the second hour was on ''Without a Trace''.&lt;ref name="crossover-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csifanatic.com/2007/07/31/a-csi-without-a-trace-crossover|title=A CSI Without a Trace Crossover|work=CSIfanatic.com|accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both series are on the same network in the United States, spreading two parts of a story across two different shows can cause problems in international markets where they have been separately sold to different broadcasters. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Without a Trace'' was shown on [[Channel 4]] and ''CSI'' on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], meaning the two companies had to come to a special agreement to show both episodes.&lt;ref name="crossover-2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/13/tvratings.television|title=CSI Vegas gamble pays off for Five|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-02-12|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|date=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''CSI'' crossover occurred in 2009 when [[Raymond Langston]] from ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' appeared both in ''[[CSI: Miami]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Bone Voyage| episodelink = Bone Voyage| series = CSI: Miami| serieslink = CSI: Miami| airdate = November 9, 2009| season = 8| number = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[CSI: NY]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Hammer Down| episodelink = Hammer Down| series = CSI: NY| serieslink = CSI: NY| airdate = November 11, 2009| season = 6| number = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; traveling to Miami and New York to track a human trafficking and organ harvesting ring. ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' had a crossover with ''[[Third Watch]]'' which corresponded with a peak in viewership for the latter show, with 17.2 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/22810|title=4 Memorable TV Crossovers|work=Mental Floss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Canadian crime drama series ''[[Republic of Doyle]]'' and ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]]'' produced a crossover,&lt;ref name=doylemurdoch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/11/25/stinson-celebrating-the-can-combo-of-republic-of-doyle-and-murdoch-mysteries/|title=Celebrating the Can-combo of Republic of Doyle and Murdoch Mysteries|work=[[National Post]]|date=November 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131212035932/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/11/25/stinson-celebrating-the-can-combo-of-republic-of-doyle-and-murdoch-mysteries/|archivedate=December 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was complicated by the shows' incompatible historical settings; ''Murdoch Mysteries'' is a historical series set in the 1890s, while ''Republic of Doyle'' is set in the present day. The problem was solved by having the actors cross over as ''relatives'' of their primary characters; [[Allan Hawco]] appeared on the November 25, 2013 episode of ''Murdoch Mysteries'' as Jacob Doyle, a 19th-century ancestor of his regular character Jake Doyle, while [[Yannick Bisson]] appeared on a January 2014 episode of ''Republic of Doyle'' as Bill Murdoch, a 21st-century descendant of his regular character William Murdoch.&lt;ref name=doylemurdoch /&gt;

=====In children's television=====
Disney Channel's ''Suite Life'' franchise has featured three crossovers: In 2006, ''[[That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana]]'' featured characters from ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[That's So Raven]]'' taking a vacation at the Tipton Hotel (the main setting of ''[[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]''); [[Hannah Montana (character)|Hannah Montana]]/[[Miley Stewart]] ([[Miley Cyrus]]) also eats cake off Zack, which recurs in the 2009 crossover ''[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana]]'', in which characters from ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'' and ''Hannah Montana'' come on aboard the S.S. Tipton. In 2015 a crossover between two Disney XD shows ''[[Lab Rats: Bionic Island]]'' and ''[[Mighty Med]]'' crossed over in the special "[[Lab Rats vs. Mighty Med]]".

Another type of crossover involves characters from an off the air series resurfacing in a newer series. This occurred in a 2010 episode of the [[Nickelodeon]] sitcom ''[[iCarly]]''; the episode "iStart a Fan War" featured recurring characters from two Nickelodeon series: ''[[Drake &amp; Josh]]'' characters Eric Blonowitz, Craig Ramirez, Gavin Mitchell, and ''[[Zoey 101]]'' character Stacey Dillsen. A crossover between ''[[Victorious]]'' and ''Drake &amp; Josh'' also occurred, with Helen DuBois, portrayed by [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] making an appearance. An episode titled "[[iParty with Victorious]]" was a crossover between ''iCarly'' and ''Victorious''. This means all 4 shows exist in the same universe. However, in ''Who Did It to Trina'', Tori referred to ''Drake and Josh'' as a TV show, making it seem as if the previous appearance was an actor of a character from a show within a show. Also in multiple episodes from ''iCarly'' and ''[[Sam &amp; Cat]]'' (a crossover/spin-off of ''iCarly'' And ''Victorious'') one can see ''Drake and Josh'' and ''Zoey 101'' in TV guides, when the characters are watching TV. Carly and Spencer were heard watching it in the ''iCarly'' episode ''iGet Pranky'' and Carly is seen looking at it briefly in ''iToe Fat Cakes'' and you can see the character Megan from ''Drake and Josh'' (also portrayed by [[Miranda Cosgrove]]) and Sam is seen changing the channel to it in ''#FavoriteShow'' an episode from ''Sam &amp; Cat'', making the universe between each of the shows confusing. However, these were probably all non-canonical references.

In 2014, ''[[The Thundermans]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Hathaways]]'' did a crossover, called "The Haunted Thundermans". In 2016, ''[[Henry Danger]]'' and ''The Thundermans'' did a crossover, called "Danger &amp; Thunder". In 2017, ''Henry Danger'' and ''Game Shakers'' did a crossover, called "Danger Games", which was then followed by a crossover episode, called "Babe Loves Danger", that aired in 2018. In 2017, ''Game Shakers'' did a crossover with ''iCarly'', called "Game Shippers".

The main characters of ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'' make a crossover appearance in the ''[[Rugrats]]'' episode, "[[Ghost Story (Rugrats)|Ghost Story]]". This is because both shows were created/produced by [[Klasky Csupo]] and distributed also by Nickelodeon{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

In [[Chile]], children's programs and characters from [[El Mundo del Profesor Rossa]] ([[Spanish Language|Spanish]] for ''The World of Professor Rossa'') and [[Cachureos]] ([[Spanish Language|Chilean Spanish]] for ''odds and ends'') conducted a crossover between them for a few minutes in their emissions of Saturday 18 (Mundo del Profesor Rossa) and Sunday 19 (Cachureos) of April 1998 due the debut of the latter program on [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]], after several years of broadcast on [[Televisión Nacional de Chile|TVN]] and even have competed with each other for the child audience.

====Special usages====

=====Promotional cameos=====
Crossovers can take the form of a promotional [[cameo appearance]], used to draw attention to another work of fiction, with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show's narrative. When not clearly presented as parody, this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism. A notable example of this is ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[A Star Is Burns]]'', in which the character of Jay Sherman (from ''[[The Critic]]'') appeared. It originally aired on March 5, 1995 on FOX right before ''The Critic'' began its second season, its first season having aired on ABC. This episode was largely condemned by fans of ''The Simpsons'' as existing to promote ''The Critic'', an animated series considered inferior by comparison. Even ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] objected, preferring to remove his name from the credits of that particular episode in protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F31.html Various reactions, including Matt Groening's, to ''A Star Is Burns''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810215843/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F31.html |date=2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Dan Tanna (played by Robert Urich) from the detective series ''[[Vega$]]'' appeared in an episode of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' ("Angels in Vegas") one week prior to the debut of ''Vega$''. However, it is not considered a spin-off because Dan Tanna  was introduced in the pilot that was aired as an ''ABC TV Movie of the Week'' on the evening of Tuesday, April 25, 1978. The crossover was simply used to reintroduce the Dan Tanna character and to promote the debut of ''Vega$'' as an ongoing series. Additionally, the cast of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' appeared in the fourth season premier of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' ("Love Boat Angels").

In 2010, as a nod to the 50th anniversary of ''[[Coronation Street]]'', characters in fellow established TV soap ''[[EastEnders]]'' made reference to watching the special anniversary episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1388625_review_coronation_street_live_drama_was_so_gripping_even_dot_cotton_tuned_in |title=Review: Coronation Street live drama was so gripping, even Dot Cotton tuned in - Manchester Evening News |publisher=Menmedia.co.uk |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; EastEnders had celebrated its own 25th anniversary earlier in the same year.

The two [[CBS Daytime]] game shows (''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'') are used for promotional cameos from other CBS properties.  Promotional cameos from the two daytime dramas, primetime shows (including primetime airings), and sports properties are common.  ''Price'' has been used to promote anniversaries of CBS daytime dramas, the ''NCIS'' franchise, the three reality shows, and [[NFL on CBS|CBS Sports' coverage of the NFL]].

====Spin-offs====
{{See also|List of television spin-offs}}
In its simplest and most common form, a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] or vice versa because of established character relationships. An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when [[Cliff Huxtable]] of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' visited his daughter, [[Denise Huxtable|Denise]], on ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]''. Another example of this is ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', which was a spin-off from ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. [[Jaime Sommers (The Bionic Woman)|Jaime Sommers]] was a tennis pro who was nearly killed in a [[Parachuting|skydiving]] accident, but her life was saved by [[Oscar Goldman]] ([[Richard Anderson]]) and Dr. Rudy Wells ([[Martin E. Brooks]]) who surgically implanted her with bionic parts similar to those of [[Steve Austin (fictional character)|Steve Austin]]. Steve Austin and Jaimie Sommers often crossovered, while the characters Oscar Goldman and Rudy Wells appeared regularly in both shows. Another example would be the appearances made by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' characters to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' in [[Los Angeles]] from [[Sunnydale]]; in a striking example, "[[Fool for Love (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Fool for Love]]" and "[[Darla (Angel episode)|Darla]]", shown on the same night, contain overlapping flashbacks as remembered by [[Spike (vampire)|Spike]] and [[Darla (vampire)|Darla]] respectively. There is also ''[[Frasier]]'', which features characters from the first show, ''[[Cheers]]''. Similarly, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' characters [[J. R. Ewing]], [[Bobby Ewing]], [[Lucy Ewing]] and [[Kristin Shepard]] all appeared in its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]'' while ''Knots Landing'' characters [[Gary Ewing]] and [[Valene Ewing]] each made several appearances on ''Dallas'' after ''Knots Landing'' premiered.

More complex multi-production franchises can utilize crossovers of characters to serve as a device in establishing continuity in a shared fictional universe. This crossover is common in the [[Star Trek crossovers|''Star Trek'' universe]], where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones. A good example of this crossover is that of the [[Klingon]]s [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]] (from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episode "[[Errand of Mercy]]"), [[Koloth]] (from "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]") and [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]] (from "[[Day of the Dove]]"). After the passage of about a century of narrative time, the three onetime adversaries of [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] appeared together in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode, "[[Blood Oath (DS9 episode)|Blood Oath]]" – as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between, the former villains are now portrayed as heroes. Another Klingon, [[Arne Darvin]], appeared as a secondary character in "The Trouble with Tribbles", but was the principal villain of DS9's "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]". Intended as a celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary, "Trials and Tribble-ations" was actually a crossover in and of itself; using then brand-new [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] techniques, the episode places the DS9 cast (after hijacking the ''[[USS Defiant|Defiant]]'', Darvin had gone back in time hoping to kill Kirk and become a hero to the Klingons, and it's up to [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] and his comrades to stop Darvin and preserve the timeline) inside the TOS episode, interacting with [[James T. Kirk]], [[Spock]] and the rest of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' crew.

The distinction between "spin-off" and "crossover" is sometimes narrow. The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance. There is debate, for instance over whether ''[[Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)|Out of the Blue]]'' is a spin-off of ''[[Happy Days]]'', or whether the star of ''Out of the Blue'' merely crossed over into ''Happy Days''.

''[[Mako: Island of Secrets|Mako Mermaids]]'', a spinoff of ''[[H2O: Just Add Water]]'', featured a guest appearance by Rikki Chadwick, a main character from the former series, in its final two episodes, thus confirming that the spin off-acts as a sequel rather than a prequel or alternative storyline as many fans suspected.

=====Parodic crossovers=====
Often, the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome. Such difficulties are encountered by [[situation comedies]] that wish to crossover with [[television drama|dramatic television]] programs. The satirical crossover—ranging in length from a cameo to a full [[sketch comedy|comedy sketch]] or episode—is an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem. By various means, such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious [[parody]] or [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. However, on rare occasion, the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a [[narrative]] point by capitalizing on the audience's experience of the other program.

Such [[tongue-in-cheek]] crossovers typically fall into one of several broad categories.
* Parodic crossovers can be directly established as being outside the continuity of one or all of the properties being crossed over. A good example is the crossover between ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', which was largely accepted as being outside standard ''X-Files'' continuity.
* One episode of ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy]]'' shows that after Mandy smiles, she, along with Billy and Grim, are transformed into [[The Powerpuff Girls]] with a cameo by Professor Utonium.
* They can occur by virtue of a [[dream sequence]], in which the characters of one show will appear as part of a dream had by a character on another show. This method was perhaps used most famously to explain to audiences that the entirety of ''[[Newhart]]'' had been the dream of [[Bob Newhart]]'s character on ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''. It has more recently been used to demonstrate that cast members of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' appeared in a dream of a character on ''[[The King of Queens]]''.
* Parodic crossovers can take the form of "[[joke|gag]]" cameos by characters of one property appearing on another. Characters from ''[[King of the Hill (TV series)|King of the Hill]]'' have appeared on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' to comment on a peewee football game. Gag cameos may also include the appearance of an actor from another show, but not necessarily the character that the actor played. For instance, on the ABC/CBS show ''[[Family Matters (TV series)|Family Matters]]'' during the closing credits of the episode "Scenes From a Mall" (Season 5, Episode 12), a scene which was shown earlier in the episode featuring [[Reginald VelJohnson]] is re-played, but this time with one of the child actors stating that he "looks like that fat guy from Fresh Prince," referring to [[James L. Avery, Sr.|James Avery]] who played Judge Phillip Banks on NBC's ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. To the obvious surprise of the studio audience and VelJohnson, Avery walked onto the set with an angry look, being in on the staged joke himself. Ended the episode (but with the cameras filming still), VelJohnson and Avery hugged and smilingly greeted the public.
* Crossovers of this type can also be completely wordless. This type of crossover is more common on animated programs, such as when [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] found and ate [[Bart Simpson]]'s shorts on ''[[Futurama]]'', or [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] had a talking Bender doll on ''The Simpsons''. This would seem to be another case when a popular franchise is acknowledged as fiction and not a crossover of the stories.
* Perhaps the most obvious parodic crossover is found when characters from two series interact outside ''either'' series. This occurs most commonly on a [[sketch comedy]] show or as a humorous interlude on an award telecast. Such crossovers may sometimes involve the real actors—for example, a sketch on ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' saw Yasir and Sarah from ''[[Little Mosque on the Prairie]]'' buying the gas station from ''[[Corner Gas]]'', with many of the characters in the sketch being portrayed by the shows' real actors—although they may also feature one genuine star from the show amid a cast comprised otherwise of the sketch show's own stable of actors. Such crossovers are generally immediately apparent as parodies to the audience—and in no way considered a part of either show's continuity—due to the need for the hosting show to approximate the sets and costumes of the satirized programs quickly and inexpensively. When [[Patrick Stewart]] appeared in a ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''/''[[The Love Boat]]'' crossover on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', for instance, few ''Star Trek'' fans would have been fooled by the visual design into believing the event "counted" as an episode of the show. However, there are some cases of this type of parody having some [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] resonance with viewers. For instance, the British charity appeal [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] often contains parodic crossovers of a technically higher quality than the typical sketch show. Many of these ''Relief'' sketches are produced by the cast and crew of the actual programs being parodied, and hence appear to be "normal" episodes. A good example of this is the sketch, "BallyKissDibley", an 11-minute piece in which the leads of ''[[Ballykissangel]]'' appeared on the sets of  ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', alongside most of ''Dibley''{{'}}s cast. Since the sketch derived its humor from all actors remaining in character, the extent to which these parodies "count" as part of either show's canon is more open to interpretation than most sketch crossovers.
* Parodic crossovers can be used to lend [[verisimilitude]] to the fictional world of a program. Characters from a fictional television series may appear on a stylized version of an established non-fictional television series, such as [[game show]]s or [[reality show]]s. These crossovers between celebrity hosts and fictional characters are quite common on [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. ''[[Mama's Family]]'' once appeared on ''[[Family Feud]]'' and the townsfolk of ''The Vicar of Dibley'' have had their [[heirloom]]s valuated on ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', for instance. In such cases, it is generally the non-fictional show which ends up being the most satirized, due to a need to compress the experience to its most recognizable elements. However, these crossovers can happen on dramatic television, such as when ''[[Blue Peter]]'' provided [[Exposition (literary technique)|narrative exposition]] on ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''. Rarely, brief crossovers between two fictional programs can be used for this same purpose. In the episode, "[[Army of Ghosts]]", [[Peggy Mitchell]] was seen in a fictionalized scene from ''[[EastEnders]]'' in order to demonstrate the degree to which the titular ghosts had permeated the popular culture of ''[[Doctor Who]]''{{'}}s [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Here, too, time constraints caused the satire of the guest programme (''EastEnders'') and not the host program (''Doctor Who'').

=====Retroactive crossovers=====
Sometimes, crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them. Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers. These sorts of crossovers involve no creation of additional material, but merely result from inferences drawn about existing filmed episodes. Usually they are a product of narrative ambiguity. Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''. One interpretation of the ending scene of the final episode has been that the entire run of the program was a figment of [[autism|autistic]] character Tommy Westphall's imagination. This leads itself to a broad interpretation of the events of that series. Because the show had direct crossovers with twelve different programmes, and each one of these twelve had numerous ''other'' crossovers, linkages can be found from ''Elsewhere'' to 280 other shows, comprising what has been called "the [[Tommy Westphall Universe]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Unofficial crossovers==
In contrast with legal crossovers, unofficial crossovers are created solely because of the artistic pleasure derived by its producers. Generally, unofficial crossovers take the form of [[Fanfiction|fan-written fiction]] and [[fan art]], but it is increasingly prevalent in [[fan film|amateur films]] and [[radio drama|audio]]. Whereas official crossovers are frequently stymied by such concerns as copyright, royalties payments, quality of writing and ownership of the characters, unofficial crossovers are unfettered by such concerns, so long as property holders do not exercise their right to [[injunction|enjoin]] the distribution of such material.

A good example would be the unauthorised live action fan film ''[[Batman: Dead End]]'', which brings together the properties of ''Batman'', ''[[Alien (film series)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' in one setting.

Unofficial crossovers can also occur in a "what-if" scenario.  [[Roger (American Dad)|Roger]] makes frequent cameo appearances in ''Family Guy'', while [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] makes cameos on ''American Dad!''. Roger, [[Rallo Tubbs]], and [[Klaus Heissler]] were seen in the final ''Family Guy'' ''Star Wars'' spoof, "[[It's A Trap!]]", as an Imperial Officer, [[Nien Nunb]], and [[Admiral Ackbar]], respectively. Stewie also appears as an interactive hallucination of Booth on ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' when the agent has issues over possibly becoming a sperm donor, with David Boreanaz (who plays Booth) repaying the favor in "[[Road to the North Pole]]".
An appearance by [[Elmo]], from [[Sesame Street]], was made, in a hallucination of [[Connie Ray]]'s, on TV sitcom [[The Torkelsons]].
Fan fiction fusions between different science fiction movies and series are often created, such as ''Star Wars'' vs. ''Star Trek'' or ''Babylon 5'' vs. ''Stargate''. ''[[M.U.G.E.N.]]'' is a fighting game engine that features many fan-created and fictional characters and stages from various television series, movies, as well as other video games.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25615">The 2009 '''DARPA Network Challenge''' was a prize competition for exploring the roles the [[Internet]] and [[social networking]] play in the real-time communications, wide-area [[collaboration]]s, and practical actions required to solve broad-scope, time-critical problems. The competition was sponsored by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), a research organization of the [[United States]] [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The challenge was designed to help the military generate ideas for operating under a range of circumstances, such as natural disasters.&lt;ref name="cnnref"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-12-05/tech/darpa.balloon.challenge_1_balloons-darpa-invited?_s=PM:TECH |title=MIT wins $40,000 prize in nationwide balloon-hunt contest |accessdate=2012-02-21 |publisher=CNN |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120213614/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-12-05/tech/darpa.balloon.challenge_1_balloons-darpa-invited?_s=PM%3ATECH |archivedate=2012-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized DARPA to award cash prizes to further DARPA's mission to sponsor revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their use for national security.

In the competition, teams had to locate ten red balloons placed around the United States and then report their findings to DARPA. Due to the distributed nature of the contest, many teams used online resources, such as social media sites, to gather information or to recruit people that would look for balloons. Teams often had to deal with false submissions, and so they needed to come up with ways to validate and confirm reported sightings. The contest was concluded in under nine hours, much less than expected by DARPA, and had many implications with regards to the power of online social networking and crowdsourcing in general.&lt;ref name="MIT red"&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Red Balloon Team Wins DARPA Network Challenge |url=https://networkchallenge.darpa.mil/darpanetworkchallengewinner2009.pdf |publisher=DARPA |accessdate=2009-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111082411/https://networkchallenge.darpa.mil/darpanetworkchallengewinner2009.pdf |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specifics of the competition ==
Under the rules of the competition, the $40,000 challenge award would be granted to the first team to submit the locations of 10 moored, 8-foot, red weather balloons at 10 previously undisclosed fixed locations in the continental United States. The balloons were to be placed in readily accessible locations visible from nearby roads. The balloons were deployed at 10:00 AM Eastern Time on December 5, 2009, and scheduled to be taken down at 5:00 PM. DARPA was prepared to deploy them for a second day and wait for up to a week for a team to find all of the balloons.

Part of the purpose of the challenge was to force participants to discern actual pertinent information from potential noise. Many teams came across false reports of sightings, both accidental and purposeful. One valid strategy was spamming social networks with false reports to throw competitors off the trail of real sightings. The verification of balloon sightings was paramount to success.

The contest was announced only about a month before the start date. This limited the amount of time teams had to prepare. The ability of many to do so showed the effectiveness of mass and social media to distribute information and organize people quickly.&lt;ref name="reflecting"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=John C. Tang |author2=Manuel Cebrian |author3=Nicklaus A. Giacobe |author4=Hyun-Woo Kim |author5=Taemie Kim |author6=Douglas "Beaker" Wickert | title=Reflecting on the DARPA Red Balloon Challenge| journal=Communications of the ACM | year=2011| volume=54| issue=4| pages=78–85| url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/4/106587-reflecting-on-the-darpa-red-balloon-challenge/fulltext| doi=10.1145/1924421.1924441}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time in which information about the challenge spread was actually more compressed than a month.  However, in the week preceding the launch day the official competition site increased in traffic from an average of 1,000 hits per day to 20,000 hits per day. Similarly, the efforts of many competing teams went viral in the last few days before the start date.&lt;ref name="projectreport"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=17522|title=DARPA Network Challenge Project Report|accessdate=2012-03-03|author=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA selected the date of the competition to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the [[Internet]].

==Results==
Even though DARPA was prepared to deploy the balloons for a second day and accept submissions for up to a week until a team found all 10 balloons, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Red Balloon Challenge Team won the competition in under 9 hours.&lt;ref name="MIT red" /&gt; A team from the [[GTRI|Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI)]], which located nine balloons, won second place. Two other teams found eight balloons, five found seven, and the iSchools team (which represented [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[Syracuse University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]), whose strategy is described below, finished tenth with six balloons.&lt;ref name="reflecting" /&gt; In table form, the top ten teams were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DARPA Network Challenge Final Standings |url=https://networkchallenge.darpa.mil/FinalStandings.pdf |publisher=DARPA |accessdate=2010-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111082420/https://networkchallenge.darpa.mil/FinalStandings.pdf |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winning strategy==
The winning MIT team used a technique similar to [[multi-level marketing]] to recruit participants, with the prize money to be distributed up the chain of participants leading to successful balloon spottings, and all prize income remaining after distribution to participants to be given to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balloon.mit.edu/mit/payoff/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111214144/http://balloon.mit.edu/mit/payoff/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-01-11 |title=How It Works |publisher=MIT Red Balloon Challenge Team |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team's strategy for public collaboration in finding the balloons was explained on their website:

{{quote|We're giving $2000 per balloon to the first person to send us the correct coordinates, but that's not all -- we're also giving $1000 to the person who invited them. Then we're giving $500 whoever invited the inviter, and $250 to whoever invited them, and so on&amp;nbsp;... (see how it works).
It might play out like this. Alice joins the team, and we give her an invite link like http://balloon.media.mit.edu/alice. Alice then e-mails her link to Bob, who uses it to join the team as well. We make a http://balloon.media.mit.edu/bob link for Bob, who posts it to Facebook. His friend Carol sees it, signs up, then twitters about http://balloon.media.mit.edu/carol. Dave uses Carol's link to join&amp;nbsp;... then spots one of the DARPA balloons! Dave is the first person to report the balloon's location to us, and the MIT Red Balloon Challenge Team is the first to find all 10. Once that happens, we send Dave $2000 for finding the balloon. Carol gets $1000 for inviting Dave, Bob gets $500 for inviting Carol, and Alice gets $250 for inviting Bob. The remaining $250 is donated to charity.}}

The strategy was a variant of the Query Incentive Network model of Kleinberg and Raghavan,&lt;ref name="query"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Kleinberg |author2=P. Raghavan | title=Query Incentive Networks| journal=Proceedings of 46th Annual IEEE Symposium on FOCS| year=2005| pages=132–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the main difference being that the incentive rewards in the team's technique scale down for later participants.&lt;ref name="science"/&gt; The recursive nature of the reward had two beneficial effects. First, participants had an incentive to involve others, as these new people would not become competitors for the reward but rather cooperating partners. Second, people not located in the United States were motivated to participate by passing along information even though they had no way of locating a balloon in person. This helped the team garner a large number (over 5,000) of participants.&lt;ref name="reflecting"/&gt; The team only began with four initial participants.&lt;ref name="projectreport"/&gt;

To determine whether submissions were legitimate or fake, the team employed at least three strategies. The first strategy was examining whether there were multiple submissions for a location. If this was the case, then the likelihood of a balloon actually being there was thought to be higher. A second strategy was to check whether the IP address of the submitter matched the supposed location of the balloon. A third strategy was to examine photos accompanying the submission. Real photos included a DARPA employee and a DARPA banner, details which were not announced, while faked ones did not.&lt;ref name="reflecting" /&gt;

A detailed analysis of the winning strategy highlighted the important role that social media played. Analysis of Twitter data showed that while some teams relied on large initial bursts of activity over Twitter, mentions of those teams quickly faded. It was argued that due to the recursive incentive structure, the MIT team was able to create a more sustained social media impact than most teams.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Galen Pickard |author2=Wei Pan |author3=Iyad Rahwan |author4=Manuel Cebrian |author5=Riley Crane |author6=Anmol Madan |author7=Alex Pentland | title=Time-Critical Social Mobilization| journal=Science | year=2011| volume=334| issue=6055| pages=509–512| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6055/509| doi=10.1126/science.1205869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second-place strategy ==
The second-place GTRI team used a strategy that relied heavily on Internet publicity and social media. They created a Web site three weeks before the launch day and used a variety of media-related efforts, including a [[Facebook]] group, in order to increase the visibility of the team and increase the chance that people who spotted the balloons would report the sightings to them.

The team promised to donate all winnings to charity to appeal to the altruism of participants. However, due to the lack of a structure that created much incentive as the winning MIT team's scheme, their network of participants grew to only about 1,400 people.

With regards to validating submissions, the team assumed that because of the charitable nature of their effort, the number of false submissions would be low. In any case, they primarily relied on personal validation, having phone conversations with submitters.&lt;ref name="reflecting" /&gt;

==Tenth-place strategy==
The tenth-place iSchools team, which represented five universities, tried two distinct approaches. The first was directly recruiting team members to look for the balloons on launch day. These members included students, faculty, and alumni on official mailing lists and social media website groups for organizations on the team (e.g., [[Pennsylvania State University]]). Only a few of these observers actually participated, however, and only one balloon was found using this strategy.

The second strategy was using [[open-source intelligence]] methods to do cyberspace searching for results related to the challenge. This was the main source of their success in locating balloons. This strategy, in turn, consisted of two distinct sub-strategies. The first was to use a group of human analysts who would manually search online on a variety of information sources, including [[Twitter]] and the websites of competing teams, compile reported sightings, and then evaluate the validity of sightings based on the reputation of the sources.

Another strategy relating to cyberspace searching that the team used was an automated [[Web crawler]] which captured data from Twitter and opposing teams' websites and then analyzed it. This technology worked slowly and would have benefited from a longer contest duration, but the Twitter crawler proved to be especially useful because tweets sometimes contained geographic information.

To confirm the validity of possible sightings, recruited team members were used when possible. If none were available, new observers were recruited from organizations located near the sighting. The distributed location of the different organizations in the team allowed this to be a feasible strategy. Photographic analysis was used to confirm or dispute the validity of claims.

The team also encountered a case of another team accidentally leaking information about a sighting and then trying to cover it up. The iSchools team used a variety of information sources, including social networks, to determine what the real location was. This demonstrated the possibility of using information from a wide variety of public websites to determine the validity of something.&lt;ref name="reflecting" /&gt;

== Other strategies ==
Prior to the competition numerous people had discussed possible strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Adrian Hon |title=How to Win the DARPA Network Challenge | url=http://mssv.net/2009/10/31/how-to-win-the-darpa-network-challenge/ |publisher=Mssv |date=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[satellite photography]], [[aerial photography]] and [[crowdsourcing]] to detect balloons, as well as the possibility of [[misinformation]] campaigns to stop other teams from winning. In the actual competition, there was a variety of strategies employed by teams.

One team leader, Jason Brindel of [[San Rafael, California]], organized a team of around 140 people.&lt;ref name="Nationwide balloon-hunt contest"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Doug |title=Nationwide balloon-hunt contest tests online networking |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-12-04/tech/darpa.balloon.challenge_1_social-networking-balloons-hunt?_s=PM:TECH |work=CNN |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301014555/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-12-04/tech/darpa.balloon.challenge_1_social-networking-balloons-hunt?_s=PM%3ATECH |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His plan was to create a web site and Twitter account dedicated to the challenge that would allow his team members to communicate their findings. Anyone participating in the challenge would be allowed to submit information, provided that they included details confirming about their submission. Brindel planned to have the team scour the Internet for mentions of balloons across news sites, blogs, and social media sites.

[[George Hotz]], a Twitter celebrity now famous for hacking the [[PlayStation 3]] and settling a suit by [[Sony]], only prepared for the competition for an hour before posting a tweet an hour before the start of the competition. Hotz was able to locate 8 balloons successfully. Four were found within his Twitter network of almost 50,000 followers, and four were acquired through trades of information with other teams.&lt;ref name="projectreport"/&gt;

The fifth-place finisher, the [[Geocaching|Groundspeak Geocachers]], deployed active geocachers and Groundspeak employees to search for balloons. They were successful in finding eight balloons, but due to a data entry error, were only credited with seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10balloonies.com/ |title=10 Balloonies - Groundspeak's DARPA War Room |publisher=Groundspeak |date=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team calling themselves [[Nerdfighters]] utilized their existing network of followers from the [[Brotherhood 2.0]] [[vlog]] to launch a viral video before the competition. They managed to attract 2,000 active balloon seekers. They also utilized 3,000 Nerdfighters who scanned for Internet traffic related to the competition and specialized in launching a misinformation campaign, hoping to confuse or misdirect other teams. They also created a network of cell phone users to provide direct text message verification of findings.&lt;ref name="projectreport"/&gt;

A team of [[iPhone]] application developers formed Army of Eyes, based out of [[Austin, TX]]. Their application was developed soon after the original challenge announcement in order to be made available by challenge launch day.&lt;ref name="projectreport"/&gt;

The {{URL|http://i-neighbors.org/|iNeighbors}} team, made up of members of an existing social media site for neighborhood watch communities, performed no recruitment or trading efforts. Their goal was to evaluate the ability of their network to effectively report on abnormal activity within neighborhoods. They were able to successfully locate five of the ten balloons.&lt;ref name="projectreport"/&gt;

==Reflections==
The challenge generated a number of insights. First, it showed how mass and social media can act complementarily. While mass media were useful primarily for spreading general information about the challenge, social media were effective for viral dissemination of information about the challenge to potential team recruits. Second, it showed how social media can be useful as a data mining source. For example, the iSchools team did better than many other teams by simply monitoring public websites. Third, the challenge showed the variety of ways in which social networking can be utilized. The MIT and GTRI teams used them primarily to facilitate fast communication between participants, while the iSchools team used it as a source of information.

Fourth, the challenge showed the general effectiveness of using [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to solve geographically-distributed, time-sensitive problems. The DARPA program managers were surprised by how quickly the challenge was completed. However, it can be difficult to filter useful data from public sites, and the independent verification of publicly listed information remains a challenge in efficiency and accuracy.&lt;ref name="reflecting"/&gt;

DARPA noted that though social networks can be a powerful source of intelligence, using them may be politically sensitive due to the privacy concerns involved with data mining user content. Similarly, the winning MIT team surmised that their recursive approach would only be effective if the effort's goal was seen to be moral and good by its participants.&lt;ref name="projectreport"/&gt;

'''''Divinity II''''' is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Larian Studios]].  Its first release in 2009 was subtitled '''''Ego Draconis''''', and was published by [[dtp entertainment]] and in the United States by [[cdv Software Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/09/17/cdv-usa-to-publish-divinity-ii-ego-draconis-in-north-america|title=Divinity II - Ego Draconis published by CDV USA in North America| work=[[IGN]] | date=2009-09-17| accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The updated 2011 re-release '''''The Dragon Knight Saga''''' which included the expansion '''''Flames of Vengeance''''', as well as the final 2012 release as '''''Divinity II: Developer's Cut''''', were published by [[Focus Home Interactive]].  

The defining feature of ''Divinity II'' is the ability to switch between aerial combat as a dragon, and more traditional third-person action-role playing gameplay as a human.  It is the third game in the ''[[Divine Divinity|Divinity]]'' franchise, and the first ''Divinity'' game to be released on consoles as well as for [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Gameplay==
The main focus of the game is on traditional action-role playing gameplay, which includes completing quests, exploring the game world, and interacting with a variety of non-player characters.  ''Divinity II'' utilizes some elements of games like ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]],'' such as a focus on upgrading equipment, randomized magical effects on equipment, unique item sets that offer greater benefits when used together, and some quest mechanics such as markers to show that an NPC will offer a quest to the player.  However, it also uses elements from more traditional [[computer role playing games]], such as branching conversation trees, choices which affect other events in the game, and non-combat segments, such as platforming or puzzle elements.  When interacting with non-player characters, the player will often have the option to read their minds, which can provide information, extra choices in a quest, or equipment, at a certain cost to their experience points.  The 'experience debt' then has to be repaid before they can gain experience again.

Players are given a choice of starting packages for their character during the tutorial, but progression is freeform, and the player is free to develop their character in a different direction if they want to.  Skills are grouped into 'schools' which correspond to traditional roles, but all skills are available to all characters, allowing mixing between these roles.  Multiple forms of crafting exist: alchemy, which allows the player to create potions; necromancy, which allows a player to customize a summonable undead pet; and enchanting, which upgrades the character's equipment.

After a certain point in the game, the character gains a base of operations known as the Battle Tower, as well as the ability to become a dragon in large spaces.  Dragon combat works similarly to ground-based combat, but in three dimensions; as a dragon, the character still has a regular attack as well as skills they can use, and equipment to improve their abilities.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the world of Rivellon from ''[[Divine Divinity]]'', although much time has passed since the end of ''Divine Divinity''.  The player character starts out as a Dragon Slayer at the end of their training, when they are given draconic powers as a way to help fight the last remaining dragons.  These powers also erase their memories of their training, but they are reassured that their memories will return quickly.  The regular proceedings are interrupted by news of a dragon sighted nearby, so before the initiation is finished, the player character is rushed off with them to where the dragon was last seen.

Throughout the game, the hero has several encounters with Damian, the Damned One. Damian is amassing his armies of monsters to destroy Rivellon. He was driven to such actions by the death of his love, Ygerna, at the hands of his adopted father Lucien (The Divine One, the hero from the first game). Damian seeks to resurrect her and the player seeks to foil his plan due to her evil magic that would make the Damned One even stronger. After fighting his way through Damian's evil minions such as the necromancer who overtook the Battle Tower and the rhyming mage Bellegar, the hero discovers he was tricked into reviving Ygerna himself. He is rewarded for his efforts by being imprisoned in crystal and sent away to a different dimension.

In the expansion, ''Flames of Vengeance'', the Dragon Knight wakes in a crystal prison on the plane of Hypnoteromachia, where Lucien, the Divine, the messiah figure to Rivellon, is also imprisoned.  A ghost called Behrilin comes and offers to free the Divine if the Dragon Knight will help to free him from his earthly prison. The ghost transports him to the last city in Rivellon after Damian's campaign of destruction, only still standing due to the magic shield created by the powerful wizard Zandalor. He begs the players help to destroy the invading force and shore up the city's defenses before the shield is broken.

==Development==
Development on ''Divinity II'' began around 2006, after Larian Studios had acquired enough money to begin development on a ''Divinity'' sequel in earnest.  From the beginning, the game was planned with the feature of transforming into a dragon in mind, and even included a third form, halfway between the dragon and human forms, which would have served as a powerful form for fighting on the ground.  However, it was not implemented in the final game, though the model was reused for enemies in the game.  The original concepts included more areas, based on the original map of Rivellon in ''Divine Divinity'', as well as features like multiplayer, co-op, and a greater importance given to the Battle Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Divinity Anthology - Developer's Journal|year=2012|pages=70–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The game uses the [[Gamebryo]] engine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Larian Studios committed to Emergent's Gamebryo for developing diverse titles incl. Divinity II: EGO DRACONIS |publisher=Emergent |url=http://www.emergent.net/en/News/Press-Releases/LARIAN-STUDIOS-COMMITTED-TO-EMERGENTS-GAMEBRYO-FOR-DEVELOPING-DIVERSE-TITLES-INCLUDING-THE-HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED-DIVINITY-II-EGO-DRACONIS |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2009-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612004225/http://emergent.net/en/News/Press-Releases/LARIAN-STUDIOS-COMMITTED-TO-EMERGENTS-GAMEBRYO-FOR-DEVELOPING-DIVERSE-TITLES-INCLUDING-THE-HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED-DIVINITY-II-EGO-DRACONIS/ |archivedate=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; known for its use in ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion|Oblivion]]'' and ''[[Fallout 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.gameobserver.com/features/inside/all-platforms/gameobserver-interview-with-bethesda-softworks-130/|title=GameObserver interview with Bethesda Softworks|publisher=GameObserver|accessdate=2010-07-09|date=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial release of ''Ego Draconis'', Larian was interested in releasing an updated version that would fix many of the bugs and issues with the first game and improve the performance of the engine.  At the same time, they developed an expansion that would come after the end of the game, as many people had complained that the original ending of the game had been unsatisfying.  The updates to the main game and the expansion were sold together as the ''Flames of Vengeance'' add on, or bundled with the core game as ''The Dragon Knight Saga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Divinity Anthology - Developer's Journal|year=2012|pages=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flames of Vengeance'' and ''The Dragon Knight Saga'' were released in Germany in August 2010, and in all other language versions in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Divinity II: Flames of Vengeance FAQ| publisher=Larian Studios| url=http://www.flamesofvengeance.com/faq.php| date=2010-07-09| accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Divinity II: Flames of Vengeance| publisher=GameStar| url=http://www.gamestar.de/news/pc/rollenspiel/2313111/divinity_ii_flames_of_v| date=2009-03-02| accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no retail United States release of ''The Dragon Knight Saga'' until it was released on the Xbox 360 on April 12, 2011, along with a soundtrack CD and an art book.

For the tenth anniversary of the Divinity series and the release of the Divinity Anthology, Larian made another update to the game, calling the final version ''Divinity II: Developer's Cut'', which included design documents, concept art, and the ability to access the developer's console in-game through a second executable file.

== Marketing ==
The ''Ego Draconis'' Windows Collector's Edition included an 18&amp;nbsp;cm resin figurine holding a metal letter opener, a cloth-map of Rivellon, a soundtrack EP with seven tracks composed by Kirill Pokrovsky and a temporary tattoo showcasing the ''Divinity II: Ego Draconis'' logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/divinity-ii-ego-draconis-collectors-edition|title=Divinity II: Ego Draconis (Collector's Edition) for Windows|publisher=MobyGames|work=|accessdate=2010-07-08|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the release of ''Divinity II: Developer's Cut'' on [[GOG.com]], the website ran a promotion on a pay-what-you-want model, where people who purchased the ''Developer's Cut'' through the bundle were given early access to the bonus materials and the game itself upon release.  Larian released behind-the-scenes videos when the sales numbers reached certain milestones, as well as a tech demo of their first, unfinished game, ''The Lady, The Mage, and The Knight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/10/10/pay-what-you-want-for-divinity-anthology-on-gog/|accessdate=26 November 2012|title=Pay What You Want For Divinity Anthology on GOG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GameZone's Dan Liebman gave both the PC and Xbox 360 versions an 8.4, saying "Strong narrative and open-ended design are the highlights of this fantasy experience. Divinity II: Ego Draconis will likely be overlooked by many due to the timing of its release, but it offers a genuinely engrossing world for RPG buffs to wallow in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r36187.htm |title=Divinity II: Ego Draconis - Review - GameZone - Reviews |publisher=GameZone |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126011148/http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r36187.htm |archivedate=January 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GameZone also gave the Dragon Knight Saga a 7 out of 10, stating "Although the graphical improvements are appreciated, newcomers expecting a visual powerhouse shouldn’t get their hopes up. A good number of glitches can still be found, visual inconsistencies being one of the most striking. Your overall perception of Rivellon’s scope isn’t quite the same as a Bethesda RPG—it’s a limited field of view, despite the actual grandeur of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GameZone |url=http://xbox.gamezone.com/reviews/item/divinity_ii_the_dragon_knight_saga1/ |title=Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga Review &amp;#124; GameZone |publisher=Xbox.gamezone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010550/http://xbox.gamezone.com/reviews/item/divinity_ii_the_dragon_knight_saga1 |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] scored it a 4.8 out of 10, stating "I can’t recommend the Xbox 360 version of this product to anyone." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Onyett |first=Charles |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/106/1061529p2.html |title=Divinity II: Ego Draconis Review - Xbox 360 Review at IGN |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the review of ''The Dragon Knight Saga'', another IGN reviewer stated "If you haven't touched Divinity II at all and you enjoy action-RPGs, you won't be disappointed with the Xbox 360 version."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michael|first=Jon|title=Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga Review - Xbox 360|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/116/1162736p2.html|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequel ==
Following the success of ''Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga'', Larian expressed an interest in creating more ''Divinity'' games, while also developing the dragon gameplay that was featured in ''Divinity II''.  They have announced that one of their next planned games is going to be an action-real time strategy game, with the main character as a Dragon Knight at a time in Rivellon's history when there were many Dragon Knights.  The game was released August 6, 2013, and is titled ''[[Divinity: Dragon Commander]]''.

'''Francesca Dani,''' sometimes referred to as '''Francesca Aurora Dani,''' (born 5 March 1979 in [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]) is an Italian travel photographer, and a former [[cosplay]]er, [[net idol]] model and [[jewelry designer]].

== Cosplay and modeling career ==
Dani began her cosplay career in November 1998 after participating in [[Lucca Comics &amp; Games|Lucca Comics and Games]] as [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]]. She claims to have participated at the request of a friend, whom she had produced cosplay clothes for earlier on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guide.supereva.it/cartoni_animati/interventi/2007/08/303955.shtml|title=Francesca Dani|website=guide.supereva.it|language=it|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dani unexpectedly won an award at the contest, which granted her local fame and kickstarted her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comicsblog.it/post/1954/intervistata-la-cosplay-francesca-dani|title=Intervistata la cosplay Francesca Dani|last=|first=|date=|work=Comicsblog.it|access-date=2018-06-17|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dani quickly launched her website under the Geocities free hosting service, subsequently transferring it under her own domain ''francescadani.com'' in 2001. Understanding the potential of internet way before most other celebrities, she launched a [[pay website]] on 14 April 2002. The website used to feature short videos and thousands of photographs depicting her posing in various risque outfits, swimsuits, lingerie, and other fetish outfits. Although often showing very provocative outfit, Dani has reportedly never posed fully naked pictures, in spite of numerous requests she claims to have received in that regard.&lt;ref name="ELTM1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-3405755|title=La Modelo Con Ojos De Muñeca Hentai|author=Solano, Carlos|date=April 19, 2009|publisher=''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]''|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 2002 to September 2005 she modeled for an American paysite called ''Varietease'', but in October 2005 she left the site for her own paysite under the domain ''francescadani.com''. 

Dani gained fame in Japan on 25 December 2002, during an appearance on popular TV show ''Sekai Marumie'', directed by [[Takeshi Kitano]], aired on [[Nippon TV]]. Dani was chosen for a special live interview, filmed in her hometown, because of her status as an international cosplayer. 

Three years later, Dani gained global fame after winning the World Cosplay Summit in [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]], in 2005 as a member of the Italian team, which also featured Giorgia Vecchini (who also went on to become a prominent cosplayer) and the Livia Fata sisters. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://akibaspace.com.br/akibacosplay/post/teste-akibacosplay/|title=Celebridade cosplay : Francesca Dani|work=AkibaSpace|access-date=2018-06-17|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event boosted her popularity in Japan. Immediately after the event, she was chosen as a spokesmodel for ''Bodyline'', a Japanese manufacturer of Gothic and Lolita dresses: Francesca's photos appeared on Bodyline packages. At the end of 2005, [[Livedoor]], an [[Internet service provider]] based in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], started selling Francesca's digital photo-books at ''DLsite'', a [[digital distribution]] website. 

Francesca has appeared in dozens in magazines around the world, most notably for [[Maxim (magazine)|''Maxim'']] who hailed her as "¡La cosplayer más popular en la web!" ("The most popular cosplayer on the web!") &lt;ref&gt;Larenas, Gerardo H. "La reina De Los Geeks". [[Maxim (magazine)|MAXIM (Mexico)]], 1 May 2007, Year 5, Issue 5, Pages 20 - 22&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 she published a video DVD titled ''DNA of Angel, Soul of Devil'', celebrating 10 years of her career. It includes a documentary on her story, directed and produced by her longtime photographer and partner, [[Paolo Cellammare]]. By his own admission, Cellammare's career as an international cosplay photographer has started and flourished thanks to a long-standing partnership with Dani.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anime.everyeye.it/articoli/intervista-intervista-a-paolo-cellammare-9220.html|title=Intervista Intervista a Paolo Cellammare|work=Everyeye Anime|access-date=2018-06-17|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Francesca Dani was featured in an Italian-language book by Francesca Mazzuccato, as an example of a person who has chosen strip-tease as a way to express creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.it/Storia-dello-strip-tease-Francesca-Mazzucato/dp/8862881096|title=Storia dello strip-tease|last=Mazzucato|first=Francesca|date=14 July 2011|publisher=Odoya|isbn=9788862881098|location=Bologna|language=Italiano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among others, Dani has participated in Cosplay fairs and events in Italy, Japan, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Brazil, where she was asked to stage a performance to present a new manga called ''[[Death Note]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=kiradeathnote333|title=Francesca Dani - Misa Misa|date=2008-03-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gpp19jkmP4|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francesca has personally produced dozens of costumes during her long cosplay career, taking pride in the fact that all her costumes have been made solely by her. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nt2099.com/cosplay/INTERVIEWS/10/file10.pdf|title=File #10 - interview with Francesca Dani|last=|first=|date=October 2004|work=Cosplay Underground|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewellery design and retirement from modeling==
In 2010 Dani began designing her own brand of gothic-inspired jewellery, launching under the brand name of ''My Bones''. She launched a specific website for this product line, which was online under the francescadanistore.com URL until 2015. 

The last public cosplay event that Francesca has been seen at was Novegro Comics, Italy, in February 2010, where she acted as a honorary jury member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comicsblog.it/post/6908/festival-del-fumetto-2010-a-novegro-cosplay-fotogallery-di-sabato-6-febbraio|title=Festival del Fumetto 2010 a Novegro: cosplay fotogallery di sabato 6 febbraio|work=Comicsblog.it|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There she portrayed famous videogame character [[Princess Zelda]]. Following that and a few other photosets that she published on her website, Dani suddenly retired from cosplay and modelling, and ceased appearing in public events such as fairs and contests. Her web site was left online with the existing content. However, no new content was added until it was replaced by her new photography site, in 2015.

== Travel photography career ==
In 2015 Dani took up photography, focusing initially on nocturnal landscapes shot in the surrounding of her hometown [[Florence]]. During a trip to Northern Norway in late 2015, she took her first photography of the [[Aurora|Northern lights]], a theme she continues to develop still today. She claims that her pictures have a recurring theme, with small human shapes lost in large, empty spaces. According to Dani, this enhances the insignificant role that human beings play, when compared to the immense power of nature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.francescadani.com|title=Francesca Dani|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 she joined ''LappOne'', a Swedish tour operator, where she currently performs various duties such as photographic tour leader, marketing, IT and web site development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lappone.com/it/chi-siamo/|title=Chi Siamo - LappOne|work=LappOne|access-date=2018-06-17|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her photography works have exhibited in Rome, London, Paris and New York. One of her photographic projects, Ghosts of Chernobyl &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.francescadani.com/Portfolio/Chernobyl-Prypjat|title=Ghosts Of Chernobyl - Francesca Dani|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is aimed to raise awareness among future generations of the consequences of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], which, in Dani's words "has killed not only people, but also families, history and human dignity".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She regularly arranges guided tours to the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|Chernobyl exclusion zone]] and [[Pripyat]] in [[Ukraine]], organized through an Italian travel agent.

Other than her website, Dani makes widespread use of social networks to display her work.

'''Richard "Richie" Gecko''' is the name of two [[fictional characters]] in the ''[[From Dusk till Dawn (film series)|From Dusk till Dawn]]'' film series. The original Richie Gecko is one of the [[protagonist]]s in the 1996 film ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]''. He is a nerdy, short-fused, rapist psychopath that only his brother, [[Seth Gecko]] (a [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]], [[wikt:suave|suave]], [[Nervous breakdown|short-fused]], [[Sociopathy|sociopathic]] [[Antihero|anti-hero]]), could stand. He was portrayed by [[Quentin Tarantino]] on film, and an alternate version of the character is portrayed by [[Zane Holtz]] on TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/el-reys-from-dusk-till-dawn-rounds-out-cast/ El Rey’s ‘From Dusk Till Dawn’ Rounds Out Cast, by THE DEADLINE TEAM]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Film series universe====
There is not much information regarding Richie's back story, although a news report about the robbery that is seen during the film states that he holds prior convictions for robbery and sex crimes. ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' tells the story of the Gecko Brothers right after their latest botched bank-robbery/kidnapping attempt. He [[rape]]s and murders their hostage, a bank teller, for which Seth scolds him. After fleeing to Mexico, they unexpectedly cross paths with a sect of vampires using a strip club as a feeding ground. Richie has a chance to bond with his brother, before his insane antics catch up with him and results in an untimely "death".  Richie returns to life as an undead zombie-like blood sucker. Seth is then left with the task of putting his brother's evil-possessed carcass out of its misery. The Gecko brothers are mentioned in ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money]]''. [[Bo Hopkins]] references [[Earl and Edgar McGraw|Edgar McGraw]]'s cold demeanor and distracted nature: "Oh, them Gecko brothers killed his daddy." The Gecko brothers briefly appear in a photo cameo in the [[black comedy]] ''[[Curdled (film)|Curdled]]''. In additional, Katie Houge, news reporter from the first film, appears, again portrayed by [[Kelly Preston]].

====Television series universe====
In late 2013, it was reported that a parallel universe [[From Dusk till Dawn: The Series|TV series]] had begun production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2013/11/17/t2s-robert-patrick-join-dusk-till-dawn-series/ T2's Robert Patrick &amp; More Join 'From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series', by Craig Hunter]&lt;/ref&gt; This incarnation of Richie will be played by [[Zane Holtz]]. Mixing ideas from the original first and third films, the show pits the humans, led by Seth, who will be played by [[D.J. Cotrona]] against the vampires, led by the wicked [[Santanico Pandemonium]], played by [[Eiza Gonzalez]] and Sheriff McGraw, played by [[Don Johnson]]. This series stars [[Robert Patrick]], as Jacob Fuller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=111453 Robert Patrick and More Join Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series.

'''Santanico Pandemonium''', formerly '''Esmeralda''' or '''Kisa''', is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[From Dusk till Dawn (film series)|From Dusk till Dawn]]'' media franchise. She is the primary Queen Vampire of the "Titty Twister", a [[strip club]] in the middle of a desolate part of [[Mexico]]. In the film series, she is portrayed by [[Salma Hayek]] and [[Ara Celi]].

Hayek's role as Santanico was generally well received by viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joe.ie/movies/cult-classics/cult-classic-from-dusk-till-dawn-0026808-1 Cult Classic: From Dusk Till Dawn, by  Emmet Purcell] JOE.ie&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Santanico Pandemonium is most often seen in her human form, which resembles a [[stripper|beautiful Mexican erotic dancer]]. She has the ability to transform from human to vampire and vice versa. While in vampire form, her face transforms to have reptilian-like features and sharp teeth. She often uses her human form to [[Succubus|seduce her victims before biting them]]. She is a [[barefoot]]er and is most often seen wearing a red/black [[bra]] and [[underwear]] combo, occasionally also wearing a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] and a [[cape]] with a [[snake]] around her neck. She is vulnerable to sunlight.

===''From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter''===
Born a [[Dhampir]] named Esmeralda in [[Mexico]] in 1894, she was the daughter of the Hangman and the High Priestess Vampire, Quixla. Esmeralda knew nothing about her mother or what had happened to her. Instead, she was raised by her father, the local Hangman with an eerie past. During her childhood the Hangman attempted to kill Esmeralda on several occasions, but she kept coming back.

In 1913, when Esmeralda is nineteen years old, she is kidnapped by Johnny Madrid (a local outlaw), after a daring gallows escape with the help of Reece, an American outlaw. With the hangman, who fears the worst for his daughter, and a local posse on their trail, Madrid meets with his gang. Together, they rob a stagecoach containing American author [[Ambrose Bierce]] and newly-wed couple John and Mary Newlie. As night falls they go to a whorehouse that would later become the Titty Twister in [[From Dusk till Dawn]]. Esmeralda soon discovers the truth of her heritage after being turned by her mother Quixla and grandmother, an ancient vampire. She later hypnotizes her father, kisses him, then quickly feeds on his neck, turning him. She begs Madrid to stay, but Quixla lunges at Madrid and Bierce as they tried to escape. Seeing this, the Hangman, who is now a vampire, opens the locked door, which kills Quixla in the sunlight. Madrid and Bierce flee, ignoring Esmeralda's pleas.

===''From Dusk Till Dawn''===
Esmeralda — now known as Santanico Pandemonium, vampire heiress — takes her place as vampire queen and the main attraction at the Titty Twister. Throughout the century she puts on big shows at the bar, as seen when the Geckos arrived to await the arrival of their contact in 1996. After her show is over, Chet the bouncer, having recovered from his beating, enters the bar with a group of people looking to fight the Geckos. This leads to a fight; Richie is stabbed in the hand by Razor Charlie, and Seth takes out his gun and starts shooting people.

But as their backs are turned, Santanico morphs into a horrible creature, jumps on Richie's back and sinks her fangs into his neck, killing him. This spur-of-the-moment surge of bloodlust, triggered by his bleeding hand, sparks the other vampires’ feeding frenzy. She is killed in the original [[From Dusk till Dawn|film]] when she is impaled by a chandelier shot down by [[Seth Gecko|Seth]] — after threatening to turn him into her vampire slave.

Santanico kills two characters in the original movie — most notably Richard Gecko. The other is featured in the deleted scenes section of the laserdisc and DVD of [[From Dusk till Dawn]] where Santanico (in her human form) sits on the lap of a dazed and wounded biker (played by [[Greg Nicotero]] of KNB Effects). As she is holding his gaze for a moment, a second mouth — resembling a monstrous snake — erupts out of her mouth and bites his head off.

===Music video===
''[[She's Just Killing Me]]'', a song by rock band [[ZZ Top]] and their first single released from their 1996 album, ''[[Rhythmeen]]''. The song is featured in the film [[From Dusk till Dawn]] and on the soundtrack which also includes Mexican Blackbird by ZZ Top. The music video shows ZZ Top playing in a bar then cuts to video clips from the film ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' featuring [[George Clooney]] and [[Salma Hayek]] as Seth Gecko and Santanico Pandemonium, respectively.

===Television===
In the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] 2014 TV series ''[[From Dusk till Dawn: The Series]]'', Santanico Pandemonium was born 500 years prior to the first season. She was kept by her tribe to use for blood offerings to their gods. When she tried to run away (feeling guilty from the sacrifices made in her name) she was chased and forced to become a vampire. She was imprisoned in a temple and became the leader of the vampire blood cult — eventually becoming the "queen vampire" at the Titty Twister bar that was built onto the temple in modern times to lure in travelers. Throughout the final episodes of season one, Santanico lures Seth and Richard Gecko into the 'Titty Twister', then officially converts Richard Gecko into a vampire when suffering loss of blood. She then persuades Gecko to help her escape the Titty Twister when she forces Richard and his brother Seth to complete a test through an ancient labyrinth under the Twister in hope of being freed. The Geckos survive their test, as Richard swallows the serpent containing her blood, making him her prince. Carlos Madrigal betrays Santanico by siding with Narciso, a messenger of the vampire blood cult and the nine lords of the vampire blood cult. He kidnaps Richard, wanting Seth to bring him the $30 million in oil bonds. A final battle ensues, before the sun rises to cleanse the bar/temple of its cult. Santanico is freed from the Twister and escapes with Richard Gecko to the United States.

In season two, more of Santanico’s past is revealed when Lord Amancio Malvado, the head of the nine lords of the vampire blood cult is shown at the Twister Saloon (before fully established as the ‘Titty Twister’) informs Santanico that her real name is actually '''Kisa'''. He also attempts to get Santanico to forget about her human past life (before she was known as ‘Santanico Pandemonium’). Santanico is implied to be sexually abused by Malvado, as well as Carlos Madrigal, who has a romantic fixation with her. Also in season two, Santanico is viewed by other vampires as a form of  a goddess. Towards the end of season two, Santanico officially finds Amancio Malvado at his new hideout, a bar named ‘Jacknife Jed’s’; however, she is poisoned by Malvado and falls into an unconscious state; Mavaldo attempts to leave with her for 'El Rey', before she eventually regains her consciousness. She eventually kills Malvado, then ends her association with the Geckos and departing into a seemingly new life.

In season three, it is revealed by Seth and Richard Gecko that Santanico is now living in [[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]], who ran an underground fight ring. She was implied to be in a relationship with a human, a woman named Manola. The Geckos attempt to persuade Santanico to join them to help them fight various demons who have escaped from the ancient labyrinth of the Titty Twister and to persuade remaining vampires to join them also.

==Video game==
{{main|From Dusk Till Dawn (video game)}}

The {{Nihongo|'''Hitotsubashi Group'''|一ツ橋グループ|Hitotsubashi Gurūpu}} is a [[keiretsu]] publishing group in Hitotsubashi, [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It is composed of [[Shogakukan]], [[Shueisha]], [[Hakusensha]] and related publishing companies. The name of the group is derived from the location of its major members' headquarters in the [[Hitotsubashi, Chiyoda|Hitotsubashi]] area of Tokyo. The group companies are mostly run by the Ōga family, whose influence in the companies is still strong today.

It was started when Shogakukan, which was focused mainly on educational magazines and other related publishing at the time, decided to spin off a company (Shueisha) to produce entertainment magazines. Eventually, Shogakukan moved into the entertainment business as well, and became a rival of Shueisha, and the group was formed to help each one grow. The headquarters buildings for Shogakukan and Shueisha are right next to each other.

'''''Hollow Knight''''' is a [[Metroidvania]] [[video game]] developed and published by Team Cherry. The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] in 2017, and for the [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamcherry.com.au/hollow-knight-mac-debut-delay/|title=Hollow Knight Mac Debut Delay|date=22 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development was partially funded through a [[Kickstarter]] crowdfunding campaign, raising over {{AUD}}57,000 by the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/description| title=Hollow Knight| author=Team Cherry| publisher=[[Kickstarter]]| date=19 November 2014| accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game tells the story of a knight on a quest to uncover the secrets of the long-abandoned insect kingdom of Hallownest, whose haunting depths draw in the adventurous and brave with promises of treasures and answers to ancient mysteries.

''Hollow Knight'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Metroidvania|Metroidvania]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game, which takes place in Hallownest, a fictional ancient kingdom.&lt;ref name="infosheet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Team Cherry|title=Hollow Knight Info Sheet|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RCiyT927w-bH3Pp_HbaEy5dE4PKdF5vUxq9uI4WhF3o/edit|accessdate=18 May 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6zVoJuraZ|archivedate=18 May 2018|language=en|date=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player controls an [[insect]]-like, [[Silent protagonist|silent]], and nameless [[knight]] while exploring the underground world. The knight wields a nail, which is a cone-shaped [[sword]], used both in combat and environmental interaction.&lt;ref name="PCGUS" /&gt;

In most areas of the game the player encounters hostile bugs and other sorts of creatures. Combat involves using the nail to strike enemies from a short distance. The player can also use spells, allowing for long-range attacks.&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=John|title=Hollow Knight feels too familiar, despite being a solid metroidvania|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/02/hollow-knight-review/|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|accessdate=18 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812094620/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/02/hollow-knight-review/|archivedate=12 August 2017|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defeated enemies drop currency called Geo.&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt; The knight starts with a limited number of mask shards, which represent [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] of the character.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt; More mask shards can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's health. When the knight takes damage from an enemy or from the environment, a mask is destroyed. By striking enemies, the knight gains Soul, which is stored in the Soul Vessel. If all masks are lost, the knight dies and a Shade appears at that place. The player needs to defeat the Shade to recover the lost currency and to carry normal amount of Soul.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt; The game continues from a last visited bench—they are scattered throughout the game world and they act as save points—but the player loses all Geo and can hold a smaller amount of Soul. Initially the player can only use Soul to "Focus" and regenerate mask shards, but as the game progresses the player unlocks several offensive spells, which consume Soul. 

Many areas feature more challenging enemies ([[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]) which the player may or may not need to defeat in order to progress further.&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt; Defeating some bosses grants the player new abilities.&lt;ref name="PCGUS" /&gt; Later in the game, the player acquires a dream nail. It enables the player to face more challenging versions of some bosses.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt;

During the game, the player encounters [[non-player character]]s, with whom they can interact. These characters provide information about the game's plot or lore, offer aid, and sell items or services.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt; The player can upgrade the knight's nail to deal more damage or find soul vessels to carry more Soul. During the course of the game, the player acquires items that provide new movement abilities. They include an [[Glossary of video game terms#Double jump|additional jump mid-air]] (Monarch Wings), adhering to walls and [[Glossary of video game terms#Wall jump |jumping off them]] (Mantis Claw), and a quick dash (Mothwing Cloak). The player can also acquire other combat abilities, known as nail arts, and the aforementioned spells. To further customise the knight, the player can equip various Charms, which can be found or bought. Some of their effects include: improved combat abilities or spells, more masks or their regeneration, better movement skills, easier collecting of currency or of Soul, transformation.&lt;ref name="PCGUS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt; Equipping Charms takes up limited slots, called notches. Wearing more Charms than notches is possible, but it causes the knight to receive twice as much damage. 

Hallownest consists of several large, inter-connected areas with unique themes.&lt;ref name="PCGUS" /&gt; Although ''Hollow Knight'' does not bind the player to [[Nonlinear gameplay|one path]] through the game nor require to explore the whole world, there are obstacles that limit the player's access to an area. The player may need to progress in the story of the game, or acquire a specific movement ability, a magic skill or an item to progress further.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Team Cherry|title=Hollow Knight Game Manual|date=2017|publisher=Team Cherry}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[fast travel]] through the game's world, the player can utilise Stag Stations, terminals of a network of tunnels; the player can only travel to previously visited and unlocked stations.&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hiddendreamsav"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horti|first1=Samuel|title=Hollow Knight's free Hidden Dreams update out now|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/hollow-knights-free-hidden-dreams-update-out-now/|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=18 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021110535/https://www.pcgamer.com/hollow-knights-free-hidden-dreams-update-out-now/|archivedate=21 October 2017|language=en|date=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the player enters a new area, they do not have access to the map of the surroundings. They need to find Cornifer, the [[Cartography|Cartographer]], in order to buy a rough map. As the player explores an area, the map becomes more accurate and complete, although it is updated only when sitting on a bench. The player will need to buy specific items to complete maps, to see [[Point of interest|points of interest]], and to place markers. The knight's position on the map can only be seen if the player is carrying a specific Charm.&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt;

==Plot==
At the game's outset, the player character, or Knight, arrives in a small town above Hallownest's ruins called Dirtmouth, seeking to venture within. As they journey through the forgotten kingdom, the Knight encounters the possessed remnants of Hallownest's former residents and other creatures, slowly being overcome by a mysterious Infection. They also encounter Hornet, the self-proclaimed protector of Hallownest's ruins, who attempts to stop the Knight's quest on multiple occasions. Through learning the history of Hallownest on their journey, the Knight discovers that they are a failed Vessel, one of many artificial beings created by the Pale King to stop the Infection by sealing it away within them. The Hollow Knight, the sole successful Vessel, was given this duty and magically sealed within the Black Egg Temple by three powerful bugs known as the Dreamers, but due to unforeseen emotions, the Infection still escaped.

Depending on the player's actions, ''Hollow Knight'' has multiple endings. In the first ending, the player Knight defeats the Hollow Knight and absorbs the Infection into itself to become the new Vessel. As chains manifest to hold the Knight in place, the Temple is once again resealed and the plague is held at bay, though its true source still survives. The second ending occurs if the player is able to collect an item called the Void Heart before fighting the Hollow Knight. Halfway through the battle, Hornet arrives to offer assistance and briefly holds the Hollow Knight at bay. Choosing to continue fighting normally causes her to be knocked unconscious. The ending then plays out like the first, except Hornet is sealed in with the player Knight and her mask is used as the new Dreamer seal upon the Temple door. 

The third ending occurs if the player Knight collects the Void Heart and uses the Awakened Dream Nail ability to enter the Hollow Knight's mind when Hornet arrives to help. Here, the player Knight challenges The Radiance, a moth-like goddess that was the true source of the Infection, seeking to reduce all bugs back to a mindless state and eliminate the Pale King's influence. With the power of the Void Heart, the player Knight commands the forces of the Void, with the aid of the Hollow Knight and the shades of the failed Vessels, to consume The Radiance. As the darkness from the Temple fades, Hornet awakens to find the chamber empty, except for the player Knight's broken and empty shell.

Two additional endings were added with the ''Godmaster'' content update, in which the Knight can battle harder versions of all of the bosses in the game in a series of challenges set by a being called the Godseeker. If the Knight completes these challenges and battles the Absolute Radiance as the final boss, the darkness of the Void is summoned again to defeat her, but the Knight instead appears to transform into a massive Void creature and outright destroys the Absolute Radiance. The Godhome arena is consumed by darkness as the Godseeker begins oozing Void, which eventually erupts and destroys her as well before appearing to spread out into Hallownest. Hornet then is seen standing by the Temple as the tendrils of Infection turn black. A creature approaches her armed with a weapon and rattling chains, implied to be the Hollow Knight now free from its prison, and Hornet readies for battle. 

The fifth ending is unlocked if the Knight has given the Godseeker a Delicate Flower item before defeating the Absolute Radiance. The ending is identical to the fourth, but both the Godseeker and the Void are instead destroyed in a flash of pale light, leaving only the flower behind.

==Development and release==
''Hollow Knight'' was revealed on Kickstarter in November 2014 and reached its initial funding goal in December of the same year. The game reached a beta state in September 2015 and continued to achieve numerous stretch goals to add in more content after an engine switch from Stencyl to [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/updates|title=Hollow Knight|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the stretch goal content, such as the Colosseum of Fools and The Abyss, still made it into the game despite those goals not having been attained.

The [[Nintendo Switch]] version of ''Hollow Knight'' was announced in January 2017 and released on 12 June 2018. Team Cherry originally planned to make their game available on the [[Wii U]]. Development of the Wii U version began in 2016, alongside the PC version, and it eventually shifted to Switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/01/feature_bugging_out_with_hollow_knights_team_cherry|title=Feature: Bugging Out With Hollow Knight's Team Cherry|last=Cousins|first=Jon|date=21 January 2018|work=Nintendo Life|access-date=26 June 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of ''Hollow Knight'' worked with another Australian developer, [[Shark Jump Studios]], to speed up the porting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.destructoid.com/hollow-knight-now-has-a-second-team-to-help-speed-up-the-switch-port-436648.phtml|title=Hollow Knight now has a second team to help speed up the Switch port|last=Devore|first=Jordan|date=17 May 2017|work=Destructoid|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Team Cherry planned the Switch version to arrive "not too long after the platform’s launch", subsequently they delayed it to early 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-14-hollow-knight-on-switch-has-been-delayed-until-early-next-year|title=Hollow Knight on Switch has been delayed until early next year|last=Wales|first=Matt|date=14 November 2018|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=26 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A release date was not announced until the [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]] on 12 June 2018, when it was unveiled the game would be available later that day via [[Nintendo eShop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-12-hollow-knight-is-out-today-on-switch|title=Hollow Knight is out on Switch today|last=Wales|first=Matt|date=12 June 2018|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=26 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Team Cherry partnered with [[IndieBox]], a monthly [[subscription box]] service, to create an exclusive, physical release of the game. This limited collector’s edition included a [[DRM-Free|DRM-free]] game disc, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual, a [[Steam (software)|Steam]] key, and various custom-designed collectible items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theindiebox.com/hollow-knight/|title=Hollow Knight {{!}} IndieBox|website=www.theindiebox.com|language=en-US|access-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same month, Team Cherry announced a free major content update to the game entitled "Hidden Dreams", which was released on 3 August 2017. The update includes two new optional boss encounters, two new songs in the soundtrack, a new fast-travel system, and a new Stag Station to discover. The content can be accessed at any point in the game, though it is advised to wait until the late game due to the difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/1354868867709657584/|title=Free Content Pack 01: Hidden Dreams coming 3 August :: Hollow Knight General Discussions|website=steamcommunity.com|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2017, Team Cherry launched the second free content update, entitled "The Grimm Troupe". This content pack adds new major quests, new boss fights, new charms, new enemies, and other content. The update also added support for Russian, Portuguese, and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://teamcherry.com.au/the-grimm-troupe/|title=The Grimm Troupe Descends! Backer Rewards! TGS!

On 31 January 2018, Team Cherry announced their third free content updated entitled "Gods and Glory". The expansion title was later changed to "Godmaster" due to copyright&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://teamcherry.com.au/hollow-knight-gods-glory-is-now-godmaster/|title=Hollow Knight: Gods &amp; Glory is now Godmaster!|date=2018-08-15|work=Team Cherry|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This expansion unlocks new characters, boss fights, music, a new game mode as well as two new endings. "Godmaster" was released on 23 August 2018. &lt;ref name="godsglory"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamcherry.com.au/godsglory/|title=GODS &amp; GLORY REVEALED! CHRISTMAS WRAP!

On 20 April 2018, Team Cherry launched a new update to the game entitled "Lifeblood" after a public beta testing period which started from 24 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://teamcherry.com.au/lifeblood-update/|title=Hollow Knight: Lifeblood now on public beta!

''Hollow Knight''{{'}}s initial release received  "generally favorable" reviews and the Nintendo Switch version was met with "universal acclaim", according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCNS"/&gt; Jed Whitaker of ''[[Destructoid]]'' praised it as a "masterpiece of gaming&amp;nbsp;..., and certainly art worthy of being in a museum"&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; and, on ''[[PC Gamer]]'', Tom Marks called it a "new classic".&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt; Reviewers spoke highly of ''Hollow Knight''{{'}}s atmosphere, visuals, sound and music, noting the vastness of the game's world.

Critics recognized the combat system as simple,&lt;ref name="EuroGrev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNrev"/&gt; unsurprising&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt; or nuanced;&lt;ref name="PCPPrev"/&gt; they praised its responsiveness, or "tightness", similarly to the movement system.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NLiferev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NWRrev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCPPrev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGrev"/&gt; On ''IGN'', Tom Marks stated: "The combat in Hollow Knight is relatively straightforward, but starts out tricky ... It rewards patience and skill massively".&lt;ref name="IGNrev"/&gt; In his review on ''PC Gamer'', Marks praised the "brilliant" charm system: "What's so impressive about these charms is that I could never find a 'right' answer when equipping them. There were no wrong choices."&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt; ''NintendoWorldReport'' stated: "Charms offer a huge variety of upgrades ... Some charms ... were so essential that removing them felt like trading a part of myself for a better chance at an upcoming battle."&lt;ref name="NWRrev"/&gt;

Difficulty of ''Hollow Knight'' received attention from reviewers. Vikki Blake of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' called the game "ruthlessly tough, even occasionally unfair".&lt;ref name="EuroGrev"/&gt; For ''Nintendo World Report''{{'}}s Adam Abou-Nasr it also seemed unfair—he had {{" '}}so frustratingly hard that I cannot recommend this game' angrily scrawled in [his] notes"—but "it eventually clicked".&lt;ref name="NWRrev"/&gt; ''Destructoid'' "never found any of the bosses to be unfair".&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; Critics described Hollow Knight as challenging;&lt;ref name="IGNrev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NLiferev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCPPrev"/&gt; ''Destructoid'' and ''Nintendo World Report'' reviewers felt a sense of accomplishment after difficult fights.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NWRrev"/&gt; Critics also made comparisons to ''[[Dark Souls (series)|Dark Souls]]'', noting the mechanic of losing currency on death and having to defeat a Shade to regain it.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NLiferev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCPPrev"/&gt; ''Destructoid'' praised this feature, as well as the holding down of a button to heal, because "[t]hey circumvent a couple of issues games have always had, namely appropriate punishment for failing, and a risk-reward system".&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;

'''Hyperion Entertainment CVBA''' (formerly Hyperion Entertainment VOF) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] software company which in its early years focused in porting [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] games to [[Amiga OS]], [[Linux]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Mac OS]]. In 2001, they accepted a contract by [[Amiga Inc]]orporated to develop [[AmigaOS 4]] and mainly discontinued their porting business to pursue this development. AmigaOS 4 runs on the [[AmigaOne]] systems, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] Amiga systems with a [[Phase5]] [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] accelerator board, [[Pegasos|Pegasos II]] systems and [[Sam440]]/[[Sam460ex|Sam460]] systems.

== History ==

Hyperion Entertainment was founded in April 1999 with Ben Hermans and Evert Carton in charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-1999-07-00329-DE.html|title=Hyperion portiert Team17's Kult-Spiel "Worms: Armageddon"|publisher=Amiga-News.de|language=German|orig-year=31 July 1999|date= 28 July 2011|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their own words, "After [[Belgian]] lawyer Benjamin Hermans wondered why no one had ever tried to license [[Personal Computer|PC]] games to do Amiga ports." Hyperion does not maintain programmer staff but sub-contracts software programmers for projects as necessary. Hans-Joerg Frieden, who had previously worked on ports of the games ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'' and ''[[Abuse (video game)|Abuse]]'' as well as the [[Warp3D]] library, was contracted to be Hyperion's main developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klub.amiga.si/interviews.php?id=4&amp;lang=en |title=Interviews - Hans-Joerg Frieden |work=Digital Amiga Dream |accessdate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819122052/http://klub.amiga.si/interviews.php?id=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=19 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next few years, Hyperion would port several game titles to the Amiga and later Linux and the Macintosh, starting with Amiga port of [[Heretic II]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-2000-06-00245-DE.html|title=playamiga.de: Heretic II Review|publisher=Amiga-News.de|language=German|date=25 June 2000|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game development===
The port of Heretic II was generally well received by the Amiga press, but had weak sales. Following this, Hyperion set out to target a broader range of platforms: [[Amiga]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS]]. Later in 2000, Hyperion completed Linux version of SiN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-2000-08-00266-DE.html|title=SiN für Linux fast fertig|publisher=Amiga-News.de|language=German|date=28 August 2000|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Amiga port has been postponed due to hardware requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-2001-05-00132-DE.html|title=Amiga-Port von SiN fertig, aber.....|publisher=Amiga-News.de|language=German|date=12 May 2001|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately not released. They also approached [[Monolith Productions]] to port their [[Lithtech]] engine, culminating in their port of ''[[Shogo: Mobile Armor Division]]'' for Amiga, Linux, and Mac OS in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxgames.com/archives/1710 |title=Lithtech 3D Linux Port |publisher=[[LinuxGames]] |accessdate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319211901/http://www.linuxgames.com/archives/1710 |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.slashdot.org/story/00/01/20/1019232/Monolith-Adds-Games-For-Linux|title=Monolith Adds Games For Linux |publisher=[[Slashdot]]|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game had not sold as well as had been hoped, most notably on Linux, despite becoming a best seller on [[Tux Games]]. Hyperion stated that Linux users were likely to dual boot with [[Windows]] to play easily available games rather than purchase more expensive specialised versions years after release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shogo.thehaus.net/interviews/interview_hermans.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018161155/http://shogo.thehaus.net/interviews/interview_hermans.shtml |title=A.T. Hun's Haus of Shogo: Interview with Hyperion's Ben Hermans |archivedate=18 October 2007 |work=thehaus.net |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2002 Hyperion introduced Amiga port of ''[[Descent: FreeSpace – The Great War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-2002-01-00067-DE.html|title=H&amp;P: Freespace: Endlich lieferbar|publisher=Amiga-News.de|language=German|date=7 January 2002|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved version for AmigaOS 4 followed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amiga-ng.org/article.php?sid=508|title=Freespace updated to AmigaOS 4.1 - Amiga-NG|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After id Software released source code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-2001-12-00192-DE.html|title=Quellcode von Quake2 veröffentlicht (Update)|publisher=Amiga-News.de|language=German|date=24 December 2001|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperion marketed later in 2002 a commercial Amiga port of ''[[Quake II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-2002-11-00055-DE.html|title=Quake2 Amiga-Port erhältlich|publisher=Amiga-News.de|language=German|date=7 November 2002|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Linux port of ''[[Gorky 17]]'' was developed by Hyperion and published by [[Linux Game Publishing]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Larabel|first=Michael |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTQwOQ |title=Gorky 17 Goes Gold |publisher=Phoronix.com |date=7 June 2006|accessdate=3 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311005225/https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTQwOQ |archivedate=11 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; version for AmigaOS 4 was released nearly a decade later in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.amiga-news.de/en/news/AN-2015-10-00011-EN.html|title=AmigaOS 4: Gorky 17 released|publisher=Amiga-News.de|date=4 October 2015|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During work on the Heretic II port, Hyperion Entertainment developers created an [[OpenGL]] subset called MiniGL which sits on top of [[Warp3D]] to ease porting of 3D games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Ben|last=Vost|date=December 1999 |title=Previews, Heretic II|magazine=Amiga Format |publisher=Future Publishing|issn=0957-4867|issue=130|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MiniGL library was released for free use to other software developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-2000-04-00141-DE.html|title=Hyperion: Neue MiniGL Library fertig|publisher=Amiga-News.de|language=German|date=16 April 2000|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AmigaOS 4 ===

In 2001 Hyperion announced that, after licensing the rights from Amiga, Inc, it would be working on the long-awaited successor to AmigaOS 3.9, and to this end concentrated most of its effort on the development of AmigaOS 4. Hyperion claimed and still claim that it is based upon AmigaOS 3.1 source code, and to a lesser extent certain AmigaOS 3.9 sources. A quick port of 68k AmigaOS to PowerPC was originally planned, with new features added as development continued. Ben Hermans, writing on Amiga forum Ann.lu, claimed that these sources, along with the source of the PPC kernel [[WarpOS]] would be sufficient to provide a version to users within a year, making his now-infamous "change some flags and recompile" comment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

AmigaOS 4.0 was first released to end-users and second level betatesters in April 2004, with AmigaOS 4.1 following in September 2008. It is currently still in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amigaos.net/content/10/history-amigaos|title=Hyperion AmigaOS 4 development timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Hyperion attempted to obtain a licence for an AmigaOS 4 native port of the file manager [[Directory Opus]] which had originally and been developed on the Amiga, but for which development had since moved to the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform. However talks between Hyperion and GP Software broke down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306143658/http://system-log.com/?p=1363|title=Greg Perry of GP Software on Directory Opus for AmigaOS 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Managing Partner of Hyperion, Benjamin Hermans, in the period between announcement and release of AmigaOS 4, ignited a great deal of community controversy by repeatedly claiming that [[MorphOS]], an AmigaOS-like competitor (which had been released in complete form in 2003), was illegal, and had on several occasions threatened to take legal action against it either on the grounds that it was parasitic competition to AmigaOS 4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biclodon.com/misc/amigafarm/benhermans/20020415_letsfindout.html|title=Ben Hermans on ANN.lu, challenged on suing MorphOS. Let's find out.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even that it was actually based on stolen AmigaOS source code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biclodon.com/misc/amigafarm/benhermans/20011104_usingos31sourcecode.html|title=Ben Hermans, ANN.lu. "MorphOS people are using OS3.1 source codes, it's a known fact."}}&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence to support either claim ever became public, neither did any legal action against MorphOS take place, although neither prevented such views being repeated commonly in public Amiga forums and mailing lists and even accepted as fact by some. This situation was inflamed by ex-Commodore engineer Dave Haynie, who backed up Herman's claims: "If you have seen the Amiga source code, you cannot produce a legally separate work-alike",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.sys.amiga.morphos/2011-04/msg00000.html|title=Haynie: MorphOS code is stolen}}&lt;/ref&gt; though again without any direct evidence.

The dispute did not enter the courts, but in the forums the argument was bitter. Hermans claimed that Bill Buck leading the [[Genesi]] company funding MorphOS was a "[[con-artist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0BxlY9g_OfLqDMThlY2FmMzUtMjE5My00NjdiLWIxN2MtZDQyNTUzZTJlNTI3&amp;hl=en|title=Ben Hermans claiming "Bill Buck is the con-artist"|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evert Carton took over the Managing Partner position after Benjamin Hermans stepped down in 2003, due to lack of time for daily administrative work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-2003-11-00080-EN.html|title=Hyperion: Evert Carton now sole Managing Partner|publisher=Amiga-News.de|date=14 November 2003|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy de Groote became another Partner in 2003.&lt;ref name="ObligementNews11-03.04"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://obligement.free.fr/articles/actuenbref03042011.php|title=Actualité de mars/avril 2011, Départ d'Evert Carton de Hyperion|publisher=Obligement|language=French|date=April 2011|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispute and settlement with Amiga, Inc. ===
{{see also|History of the AmigaOS 4 dispute}}

In 2007, Hyperion were sued by [[Amiga, Inc.|Amiga Incorporated]] for trademark infringement in the Washington Western District Court in Seattle, US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-wawdce/case_no-2:2007cv00631/case_id-143245/ |title=Amiga Inc v. Hyperion VOF :: Justia Dockets &amp; Filings |publisher=Dockets.justia.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amiga-news.de/de/news/AN-2007-04-00110-DE.html|title=Amiga Inc.: "Lizenzabkommen beendet" / Klage gegen Hyperion (Update 3)|publisher=Amiga-News.de|language=German|date=30 April 2007|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amiga, Inc. sued Hyperion for breach of contract, trademark violation and copyright infringement concerning the development and marketing of AmigaOS 4.0, stating that Hyperion had continued to develop and market AmigaOS 4 without paying agreed royalties and had continued to do so even after warned to cease and desist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Proven |first=Liam |date=3 May 2007 |title=The trials of the Amiga continue |url=https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1035139/the-trials-amiga-continue |publisher=The Inquirer |accessdate=10 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperion launched a counter action, claiming [[fraud]] in Amiga, Inc. handling of Amiga intellectual properties and debts, including the use of debt-holding shell companies, by shifting responsibility between these shell companies. They also claimed that Amiga, Inc. had failed to uphold their part of the contract and had been untruthful in correspondence;{{Citation needed|reason=Text probably c/p from court documents.Mybe better to remove and start anew.|date=August 2018}} and that they had failed to deliver the AmigaOS 3.1 source that AmigaOS 4 was developed from, forcing Hyperion to find it elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyperion-entertainment.biz:8080/news/2007-05-01 Hyperion's official statement]&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of that ongoing legal dispute, in Autumn 2007 Hyperion released a standalone version of AmigaOS 4 for classic Amiga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zivadinovic |first=Dusan |date=26 November 2007 |title=AmigaOS 4.0 für klassische Amigas mit PPC-Erweiterungen |url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/AmigaOS-4-0-fuer-klassische-Amigas-mit-PPC-Erweiterungen-199445.html |publisher=heise.de |language=German|accessdate=10 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an action Amiga, Inc. claimed as illegal.

On 29 May 2007, the new Managing Partner stated under oath - without further evidence - that the open-source AmigaOS reimplementation [[AROS]] was "probably illegal", as documented on page 27 of court documents related to the Amiga-Hyperion court case.&lt;ref&gt;http://merlancia.us/amiga-hyperion/35-5decmcewenexhibit5show_case_doc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2009, Hyperion and Amiga, Inc reached settlement. Hyperion were granted an exclusive license to develop and market AmigaOS 4 and subsequent versions with the name AmigaOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Alexander's Ragtime Band - Billy Murray.ogg|thumb|''Alexander's Ragtime Band'', performed by [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], Edison Amberol cylinder, 1911]]
'''Irving Berlin''' (born '''Israel Beilin''' ({{lang-rus|Израиль Моисеевич Бейлин}}) {{OldStyleDate|May 23|1888|May 11}}&lt;ref name=rusencyc&gt;[https://bigenc.ru/music/text/3366492 "Big Russian Encyclopedia: Irving Berlin"] ''Ministry of Culture, Russian Federation''&lt;/ref&gt; – September 22, 1989) was an American [[composer]] and [[lyricist]], widely considered one of the greatest songwriters in American history. His music forms a great part of the [[Great American Songbook]]. Born in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. He published his first song, "Marie from Sunny Italy", in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights,&lt;ref name="Starr 2009, pg. 64"&gt;Starr, Larry and Waterman, Christopher, American Popular Music: From Minstrelsy to MP3, Oxford University Press, 2009, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;   and had his first major international hit, "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]" in 1911.  He also was an owner of the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. It is commonly believed that Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp unless using his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever. &lt;ref name="Guitar Zero, pg. 164"&gt;Marcus, Gary, ''Guitar Zero'', Penguin Press (2012) pg. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

"Alexander's Ragtime Band" sparked an international dance craze in places as far away as Berlin's native Russia, which also "flung itself into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania." Over the years he was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to "reach the heart of the average American," whom he saw as the "real soul of the country."&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; In doing so, said [[Walter Cronkite]], at Berlin's 100th birthday tribute, he "helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives."&lt;ref name=birthday&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uV4frZIkIQ Carnegie Hall, May 27, 1988], Irving Berlin's 100th birthday celebration&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him famous before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original [[Hollywood]] films,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44750842|title=The complete lyrics of Irving Berlin|last=1888-1989.|first=Berlin, Irving,|date=2000|publisher=Knopf|others=Kimball, Robert., Emmet, Linda.|isbn=0679419438|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=44750842}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his songs nominated eight times for [[Academy Awards]]. Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]","[[Easter Parade (song)|Easter Parade]]","[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]", "[[Cheek to Cheek]]", "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]", "[[Happy Holiday (song)|Happy Holiday]]", "[[Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)]]", and "[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]".  His Broadway musical and 1943 film ''[[This is the Army]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=This Is the Army (1943)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036430/|accessdate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Ronald Reagan]], had [[Kate Smith]] singing Berlin's "[[God Bless America]]" which was first performed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEJo7x9y3D4 "Kate Smith, "God Bless America"], 5 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin's songs have reached the top of the charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers including [[The Andrews Sisters]], [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Cher]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Ruth Etting]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Marilyn Miller]], [[Rudy Vallée|Rudy Valee]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Doris Day]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Michael Bublé|Michael Buble]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Christina Aguilera]].

Composer [[Douglas Moore]] sets Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters, and includes him instead with [[Stephen Foster]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[Carl Sandburg]], as a "great American minstrel"—someone who has "caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe."&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;  Composer [[George Gershwin]] called him "the greatest songwriter that has ever lived",&lt;ref name=Gershwin/&gt;{{rp|117}} and composer [[Jerome Kern]] concluded that "Irving Berlin has no ''place'' in American music—he ''is'' American music."&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;

==Early life==

===Russian immigrant===

====Life in Russia====

Berlin was born on May 11, 1888, in the Russian Empire. His exact birthplace is unknown. Although Berlin's family came from the shtetel of [[Tolochin]] (in latter-day Belarus), he may have been born in [[Tyumen]], Siberia.&lt;ref name="FuriaWood1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip Furia|author2=Graham Wood|title=Irving Berlin: A Life in Song|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od0HAQAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=978-0-02-864815-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of eight children of Moses (1848–1901) and Lena Lipkin Beilin (1850–1922). His father, a [[Hazzan|cantor]] in a [[synagogue]], uprooted the family to America, as did many other Jewish families in the late 19th century. On September 14, 1893&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/russianarrivalsimmigrationdatafile/?name=_Beilin&amp;arrival=1893-9&amp;arrival_x=0-0-0&amp;count=50&amp;name_x=_1|title=Ancestry.com|last=Passenger list of the Beilin family|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the family arrived in New York City. Upon their arrival at Ellis Island, the name "Beilin" was changed to "Baline". According to biographer [[Laurence Bergreen]], as an adult Berlin admitted to no memories of his first five years in Russia except for one: "he was lying on a blanket by the side of a road, watching his house burn to the ground. By daylight the house was in ashes."&lt;ref name=Bergreen&gt;Bergreen, Laurence. ''As Thousands Cheer'', Viking Penguin, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} As an adult, Berlin said he was unaware of being raised in abject poverty since he knew no other life.&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ian.

Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia]] and then Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], his son, had revived with utmost brutality the anti-Jewish [[pogrom]]s, which created the spontaneous mass exodus to America. The pogroms were to continue until 1906, with thousands of other Jewish families also needing to escape, including those of [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Sophie Tucker]], [[L. Wolfe Gilbert]], [[Jack Yellen]], [[Louis B. Mayer]] (of [[MGM]]), and the [[Warner Bros.|Warner brothers]].&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|14}} It has been suspected that the Beilin family also fled due to these pogroms, though there is no evidence to indicate that there were pogroms in Tolochin or Tyumen when the Beilins left for America. When they reached [[Ellis Island]], Israel was put in a pen with his brother and five sisters until immigration officials declared them fit to be allowed into the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C-rR_ihoOw&amp;t=1m39s "Irving Berlin - The Voice of the City"], BBC Bristol and A&amp;E network's 1988 broadcast&lt;/ref&gt;

====Settling in New York City====
[[File:LES, 1910.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Lower East Side in the early 1900s]]
After their arrival in New York City, the Baline family lived briefly in a basement flat on Monroe Street, and then moved to a three-room tenement at 330 [[Cherry Street (Manhattan)|Cherry Street]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His father, unable to find comparable work as a cantor in New York, took a job at a [[kosher]] meat market and gave Hebrew lessons on the side, to support his family. He died a few years later when Irving was thirteen years old.&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;

Now, with only a few years of schooling, eight-year-old Irving began helping to support his family.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/23/obituaries/irving-berlin-nation-s-songwriter-dies.html “Irving Berlin, Nation's Songwriter, Dies”] ''New York Times'', September 23, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He became a newspaper boy, hawking ''The Evening Journal.'' One day while delivering newspapers, according to Berlin's biographer and friend, [[Alexander Woollcott]], he stopped to look at a ship departing for China and became so entranced that he didn't see a swinging crane, which knocked him into the river. When he was fished out after going down for the third time, he was still holding in his clenched fist the five pennies he earned that day.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woollcott&gt;Woollcott, Alexander. ''The Story of Irving Berlin'', Da Capo Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother took a job as a [[midwife]], and three of his sisters worked wrapping cigars, common for immigrant girls. His older brother worked in a sweatshop assembling shirts. Each evening, when the family came home from their day's work, Bergreen writes, "they would deposit the coins they had earned that day into Lena's outspread apron."&lt;ref name="Bergreen"/&gt; {{rp|11}}

Music historian [[Philip Furia]] writes that when "Izzy" began to sell newspapers in the Bowery, he was exposed to the music and sounds coming from saloons and restaurants that lined the crowded streets. Young Berlin sang some of the songs he heard while selling papers, and people would toss him some coins. He confessed to his mother one evening that his newest ambition in life was to become a singing waiter in a saloon.&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets&gt;Furia, Philip. ''The Poets of Tin Pan Alley'',  Oxford Univ. Press (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}}

However, before Berlin was fourteen his meager income was still adding less than his sisters' to the family's budget, which made him feel worthless.&lt;ref name=Woollcott/&gt; He then decided to leave home and join the city's ragged army of other young immigrants.&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|15}} He lived in the [[Bowery]], taking up residence in one of the lodging houses that sheltered the thousands of other homeless boys in the [[Lower East Side]]. Bergreen describes them as being uncharitable living quarters, "[[Dickensian]] in their meanness, filth, and insensitivity to ordinary human beings."&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|15}}

===Early jobs===
[[File:Irving Berlin 1906.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin at his first job with a music publisher, aged 18]]
With few survival skills having left school around the age of thirteen,&lt;ref name="FuriaWood1998" /&gt; he realized that formal employment was out of the question. His only ability was acquired from his father's vocation as a singer, and he joined with a few other youngsters who went to saloons on the Bowery and sang to customers. Itinerant young singers like them were common on the Lower East Side. Berlin would sing a few of the popular ballads he heard on the street, hoping people would pitch him a few pennies. From these seamy surroundings he became street wise, with a real and lasting education. Music was his only source of income and he picked up the language and culture of the ghetto lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Early Career of Irving Berlin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maslon |first1=Laurence |title=Early Career and Tin Pan Alley |url=http://www.irvingberlin.com/early-career-and-tin-pan-alley |website=Irving Berlin |publisher=The Irving Berlin Music Company |accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin learned what kind of songs appealed to audiences, writes Begreen: "well-known tunes expressing simple sentiments were the most reliable."&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|17}} He soon began [[Song-plugger|plugging songs]] at [[Tony Pastor]]'s Music Hall in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] and in 1906, when he was 18, got a job as a singing waiter at the Pelham Cafe in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]]. Besides serving drinks, he sang made-up "blue" parodies of hit songs to the delight of customers.

Biographer Charles Hamm writes that in Berlin's free time after hours, he taught himself to play the piano.&lt;ref name=Hamm&gt;Hamm, Charles. ''Irving Berlin: Songs from the Melting Pot'', Oxford Univ. Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Never having lessons, after the bar closed for the night, young Berlin would sit at a piano in the back and begin improvising tunes.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; His first attempt at actual songwriting was "Marie From Sunny Italy," written in collaboration with the Pelham's resident pianist, Mike Nicholson, from which he earned 37 cents in royalties.&lt;ref name="FuriaWood1998" /&gt; A spelling error on the sheet music to the published song included the spelling of his name as "I. Berlin."&lt;ref name=Freedland&gt;Freedland, Michael.  'Irving Berlin', Stein and Day, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin continued writing and playing music at Pelham Cafe and developing an early style. He liked the words to other people's songs but sometimes the rhythms were "kind of boggy," and he might change them. One night he delivered some hits composed by his friend, [[George M. Cohan]], another kid who was getting known on Broadway with his own songs. When Berlin ended with Cohan's "Yankee Doodle Boy," notes Whitcomb, "everybody in the joint applauded the feisty little fellow."

Nobel Prize-winning author [[Rudyard Kipling]], living up the coast during that period, said he "was shocked and intrigued by the screeching squalor he found in the dirty gray tenement canyons of immigrant New York."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|20}} He described it as worse than the slums of [[Bombay]], but was nonetheless "impressed and moved by the Jews," says Whitcomb, noting how the songs by the little immigrant boys "saluted the Stars and Stripes." Kipling wrote, "For these immigrant Jews are a race that survives and thrives against all odds and flags."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|20}}

===Recognition as songwriter===
Max Winslow (c. 1883–1942),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[ Displaying Abstract ] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1942/06/09/archives/max-winslow-dead-music-publisher-59-official-of-irving-berlin-inc.html |title="Max Winslow Dead", New York Times, June 9, 1942 |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=June 10, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a staff member at music publisher [[Harry Von Tilzer]] Company, noticed Berlin's singing on many occasions and became so taken with his talent that he tried to get him a job with his firm. Von Tilzer said that Max claimed to have "discovered a great kid," and raved about him so much that Von Tilzer hired Berlin.&lt;ref name=Hamm/&gt;{{rp|viii}}

Later, in 1908, when he was 20, Berlin took a new job at a saloon named Jimmy Kelly's in the Union Square neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There, he was able to collaborate with other young songwriters, such as [[Edgar Leslie]], [[Ted Snyder]], [[Al Piantadosi]], and [[George A. Whiting]]. In 1909, the year of the premiere of [[Israel Zangwill]]'s ''[[The Melting Pot (play)|The Melting Pot]]'', he got another big break as a staff lyricist with the [[Ted Snyder Company]].

==Songwriting career==

===Before 1920===

===="Alexander's Ragtime Band" (1911)====

{{quote box|title=Ragtime a Form of Insanity|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = LightCyan|quote='Alexander's Ragtime Band' is a public menace....Hysteria is the form of insanity that an abnormal love for ragtime seems to produce. It is as much a mental disease as acute mania—it has the same symptoms.

''Irving Berlin's Show Business'', Harry Abrams (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}}}

Berlin rose as a songwriter in [[Tin Pan Alley]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1911, Emma Carus introduced his first world-famous hit, "Alexander's Ragtime Band", followed by a performance from Berlin himself at the Friars' Frolic of 1911.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He became an instant celebrity, and the featured performer later that year at [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]]'s vaudeville house, where he introduced dozens of other songs. The ''New York Telegraph'' described how two hundred of his street friends came to see "their boy" on stage: "All the little writer could do was to finger the buttons on his coat while tears ran down his cheeks—in a vaudeville house!"&lt;ref name=Hamm/&gt;{{rp|ix}}

[[File:Irving Berlin - Ragtime.JPG|thumb|left|Berlin with film stars [[Alice Faye]], [[Tyrone Power]] and [[Don Ameche]] singing chorus from ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' (1938)]]

[[Richard Corliss]], in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine profile of Berlin, described "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]" as a march, not a [[ragtime|rag]], "its savviest musicality comprised quotes from a [[bugle call]] and "[[Swanee River (song)|Swanee River]]." The tune revived the [[ragtime]] fervor that [[Scott Joplin]] had begun a decade earlier, and made Berlin a songwriting star.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; From its first and subsequent releases, the song was near the top of the charts as others sang it: [[Bessie Smith]], in 1927, and [[Louis Armstrong]], in 1937;  no. 1 by [[Bing Crosby]] and Connee Boswell; [[Johnny Mercer]] in 1945; [[Al Jolson]], in 1947 and [[Nellie Lutcher]] in 1948. Add [[Ray Charles]]'s [[big-band]] version in 1959, and "Alexander" had a dozen hit versions in just under a half century.&lt;ref name=Corliss&gt;Corliss, Richard. [http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,189846,00.html "That Old Christmas Feeling: Irving America: Richard Corliss remembers Irving Berlin"] ''TIME'' Magazine. December 24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the song was not recognized as a hit, however; Broadway producer [[Jesse Lasky]] was uncertain about using it, although he did include it in his "Follies" show. It was performed as an instrumental but did not impress audiences, and was soon dropped from the show's score. Berlin regarded it as a failure. He then wrote lyrics to the score, played it again in another Broadway Review, and this time ''Variety'' news weekly called it "the musical sensation of the decade."&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|68}} Composer [[George Gershwin]], foreseeing its influence, said it was "the first real American musical work," adding, "Berlin had shown us the way; it was now easier to attain our ideal."&lt;ref name=Gershwin/&gt;{{rp|117}}

====Sparking a national dance craze====
[[File:Irving Berlin in New York City, circa 1911.jpg|thumb|upright|Enjoying early success in New York, c. 1911]]
Berlin was "flabbergasted" by the sudden international popularity of the song, and wondered why it became a sudden hit. He decided it was partly because the lyrics, "silly though it was, was fundamentally right...[and] the melody... started the heels and shoulders of all America and a good section of Europe to rocking."&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|69}} In 1913, Berlin was featured in the London revue Hello Ragtime, where he introduced "[[That International Rag]]", a song he had written for the occasion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

;"Watch Your Step"
Furia writes that the international success of "Alexander's Ragtime Band"  gave [[ragtime]] "new life and sparked a national dance craze." Two dancers who expressed that craze were Irene and [[Vernon Castle]]. In 1914, Berlin wrote a ragtime revue, "Watch Your Step," which starred the couple and showcased their talents on stage. That musical revue became Berlin's first complete score with songs that "radiated musical and lyrical sophistication." Berlin's songs signified [[modernism]], and they signified the cultural struggle between Victorian gentility and the "purveyors of liberation, indulgence, and leisure," says Furia. The song "[[Play a Simple Melody]]" became the first of his famous "double" songs in which two different melodies and lyrics are [[counterpoint]]ed against one another.&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;audio: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaGkvhxcOWI "Play A Simple Melody", with Bing and Gary Crosby]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Variety'' called "Watch Your Step" the "first syncopated musical," where the "sets and the girls were gorgeous." Berlin was then twenty-six, and the success of the show was riding on his name alone. ''Variety'' said the show was a "terrific hit" from its opening night. It compared Berlin's newfound status as a composer with that of the Times building: "That youthful marvel of syncopated melody is proving things in "Watch Your Step", firstly that he is not alone a rag composer, and that he is one of the greatest lyric writers America has ever produced."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|173}}

Whitcomb also points out the irony that Russia, the country Berlin's family was forced to leave, flung itself into "the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania." [[Prince Felix Yusupov]], for instance, a recent Oxford undergraduate of Russian noble lineage and heir to the largest estate in Russia, was described by his dance partner as "wriggling around the ballroom like a demented worm, screaming for 'more ragtime and more champagne'."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|183}}

====Simple and romantic ballads====

[[File:Berlin-Jolson27.JPG|thumb|upright|left|With [[Al Jolson]] (r), star of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', c. 1927]]
Some of the songs Berlin created came out of his own sadness. For instance, in 1912 he married [[Dorothy Goetz]], the sister of songwriter [[E. Ray Goetz]]. She died six months later of [[typhoid fever]] contracted during their honeymoon in [[Havana]]. The song he wrote to express his grief, "When I Lost You," was his first ballad. It was an immediate popular hit and sold more than a million copies.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

He began to realize that ragtime was not a good musical style for serious romantic expression, and over the next few years adapted his style by writing more love songs.&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt; In 1915 he wrote the hit "I Love a Piano", a comical and erotic ragtime love song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/I-Love-A-Piano-lyrics-Irving-Berlin/61706587FB23D96F48256970000E8508 |title=I Love A Piano Lyrics – Irving Berlin |publisher=Sing365.com |date= |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1918 he had written hundreds of songs, mostly topical, which enjoyed brief popularity. Many of the songs were for the new dances then appearing, such as the "grizzly bear", "chicken walk", or fox trot. After a Hawaiian dance craze began, he wrote "That Hula-Hula", and then did a string of southern songs, such as "When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam". During this period, he was creating a few new songs every week, including songs aimed at the various immigrant cultures arriving from Europe. On one occasion, Berlin, whose face was still not known, was on a train trip and decided to entertain the fellow passengers with some music. They asked him how he knew so many hit songs, and Berlin modestly replied, "I wrote them."&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;{{rp|53}}

An important song that Berlin wrote during his transition from writing ragtime to lyrical ballads was "[[A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody]]," which became one of Berlin's "first big guns," says historian [[Alec Wilder]]. The song was written for [[Ziegfeld]]'s ''Follies of 1919'' and became the musical's lead song. Its popularity was so great that it later became the theme for all of Ziegfeld's revues, and the theme song in the 1936 film ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]''.&lt;ref&gt;video: [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3ick8_a-pretty-girl-is-like-a-melody-the_shortfilms "A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilder puts it on the same level as [[Jerome Kern]]'s "pure melodies," and in comparison with Berlin's earlier music, says it's "extraordinary that such a development in style and sophistication should have taken place in a single year."&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;{{rp|53}}

====World War I====
On April 1, 1917, after President [[Woodrow Wilson]] declared that America would enter [[World War I]], Berlin felt that [[Tin Pan Alley]] should do its duty and support the war with inspirational songs. Berlin wrote the song, "For Your Country and My Country", stating that "we must speak with the sword not the pen to show our appreciation to America for opening up her heart and welcoming every immigrant group." He also co-wrote a song aimed at ending ethnic conflict, "Let's All Be Americans Now."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|197}}

;"Yip Yip Yaphank"

In 1917, Berlin was drafted into the [[United States Army]], and the news of his induction became headline news, with one paper headline reading, "Army Takes Berlin!" But the Army wanted Berlin, now aged 30, to do what he knew best: write songs. While stationed with the [[152nd Depot Brigade]] at [[Camp Upton]], he then composed an all-soldier musical revue titled "[[Yip Yip Yaphank]]", written to be patriotic tribute to the [[United States Army]]. By the following summer, the show was taken to Broadway where it also included a number of hits, including "Mandy" and "Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning", which he performed himself.&lt;ref name="NYT-obit" /&gt;

The shows earned $150,000 for a camp service center. One song he wrote for the show but decided not to use, he would introduce twenty years later: "God Bless America."&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

===1920 to 1940===
[[File:Berlin-doorway.jpg|thumb|Circa 1920]]
[[File:IllSeeYouInCUBAcover.jpeg|thumb|''I'll See You in C-U-B-A'', cover of 1920 sheet music]]

Berlin returned to [[Tin Pan Alley]] after the war and in 1921 created a partnership with Sam Harris to build the [[Music Box Theater]]. He maintained an interest in the theater throughout his life, and even in his last years was known to call the [[Shubert Organization]], his partner, to check on the receipts. In its early years, the theater was a showcase for revues by Berlin. As theater owner, producer and composer, he looked after every detail of his shows, from the costumes and sets to the casting and musical arrangements.&lt;ref name=NYT-Dreaming&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2D71430F930A15751C1A9639C8B63 "Dreaming of Irving Berlin In the Season That He Owned"] ''New York Times'', December 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Berlin biographer David Leopold, the theater, located at 239 West 45th St., was the only Broadway house built to accommodate the works of a songwriter. It was the home of Berlin's "Music Box Revue" from 1921 to 1925 and "As Thousands Cheer" in 1933 and today includes an exhibition devoted to Berlin in the lobby.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, David. ''Irving Berlin's Show Business: Broadway—Hollywood—America'', Harry N. Abrams, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Various hit songs by Berlin====
By 1926, Berlin had written the scores to two editions of the ''Ziegfeld Follies'' and four "Music Box Revues." Berlin's "Music Box Revues" spanned the years of 1921-1926, premiering songs such as "Say It With Music", "Everybody Step", and "Pack Up Your Sings and Go to the Devil".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Life magazine'' called him the "Lullaby Kid", noting that "couples at country-club dances grew misty-eyed when the band went into "Always", because they were positive that Berlin had written it just for them. When they quarreled and parted in the bitter-sweetness of the 1920s, it was Berlin who gave eloquence to their heartbreak by way of "[[What'll I Do]]" and "Remember" and "All Alone."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

;"[[What'll I Do?]]" (1924)
This ballad of love and longing was a hit record for [[Paul Whiteman]] and had several other successful recordings in 1924. Twenty-four years later, the song went to no. 22 for [[Nat Cole]] and no. 23 for [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

;"Always" (1925)
Written when he fell in love with Ellin Mackay, who later became his wife. The song became a hit twice (for [[Vincent Lopez]] and [[George Olsen]]) in its first incarnation. There were four more hit versions in 1944–45. In 1959, [[Sammy Turner]] took the song to no. 2 on the R&amp;B chart. It became [[Patsy Cline]]'s postmortem anthem and hit no. 18 on the country chart in 1980, 17 years after her death, and a tribute musical called "Always... Patsy Cline", played a two-year [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] run that ended in 1995.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; [[Leonard Cohen]] included a cover of this song on his 1992 release ''[[The Future (Leonard Cohen album)]]''.

;"[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]" (1926)
Written after his first daughter's birth, he distilled his feelings about being married and a father for the first time: "Blue days, all of them gone; nothing but blue skies, from now on."&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt; The song was introduced by Belle Baker in ''Betsy'', a Ziegfeld production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It became hit recording for [[Ben Selvin]] and one of several Berlin hits in 1927, it was performed by [[Al Jolson]] in the first feature sound film, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', that same year. In 1946, it returned to the top 10 on the charts with [[Count Basie]] and [[Benny Goodman]]. In 1978, [[Willie Nelson]] made the song a no. 1 country hit, 52 years after it was written.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

;"[[Puttin' On the Ritz]]" (1928)
An instant standard with one of Berlin's most "intricately syncopated choruses", this song is associated with [[Fred Astaire]], who sang and danced to it in the 1946 film ''Blue Skies''. The song was written in 1928 with a separate set of lyrics and was introduced by [[Harry Richman]] in 1930 of the same name. In 1939, [[Clark Gable]] sang it in the movie ''Idiot's Delight''. In 1974 it was featured in the movie ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mel Brooks]], and was a no. 4 hit for the techno artist [[Taco Ockerse|Taco]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_W5QnO5UGk Taco - Puttin on the Ritz (1983)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was used for a [[flash mob]] wedding event in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNXd3wX_USc Flashmob Moscow (Russia) : Putting on the ritz 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

;"Marie" (1929)
This waltz-time song was a hit for [[Rudy Vallee]] in 1929, and in 1937, updated to a four-quarter-time [[swing music|swing]] arrangement, was a top hit for [[Tommy Dorsey]]. It was on the charts at no. 13 in 1953 for [[The Four Tunes]] and at no. 15 for [[the Bachelors]] in 1965, 36 years after its first appearance.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

;"Say It Isn't So" (1932)
[[Rudy Vallee]] performed it on his radio show, and the song was a hit for [[George Olsen]], [[Connee Boswell]] (she was still known as Connie), and [[Ozzie Nelson]]'s band. [[Aretha Franklin]] produced a single of the song in 1963, 31 years later.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; Furia notes that when Rudy Vallee first introduced the song on his radio show, the "song not only became an overnight hit, it saved Vallee's marriage: The Vallees had planned to get a divorce, but after Vallee sang Berlin's romantic lyrics on the air, "both he and his wife dissolved in tears" and decided to stay together.&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;

;"I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm" (1937)
Performed by [[Dick Powell]] in the 1937 film ''On the Avenue''. Later it had four top-12 versions, including by [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], who took it to no. 1.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

Berlin's daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, states that the song was actually "very personal" for her father, and was intended as an expression of his deep gratitude to the nation for merely "allowing" him, an immigrant raised in poverty, to become a successful songwriter.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{YouTube|9p-h-Ml-cXU|"Irving Berlin Spotlight Interview"}}&lt;/ref&gt; "To me," said Berlin, "'God Bless America' was not just a song but an expression of my feeling toward the country to which I owe what I have and what I am."&lt;ref&gt;Galewitz, Herb.

The song was heard after September 11, 2001, as U.S. senators and congressmen stood on the capitol steps and sang it after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. It is often played by sports teams such as major league baseball. The [[Philadelphia Flyers]] hockey team started playing it before crucial contests. When the 1980 [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|U.S. Olympic hockey team]] pulled off the "greatest upset in sports history," referred to as the "[[Miracle on Ice]]", the players spontaneously sang it as Americans were overcome by patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, John U., [http://annarborchronicle.com/2010/02/19/column-oh-say-can-you-see-a-new-anthem/ "Oh, Say Can You See a New Anthem?"] ''Ann Arbor Chronicle'', February 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/classic/s/miracle_ice_1980.html "College kids perform Olympic miracle"] ESPN TV network&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other songs====
Though most of his works for the Broadway stage took the form of revues—collections of songs with no unifying plot—he did write a number of book shows. ''[[The Cocoanuts]]'' (1929) was a light comedy with a cast featuring, among others, the [[Marx Brothers]]. ''[[Face the Music (musical)|Face the Music]]'' (1932) was a political satire with a book by [[Moss Hart]], and ''[[Louisiana Purchase (musical)|Louisiana Purchase]]'' (1940) was a satire of a Southern politician obviously based on the exploits of [[Huey Long]]. ''[[As Thousands Cheer]]'' (1933) was a revue, also with book by Moss Hart, with a theme: each number was presented as an item in a newspaper, some of them touching on issues of the day. The show yielded a succession of hit songs, including "[[Easter Parade (song)|Easter Parade]]" sung by Marilyn Miller and Clifton Webb, "[[Heat Wave (Irving Berlin song)|Heat Wave]]" (presented as the weather forecast), "Harlem on My Mind", and "[[Supper Time]]", a song about racial violence inspired by a newspaper headline about a lynching, sung by [[Ethel Waters]]. She once said about the song, "If one song can tell the whole tragic history of a race, 'Supper Time' was that song. In singing it I was telling my comfortable, well-fed, well-dressed listeners about my people...those who had been slaves and those who were now downtrodden and oppressed." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25205237|title=His eye is on the sparrow : an autobiography|last=1896-1977.|first=Waters, Ethel,|date=1992|publisher=Da Capo Press|others=Samuels, Charles.|isbn=0306804778|edition=1st Da Capo Press|location=New York|oclc=25205237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1941 to 1962===

====World War II patriotism—"This is the Army" (1943)====
[[File:Irving Berlin aboard the USS Arkansas, 944.jpg|thumb|Irving Berlin singing and conducting aboard [[USS Arkansas (BB-33)|USS Arkansas]], 1944]]
Berlin loved his country, and wrote many songs reflecting his patriotism. Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] requested a song to inspire Americans to buy [[war bond]]s, for which he wrote "Any Bonds Today?"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He assigned all royalties to the [[United States Treasury Department]]. He then wrote songs for various government agencies and likewise assigned all profits to them: "Angels of Mercy" for the [[American Red Cross]]; "Arms for the Love of America", for the [[Army Ordnance Department]]; and "I Paid My Income Tax Today,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/57008.html Danny Kaye's Musical Tribute to the Income Tax], George Mason's History News Network, November 14, 2008, retrieved April 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; again to Treasury.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

When the United States joined [[World War II]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, Berlin immediately began composing a number of patriotic songs. His most notable and valuable contribution to the war effort was a stage show he wrote called "[[This is the Army]]". It was taken to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and then on to [[Washington, D.C.]] (where President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] attended). It was eventually shown at military bases throughout the world, including London, North Africa, Italy, Middle East, and Pacific countries, sometimes in close proximity to battle zones. Berlin wrote nearly three dozen songs for the show which contained a cast of 300 men. He supervised the production and traveled with it, always singing "[[Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning]]". The show kept him away from his family for three and a half years, during which time he took neither salary nor expenses, and turned over all profits to the Army Emergency Relief Fund.&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt;{{rp|81}}

The play was adapted into a movie of the same name in 1943, directed by [[Michael Curtiz]], co-starring [[Joan Leslie]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], who was then an army lieutenant. [[Kate Smith]] also sang "God Bless America" in the film with a backdrop showing families anxious over the coming war. The show became a hit movie and a morale-boosting road show that toured the battlefronts of Europe.&lt;ref name=NYT-Barrett/&gt; The shows and movie combined raised more than $10 million for the Army,&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; and in recognition of his contributions to troop morale, Berlin was awarded the Medal of Merit by President [[Harry S. Truman]].  His daughter, [[Mary Ellin Barrett]], who was 15 when she was at the opening-night performance of "[[This is the Army]]" on Broadway, remembered that when her father, who normally shunned the spotlight, appeared in the second act in soldier's garb to sing "Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning," he was greeted with a standing ovation that lasted 10 minutes. She adds that he was in his mid-50's at the time, and later declared those years with the show were the "most thrilling time of his life."&lt;ref name=NYT-Barrett&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/20/books/books-of-the-times-recalling-the-somber-man-behind-so-many-happy-songs.html "BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Recalling the Somber Man Behind So Many Happy Songs"] ''New York Times'' (book review), January 20, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Annie Get Your Gun" (1946)====
The grueling tours Berlin did performing "This Is The Army" left him exhausted, but when his old and close friend [[Jerome Kern]], who was the composer for [[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|"Annie Get Your Gun"]], died suddenly, producers [[Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II]] persuaded Berlin to take over composing the score.

{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=What distinguishes Berlin is the brilliance of his lyrics. 'You Can't Get a Man With a Gun'—that's as good a comic song as has ever been written by anybody. You look at the jokes and how quickly they're told, and it still has a plot to it. It's sophisticated and very underrated.|source= — composer-lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]]&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank.[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/magazine/conversations-with-sondheim.html "Conversations With Sondheim"] ''New York Times,'' March 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGB7yTZEZE4 Betty Hutton sings "You Can't Get A Man With A Gun"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Loosely based on the life of sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]], the music and lyrics were written by Berlin, with a book by [[Herbert Fields]] and his sister [[Dorothy Fields]], and directed by [[Joshua Logan]]. At first Berlin refused to take on the job, claiming that he knew nothing about "[[hillbilly]] music", but the show ran for 1,147 performances and became his most successful score. It is said that the showstopper song, "[[There's No Business Like Show Business (song)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]", was almost left out of the show altogether because Berlin mistakenly thought that Rodgers and Hammerstein didn't like it. However, it became the "ultimate uptempo show tune."

On the origin of another of the play's leading songs, Logan described how he and Hammerstein privately discussed wanting another duet between Annie and Frank. Berlin overheard their conversation, and although the show was to go into rehearsal within days, he wrote the song [[Anything You Can Do (song)|"Anything You Can Do"]] a few hours later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudOp3XGZNA "Ethel Merman, Joshua Logan, 90th Birthday Tribute to Irving Berlin"]&lt;/ref&gt;

One reviewer commented about the play's score, that "its tough wisecracking lyrics are as tersely all-knowing as its melody, which is nailed down in brassy syncopated lines that have been copied—but never equaled in sheer melodic memorability—by hundreds of theater composers ever since."&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt; Singer and musicologist, Susannah McCorkle writes that the score "meant more to me than ever, now that I knew that he wrote it after a grueling world tour and years of separation from his wife and daughters."&lt;ref name=McCorkle&gt;{{cite magazine |last=McCorkle |first=Susannah |title=Always: A Singer's Journey Through the Life of Irving Berlin |magazine=American Heritage |date=November 1998 |volume=49 |pages=74–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}} Historian and composer [[Alec Wilder]] says that the perfection of the score, when compared to his earlier works, was "a profound shock."&lt;ref name=Wilder/&gt;{{rp|94}}

Apparently the "creative spurt" in which Berlin turned out several songs for the score in a single weekend was an anomaly. According to his daughter, he usually "sweated blood" to write his songs.&lt;ref name=NYT-Barrett/&gt; ''Annie Get Your Gun'' is considered to be Berlin's best musical theatre score not only because of the number of hits it contains, but because its songs successfully combine character and plot development. The song "There's No Business Like Show Business" became "[[Ethel Merman]]'s trademark."&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;

====Final shows====
Berlin's next show, ''[[Miss Liberty]]'' (1949), was disappointing, but ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' in 1950, starring [[Ethel Merman]] as Sally Adams, a Washington, D.C. socialite, loosely based on the famous Washington hostess [[Perle Mesta]], fared better, giving him his second greatest success. After a failed attempt at retirement, in 1962, at the age of 74, he returned to Broadway  with ''[[Mr. President (musical)|Mr. President]]''. Although it ran for eight months, (with the premiere attended by President [[John F. Kennedy]]), it was not one of his successful plays.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

Afterwards, Berlin officially announced his retirement and spent his remaining years in New York. He did, however, write one new song, "An Old-Fashioned Wedding," for the 1966 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' starring [[Ethel Merman]].  Though he lived 23 more years, this was one of Berlin's final published compositions.

Berlin maintained a low profile through the last decades of his life, almost never appearing in public after the late 1960s, even for events held in his honor.  However, he continued to maintain control of his songs through his own music publishing company, which remained in operation for the rest of his life.

==Film scores==

===1920s–1950s===

In 1927, his song "[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]", was featured in the first feature-length [[talkie]], ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', with [[Al Jolson]]. Later, movies like ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935) became the first of a series of distinctive film musicals by Berlin starring performers like [[Bing Crosby]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and [[Alice Faye]]. ''Top Hat'' featured a brand new score, as did several more, including ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936), ''[[On the Avenue]]'' (1937), ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' (1938), and ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939). Starting with ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'' (1938), he often blended new songs with existing ones from his catalog. He continued this process with the films ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942), ''[[Blue Skies (1946 film)|Blue Skies]]'' (1946) and ''[[Easter Parade (1948 film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Fred Astaire]], and ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'' (1954).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===="White Christmas" (1942)====
The 1942 film ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' introduced "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]", one of the most recorded songs in history. First sung in the film by [[Bing Crosby]] (along with [[Marjorie Reynolds]], whose voice was dubbed by [[Martha Mears]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-marjorie-reynolds-1278697.html|title=Obituary: Marjorie Reynolds|date=1997-02-15|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it has sold over 50 million records and stayed no. 1 on the pop and R&amp;B charts for 10 weeks. Crosby's version is the [[List of best selling singles|best-selling single]] of all time. Music critic [[Stephen Holden]] credits this partly to the fact that "the song also evokes a primal nostalgia—a pure childlike longing for roots, home and childhood—that goes way beyond the greeting imagery."&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;

[[Richard Corliss]] also notes that the song was even more significant having been released soon after America entered [[World War II]]: [it] "connected with... GIs in their first winter away from home. To them it voiced the ache of separation and the wistfulness they felt for the girl back home, for the innocence of youth...."&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; Poet [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote, "We have learned to be a little sad and a little lonesome without being sickly about it. This feeling is caught in the song of a thousand jukeboxes and tune whistled in streets and homes. "I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas'. When we sing that we don't hate anybody. And there are things we love that we're going to have sometimes if the breaks are not too bad against us. Way down under this latest hit of his, Irving Berlin catches us where we love peace."&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"White Christmas" won Berlin the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Music in an Original Song, one of seven Oscar nominations he received during his career. In subsequent years, it was re-recorded and became a top-10 seller for numerous artists: [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Jo Stafford]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[The Ravens]] and [[The Drifters]]. It would also be the last time a Berlin song went to no. 1 upon its release.

Berlin is the only Academy Award presenter and Academy Award winner to open the "envelope" and read his or her own name (for "White Christmas"). This result was so awkward for Berlin (since he had to present the Oscar to himself) that the Academy changed the rules of protocol the following year to prevent this situation from arising again.

Talking about Irving Berlin's "White Christmas", composer–lyricist Garrison Hintz stated that although songwriting can be a complicated process, its final result should sound simplistic. Considering the fact that "White Christmas" has only eight sentences in the entire song, lyrically Mr. Berlin achieved all that was necessary to eventually sell over 100 million copies and capture the hearts of the American public at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Ascap magazine article, Tribute to Irving Berlin December 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songwriting methods==
According to Saul Bornstein (a.k.a. Sol Bourne, Saul Bourne), Berlin's publishing company manager, "It was a ritual for Berlin to write a complete song, words and music, every day."&lt;ref name=Wilder&gt;Wilder, Alec. ''American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900–1950'', Oxford Univ. Press (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}} Berlin has said that he "does not believe in inspiration," and feels that although he may be gifted in certain areas, his "most successful compositions were the "result of work." He said that he did most of his work under pressure. He would typically begin writing after dinner and continue until 4 or 5 in the morning. "Each day I would attend rehearsals," he said, "and at night write another song and bring it down the next day."&lt;ref name=NYT-1916/&gt;

Not always certain about his own writing abilities, he once asked a songwriter friend, [[Victor Herbert]], whether he should study composition. "You have a natural gift for words and music," Mr. Herbert told him. "Learning theory might help you a little, but it could cramp your style." Berlin took his advice. Herbert later became a moving force behind the creation of ASCAP, the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]. In 1914, Berlin joined him as a charter member of the organization that has protected the royalties of composers and writers ever since.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; In 1920, Irving Berlin became a member of [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|SACEM]], the French Society of Authors, Composers, and Publishers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In later years, Berlin emphasized his conviction, saying that "it's the lyrics that makes a song a hit, although the tune, of course, is what makes it last."&lt;ref name=Furia/&gt;{{rp|234}} He played almost entirely in the key of [[F-sharp major|F sharp]] so that he could stay on the black notes and owned three transposing pianos so as to change keys by moving a lever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2664/if-irving-berlin-could-not-read-or-write-music-how-did-he-compose|title=The Straight Dope: If Irving Berlin couldn't read or write music, how did he compose?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Berlin eventually learned to write music, he never changed his method of dictating songs to a "musical secretary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/708648754|title=The Irving Berlin reader|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Sears, Benjamin.|isbn=0195383745|location=New York|oclc=708648754}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Berlin never learned to play in more than one key and used two special pianos (his first piano, purchased second-hand in 1909, was made by Weser Brothers, augmented in 1921 by a second from Somner Brothers) with transposing levers to change keys. Berlin demonstrated his transposing keyboard during a television show with Dinah Shore, and the piano was placed on display in Belgium's Red Star Line Museum in 2013, on loan from the Emmet family. A second transposing piano is on loan from the Peters family to the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia.}}

As a result, Wilder says that many admirers of the music of [[Jerome Kern]], [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Cole Porter]] were unlikely to consider Berlin's work in the same category because they forgot or never realized that Berlin wrote many popular tunes, such as "Soft Lights and Sweet Music," "Supper Time," and "Cheek to Cheek." Some are even more confused because he also wrote more romantic melodies, such as "What'll I Do?" and "Always."&lt;ref name=Wilder/&gt; Wilder adds that "in his lyrics as in his melodies, Berlin reveals a constant awareness of the world around him: the pulse of the times, the society in which his is functioning. There is nothing of the hothouse about his work, urban though it may be."&lt;ref name=Wilder/&gt;

==Music styles==
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = LightCyan|quote=His music has that vitality—both rhythmic and melodic—which never seems to lose any of its exuberant freshness; it has that rich, colorful melodic flow which is ever the wonder of all those of who, too, compose songs; his ideas are endless.|source= — composer [[George Gershwin]]&lt;ref name=Gershwin&gt;Wyatt, Robert; Johnson, John A. ''The George Gershwin Reader'', Oxford Univ. Press (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}}}}

Composer [[Jerome Kern]] recognized that the essence of Irving Berlin's lyrics was his "faith in the American vernacular" and was so profound that his best-known songs "seem indivisible from the country's history and self-image." Kern, along with [[George Gershwin]], [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] and [[Cole Porter]] brought together Afro-American, Latin American, rural pop, and European operetta.&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;

Berlin, however, did not follow that method. Instead, says music critic [[Stephen Holden]], Berlin's songs were always simple, "exquisitely crafted street songs whose diction feels so natural that one scarcely notices the craft....they seem to flow straight out of the rhythms and inflections of everyday speech."&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt; It led composer [[George Gershwin]] to claim that he learned from Berlin that ragtime, which later became jazz, "was the only musical idiom in existence that could aptly express America."&lt;ref name=Gershwin/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Among Berlin's contemporaries was Cole Porter, whose music style was often considered more "witty, sophisticated, [and] dirty," according to musicologist [[Susannah McCorkle]]. Of the five top songwriters, only Porter and Berlin wrote both their own words and music. However, she notes that Porter, unlike Berlin, was a [[Yale]]-educated and wealthy Midwesterner whose songs were not successful until he was in his thirties. She notes further that it was "Berlin [who] got Porter the show that launched his career."&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt;{{rp|76}}

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
In 1912, he married [[Dorothy Goetz]], the sister of the songwriter [[E. Ray Goetz]]. She died six months later of [[typhoid fever]], which she contracted during their honeymoon in [[Havana]]. The song he wrote to express his grief, "When I Lost You," was his first ballad.

[[File:IrvingBerlinEllenMackayBain.jpg|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;With wife Ellin, c. 1920s&lt;/center&gt;]]
Years later in the 1920s, he fell in love with a young heiress, Ellin Mackay, the daughter of [[Clarence Mackay]], the socially prominent head of the Postal Telegraph Cable Company, and an author in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krebs|first1=Albin|title=Ellin berlin, 85, a Novelist, Dies; The Songwriter's Wife of 62 Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/30/obituaries/ellin-berlin-85-a-novelist-dies-the-songwriter-s-wife-of-62-years.html|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Berlin was Jewish and she was a Catholic of [[Ireland|Irish]] descent, their life was followed in every possible detail by the press, which found the romance of an immigrant from the Lower East Side and a young heiress a good story.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

They met in 1924, and her father opposed the match from the start. He went so far as to send her off to Europe to find other suitors and forget Berlin. However, Berlin wooed her with letters and song over the airwaves such as  "Remember" and "[[All Alone (Irving Berlin song)|All Alone]]," and she wrote him daily.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite book|title=Irving Berlin: a daughter's memoir|author=Mary Ellin Barrett|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=9780671711498|pages=98–99; 123–124|quote=All three of us would share our father's agnosticism and sidestep our husbands' faiths. ...If I can picture my father, the nonbeliever, it is listening to the reading, learning just like me, for he had long ago forgotten the story, pleased that this is what my mother and I are doing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Philip Furia]] writes that newspapers rumored they were engaged before she returned from Europe, and some Broadway shows even performed skits of the "lovelorn songwriter." After her return, she and Berlin were besieged by the press, which followed them everywhere. ''Variety'' reported that her father vowed that their marriage "would only happen 'over my dead body.'"&lt;ref name=Furia/&gt; As a result, they decided to elope and were married in a simple civil ceremony at the Municipal Building away from media attention.

The wedding news made the front-page of the ''New York Times''. The marriage took her father by surprise, and he was stunned upon reading about it. The bride's mother, however, who was at the time divorced from Mackay, wanted her daughter to follow the dictates of her own heart. Berlin had gone to her mother's home before the wedding and had obtained her blessing.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE7D81539E633A25756C0A9679C946795D6CF Ellin Mackay Wed to Irving Berlin; Surprises Father]", ''New York Times'', page one, January 5, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;

There followed reports that the bride's father now disowned his daughter because of the marriage. In response, Berlin gave the rights to "Always", a song still played at weddings, to her as a wedding present.&lt;ref name="FuriaWood1998" /&gt; Ellin Mackay was thereby guaranteed a steady income regardless of what might happen with the marriage. For years, Mackay refused to speak to the Berlins, but they reconciled after the Berlins lost their first son, Irving Berlin Jr., on Christmas Eve in 1928, less than one month after he was born.&lt;ref name="FuriaWood1998" /&gt;

Their marriage remained a love affair and they were inseparable until she died in July 1988 at the age of 85. They had four children during their 63 years of marriage: Irving, who died in infancy on Christmas Day 1928; [[Mary Ellin Barrett]], Elizabeth Irving Peters and Linda Louise Emmet.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

===Lifestyle===
In 1916, in the earlier phase of Berlin's career, producer and composer [[George M. Cohan]], during a toast to the young Berlin at a [[New York Friars' Club|Friar's Club]] dinner in his honor, said, "The thing I like about Irvie is that although he has moved up-town and made lots of money, it hasn't turned his head.

''Irving Berlin: A Life in Song'' Schirmer Books, (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He never forgot those childhood years when he "slept under tenement steps, ate scraps, and wore secondhand clothes," and described those years as hard but good. "Every man should have a Lower East Side in his life," he said. He used to visit ''The Music Box Theater'', which he founded and which still stands at 239 West Forty-Fifth St. From 1947 to 1989, Berlin's home in New York City was 17 [[Beekman Place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20110714/murray-hill-gramercy/irving-berlins-former-beekman-place-home-chronicled-new-book|title=Irving Berlin's Former Beekman Place Home Chronicled in New Book|work=DNAinfo New York|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120412/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20110714/murray-hill-gramercy/irving-berlins-former-beekman-place-home-chronicled-new-book|archivedate=August 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Frazier of ''Life'' magazine found Berlin to be "intensely nervous," with a habit of tapping his listener with his index finger to emphasize a point, and continually pressing his hair down in back" and "picking up any stray crumbs left on a table after a meal." While listening, "he leans forward tensely, with his hands clasped below his knees like a prizefighter waiting in his corner for the bell.... For a man who has known so much glory," writes Frazier, "Berlin has somehow managed to retain the enthusiasm of a novice."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

Berlin's daughter wrote in her memoir that her father was a loving, if workaholic, family man who was "basically an upbeat person, with down periods." In his final decades he retreated from public life.&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt; Her parents liked to celebrate every single holiday with their children, and "They seemed to understand the importance, particularly in childhood, of the special day, the same every year, the special stories, foods, and decorations and that special sense of well-being that accompanies a holiday."&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt;{{rp|80}} Although he did comment to his daughter about her mother's lavish Christmas spending, "I gave up trying to get your mother to economize. It was easier just to make more money."

Berlin voted for both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates,&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt; but he supported the presidential candidacy of General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and his song "I Like Ike" featured prominently in the Eisenhower campaign. In his later years he also became more conservative in his views on music. According to his daughter, "He was consumed by patriotism." He often said, "I owe all my success to my adopted country" and once rejected his lawyers' advice to invest in [[tax shelters]], insisting, "I ''want'' to pay taxes. I love this country."&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt;{{rp|80}}

Berlin was a [[Freemason]], and was a member of Munn Lodge no. 190, New York City, the Scottish Rite Valley of New York City, and Mecca Shrine Temple.&lt;ref name="NYmasons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html | website=Grand Lodge of the State of New York | title=Famous Masons I: Dreamers and Doers |accessdate=January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110010123/http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin was a staunch advocate of civil rights. Berlin was honored in 1944 by the National Conference of Christians and Jews for "advancing the aims of the conference to eliminate religious and racial conflict."&lt;ref name=jonon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amuseum.org/jahf/virtour/page21.html |title=Jewish-American Hall of Fame – Virtual Tour |publisher=Amuseum.org |date=January 15, 2007 |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1943 production "This Is The Army", was the first integrated division army unit in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/michael-feinsteins-american-songbook/irving-berlin-this-is-the-army.php|title=Segregation and Musicals During World War II {{!}} Michael Feinstein's American Songbook {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) honored him as one the twelve "most outstanding Americans of Jewish faith."&lt;ref name=jonon /&gt; While he was culturally Jewish, he was religiously agnostic.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt; Berlin's Civil Rights Movement support also made him a target of FBI Director [[J.

==Death==
[[File:Irving Berlin Grave 1024.jpg|thumb|The grave of Irving Berlin in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], [[the Bronx]], New York City]]
Berlin died in his sleep on September 22, 1989, of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]], in New York City, at the age of 101. He was interred in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

On the evening following the announcement of his death, the marquee lights of Broadway playhouses were dimmed before curtain time in his memory. President [[George H. W. Bush]] said Berlin was "a legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of our nation." Just minutes before the President's statement was released, he joined a crowd of thousands to sing Berlin's "God Bless America" at a luncheon in Boston. Former President [[Ronald Reagan]], who costarred in Berlin's 1943 musical ''This Is the Army,'' said, "Nancy and I are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions and will live on forever."&lt;ref name=NYT9-24/&gt;

[[Morton Gould]], the composer and conductor who was president of the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP), of which Berlin was a founder, said, "What to me is fascinating about this unique genius is that he touched so many people in so many age groups over so many years. He sounded our deepest feelings—happiness, sadness, celebration, loneliness." [[Ginger Rogers]], who danced to Berlin tunes with [[Fred Astaire]], told The Associated Press upon hearing of his death that working with Berlin had been "like heaven."&lt;ref name=NYT9-24&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/nyregion/berlin-s-work-is-recalled-with-words-and-music.html "Berlin's Work Is Recalled With Words and Music"] ''New York Times'', September 24, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|After his death, Irving Berlin's three daughters donated the songwriter's musical collection of 750,000 items to the music archives of the Library of Congress.}}

''[[The New York Times]]'', after his death in 1989, wrote, "Irving Berlin set the tone and the tempo for the tunes America played and sang and danced to for much of the 20th century."  An immigrant from Russia, his life became the "classic rags-to-riches story that he never forgot could have happened only in America."&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; During his career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs&lt;ref name=NYT-Dreaming/&gt; and was a legend by the time he turned 30. He went on to write the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with his songs nominated for [[Academy Awards]] on eight occasions. Music historian [[Susannah McCorkle]] writes that "in scope, quantity, and quality his work was amazing."&lt;ref name=McCorkle/&gt; Others, such as Broadway musician Anne Phillips, says simply that "the man is an American institution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cabaret.broadwayworld.com/article/SING_SING_SING_Salutes_Irving_Berlin_At_The_Triad_127_20101103 "SING! SING! SING! Salutes Irving Berlin"] Broadwayworld.com, November 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During his six-decade career, from 1907 to 1966, he produced sheet music, Broadway shows, recordings, and scores played on radio, in films and on television, and his tunes continue to evoke powerful emotions for millions around the world. He wrote songs like "Alexander's Ragtime Band," "Cheek to Cheek", "There's No Business Like Show Business", "Blue Skies" and "Puttin' On the Ritz." Some of his songs have become holiday anthems, such as "[[Easter Parade (song)|Easter Parade]]", "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" and "[[Happy Holiday (song)|Happy Holiday]]". "White Christmas" alone sold over 50 million records, the top single selling song in recording history, won an [[ASCAP]] and an [[Academy Award]], and is one of the most frequently played songs ever written.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;

In 1938, "[[God Bless America]]" became the unofficial national anthem of the United States, and on September 11, 2001, members of the House of Representatives stood on the steps of the Capitol and solemnly sang "God Bless America" together. The song returned to no. 1 shortly after 9/11, when [[Celine Dion]] recorded it as the title track of a 9/11 benefit album. The following year, the [[Postal Service]] issued a commemorative stamp of Berlin. By then, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of New York had received more than $10 million in royalties from "God Bless America" as a result of Berlin's donation of royalties.&lt;ref name=NYT-Dreaming/&gt; According to music historian [[Gary Giddins]], "No other songwriter has written as many anthems.... No one else has written as many pop songs, period... [H]is gift for economy, directness, and slang, presents Berlin as an obsessive, often despairing commentator on the passing scene."&lt;ref&gt;Giddins, Gary. ''Weather Bird: Jazz at the Dawn of its Second Century'', Oxford Univ. Press (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|405}}

In 1934, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19340528,00.html|title=TIME Magazine Cover: Irving Berlin - May 28, 1934|website=TIME.com|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; put him on its cover and inside hailed "this itinerant son of a Russian cantor" as "an American institution."&lt;ref name=DVD&gt;''Irving Berlin: An American Song'', film, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; And again, in 1943, the same magazine described his songs as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They possess a permanence not generally associated with [[Tin Pan Alley]] products and it is more than remotely possible that in days to come Berlin will be looked upon as the [[Stephen Foster]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Life&gt;Frazier, George. ''Life Magazine'', April 5, 1943, pgs. 79–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At various times, his songs were also rallying cries for different causes: He produced musical editorials supporting [[Al Smith]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]] as presidential candidates, he wrote songs opposing [[Prohibition]], defending the [[gold standard]], calming the wounds of the [[Great Depression]], and helping the war against [[Hitler]], and in 1950 he wrote an anthem for the state of Israel.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; Biographer David Leopold adds that "We all know his songs... they are all part of who we are."

At his 100th-birthday celebration in May 1988, violinist [[Isaac Stern]] said, "The career of Irving Berlin and American music were intertwined forever—American music was born at his piano,"&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; while songwriter [[Sammy Cahn]] pointed out:  "If a man, in a lifetime of 50 years, can point to six songs that are immediately identifiable, he has achieved something. Irving Berlin can sing 60 that are immediately identifiable... [Y]ou couldn't have a holiday without his permission."&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; Composer [[Douglas Moore]] added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a rare gift which sets Irving Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters. It is a gift which qualifies him, along with [[Stephen Foster]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Vachel Lindsay]] and [[Carl Sandburg]], as a great American minstrel. He has caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[ASCAP]]'s records show that 25 of Berlin's songs reached the top of the charts and were re-recorded by dozens of famous singers over the years, such as [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Doris Day]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. In 1924, when Berlin was 36, his biography, ''The Story of Irving Berlin'', was being written by [[Alexander Woollcott]]. In a letter to Woollcott, [[Jerome Kern]] offered what one writer said "may be the last word" on the significance of Irving Berlin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Irving Berlin has no ''place'' in American music—he ''is'' American music. Emotionally, he honestly absorbs the vibrations emanating from the people, manners and life of his time and, in turn, gives these impressions back to the world—simplified, clarified and glorified.&lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Composer [[George Gershwin]] (1898–1937) also tried to describe the importance of Berlin's compositions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to say at once that I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the greatest songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and each one of them is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's [[Schubert]]. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.&lt;ref name=Gershwin/&gt;{{rp|117}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Izvestia''''' ({{lang-rus|Известия|p=ɪzˈvʲesʲtʲɪjə}}) is a daily [[broadsheet]] [[newspaper]] in [[Russia]]. It was a [[Newspaper of record#Newspapers of record (by reputation)|newspaper of record]] in the [[Soviet Union]] from 1917 until the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastview.com/Files/EVIzvestiiaDA.pdf|title=Izvestiia Digital Archive 1917-2010. Online access to the Kremlin’s newspaper of record|publisher=East View Information Services |location=Minneapolis, MN|page=5|format=pdf|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''izvestiya'' in Russian means "delivered messages", derived from the verb ''izveshchat'' ("to inform", "to notify"). In the context of newspapers it is usually translated as "news" or "reports".

==Origin==
The newspaper began as the ''News of the [[Petrograd Soviet]] of Workers Deputies'' on {{OldStyleDate|13 March|1917|28 February}} in [[Petrograd]]. Initially, the paper expressed [[Menshevik]] and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] views.

In August 1917, it took the title ''News of the Central Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies''. By October 1917 it became ''News of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Working and Military Deputies'', and was eventually retitled ''News of the Soviets of People's Deputies''.

After the Second All-Union Congress of Soviets, ''Izvestia'' became an official newspaper of the Soviet government (Central Executive Committee of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] and [[Sovnarkom]]).

==History==
===1917–1991===
[[File:Izvestia logo old.png|thumb|right|200px|Old ''Izvestia'' logo. It uses two letters that are no longer used in the Russian language (see [[Reforms of Russian orthography]]).]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, while ''[[Pravda]]'' served as the official mouthpiece of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], ''Izvestia'' expressed the official views of the Soviet government as published by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Andrei G. Richter|title=The Russian Press after Perestroika|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|date=1995|volume=20|issue=1|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/842/748|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full name was ''Izvestiya Sovetov Narodnykh Deputatov SSSR'' (in Russian, ''Известия Советов народных депутатов СССР'', the ''Reports of Soviets of Peoples' Deputies of the USSR'').

===1992–present===
Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], ''Izvestia'' now describes itself as a "national" newspaper of [[Russia]]. The newspaper was owned by a vast holding company of [[Vladimir Potanin]] which had close ties with the government.&lt;ref name=gse&gt;{{cite web|last=Bigg|first=Claire |title=Russia: State-Owned Gazprom Buys Leading Independent Daily 'Izvestiya'|work=GlobalSecurity|date=3 June 2005 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2005/russia-050603-rferl01.htm|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A controlling stake in ''Izvestia'' was purchased by state-owned [[Gazprom]] on 3 June 2005, and included in the [[Gazprom Media]] holding.&lt;ref name=gse/&gt; According to the allegations of the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], Raf Shakirov, editor-in-chief of ''Izvestia'', was forced to resign because the government officials did not like the paper's coverage of the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpj.org/attacks05/europe05/russia_05.html Attacks 2005: Europe and Central Asia].

Its 2007 circulation certified by TNS Gallup Media was 371,000 copies.&lt;ref name=bbc8&gt;{{cite news|title=Main papers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4315129.stm|accessdate=6 October 2013|work=BBC|date=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until his death on 1 October 2008, the chief artist was [[Boris Yefimov]], the centenarian illustrator who had worked as [[Joseph Stalin]]'s political cartoonist.

In 2008, Gazprom Media sold ''Izvestia'' to [[National Media Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nm-g.ru/en/about/ - About Us] National Media Group &lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper was relaunched in D2 ([[broadsheet]]) format after that and adopted a new slogan ("Making ''Izvestia'' [i.e., reports] from the news"), as well as extended simultaneously its business coverage. The paper's old business section, '''Finansovye Izvestia''' (Finance Izvestia), was closed, and '''Marker Weekly''' was launched instead in September 2011, distributed with ''Izvestia'' on Mondays. The Friday appendix '''Nedelya''' (The Week), devoted to culture and leisure activities, was relaunched as well.

Almost forty years later, these decks fetch upwards of $200–500 per deck on the second-hand market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://decemberboys.com.ua/en/shop/jerrys-nugget/ "Jerry's Nugget Playing Cards"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:JerrysTower.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Jerry's Nugget|Jerry's Nugget Casino]], North Las Vegas, Nevada]]
Jerry's Nugget playing cards were supposedly printed in the 1970s for the gaming tables, but never saw any action at the gambling table.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, Lee (31 May 2009). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_htHzYWtAg "Jerry's Nugget Playing Cards Hidden Secret - The Box is the Key to Unlocking the Secret"]. YouTube. Retrieved 7 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; They were immediately sold in the gift store thereafter. The classic Jerry's Nugget playing cards were made from top of the line [[United States Playing Card Company]] card stock, that is not available today, which makes the cards much thinner than today's playing cards. The Playing Card Company also used a chemical finish then, which is also not available today due to environmental reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dananddave.com/editorial/jerrys-nugget-playing-cards/ "Jerry’s Nugget Playing Cards by Dan and Dave"] (7 December 2011). Dan&amp;Dave. Retrieved 6 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerry's Nugget playing cards were printed in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and then were driven to the North Las Vegas casino via trucks where they sat in storage for many years. The highly prized playing card eventually sold out in the summer of 1999. In 2000, a private collector purchased the remaining stock of 40,000 decks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artofplay.com/products/jerrys-nugget-casino-playing-cards "Jerry's Nuggets"]. Dan&amp;Dave. Retrieved 7 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry's Nugget Casino does not have any plans to reprint them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeasher.com/playing_cards/jerrys_nugget/index.html "How Did Jerry's Nugget Playing Cards Gain Their Cult Status?"]. LeeAsher. Retrieved 7 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jerry's fans, there is something different about the cards that makes them perfect for different types of moves and flourishes.&lt;ref&gt;"Allen, Stan (August 2010). [http://www.mylovelyassistant.com/products/view/14785 "Tools of the Trade By Jason England"]. MAGIC. Volume 19, number 12, page 39-48. Retrieved 28 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dai Vernon]], [[Larry Jennings]], [[Ed Marlo]], [[Lee Asher]], Frank Simon, Chris Kenner, Earl Nelson, Dan &amp; Dave Buck, Wayne Houchin, and many other notable sleight of hand artists have been seen playing with Jerry's Nugget playing cards. The playing cards are stiff, hold their form, and are easily manipulated. Flourishers have taken a liking to these pasteboards as well.

==Design==
The backs display fields of red or blue with an image of the oil derrick sign that graces the parking lot of the casino. The Jerry's Nugget [[oil derrick]] appears on the deck's [[joker (playing card)|joker]] as well.

==Counterfeit==
In 2008, sophisticated [[counterfeit]]ers super-saturated the market with fake Jerry's Nugget playing cards. Random videos started appearing on [[YouTube]] from upset purchasers. While the illegal versions look remarkably genuine, most playing card experts can tell the difference easily, as the fake decks were made from cheap cardboard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LocMnE-KEU8 "Fake Jerry's Nuggets Playing Cards"] (27 May 2008). YouTube. Retrieved 6 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the signs would be that of the box. The stamp on the legitimate version of the deck is blue and off center. Another sign would be on the flap, a long flap with no context on it. If you cut open the box and look inside there will be a printed year on the side. Last but not least would be the color, the originals are off white and lightly yellowed.

==Life==
Joseffy came to the United States of America at the age of 19 where he worked at a Chicago Magic Store, building props and [[Magic (illusion)|illusions]]. He invented a self-contained, no-thread version of The Rising Cards that astounded magicians of his day.&lt;ref name=nook&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magicnook.com/forum/bioHIJ.htm |title=Biographies Page H–I–J}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his mechanical creations was "Balsamo, the [[Brazen head|Living Skull]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Phelps Abbott|title=The Marvelous Creations of Joseffy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nt43AQAAIAAJ|year=1908|publisher=Open Court Publishing Company|page=7}}; Peabody, J. L. 'Spirit Pictures and a Speaking Skull.'  ''Popular Mechanics Magazine.''39:6 pp. 817-820.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseffy was a performer at [[Coney Island]] as the [[Chautauqua]] &amp; [[Lyceum]] headliner, and also played violin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floraco.com/lyceum/ |title=Chautauqua &amp; Lyceum Magicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American poet [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote a promotional booklet entitled simply ''Joseffy'' (1910).&lt;ref name=nook /&gt;

Joseffy eventually stopped performing and became an electrical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Joseffy |title=Joseffy MagicPedia entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being very secretive about his inventions, it's been stated that in his book, ''The Marvelous Creations of Joseffy'' by David P. Abbott (1908), he either faked the photographs or showed apparatus that he did not actually use in the tricks to mislead the readers to the genuine secrets.

'''LeoVegas''' is a Swedish mobile gaming company and provider of [[online casino]] and [[sports betting]] services such as [[table game]]s, [[Slot machine|video slots]], progressive jackpots, [[video poker]] and live betting to a number of international markets. LeoVegas Gaming Ltd. is a [[subsidiary]] of LeoVegas AB, the [[parent company]] whose stock is traded on the [[Nasdaq First North|Nasdaq First North Premier]] list at the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]].

== Corporate History ==
Leovegas was founded in 2011 by Gustaf Hagman (Group CEO) and Robin Ramm-Ericson (Chairman of the Board &amp; CXO) with the vision to create the ultimate mobile gaming experience and be number one in mobile casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leovegasgroup.com/en/|title=Välkommen till LeoVegas AB  - The mobile gaming company|website=leovegasgroup.com|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LeoVegas has experienced rapid growth due to the overriding increase of smartphone use and a [http://hugin.info/171540/R/2013640/746291.pdf “mobile first”] mentality of its founders.

'''MNB''' is an onscreen brand of what is officially known in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] as '''''Монголын Үндэсний Олон Нийтийн Телевиз 1''''' ({{Language with name/for||Mongolian|Mongolian National Public Television 1}}, shortened as ''МҮОНТ-1''), is a [[television channel]] owned by the [[Mongolian National Broadcaster]] (MNB), the official, state-funded broadcaster in [[Mongolia]]. On average, the channel broadcasts for 17 hours a day, from 07:00 to midnight.

==History==
On September 27, 1967, the Mongolian National Television started broadcasts, and with it started Mongolian TV Broadcasting. Initially all programmes were broadcast live but in December 1971 the Mongolian TV studios opened and another important step towards improving the quality of the images and enabling the pre-recording of documentaries and short films was taken. This in turn enabled the broadcast schedule to become much more varied and entertaining. Since the 1980s Mongolian National Broadcaster began working with a new generation of equipment made in Japan, France and Russia and this, along with a new TV centre being put into commission, made the transition to colour possible.

Until the mid-1980s  programs were only watched by a small percentage of the population but with the help of radio relay lines reception was extended. In 1991 it began broadcasting via the [[AsiaSat 1|Asiasat]] satellite and this allowed its programs to be received in even the remotest parts of Mongolia. Today some 70% of the country's population watch the national TV channel.

'''Veronica Ngô Thanh Vân''' (born 1979) is a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] actress, singer and model. She is also known as '''Veronica Ngo''' or her initials''' NTV'''.

==Early life and education==

Ngo was born on February 26, 1979, in [[Trà Vinh]], [[Vietnam]]. When she was 10, she moved to [[Norway]] with her family, but later relocated to Vietnam to pursue an entertainment career.

In 1999, Ngo returned to Vietnam where she participated in a [[beauty pageant]] organized by the magazine ''Women's World'', and finished as second runner-up. Following this initial success, she launched her modelling career in Vietnam as a model for magazines, calendars, and fashion collections. Soon after, she had her first acting role on the small screen in ''Huong De'', a short TV series on HTV Channel.

==Career==
===Music career===
In 2002, Ngo transitioned into the music scene as a pop-dance singer with the help of producer Quoc Bao. She recorded the duet album called ''Vuon Tinh Nhan (Lovers' Garden)'' with established singer Tuan Hung.

One year later, again with the help of producer Quoc Bao, Ngo released her debut solo album, ''The Gioi Tro Choi (Playworld)'', on February 26. This album was a power pop-dance [[LP album|LP]] with the theme "NTV Virus". Two music videos were filmed for the album; "The Gioi Tro Choi" &amp; "Ngay Tuoi Sang", a cover version of [[jtL]]'s "[[A Better Day]]", which was directed by [[Jackie Chen]]. These two videos were the first Vietnamese music videos to feature professional special effects and are listed among the most expensive Vietnamese music videos to date.

In 2004, Ngo followed up with her second album, ''Bi An Vang Trang (Mystery of the Moon)'', which featured a moon theme, on March 15. Three videos were released from this album: "Bi An Vang Trang", the cheerleader-themed "Vuon Toi tam Cao (Reach for the Sky)", and the ballad "Khi Nao Em Buon (Whenever I'm Sad)", which was later covered by many artists including [[Mat Ngoc]], Minh Thuan and [[Thanh Thảo (singer)|Thanh Thảo]].

In autumn 2006, after a 2-month break in America, Ngo returned to Vietnam, and started recording her 4th album which she promised would be a dance anthem record. On October 2006, Ngo premiered one of her new songs "[[I Won't Stop Loving You]]," a new collaboration with [[Quốc Bảo]], on the final episode of ''[[21st Century Woman]]'' on [[Vietnam Television|VTV]]. But due to heavy promotion for ''The Rebel'', the album release was pushed back to the summer of 2007. In May 2007, Ngo announced that the fourth album title would be ''Studio 68'' and claimed that 68 was her lucky number. She released ''Studio 68'' on January 10, 2008.

In 2006, Ngo signed a contract to appear in the long-running music and comedy show ''Van Son'', produced by Van Son Entertainment, an overseas Vietnamese music production company. She has since appeared in every Van Son DVD release to date.

During the first months of 2008, Ngo began working on her next album ''Nuoc Mat Thien Than (Tears of Angel)'', while ''Studio 68'' was awarded "Most Creative Album" in a monthly "Album Vang" prize.

===Acting career===
In 2004, Ngo made her first international appearance in ''[[Rouge (TV series)|Rouge]]'', a 13-part late night television series aired on [[AZN Television]]. 'Rouge' was produced by [[MTV Asia]] &amp; [[MediaCorp Singapore]] and was broadcast widely in Asia and Australia.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} For the remainder of the year, Ngo was busy with the promotional campaign for Rouge throughout Asia and the recording of her third album. She was chosen as the favourite actress in Rouge on the MTV Asia website.

On September 5, 2005, ''My Way'', Ngo's third album, was released. This album was produced by Ngo herself and featured a collaboration with a group of producers called ''The Dreams''. My Way featured multiple genres, from alternative rock to pop, R&amp;B, and hip hop. She remixed the famous [[Trịnh Công Sơn]] song "Quynh Huong".

After ''My Way'', Ngo engaged herself further in acting, with many starring roles in films such as ''[[Saigon Love Story]]'' by [[Ringo Le]], ''[[2 in 1 (film)|2 in 1]]'' by Dao Duy Phuc, and ''[[The Rebel (2007 film)|The Rebel]]'' by Charlie Nguyen Chanh Truc with [[Johnny Trí Nguyễn]], the latter becoming (at that point) Vietnam's highest-grossing film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Johnny-Tri-Nguyen-finds-movie-stardom-in-Vietnam-2471796.php Johnny Tri Nguyen finds movie stardom in Vietnam] 2011 "Nguyen is the martial arts hero, screenwriter and co-producer in both, and his real-life love, Thanh Van Ngo, is the female star of both films (they're Vietnam's version of Brangelina)."&lt;/ref&gt; Ngo's performance was highly praised by both critics and the public,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} and she was nominated for "Best Actress" at the 'Canh Dieu Vang' awards (Vietnam's [[Academy awards|Oscars]]) for the second time.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In the spring of 2007, Ngo also starred in a new thriller called ''Ngoi Nha Bi An (Haunted Manor)'', which premiered in Vietnamese cinemas in November 2007. That December, Ngo was awarded the "Best Actress" prize at the 15th Vietnam Film Festival.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

After her success in ''The Rebel'', Ngo went public about her relationship with Johnny Trí Nguyễn, which ended his marriage with Cathy Viet Thi, a singer on Van Son.

2009 saw Ngo once again starring beside [[Johnny Trí Nguyễn]] in a Chanh Phuong action movie ''[[Clash (2009 film)|Clash]]''. She also opened her own talent agency called VAA.

In 2010, Ngo competed as a contestant in the Vietnamese version of ''Dancing With The Stars''. She finished as the victor for season one. After winning, Ngo revealed that she would return to music in 2011. In Autumn, she embarked on a national promotional tour.

In 2017, she played [[Paige Tico]], the older sister to [[Rose Tico]], in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/star-wars-the-last-jedi-cover-portfolio|title=Cover Story: Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the Definitive Preview|first=David|last=Kamp|website=HWD|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although her screen time was brief, her character's death was an important act of self-sacrifice that affected the major characters in the film, especially Rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nextshark.com/paige-tico-veronica-ngo-star-wars-the-last-jedi-resistance/|title=Meet the Asian Woman Who Played the Biggest Part of All in 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'|website=nextshark.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2017, she played Tien, an Inferni elf enforcer working for Leilah, the main antagonist in the Netflix film ''[[Bright (film)|Bright]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maactioncinema.com/archives/7863|title=M.A.A.C. – NGO THANH VAN aka VERONICA NGO Stars Alongside WILL SMITH In Netflix’s BRIGHT.

The '''Puppet Guild of Greater Saint Louis''' consists of people interested in [[puppetry]].  Typically the guild has included professional puppeteers, teachers, librarians, scout leaders, and other walks of life.  Some members are performers who perform for small groups, others are professionals, and others are just people who like the art.  Some members like to collect puppets, and have extensive collections of puppets from all over the world.  The only common element is an appreciation of the art of puppetry.

== Origins ==
The Puppet Guild of [[Greater Saint Louis]], Inc. was founded largely through the efforts of Iona Hedges. She had attended the first Puppeteers of America Festival in 1936 and signed herself and Susan Barnes as charter members of that organization.
In 1939 the Puppet Guild of St. Louis was formed, and dues were 10 cents. At that time, the main thrust of guild activity was to bring the Puppeteers of America National Festival to Saint Louis in 1940.  However it did not actually happen until 1941.

Those persons at the first meeting on June 12, 1939, at the home of Iona Hedges, 5445 Maple Avenue, in the City of St. Louis were as follows:

(No listing of the charter members has been found. A transcript of a 1959 speech of Leona Thompson references 12 founding members instead of the listed 16 attendees.)
* Miss Helen Addington
* Mrs. Josephine Harrington
* Miss Doritha Lancton
* Mr. Joseph Peek
* Miss Dorris/Dorothea Allen
* Mrs. Iona Hodges
* Miss Laverne Lockmueller
* Miss Ruth Rubin
* Miss Susan Barnes
* Miss Margaret Johnson
* Miss Nelly Mendham
* Mrs. Beverly Stanford
* Miss Elizabeth Green
* Mr. David Kemmerer
* Miss Sally O’Fallon
* Miss Barbara Yore
The first two meeting were held at the Hedge’s home. The third meeting was held on June 26, 1939, at the Cabanne Branch of the Saint Louis Public Library. It was at that meeting that Carolyn Meyer joined the guild and new officers were elected: Wendell Chilton, President; Ruth Rubin, office not specified; Doritha Lanctot, corresponding secretary; Robert Rowlson, office not specified.

According to 1993 interviews with Carolyn Meyer and Susan Barnes, and the 1959 transcript, charter members of the Puppet Guild of Greater St. Louis were as follows:
(Again the listing has 16 names not the 12 referred to in the 1959 transcript.)
* Miss Helen Addington
* Miss Louise Ewing
* Miss Ruth Rubin
* Mrs. Robert Rowlson
* Mrs. Dorris Allen
* Mrs. Edith Finney
* Mrs. Ellen Proctor
* Miss Sally O’Fallon
* Miss Susan Barnes
* Mrs. Iona A. Hedges
* Mr. Romaine Proctor
* Mr. Caroline Singleton
* Mr. Wendell Chilton
* Miss Doritha Lancton
* Mr. Robert Rowlson

AppSmile said " With simple controls, an engaging combat system and some great graphics, this game should please both casual iPhone gamers as well as hardcore RPG veterans. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appsmile.com/2010/09/10/rimelands-hammer-of-thor-review/&lt;/ref&gt; SlidetoPlay said " Rimelands is a highly original RPG that combines dice-rolling chance with player-driven decisions. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slidetoplay.com/review/rimelands-hammer-of-thor-review/&lt;/ref&gt;  NDPad said " Small annoyances aside, Rimelands: Hammer of Thor is simply one of the highest quality traditional role-playing game experiences available on the app store. It's tough as nails, but the combat have you coming back for more. "&lt;ref&gt;http://nodpad.com/2010/09/26/rimelands-hammer-of-thor-review-prepare-to-be-smitten/&lt;/ref&gt; 148Apps wrote " Rimelands is the first turn based RPG that I didn't feel constrained by the controls or game speed. On top of that, there is a good story, there are good characters, good combat, good level designs, and good graphics. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.148apps.com/reviews/rimelands-hammer-thor-review/&lt;/ref&gt; AppSarafi said " This is a really strong entry from Crescent Moon Games. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appsafari.com/games/15100/rimelands-hammer-of-thor/&lt;/ref&gt; TouchArcade wrote " I don't typically love turn-based strategy games, but Rimelands had me hooked almost instantly. "&lt;ref&gt;http://toucharcade.com/2010/09/02/rimelands-hammer-of-thor-review-%E2%80%93-roll-the-dice-in-this-epic-turn-based-rpg/&lt;/ref&gt;

PocketGamerUK said " Rimelands: Hammer of Thor fits snugly into the turn-based role-playing genre, but offers enough variation to keep the action fresh and exciting. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Rimelands%3A+Hammer+of+Thor/review.asp?c=23011&lt;/ref&gt; TouchGen wrote " Rimelands : Hammer of Thor is an extremely enjoyable game due to keeping the challenge going, and I really hope to be able to continue the adventure. Not because I care about the story, but rather because the game mechanic works well. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touchgen.net/rimelands-hammer-of-thor-review&lt;/ref&gt; AppSpy wrote " Rimelands: Hammer of Thor is an excellent turn-based RPG with an amazingly simple combat system that only gets better as you delve deeper in to your chosen character path. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appspy.com/review/4455/rimelands-hammer-of-thor-review&lt;/ref&gt; ZTGD wrote " Still, if you're an RPG enthusiast and you're looking for an experience that's well suited to the iPhone rather than simply mimicking the console, it would be disingenuous to steer you elsewhere. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ztgd.com/reviews/rimelands/&lt;/ref&gt; Multiplayer wrote " Hammer of Thor is a great first entry in the Rimelands series. Thanks to its charming dice combat system and the articulated skill tree, it is without any doubt one of the most enjoyable RPGs on the App Store. However, the game greatly stumbles in its storytelling, boring and full of clichés, while the adventure is too much linear and there are very few secondary missions.

'''''Swigridova kletba''''' is a 1996 Czech adventure game developed by Agawa and published by JRC Interactive for DOS.

==Production==
Agawa released two games: ''[[Mise Quadam]]'' in 1995 and ''Swigridova kletba'' in 1996.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"&gt;https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/52702/DPTX_2010_2_11230_0_322985_0_111952.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; The developers were displeased with the graphic processing of their previous title ''[[Mise Quadam]]'', so they hired the professional artist Zden Jasanovska for this game.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"/&gt;

The game was sold at a price of 500.176 Crowns.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"/&gt; The game was one of the first successful Czech adventure games; its design is similar to ''[[The Legend of Kyrandia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.level.cz/starsi-cisla/level-38/|title=LEVEL 38 - LEVEL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also among the shortest commercially released Czech adventure games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adventurista.cz/?page_id=5407|title=Swigridova kletba - Adventurista|website=www.adventurista.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and gameplay==
The game is a fairy-tale adventure similar to ''[[The Legend of Kyrandia]]''. The player controls a simple shepherd named Robinto, who is tasked with defeating the evil Swigrid and returning the magic horn of Kerke to his home in Manahon county. The game is divided into three parts; in order to progress to the next part the player has to complete a goal such as getting money for a ferry.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"/&gt;

''Swigridova kletba'' is a classic point-and-click adventure based on collecting objects, using them and combining them together. The game is entirely controlled via the mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.databaze-her.cz/hry/swigridova-kletba/|title=Swigridova kletba – Databáze-her.cz|website=www.databaze-her.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players explore the environment, talk to characters and solve puzzles. Items can be collected and stored in the inventory at the bottom of the screen. Graphically, the game is similar to ''[[Dračí Historie]]''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesite.sk/ostatne/tematicke-clanky/26754-zabudnuty-klenot-videoherneho-priemyslu-cesko-slovenske-point-click-adventury|title=Zabudnutý klenot videoherného priemyslu – česko-slovenské point&amp;click adventúry|first=Ľubomír|last=Čelár|date=24 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomáš Landa from Score magazine appreciated the change in graphic design from ''Mise Quadam''.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"/&gt; Level magazine felt the game was amateur, especially when compared to ''[[Dračí historií]]'', and criticized the narrative for being short, simple and straightforward.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"/&gt;

Gamesite.sk felt the game elevated the Czech-Slovakian video gaming industry a little higher, and added that while it was a short adventure, it had its roots in Czech culture and contained Czech dubbing, which was rare at the time.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Old-games.ru felt the game was not interesting, yet valuable from a video game history perspective.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.old-games.ru/game/6095.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Television content rating systems''' are systems for [[Content rating|evaluating the content]] and reporting the suitability of [[television program]]s for children, teenagers, or adults. Many countries have their own television [[evaluation|rating]] system and countries' rating processes vary by local priorities. Programs are rated by the organization that manages the system, the [[broadcasting|broadcaster]], or the content producers.

A rating is usually set for each individual [[episode]] of a [[television series]]. The rating can change per episode, [[television network|network]], rerun, and country. As such, program ratings are usually not meaningful unless when and where the rating is used is mentioned.

== Comparison table ==

A comparison of current television content rating systems, showing age on the horizontal axis. Note however that the specific criteria used in assigning a classification can vary widely from one country to another. Thus a color code or age range cannot be directly compared from one country to another.

:''For details on the [[home video|video]] and [[DVD]] classification system in Australia, see [[Censorship in Australia]].''
{{Main|Australian Classification Board}}

Commercial television networks in [[Australia]] are required to comply with the [[Australian Commercial Television Code of Practice]], which is governed by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] with [[Free TV Australia]] mediating between the networks and the ACMA, as well as handling viewer complaints.

Classifications for each program broadcast on TV, are decided upon by trained classification officers at each network.

If viewers believe a network has breached the TV Code of Practice (an incorrect classification have been given, for example), viewers can submit a complaint to Free TV Australia, who then submit that complaint to the network. If viewers are dissatisfied with the result, they may then refer their complaint to the ACMA for an investigation.

Classifications are intended to be equivalent to the [[Australian Classification Board]] (ACB) classifications of the same name. They're usually presented with the same shape and sometimes colour as their ACB counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Classifications |publisher=[[FreeTV Australia]] |url=http://www.freetv.com.au/content_common/pg-about-classifications.seo |accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 2015, the ACMA introduced sweeping changes to the ratings system for commercial networks. Among them were allowing M and MA15+ programs to air an hour earlier then they were previously allowed, from 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm and 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm respectively, PG programs can air all day, dissolving the AV15+ classification, as well as changes to when adverts with higher classifications program can air.&lt;ref name="Dec15changes"&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Amanda|last=Meade|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/10/restrictions-on-m-rated-tv-shows-lowered-after-shifts-in-digital-landscape|title= M-rated shows to be broadcast an hour earlier under new commercial TV code |date=10 November 2015|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/11/m-rated-tv-now-allowed-from-730pm-in-classification-overhaul.html|title=M rated TV now allowed from 7:30pm in Classification overhaul |date=10 November 2015|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Networks are still{{When|date=May 2016}} getting used to these changes and it will be a gradual change, with many programs already classified and scheduled on stations weeks ahead, in accordance with the old code. The [[Seven Network]], [[Nine Network]] and [[Network Ten]] are continuing this trend.

R18+ and X18+ restricted classifications are not permitted for free-to-air broadcast in Australia.

Many R18+ movies on DVD/Blu-ray are often edited on Free TV/cable networks, to secure an MA15+ classification or lower. Some movies that were classified R18+ on DVD have since been aired on Australian TV with an MA15+ classification.

The two government-owned TV networks, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], are not bound by the same regulations as their commercial counterparts, and are instead each bound by their own Codes of Practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (2007). [http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/documents/codeprac07.pdf ABC Code of Practice: March 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Special Broadcasting Service]]. [http://www20.sbs.com.au/sbscorporate/index.php?id=1061 SBS Codes of Practice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330010229/http://www20.sbs.com.au/sbscorporate/index.php?id=1061 |date=30 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines provided by these Codes are similar but not identical to the Codes of Practice for commercial stations. For example, SBS refers to the rating '''MAV15+''' instead of AV15+,&lt;ref&gt;[[Special Broadcasting Service]]. [http://www20.sbs.com.au/sbscorporate/index.php?id=1061#4.5 SBS Codes of Practice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330010229/http://www20.sbs.com.au/sbscorporate/index.php?id=1061 |date=30 March 2007 }} (Section 4.5: Classification Categories.)&lt;/ref&gt; while ABC does not use the AV/MAV rating at all; instead programs rated MA15+ must not start before 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., instead of 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.. While the ABC recognizes the G rating, its code of practice does not require that it display its classification symbol on-air in respect to G-rated programming.

[[Pay television]] networks also have a different system&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association]] (2007). [http://www.astra.org.au/content/pdf/codes/STBCodesofPractice2007.pdf Subscription Broadcast Television Codes of Practice 2007.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705093925/http://www.astra.org.au/content/pdf/codes/STBCodesofPractice2007.pdf |date=5 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[free-to-air]] networks. In general, all content on pay TV must still be given one of the above ratings; however, there are not usually restrictions on the time of day any particular programming can be broadcast. There is no R18+ rating for pay TV, but its use is strictly limited to special interest channels. FOXTEL, a pay TV company, has a parental lock-out system which can be programmed by parents to stop children from seeing certain programs. In 2009, the system malfunctioned, allowing children access to violent TV shows and films. The restrictions on R18+ rated programming have been increased since then, and those programs can now only be shown on the two adult channels.

===== Consumer advice =====
Consumer advice is compulsory for all MA15+ and one-off programs. As well as very short series classified M or higher (such as [[feature films]], [[miniseries]] and [[documentaries]]). Commercial networks have been providing consumer advice to all PG and M programs anyway. As of 13 April 2016, the [[Nine Network]], the [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]] along with regional networks [[Prime7]], [[GWN7]], [[WIN Television]], [[NBN Television]] no longer uses full-screen and voiced-over boards, prior to the beginning of a program. Instead opting for a small text box in the bottom right-hand corner (Nine) and top left-hand corner (WIN, GWN7, Prime7, Seven &amp; Ten), while [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]], [[Foxtel]] and [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] continue to use full-screen and voiced-over boards before the start of a program.

Consumer advice takes the form of a full-screen written and verbal announcement at the start of the program, announcing the classification as well as listing the type &amp; strength and/or frequency of any classifiable element. In addition when a program carries consumer advice, appropriate abbreviations are displayed along with the classification symbol after each commercial break. They also usually appear in programming guides, usually in lower case to distinguish from primary classifications. In general, these abbreviations are as follows:
&lt;!-- Please do not list 'strengths; of the content descriptors, as they clutter the list and are indiscriminate. Thank you. --&gt;
* '''A'''&amp;nbsp;– used for programs with [[Thematic elements|adult themes]].
* '''V'''&amp;nbsp;– used for programs depicting [[violence]];
* '''L'''&amp;nbsp;– used for programs [[Profanity|coarse language]];
* '''S'''&amp;nbsp;– used for programs depicting simulated [[Human sexuality|sex scenes]] and/or references;
* '''H'''&amp;nbsp;– used for programs containing [[Horror film|horror]] or [[supernatural]] themes;
* '''D'''&amp;nbsp;– used for programs with [[drug]] references and/or use;
* '''N'''&amp;nbsp;– used for programs containing [[nudity]];
* '''MP'''&amp;nbsp;– used for programs containing [[medical procedure]]s;

For violence, coarse language and sex scenes, the intensity and/or frequency is mentioned in front of the consumer advice. These include: "mild", "stylised", "some", "frequent" or "strong". Example: "strong sex scenes".

A television content rating system in [[Brazil]] was implemented following a consultation in 2006.&lt;ref name="ANDI 2000"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.andi.org.br/politicas-de-comunicacao/publicacao/tv-rating-system-building-citizenship-on-the-small-screen | title = TV Rating System Building Citizenship on the Small Screen | accessdate = 29 July 2013 | year = 2006 | format = PDF | work = Políticas de Comunicação | publisher = Agência de Notícias dos Direitos da Infância (ANDI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the television networks themselves rate the shows, while the [[Brazilian advisory rating system|advisory rating]] ({{Lang-pt|Classificação Indicativa}}) judges the content to guarantee that the rating is appropriate for that specific show.&lt;ref name="Ministério da Justiça 2011"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://portal.mj.gov.br/main.asp?View={09C66D3D-927A-4AA4-90E1-40CC176378E4}&amp;BrowserType=IE&amp;LangID=pt-br¶ms=itemID%3D{99C92CC2-3F7D-4DF6-B3AC-B8D6E0B77257}%3B&amp;UIPartUID={2218FAF9-5230-431C-A9E3-E780D3E67DFE} | title = Sociedade apoia multa por descumprimento de classificação indicativa | accessdate = 29 July 2013 | date = 12 December 2011 | work = Classificação Indicativa: Notícias | publisher =  | language = Portuguese}}{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On broadcast networks, where the system is mandatory, the ratings are also translated in [[Brazilian Sign Language]], and may also carry content descriptors.

The Canadian TV Classification System was created in late 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/1997/sep/97092901.html|title=Canadian television networks begin rating system|publisher=LifeSiteNews.com|accessdate=2009-01-15|date=29 September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; for English-language programs to use in conjunction with the V-chip (by this point, Canadian viewers were used to seeing ratings attached to American programming delivered via cable and over-the-air reception). The upper-right corner of symbols are shaped like the corner of a [[maple leaf]], as is used in the [[Flag of Canada|national flag]]. The icons are intended to be shown once an hour lasting 15 seconds, although in the case of longer programs that do not start on the hour, some broadcasters show the rating at the start and at the top of each subsequent clock hour, while others show the rating at the start and again precisely one hour later. However, there are some networks like [[Global Television Network|Global]] that only display the television rating at the beginning of the show. The icons are displayed in the upper-left corner and the size should be a minimum of 52 [[scan lines]] tall.&lt;ref name ="Canadian ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cab-acr.ca/english/social/antiviolence/icons_manual.shtm |title=CAB-Broadcaster Manual for Classification and Icon Use |publisher=Cab-acr.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, should a program contain content potentially unsuitable for some viewers, such as violence, coarse language, or nudity, members of the self-regulating [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (which does not include the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], although it still uses such warnings) are required to air a disclaimer at the beginning of the program and at the end of each commercial break, advising viewer discretion (such disclaimers are only required for the first hour if airing after [[Watershed (television)|9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.]]). This disclaimer is technically required even if the final commercial break comes immediately before the closing credits, and some (but not all) channels in fact observe this.&lt;ref&gt;For further details, refer to the [[Canadian Association of Broadcasters]] [http://www.cbsc.ca/english/codes/cabethics.php Code of Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227082714/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/codes/cabethics.php |date=27 December 2008 }} and [http://www.cbsc.ca/english/links/crtcdocuments/pn1993149.php Voluntary Code Regarding Violence in Television Programming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218071110/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/links/crtcdocuments/pn1993149.php |date=18 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, the television rating given may depend on the level of [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Direct broadcast satellite|satellite]], or if the program is broadcast [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]]. Also, television ratings are generally considered more restrictive than [[Canadian motion picture rating system|movie ratings]].

====Outside Quebec====
[[File:Canadian TV Ratings.png|thumb|right|Canadian Television Ratings: C, C8, G, PG, 14+, and 18+]]
The Canadian rating system is as follows:&lt;ref name ="Canadian ratings" /&gt;
* '''Exempt'''&amp;nbsp;– Shows which are exempt from ratings (such as news and sports programming) will not display an on-screen rating at all.
* '''C'''&amp;nbsp;– Programming is intended for younger children under the age of 8 years. No profanity or sexual content of any level allowed. Might contain occasional comedic, unrealistic depictions of violence.
* '''C8'''&amp;nbsp;– Suitable for children ages 8+. Low level violence and fantasy horror is allowed. No foul language is allowed, but occasional "socially offensive and discriminatory" language is allowed if in the context of the story. No sexual content of any level allowed.
* '''G'''&amp;nbsp;– Suitable for general audiences. Programming suitable for the entire family with mild violence, and mild profanity and/or censored language.
* '''PG'''&amp;nbsp;– Parental guidance. Moderate violence and moderate language is allowed, as is brief nudity and sexual references if important to the context of the story. Some content may not be suitable for children under the age of 8 and parental supervision is recommended for children aged 8–13.
* '''14+'''&amp;nbsp;– Programming intended for viewers ages 14 and older. May contain strong violence and strong language, and depictions of sexual activity as long as they are within the context of a story. Parents are strongly cautioned to exercise discretion in permitting viewing by pre-teens and early teens without parent/guardian supervision.
* '''18+'''&amp;nbsp;– Programming intended for viewers ages 18 and older. May contain explicit violence, extreme language, and sexual activity. Programming with this rating cannot air before the [[Watershed (television)|watershed]] (9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.).

====Quebec ratings====
French-language broadcasters use the [[Régie du cinéma (Quebec)|Régie du cinéma]] [[Motion picture rating system|film rating system]] for television programming. Logo may or may not appear on screen after every commercial depending on the TV channel.
* &lt;span style="background:#090; color:white"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''G:Général'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; (general)&amp;nbsp;– appropriate for all ages and must contain little or no violence and little to no sexual content.
* &lt;span style="background:orange; color:black;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''8+ ans'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;– appropriate for children 8 and up may contain with little violence, language, and little to no sexual situations;
* &lt;span style="background:yellow;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''13+ ans'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; appropriate&amp;nbsp;– suitable for children 13 and up and may contain with moderate violence, language, and some sexual situations;
* &lt;span style="background:blue; color:white;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''16+ ans'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;– recommended for children over the age of 16 and may contain with strong violence, strong language, and strong sexual content;
* &lt;span style="background:red; color:white;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''18+ ans'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;– only to be viewed by adults and may contain extreme violence and graphic sexual content. It is mostly used for 18+ movies and [[pornography]].
*An '''E''' rating (no rating will appear on screen) is given to exempt programming, in the same classes used for English Canadian programming above.

The [[Hrvatska Radiotelevizija]] (Croatian Radiotelevision) channels, [[RTL Televizija]], [[RTL 2 (Croatia)|RTL 2]], [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]] and [[Doma TV]] all display warnings before a broadcast not meant for a general audience. Broadcasts meant for all audiences do not have a rating. With that in mind, the rating system is the following:

* '''12''' - Content suitable for children of 12 years of age or older.
* '''15''' - Content suitable for teens of 15 years of age or older.
* '''18''' - Content suitable for adults of 18 years of age or older.

There initially was no ratings system for [[Television in France|French television]]. In March 1961, following the broadcast of a film where a female nude was briefly visible, the "white square" was introduced. A white square, replaced by a white rectangle in 1964, was displayed in the corner of the screen. An off-screen voice warned at the beginning of the program that it was unsuitable for all audiences. This system continued until 1996 when the [[Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel]] replaced it with a system of five pictograms, indicating the suitability of the program. This system was replaced by the current system on 18 November 2002.&lt;ref name=csasign&gt;{{cite web|title=Le CSA adopte une nouvelle signalétique|url=http://csa.fr/Espace-juridique/Decisions-du-CSA/Le-CSA-adopte-une-nouvelle-signaletique|website=csa.fr|publisher=Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel|accessdate=7 July 2015|language=French|date=17 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Signalétique d'avertissement#Carré blanc, rectangle blanc et pictogrammes TV en France|French wikipedia: Carré blanc, rectangle blanc et pictogrammes TV en France]]{{Better source|date=November 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong television rating system is since by generic code of television programs standard of the Broadcasting Ordinance (Cap.562) on December 11, 1995.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The current ratings are:
* '''G''' (general)&amp;nbsp;– for general audiences;
* '''PG''' (parental guidance recommended)&amp;nbsp;– programs are unsuitable for children, parental guidance is recommended;
* '''M''' (mature)&amp;nbsp;– programs are recommended for adult viewers above the age of 18, only allowed to be shown between 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.

Programs that are classified as either 'PG' or 'M' should not be broadcast between 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. every day, as this is a watershed devised for family viewing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

{{Weasel|section|date=August 2011}}
The [[Hungary|Hungarian]] content rating system has changed frequently. The ratings of the programs broadcast often caused legal interferences, since the radio and television authorities have stricter guidelines about age appropriate rating categories for programs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} If a program is not marked with the television authority's choice of rating symbol, the airing channel often has to pay large penalties to Hungarian authorities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 2002, a new rating system was devised. Ranking programs and displaying the rating symbols became compulsory on every Hungarian television network. The new rating system caused trouble within these networks, because the channels were required to display the ranking symbols during the entire duration of their programs. The symbols were distracting to viewers, and networks feared that their constant presence could [[Screen burn-in|damage the television screen]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Because of the complaints, the television authority allowed channels to choose to show the rating symbols on the left or on the right side of the screen. Later, channels were also allowed to increase the transparency of the symbols.

In the current system there are five rating categories:
* '''Unrated'''&amp;nbsp;– programs can be viewed by any age, also used for content exempt from classification 
** [[File:GY icon TV (Hungary).svg|30px]] '''children friendly'''&amp;nbsp;– programs recommended for children. It is an optional rating, there is no obligation for broadcasters to indicate it.
* [[File:6 icon TV (Hungary).svg|30px]] '''6''' – programs not recommended for children below the age of 6, may not contain any violence or sexual content. A yellow circle with the number 6 written inside is used for this rating;
* [[File:12 icon TV (Hungary).svg|30px]] '''12'''&amp;nbsp;– programs not recommended for children below the age of 12, may contain light sexual content or explicit language. Most films without serious violence or sexual content fit into this category as well. A yellow circle with the number 12 written inside is used for this rating;
* [[File:16 icon TV (Hungary).svg|30px]] '''16'''&amp;nbsp;– programs not recommended for teens and children below the age of 16, may contain more intensive violence and sexual content. A yellow circle with the number 16 written inside is used for this rating;
* [[File:18 icon TV (Hungary).svg|30px]] '''18'''&amp;nbsp;– the program is recommended for adult viewers (for ages 18 and up), may contain explicit violence and explicit sexual content. A red circle with the number 18 written inside is used for this rating (the red circle was also used until 2002, but it did not contain any number in it).

Similar ratings also apply to films shown in cinemas, however unlike in other countries a viewer cannot be denied access from entering a screening if they are not the age of the rating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/getdoc.cgi?docid=A04000024.NKMárga+kör+TV&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4&amp;client=safari Law concerning TV ratings (in Hungarian)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709180346/https://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/getdoc.cgi?docid=A04000024.NKM |date=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television rating system in the [[Netherlands]] was created in 2001 by the ''Dutch Institute for the Classification of Audiovisual Media'' (NICAM) and is known as '''Kijkwijzer''' (ViewingGuide or WatchWiser). The same rating systems are used for both television programs and films, and serve partly as guidelines (Programs with the classification 12 years may only be broadcast from 8pm and with the classification 16 years from 10pm. Cinemas and theaters in the country cannot provide films with the classification 16 years to people under the age of 16). Animated versions of the icons used are also utilized in visual mediums. They are the same as Dutch film ratings. The system is also used for DVDs in Belgium and selectively used on television broadcasts in Flanders.

The following icons are in use for age rating:
* [[File:Dutch rating AL.svg|30px]] All Ages (Alle leeftijden)
* [[File:Dutch rating 6.svg|30px]] Watch out with children under 6 (Let op met kinderen tot 6 jaar)
* [[File:Dutch rating 9.svg|30px]] Watch out with children under 9 (Let op met kinderen tot 9 jaar)
* [[File:Dutch rating 12.svg|30px]] Watch out with children under 12 (Let op met kinderen tot 12 jaar)
* [[File:Kijkwijzer 16.svg|30px]] Watch out with children under 16 (Let op met kinderen tot 16 jaar)

There are also six descriptor icons used:
* [[File:Dutch rating violence.svg|30px]] Violence (Geweld)
* [[File:Dutch rating scary.svg|30px]] Scary or Disturbing Content (Angst)
* [[File:Dutch rating sex.svg|30px]] Sexual Content (Seks)

New Zealand has two separate content rating systems, one for free-to-air channels and one for pay TV services.

====Free-to-air====

New Zealand's free-to-air TV content rating system has been in place since 1989 and is based on the system Australia was using from the early 1980s until 1993. There are three classifications:

'''G''' ('''General Programs'''): These exclude material likely to harm children under 14 and can screen at any time. Programs may not necessarily be designed for younger viewers, but must not contain material likely to cause them undue distress or discomfort.

'''PGR''' ('''Parental Guidance Recommended'''): Programs more suited to more mature viewers. These are not necessarily unsuitable for children (defined as under 14), but viewer discretion is advised, and parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise younger viewers. Programs rated PGR can screen between 9&amp;nbsp;a.m.&amp;nbsp;– 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. and between 7&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;– 6&amp;nbsp;a.m.

'''AO''' ('''Adults Only'''): AO programs contain material of an adult nature handled in such a way that it is unsuitable for children. Such programs are directed primarily at a mature audience and can screen between noon and 3pm on a school day (except during school and public holidays as designated by the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]]), and between 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;– 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. A special sub-class of this rating, denoted ''AO 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. or later'', is reserved for programs with a "greater degree of sexual activity, potentially offensive language, realistic violence, sexual violence, or horrific encounters" and are considered unsuitable for viewing before that time. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070320063319/http://www.bsa.govt.nz/codesstandards-freetv.php www.bsa.govt.nz].

The rating for each program is shown at the start and after each commercial break. Some PGR programs and most AO programs have an advisory before the program begins to advise of any specific content that could offend viewers such as language, nudity, sex and violence.

====Pay television====

The system for pay television is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |title=PAY TELEVISION CLASSIFICATIONS AND AUDIENCE ADVISORIES |publisher=[[Broadcasting Standards Authority]] |location=New Zealand |url=https://bsa.govt.nz/images/02_BSA_PAY-TV_CLASSIFICATIONS_DRAFT.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* G: Approved for General viewing
* PGR: Parental Guidance recommended for young viewers
* M: Suitable for Mature audiences 16 years and over
* 16: People under 16 years should not view
* 18: People under 18 years should not view

* Programming rated M or higher should not be scheduled on either side of a program rated G.
* Visual warning labels should be displayed before certain programs rated PGR or higher. More than one can be used and the labels are:
** C: Content may offend
** L: Language may offend
** V: Contains Violence
** S: Sexual Content may offend

===Norway===

A TV-content rating system was introduced in Norway in July 2015. Television broadcasters are obliged to classify their programmes in the following age categories: A (all ages), 6 years, 9 years, 12 years, 15 years or 18 years. The classification must be based on the guidelines made by The Norwegian Media Authority. Programmes in the different age categories must be transmitted according to the following time schedule during the day:
* All ages, 6 and 9 years – allowed at all times
* 12 years – only allowed during the period 19.00 – 05.30
* 15 and 18 years – only allowed during the period 21.00 – 05.30

Television broadcasters shall specify the age limit acoustically before the programme starts or clearly mark the programme with an age limit throughout its duration. Television broadcasters shall also specify the age limit in programme schedules and electronic programme guides.

The age categories are also applicable to other platforms such as Video on demand-services, videogrammes (DVD, Blu-Ray) and cinema theatres.

The age rating system in Peru was introduced in 2005 by the then-President Alejandro Toledo and came into force for both radio and television broadcasts. Currently, the only free-to-air channels advising their audiences about the rating system are ATV, NexTV and La Tele, since most channels adopted their own system since 2009, starting with América Televisión.

The ratings for television programs are available on some [[List of South American television stations#Peru|Peruvian channels]]. The rating system used in Peru is listed below.

{{main|Movie and Television Review and Classification Board#Television}}
In the Philippines, the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]], commonly known as MTRCB, implements and regulates local television content rating systems. In November 1995,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} the MTRCB has implemented only two television ratings: "General Patronage" and "Parental Guidance", in which these advisories are simply written on the upper left side or at the lower right side of the television screen.

On 6 October 2011, in order to encourage parents to supervise and be responsible with their children in watching television, the MTRCB revamped its rating system, implementing a three-tiered system:&lt;ref name="newratings"&gt;{{cite web | title = Classification ng TV ratings, nirepaso ng MTRCB | url = http://dzmm.abs-cbnnews.com/news/Entertainment/Classification_ng_TV_ratings%2C_nirepaso_ng_MTRCB.html | language = Tagalog | publisher = [[DZMM]] | accessdate = 27 October 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425155215/http://dzmm.abs-cbnnews.com/news/Entertainment/Classification_ng_TV_ratings,_nirepaso_ng_MTRCB.html | archive-date = 25 April 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newratings2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cruz|first=Marinel|title=MTRCB revises rating system for TV shows|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/16561/mtrcb-revises-rating-system-for-tv-shows|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matabuena |first=Julien Merced |title=Revised TV classifications launched by MTRCB |url=http://mb.com.ph/node/336837/revi |publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=6 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017220040/http://mb.com.ph/node/336837/revi |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ratings was originally to have been a four-tiered system, composed of G (General Patronage), PG (Parental Guidance), SPG (Strong Parental Guidance), and M,{{vague|date=July 2012}} but some time before the implementation of the new system, the "M" rating was dropped.

The new ratings system is similar to the old one, but the look and the ratings themselves was completely revamped. The new system consists of a new full-screen advisory of the program's rating which is played before every program, whatever the rating of such program is, except in the case of programs with SPG rating, wherein the rating must be aired twice (before the program and after a commercial break somewhere in the middle of the program). A rating logo then appears at the bottom right of the screen during a program if it was rated as such. Sometimes, when annotations are to be put and it takes the place of the logo, then it has to be put on the upper left side of the screen, opposite the logo of the TV station.

Before 2000, [[Poland]] did not have any uniform classification system for television programs.

For a long time, the only existing regulation on [[Portugal|Portuguese]] television was that programs with potentially shocking or harmful content could air only between 10:30pm and 6am and with a red circular marker on the top-right corner of the screen in rated 16.

In 2006, all free-to-air networks decided to complement this rule with a shared, more detailed rating system for TV shows:
* [[File:CPT-T.png|28px]] Todos (suitable for all)
* [[File:CPT10AP.png|28px]] 10, Acompanhamento Parental (for spectators aged 10 or over; parental guidance required for children under 10)
* [[File:CPT-12AP.png|28px]] 12, Acompanhamento Parental (for spectators aged 12 or over; parental guidance required for children under 12)
* [[File:CPT-16.png|28px]] 16 (for spectators aged 16 or over; not suitable for children)

These logos must be shown during 10 seconds in the beginning of any program and after every break. If a program is rated 16, it can only be broadcast between 10:30pm and 6am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tvi.iol.pt/pdf/sinalizacao_de_emissao_explicacao_para_sites_versao2.pdf|title=Sinalização de emissão explicação para sites versão 2|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Weasel|section|date=August 2011}}
The [[Romania]]n content rating system has changed frequently. The ratings of the programs broadcast often caused legal interferences, since the radio and television authorities have stricter guidelines about age appropriate rating categories for programs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} If a program is not marked with the television authority's choice of rating symbol, the airing channel often has to pay large penalties to Romanian authorities, except with [[24-hour news cycle | 24h all-news channels]], 24h advertising channels (teleshopping), [[pay television]] or [[pay-per-view]] channels (like [[Eurosport]], [[HBO]], etc.) and foreign broadcasting TV-channels (like [[TV5Monde]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[arte]], etc.) that are subjected to foreign audio-visual regulations from their country of origin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 2002, a new rating system was devised. Ranking programs and displaying the rating symbols became compulsory on every Romanian television network. The new rating system caused trouble within these networks, because the channels were required to display the ranking symbols during the entire duration of their programs. The symbols were distracting to viewers, and networks feared that their constant presence could [[Screen burn-in|damage the television screen]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Because of the complaints, the television authority allowed channels to choose to show the rating symbols on the left or on the right side of the screen. Later, channels were also allowed to increase the transparency of the symbols.

In the current system there are five rating categories:
* '''Unrated'''&amp;nbsp;– programs can be viewed by any age (generally news tv-programmes, mostly 24h news channels, reportages and documentaries with some exceptions. Most offensive and sensitive contents are censored during newscasts, exceptions are made when they are broadcast live and therefore sanctioned by the [[National Audiovisual Council | CNA]]) ;
* &lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:AP logo (Romania).png|30px]]  --&gt;'''AP''' – programs is recommended for children with the parental guidance, may not contain any violence or sexual content. A transparent circle with the font AP written inside is used for this rating;
* &lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:12 logo (Romania).png|30px]]  --&gt;'''12'''&amp;nbsp;– programs not recommended for children below the age of 12, may contain light sexual content or explicit language. Most films without serious violence or sexual content fit into this category as well. A yellow circle with the number 12 written inside is used for this rating;
* &lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:16 logo (Romania).png|30px]]  --&gt;'''15'''&amp;nbsp;– programs not recommended for teens and children below the age of 15, may contain more intensive violence and sexual content. A lime circle with the number 15 written inside is used for this rating;
* &lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:18 logo (Romania).png|30px]]  --&gt;'''18'''&amp;nbsp;– the program is recommended for adult viewers (for ages 18 and up), may contain explicit violence and explicit sexual content. A red circle with the number 18 written inside is used for this rating (the red circle was also used until 2005, but it did not contain any number in it).

Singapore has adopted the use of TV Ratings from 15 July 2011. They consist of &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;PG&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;PG13&lt;/span&gt; ratings for [[Free-to-Air]] TV and &lt;span style="color:OrangeRed;"&gt;NC16&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:OrangeRed;"&gt;M18&lt;/span&gt; ratings in addition to the &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;PG&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;PG13&lt;/span&gt; ratings for [[Pay TV]] channels. For Free-to-Air TV, the shows rated &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;PG&lt;/span&gt; may be aired anytime while &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;PG13&lt;/span&gt; should air between 10pm to 6am. For Pay TV, &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;PG13&lt;/span&gt; rated programs can be shown anytime. Before the rated program starts the TV channels will show a notification. Currently, only [[StarHub TV]]'s and [[Mio TV]]'s self-packaged non-regional Pay TV channels ( e.g. [[StarHub TV]]'s [[E City]] and [[Sensasi]] and [[Mio TV]]'s [[FashionTV]] HD and [[FashionTV]] HD On Demand, both of which features modeling nudity in certain programs ) are enabled to carry &lt;span style="color:OrangeRed;"&gt;NC16&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:OrangeRed;"&gt;M18&lt;/span&gt; rated content. [[FashionTV]] is also Singapore's first official &lt;span style="color:OrangeRed;"&gt;M18&lt;/span&gt; rated channel. &lt;span style="color:OrangeRed;"&gt;M18&lt;/span&gt; rated programs can only be telecasted from 10pm onwards to 6am on Pay TV. Regional channels like [[Fox Life]], [[Fox Movies (Asia)|Fox Movies]] and [[HBO Asia]] are unable to carry [[Media Development Authority]]'s film ratings as they are targeted at the same region (a certain group of Asia territories), which results in programs being subjected to external censorship of a much harsher nature outside Singapore territorial control. Only [[Video on Demand]] (VOD) Pay TV services are allowed to carry &lt;span style="color:OrangeRed;"&gt;R21&lt;/span&gt; content currently. &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;-rated programs are not required to show a notification for any channel.

[[South Africa]]n ratings are issued and certified by the [[Film and Publication Board]], whilst the National Broadcasting Commission regulates the various films and programs. All television stations, cinemas and distributors of DVD, video and computer games must display the following signage:
* '''Family''': This is a program/film that does not contain any obscenity, and is suitable for family viewing. A logo must be displayed in the corner of the screen for 30 seconds after each commercial break.
* '''PG''': Children under 6 may watch this program/film, but must be accompanied by an adult. This program contains an adult related theme, which might include very mild language, violence and sexual innuendo. A logo must be displayed in the corner of the screen for one minute after each commercial break.
* '''&lt;span style="color:lime;"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;''': Children under 13 are prohibited from watching this program/film. This program contains mild language, violence and sexual innuendo. A logo must be displayed in the corner of the screen for two minutes after each commercial break.
* '''&lt;span style="color:orange;"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;''': Children under 16 are prohibited from watching this program/film. It contains moderate violence, language, and some sexual situations. In the case of television, this program may only be broadcast after 9pm–4:30am. A logo must be displayed in the corner of the screen for five minutes after each commercial break. A full-screen warning must be issued before the start of the program. If the program is longer than an hour, a warning must be displayed every half an hour.
* '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;''': Children under 18 are prohibited from watching this program/film. It contains extreme violence, language and/or graphic sexual content. In the case of television, this program may only be broadcast from 10pm–4:30am. A logo must be displayed in the corner of the screen for the duration of the program. A full-screen warning must be issued before the start of the program and after each commercial break.
* '''R18''': this is reserved for films of an extreme sexual nature ([[pornography]]). '''R18''' films may only be distributed in the form of video and DVD in a controlled environment (e.g. Adult Shops). No public viewing of this film may take place. '''R18''' films may not be broadcast on television and in cinemas. This has been breached twice by ETv, where the soft bordering hardcore Emmanuelle was screened. The '''R18''' rating does not refer to child pornography—as this is banned by the Film and Publication Board.

The South Korean television rating system has been in force since 2000, and it started with only four classifications which are '''All''', '''7''', '''13''' and '''19'''. In February 2001, all programs except domestic dramas (which had been enforced since November 2002) has required to have a rating system. In 2007, rating '''13''' was changed into '''12''' and a new rating, '''15''' is introduced. Most programs have to be rated, except the "exempt" rating below. Even if it qualifies for being exempt, a broadcaster may apply a rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=106&amp;oid=009&amp;aid=0002180286|title=TV 드라마의 등급 분류 기준은?|last=Kim|first=Su-jin|date=2009-11-10|publisher=매일경제|language=Korean|accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KoreanTVrating.png|thumb|right|Example of Korean TV rating icons.]]
* [[File:Republic Of Korea Broadcasting-TV Rating System(ALL).svg|30px|Republic_Of_Korea_Broadcasting-TV_Rating_System(ALL).svg]] ''' All (모든 연령 시청가, Mo-deun yeon-ryeong si-cheong-ga)''': This rating is for programming that is appropriate for all ages. Television programs with this rating may contain some violence and/or some mild language. No adult content is allowed.
* [[File:Republic Of Korea Broadcasting-TV Rating System(7).svg|30px|Republic_Of_Korea_Broadcasting-TV_Rating_System(7).svg]] '''7 (7세 이상 시청가, chil-se ii-sang si-cheong-ga)''': Children under 7 are prohibited from watching this program/film. Children aged 7 may watch this program/film, but must be accompanied by an adult. Television programs with this rating can contain mild violence, mild language and few romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/7세%20시청가|title=7세 시청가}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[File:Republic Of Korea Broadcasting-TV Rating System(12).svg|30px|Republic_Of_Korea_Broadcasting-TV_Rating_System(12).svg]] '''12 (12세 이상 시청가, sib-i-se i-sang si-cheong-ga)''': Children under 12 are prohibited from watching this program/film. Television programs with this rating may contain horror, some fantasy violence, some sexual content, little use of strong language, mild blood, and/or mild suggestive themes.
* [[File:Republic Of Korea Broadcasting-TV Rating System(15).svg|30px|Republic_Of_Korea_Broadcasting-TV_Rating_System(15).svg]] '''15 (15세 이상 시청가, sib-o-se i-sang si-cheong-ga)''': Children under 15 are prohibited from watching this program/film. TV shows with this rating may contain use of alcohol, more sexual content, mild violence or little strong violence, major blood or gore, and/or suggestive themes.
* [[File:Republic Of Korea Broadcasting-TV Rating System(19).svg|30px|Republic_Of_Korea_Broadcasting-TV_Rating_System(19).svg]] '''19 (19세 이상 시청가, sip-gu-se i-sang si-cheong-ga)''': Children under 19 are prohibited from watching this program/film. 19-rated programming is banned from airing during the hours of 7:00AM to 9:00AM, and 1:00PM to 10:00PM. Programs that receive this rating will almost certainly have adult themes, sexual situations, strong language and disturbing scenes of violence.
* '''Exempt''' (no icon or name): This rating is only for knowledge based game shows; lifestyle shows; documentary shows; news; current topic discussion shows; education/culture shows; sports that excludes [[Mixed Martial Arts|MMA]] or other violent sports; and other programs that the [[Korea Communications Standards Commission]] recognizes. Disclaimer or rating icons are not needed.

Rating icons may be transparent, and can be positioned either on the upper-left or upper-right corner of the screen. The icon has a size of at least 1/20 of the screen, and has black writing on a yellow circle with a white outline. These icons are shown for 30 seconds when the program starts, and are shown again every 10 minutes, and when the program resumes after commercial breaks. This does not apply to 19-rated programs, where the icon must be visible throughout the entire program.
These regulations do not apply to the "All" rating, as it does not have an icon.
A rating disclaimer is displayed on the start of the program for five seconds explaining "This program is prohibited for children under the age of ''X'', so parental accompaniment is required"(이 프로그램은 ''X''세 미만의 어린이/청소년이 시청하기에 부적절하므로 보호자의 시청지도가 필요한 프로그램입니다, I peu-ro-geu-raem eun "X: se-mi-man ui eo rin-i/cheong-so nyeon-i si cheong hagi e bu-jeok jeol ha-meu robo hoja ui si cheong-ji doga pir-yo han peu-ro-geu-raem ipnida) for 7, 12, and 15 ratings. "All" and "19" ratings have a different disclaimer, which say "This program is suitable for all ages"(이 프로그램은 모든 연령의 시청자가 시청할 수 있는 프로그램입니다) and "This program is prohibited for children under the age of 19"(이 프로그램은 19세 미만의 청소년이 시청하기에 부적절한 프로그램입니다) respectively.

These ratings are used by all South Korean television broadcasters. Despite being intended for viewing outside of the country, [[KBS World]] also uses these ratings.

South Korean television ratings do not include content descriptors or advisories as they do in other nations. The ratings are therefore used in a broader sense.

These are the symbols of the Spanish rating system for television programs:
* &lt;span style="background:grey; color:white;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''SC'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; (Sin calificación). This unofficial rating applies to news, sports and religious programming.
* &lt;span style="background:purple; color:white;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''Infantil'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; (Especialmente recomendada para la infancia). Specially recommended for younger children. Only some channels use this rating, and each has its design ([[Clan TVE]] use the words "ERI" (they formerly used a baby icon) inside a purple block and [[Canal Panda]] uses a small purple banner).
* &lt;span style="background:green; color:white; color:white;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''TP'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; (Todos los públicos). For general viewing.
* &lt;span style="background:blue; color:white;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''7'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="background:blue; color:white;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''+7'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;: Not recommended for viewers under the age of 7. It is yellow in [[Televisió de Catalunya]] and formerly in [[Televisión Española]].
* &lt;span style="background:yellow; color:black;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''10'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="background:yellow; color:black;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''+10'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;: Not recommended for viewers under the age of 10. Only exists in Catalan television.
* &lt;span style="background:yellow; color:black;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''12'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="background:yellow; color:black;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''+12'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;: Not recommended for viewers under the age of 12.
* &lt;span style="background:yellow; color:black;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''13'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="background:yellow; color:black;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''+13'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;: Not recommended for viewers under the age of 13. It was formerly used in national channels but it is used today by some networks also. It is official in Catalonia.
* &lt;span style="background:orange; color:black;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''16'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="background:orange; color:black;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''+16'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;: Not recommended for viewers under the age of 16.
* &lt;span style="background:red; color:white;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''18'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="background:red; color:white;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''+18'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;: Not recommended for viewers under the age of 18. A warning tone can be heard when the program starts. These programs cannot be shown on free to air television before 10.00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and after 6.00&amp;nbsp;a.m.

Unrated programs do not display any icon on the screen; in Catalonia, TP-rated shows do not show any icon as well. Nowadays rating symbols are shown during all the program and in promos; each channel has its right to choose its design and where it has to be placed. The "Infantil" rating it's the exception, because it appears during the first five seconds. In Catalonia, only the 13, 16 and 18 ratings remain transparent in the screen, while the others (7, 10 and 12) are seen during the first 30 seconds.

In [[Thailand]], a television rating system was introduced in 2006 alongside a [[motion picture rating system|movie ratings]] for movies. In September 2013, the television rating was revised.

Under the new guideline, the so-called ′Free TV′ channels have to label their programs and reschedule their shows to comply in the following categories:
* '''Preschool''' (ก) - content suitable for preschool-aged children
* '''Children''' (ด) - content suitable for children between 5–12 years old
* '''General''' (ท) - content suitable for general audiences
* '''PG 13''' (๑๓) - content suitable for people aged 13 and above, but can be watched by those who are under the recommended age if parental guidance is provided. Under this category, the content can be shown on television between 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.
* '''PG 18''' (๑๘) - content suitable for people aged above 18 years old; those who are younger than 18 must be provided with parental guidance. The programs can be shown on television between 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.
* '''Adults''' (ฉ) - content unsuitable for children and youngsters, and can be viewed on TV only between 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 05:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.

TV programs in Thailand are already labeled by a certain system of categories, a practice criticised by rights group as nanny-state censorship and ridiculed by some Netizens for its confusing standards.

The Ukrainian TV content rating system was adopted on 15 September 2003. It started with three classifications (&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;●&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:yellow;"&gt;▲&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;). On 6 May 2016, the classifications were replaced, and shows that do not have age restrictions are not rated. The new ratings are as follows:
* '''12+''': Program contains content that may require parental guidance for children under 12.
* '''16+''': Program contains content that may require parental guidance for children under 16.
* '''18+''': Program is only for viewers aged 18 and over. In it there are scenes containing nudity, drug use, or violence. These programs may only be broadcast late at night (10&amp;nbsp;p.m.–6&amp;nbsp;a.m.).

These designations must be displayed on the lower right corner of the television screen.

Some thematic elements, according to the FCC, "may call for parental guidance and/or the program may contain one or more of the following" sub-ratings, designated with an alphabetic letter:
* '''D''' – [[Innuendo|Suggestive dialogue]]
* '''L''' – [[Profanity|Coarse language]]
* '''S''' – [[Human sexuality|Sexual content]]
* '''V''' – [[Violence]]
** '''FV''' – Fantasy violence (exclusive to [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-Y7|TV-Y7]])

Up to four content descriptors can be applied alongside an applied rating, depending on the kind of suggestive content featured in a program (with the exception of the "FV" sub-rating, due to its sole applicable use for children's programs). As the rating increases pertaining to the age, the content matters generally get more intensive. The 'suggestive dialogue' descriptor is used for TV-PG and TV-14 rated programs only, although certain networks may choose to rate their TV-MA programs with the descriptor, while the DLSV sub-ratings are only used with the TV-PG and TV-14 ratings. The violence descriptor was used for TV-Y7 programs until the creation of the 'FV' descriptor in 1997.

'''Imre Kirafly  and [[Bolossy Kiralfy]]''' were highly influential [[burlesque]] and [[spectacle]] producers in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] toward the end of the 19th century. The brothers paved the way for many of our modern day spectacles.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} With backgrounds in music and dance, these performers turned producers dazzled [[New York City]] with theatrical wonders. The brothers had a long and successful partnership and even continued to have success in their individual careers. From [[folk dancing]] in Europe to directing and producing in the United States, the Kiralfys spent their lives astounding audiences with unseen visual phenomenon and were never afraid to push the boundaries earning them a special place in entertainment history.

== Family life ==
[[File:Imre Kiralfy's Venice the bride of the sea, performance poster, 1891.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Imre Kiralfy's greatest of all spectacles, ''[[Venice in London|Venice, The Bride of the Sea]]'' at the [[Olympia, London]], featured lluminated aquatic festivities.]]
The Kiralfy Brothers, Imre (1845-1919) and Bolossy (1848-1932), were the eldest of seven siblings born in the 1840s in [[Budapest]] during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolution]], in which their father, Jacob Königsbaum, was ruined. When they were young children, Imre and Bolossy began to teach themselves to dance. They continued for years until their father caught them and promptly enrolled them in dance classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Creator of Great Musical Spectacles: An Autobiography|date=1988|publisher=Mich: UMI Research Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, they were dancing at large venues such as the Hungarian Circus. There the brothers first performed under the name “Kiralfy” instead of their family name of Königsbaum; the boys’ father changed their name to prevent them from being recognized as the sons of a revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy,Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were never recognized, though over the years, there were a number of close encounters with [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]n police, during many of which their father was nearly arrested. Jacob Königsbaum and their mother, Anna (Rosa) Weisberger, were highly supportive of their sons’ career. They gave up their clothing business to take the brothers on tour through [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the family continued to travel, touring all through both [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Western Europe]], while the three of the four younger siblings went to school and learned dance.  The Kiralfy family motto was “All the World’s a Stage.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tenneriello|first1=Susan|title=Spectacle Culture and American Identity: 1815-1940|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, their sisters Haniola, Emile and Katie, as well as their youngest brother Arnold joined Imre and Bolossy in the dance industry. Only their brother Ronald was uninterested in dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career and education ==

As teenagers in the 1860s, Bolossy and Imre travelled to [[Paris]], where they were immediately taken with theatrical spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolossy believes he first developed his theory of theatre in the city:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Real musical theatre had to be popular theatre, attracting an audience from all segments of society. It had to embody in logical form all aspects of the theatre – music, lyrics, dance and drama – in a production that was usually greater than the sum of its parts. It had to have a meaningful story with a universal theme, and it had to have a hero or heroine with whom the audience could sympathize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

[[File:Victorien Sardou - Dolores.jpg|thumb|Bolossy Kiralfy's grand Parisian production, ''Dolores'' by Victorien Sardou]]
Imre and Bolossy both trained at the [[Paris Opera Ballet|Opera Ballet]] but they refused to become permanent performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craig|first1=Jenifer|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator of Great Musical Spectacles: An Autobiography by Barbara M. Barker; Bolossy Kiralfy|journal=Dance Research Journal|date=1990|volume=22|issue=2|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolossy reflects on his training in [[Paris]]:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no question that in Paris I acquired my training, not only in the finest Ballet technique from Monsieur Barres, but in the areas of production and management. The presentations at the Theatre Francais taught me dramatic staging. My experience at the Theatre de la Porte-Saint-Martin and at the Chatelet gave me the ability to produce big spectacular numbers. At the Opera I learned the choreography that would help me to plan my lavish musical productions. And it was there that my encounters with the artists proved how exciting and challenging the work of producers and directors could be.&lt;ref&gt;Bolossy Kiralfy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Bolossy Kiralfy was 26 when he retired as a performer and began the second phase of his career where he focused on producing and choreographing. He adapted European productions to the United States. The Kiralfy Brothers had a 13-year-long producing partnership.  According to Bolossy Kiralfy, “The American public not only became educated of our large dance extravaganzas, they demanded them in all musical productions.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craig|first1=Jenifer|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator of Great Musical Spectacles: An Autobiography by Barbara M. Barker; Bolossy Kiralfy|journal=Dance Research Journal|date=1990|volume=22|issue=2|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When they travelled to [[New York City]] in May 1869, the Kiralfy Brothers may already have envisioned how to produce their ideas of spectacle on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For four years, the family continued to tour as dancers, until eventually being contracted by [[Niblo's Garden]], just after the theatre’s immense success with ''[[The Black Crook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their first foray into the production side of theatre came in 1871, with the [[pantomime]] ''[[Humpty Dumpty]]'' at the Olympic, in which the “Kiralfy Troupe,” as they had come to be known, were performing. The reviewers of the production praised both the dancing and the scenery greatly, declaring the latter to be “of exceptional beauty”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amusements-Theatrical-Pantomime at the Olympic|issue=September 1st|publisher=New York Times|date=1871|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; This “exceptional beauty” would become a common theme in reviews of the Kiralfy Brothers' productions.

'''''The Black Crook'''''

[[File:The Black Crook.jpg|thumb|''The Black Crook'']]
In August 1873, the brothers first produced their own musical spectacle, a revival of ''[[The Black Crook]]'' at [[Niblo's Garden]]. They added musical numbers, improved the costumes (beyond exposing the legs of the actresses), and strengthened the dance numbers. According to Bolossy Kiralfy, their revival was an immense success, playing over one hundred performances before going on tour and breaking [[Niblo's Garden]]'s record number of performances of a revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their production, featuring actors such as [[George Atkins (actor)|George Atkins]], E.K. Collier, and W. Martin, as well as the Kiralfy sisters’ dancing talents, was later revived from November 1874 to January 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odell|first1=George C.D.|title=Annals of the New York Stage|date=1970|publisher=Ams Pr Inc|pages=406, 555|edition=Vol. IX. 1870-1875}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this production, the brothers achieved their goal of making popular theatre, and they made a strong effort to elevate ''The Black Crook'' into a slightly higher class of theatre.

'''''The Deluge, or Paradise Lost'''''

The next year, they imported the French spectacle ''The Deluge'' to [[Niblo's Garden]], and were noted for producing rain on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Deluge'', otherwise known as ''Paradise Lost,'' opened [[Niblo's Garden]]'s 1874-1875 season, on September 4, 1874.  This production was called a “delectability” by the historian George Odell. Its players included actresses Julia Seamen, Lillie McDonald and Katie New, as well as the Kiralfy Sisters as dancers. ''The Deluge'' ran until November 14, 1874 and a competing theater company, [[Bryant's Minstrels]], opened their own ''The Deluge'' on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odell|first1=George C.D.|title=Annals of the New York Stage|date=1970|publisher=Ams Pr Inc|page=548|edition=Vol. IX. 1870-1875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odell said it brought  “a veritable flood-tide of success”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odell|first1=George C.D.|title=Annals of the New York Stage|date=1970|publisher=Ams Pr Inc|page=608|edition=Vol. IX. 1870-1875}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one of the many revivals of the Kiralfy Brothers’ production was brought to the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]] in April 1879, reviewers praised the ballet and scenery, while essentially ignoring the acting. One reviewer comments that the sets of “Pandemonium, [[the Garden of Eden]], and the Temple of Enoch were wonderful to behold, and were master-pieces of scenic painting,” and goes on to note that, because the piece was under the direction of the Kiralfys, it would “undoubtedly draw full houses”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tryniski|first1=Thomas M.|title=Drama in the United States|publisher=The New York Mirror|date=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Deluge'' is a perfect example of the Kiralfys’ mastery of the key concepts of [[burlesque]]; the plot was weak but the gorgeous set, astonishing special effects, and beautiful girls served well to cover this up.

'''''Around the World in Eighty Days'''''

[[File:Around the World in 80 days.jpg|thumb|The Kiralfy Brothers' amazing adaptation of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1877)]]

On August 28, 1875, the Kiralfy Brothers put up, “in spectacular style,” ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' at the New York [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odell|first1=George C.D.|title=Annals of the New York Stage|date=1970|publisher=Ams Pr Inc|page=66|edition=Vol. X. 1875-1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bolossy Kiralfy, their goal with the production was to “convert American theatre audiences into enthusiasts for the French style of musical spectacle” which so inspired the brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' based on the [[Jules Verne]] novel and adapted for the stage by Michael d’Ennery, was another Parisian import.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odell|first1=George C.D.|title=Annals of the New York Stage|date=1970|publisher=Ams Pr Inc|page=120|edition=Vol. X. 1875-1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; To mount the show in the [[United States]], the brothers re-created the scenery and costumes from the [[Paris]] production as precisely as possible, and hired all the cast and crew members, except for the principal speaking roles, from the [[Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin]], where the original production was performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of special effects, the brothers rented an elephant for $150 per week, brought a steam engine from Europe to run automation, and created a new stage deck for the Academy of Music to accommodate for a sinking steam ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences loved the depictions of foreign attractions such as the [[Suez Canal]], [[Calcutta]], and the [[Taj Mahal]]. The Kiralfys were immediately praised for their use of pastel backgrounds which please the eye but do not distract from performance. They were also some of the first American producers to utilize realistic set design. For example, their trees looked like actual trees and not theatrical renditions of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Cecil A.|last2=Litton|first2=Glenn|title=Musical Comedy in America: From The Black Crook to South Pacific, From The King &amp; I to Sweeney Todd|date=1987|publisher=Routledge|page=29|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They convinced Jules Verne to add a bit about a hot air balloon to the already-extensive adventures of [[Phileas Fogg]] and his companions so that the Kiralfys could put a real [[helium]] balloon onstage to be operated by wires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from adding special effects, few changes were made to the Paris production. They added the ''Around the World Waltz'' and a curtain for scene changes that was in the shape of a fan. The Kiralfy production was larger than the Paris production, having a cast of 35 principal actors, a ballet corps, and over 200 ensemble members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 
''Around the World in Eighty Days'' opened at the Academy of Music, after a legal challenge due to another New York troupe trying to mount the same Paris production, and it was a major hit. The special effects and exciting story attracted large audiences consistently. It became so popular that the [[President of the United States]] attended a performance. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who attended a performance on September 17, 1875 with Secretary [[George M. Robeson]], General [[Orville E. Babcock]], and former-Attorney General [[George Henry Williams]], “seemed to be much pleased with the brilliant spectacle”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Grant|publisher=New York Times|date=September 18, 1875}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the production closed in October at the Academy of Music, it went on tour to the outer boroughs for two weeks, until it reached the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], during Christmas week in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odell|first1=George C.D.|title=Annals of the New York Stage|date=1970|publisher=Ams Pr Inc|page=729|edition=Vol. X. 1875-1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, like ''The Deluge'', this Kiralfy Brothers production did not end here.   
 
The first of a long line of expansive revivals of ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' opened again at Niblo's Garden on January 22, 1877. It was presented at Niblo's Garden nine times, together with a series of very successful tours and revivals between 1881 and 1892 throughout New York City and the United States. Some of the houses for ''Around the World'' included [[J.H. Haverly|Haverly’s Theatre]] in Brooklyn, the [[Sara Adler|Novelty Theatre]] in Brooklyn, and the [[Pike's Opera House|Grand Opera House]], the [[48th Street Theatre|Windsor Theatre]], and the [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Amphion Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odell|first1=George C.D.|title=Annals of the New York Stage|date=1970|publisher=Ams Pr Inc|edition=Vol. XI.-XIV. 1882-1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the audience and the producers, much of the appeal in such frequent productions lay in the fluidity of the plot, which allowed many opportunities for additions to the story, scenery and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fantastic situations [[Phileas Fogg]] and company get into on their trip around the world, allow for inserts and interpretation. Due to their success with this work, the brothers bought a property at 39 [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], which they used for offices and residence until 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiralfy|first1=Bolossy|editor1-last=Barker|editor1-first=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator Of Great Musical Spectacles|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Mich.|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Excelsior'''''

[[File:Kiralfy's Excelsior.jpg|thumb|''Excelsior'' (1883), a Kiralfy Brothers spectacle]] When the electric lightbulb was commercialized around 1880, the Kiralfy brothers took full advantage. They quickly put a production of ''Excelsior'' into the works with plans to be lit electrically for special effects scenes. The spectacle was presented at Niblo's Garden in 1883. There was still use of gas-lighting and they were not the first ones to employ electric lighting (they, themselves, had previously used electric light in their revival of ''The Black Crook'') but they were the first and only production to be lit under the personal direction of [[Thomas Edison]]. In their production, the invention of incandescent light was celebrated along with the invention of the [[telegraph]] as incorporated in a dance of telegraph messengers. Not a word was spoken in the production and ''Excelsior'' is widely regarded as the Kiralfys’ most important work. That goes to show the Kiralfys’ expertise in dance and spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Cecil A.|last2=Litton|first2=Glenn|title=Musical Comedy in America: From The Black Crook to South Pacific, From The King &amp; I to Sweeney Todd|date=1987|publisher=Routledge|page=29|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fallout and separate careers ==

The Kiralfy Brothers had a 13-year long producing partnership. In 1887, Imre and Bolossy Kiralfy had a falling out and the firm disbanded, driving Bolossy and Imre to produce outdoor spectacles. Neither publicly addressed the split, although, Bolossy intimated that his brother was making business deals behind his back. Upon their split, Bolossy continued to work in fantasy and fable whereas Imre pressed on with progressive era productions filled with science, technology, and machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tenneriello|first1=Susan|title=Spectacle Culture and American Identity: 1815-1940|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The Barnum and Bailey Greatest Show on Earth…Imre Kiralfy's Columbus.jpg|thumb|The Barnum and Bailey Greatest Show on Earth: Imre Kiralfy's ''Columbus and the Discovery of America'' (1892)]]

'''Imre Kiralfy after the split'''
[[File:Empress Hall, Fulham 1937.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Empress Hall]]
Imre Kiralfy’s ''The Fall of Rome'' was produced on [[Staten Island]] with 2,000 performers, a grand number at the time. In 1892, to mark the 400th anniversary of Columbus' "founding" of America, he produced ''Columbus and the Discovery of America'' at the [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden Theatre]]. It was later featured at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] at the Chicago [[World’s Columbian Exposition]]. Imre Kiralfy also premiered his show ''America'' at the Chicago World’s Fair which was picked up by the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in 1893. ''[[Life magazine]]'' in quoted as response to the production “Kiralfy out-Kiralfy’s himself”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tennerielo|first1=Susan|title=Spectacle Culture and American Identity: 1815-1940|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imre Kiralfy then moved to England where he created even larger spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Cecil A.|last2=Litton|first2=Glenn|title=Musical Comedy in America: From The Black Crook to South Pacific, From The King &amp; I to Sweeney Todd|date=1987|publisher=Routledge|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty-four acre [[Earl's Court Exhibition Centre]] grounds were rebuilt in 1894 by Imre Kiralfy in a Mughal Indian style. ''The Empire of India Exhibition'' opened the site in 1895, and was the first of a series of annual exhibitions there, which drew heavily on the abundance of transport links in the area to attract a mass audience. Highlights of the site included the two-storey Empress Hall, built for Kiralfy in [[Fulham]] which could seat 6,000 viewers for his spectaculars, and the 300-feet high [[Great Wheel]] whose forty carriages could each accommodate thirty people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Empress Theatre/Hall|author=Arthur Lloyd|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/EmpressHall.htm|date=|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Empire of India Exhibition, 1895|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/empire-india-exhibition-1895|website=The Open University|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imre Kiralfy became a British citizen in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pes|first1=Javier|title=Kiralfy, Imre (1845-1919)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/53347|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renowned producer died on April 28, 1919 at age 74 in [[Brighton]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Imre Kiralfy Dead in England|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/04/29/96297996.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=April 29, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bolossy Kiralfy after the split'''

[[File:Mathias Sandorf.jpg|thumb|upright|Bolossy Kiralfy's spectacular production of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Mathias Sandorf]]'' (1888)]]

During his time alone, Blossy Kiralfy focused a lot on outdoor theatre. In [[London]] he created ''Venice in London'', which included a lake and water canals. A few years later, in [[Portland, Oregon]], he produced ''Carnival in Venice''. According to Bolossy, this production in Portland required “a huge open air theatre with a particularly broad canal connected to a lake. The four hundred foot stage was the largest ever constructed in the Northwest and allowed me to put two hundred performers in action in one scene. I could still hide myself and cruise the show in a gondola to evaluate the performance.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Barbara M.|title=Bolossy Kiralfy, Creator of Great Musical Spectacles: An Autobiography|date=1988|publisher=UMI Research Press|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1888, Bolossy returned from his trip to Europe and brought two new spectacles to America, ''[[Mathias Sandorf]]'' and ''Antiope''. ''Mathias Sandorf'' is a play by [[Jules Verne]]. Bolossy purchased the play itself along with the scenery, costumes and effects used in the original production. Kiralfy had several interviews with Jules Verne and [[William Busnach]] to improve certain scenes and adapt them for American audiences. Kiralfy also introduced two new ballets in this production; one of them is called ''America'' and required 120 performers; the other one is called ''The Fete of Storks'' and required no less than 200 performers. In this production, Kiralfy included performers like the James troupe of eccentric games, and Alexandrov Brothers, the famous Russian musical clowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With Two New Spectacles, Return From Europe of Bolossy Kiralfy with Some Treasures|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1888/06/25/112635218.pdf|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 25, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The other production that Kiralfy brought was the new ballet ''Antiope'' which opened at London first. Kiralfy promised this ballet to be more brilliant and effective than the ''Excelsior'', which was claimed to be best ballet of the time. The production featured 350 magnificent costumes designed by [[William Charles John Pitcher|Wilhelm]]}. Kiralfy introduced some novel features in this production, one of which was an eccentric boat moving about on real water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With Two New Spectacles, Return From Europe of Bolossy Kiralfy with Some Treasures|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1888/06/25/112635218.pdf|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 25, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bolossy Kiralfy died in 1932 at the age of 84 in New York City.

'''''The Little Show''''' was a musical [[revue]] with lyrics by [[Howard Dietz]] and music by [[Arthur Schwartz]]. It was the first of 11 musicals that featured the songs of Dietz and Schwartz. The revue opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1929.

==History==
The show grew out of a number of Sunday evening variety shows co-produced by Tom Weatherly with James Pond at the
[[American Airlines Theatre|Selwyn Theatre]] .&lt;ref&gt;Green, Stanley (1980). ''Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre''. Da Capo Press. {{ISBN|0-306-80113-2}}, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Weatherly said that they were "really nothing more than high-class vaudeville shows but they were far more artistic than the Sunday night variety programs being offered at the [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]]."&lt;ref name=greens&gt;Green, S., p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revue elements==
"This was the first American revue to give wit precedence over spectacle." Fred Allen (who had been a vaudeville headliner as a juggler and ventriloquist) "won acclaim with his sardonic banter", "torch singer Libby Hollman smoldered." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicals101.com/1920bway4.htm#Dietz "Schwartz &amp; Dietz"] musicals101.com, accessed August 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Clifton Webb, the debonair star, "wanted a number that was more perverse, a number he could deliver all alone in full-dress suit and a spotlight...a lyric with suave romantic frustration."  The song was ''[[I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan]]'',  which was used again in the 1953 MGM musical ''[[The Band Wagon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Furia, Philip (1992). ''The Poets of Tin Pan Alley''. Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0-19-507473-4}}, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;  The song "Hammacher Schlemmer, I Love You" was an "open-hearted tribute" to the hardware store.&lt;ref name=greens/&gt;

According to Kay Green, the funniest sketch was [[George S. Kaufman]]'s "The Still Alarm" which concerns nonchalant hotel guests Webb and Fred Allen, completely oblivious to being in a raging fire. The most "dramatic scene was the torrid dance Clifton Webb and Libby Holman performed after Miss Holman moaned ''Moanin' Low'' in a squalid Harlem tenement." &lt;ref name=greenk&gt;Green, Kay, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith and Litton described another act: "Fred Allen's monologues before the curtain held the audience transfixed, especially one about a little boy who shot both parents in order to be entitled to go to the orphans' picnic."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Cecil Michener and Litton, Glenn.[https://books.google.com/books?id=vIt6mArgiG8C&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=%22+The+Little+Show%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20The%20Little%20Show%22&amp;f=false "The Revue Becomes Civilized"] ''Musical comedy in America'' (2ed), Psychology Press, 1981, {{ISBN|0-87830-564-5}}, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Bloom wrote: "''The Little Show'' was one of the first intimate revues that proved to audiences that all the Ziegfeldian trappings were not necessary for the enjoyment of a revue."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Ken(2004). ''Broadway''. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|0-415-93704-3}}, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Produced by William A. Brady, Jr. and [[Dwight Deere Wiman]], in association with Tom Weatherly, the production opened on April 30, 1929 at the [[Music Box Theatre]] for a total of 321 performances. The revue was directed by Wiman, choreographed by [[Danny Dare]], and had scenic design by [[Jo Mielziner]].  The cast included [[Fred Allen]], [[Libby Holman]], [[John McCauley]], [[Romney Brent]], and [[Clifton Webb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/songs/stage_detail/C224/25548 ''The Little Show'' at Arthur Schwartz listing] songwritershalloffame.org, accessed August 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francesco Hayez - The Two Foscari - WGA11217.jpg|thumb|Francesco Foscari banishing his son Jacopo on the charge of treasonable correspondence while in exile. Painting by [[Francesco Hayez]], circa 1852.]]
'''''The Two Foscari: An Historical Tragedy''''' (1821) is a verse play in five acts by [[Lord Byron]].  The plot, set in [[Venice]] in the mid 15th century, is loosely based on the true story of the downfall of [[Doge of Venice|doge]] [[Francesco Foscari]] and his son Jacopo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/orioncurious/two_foscari_the |title=Two Foscari, The |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2002 |work=Brewer's Curious Titles |publisher=Cassell |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Byron's play formed the basis of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''[[I due Foscari]]''.

== Synopsis ==

Jacopo Foscari, son of the Doge of Venice, has twice been exiled, once for corruption and once for complicity in the murder of Donato, a member of the [[Council of Ten]].  He has been recalled from his second exile to answer the capital charge of treason, and as the play opens he is between sessions of interrogation on the rack.  The Council decide to sentence him to a third exile, this time perpetual, rather than to death.  His father Doge Francesco Foscari signs the sentence of exile, though his spirit is broken by this new disgrace.  Jacopo's patriotic spirit cannot brook such a sentence, he longs to die, and he duly does die of a broken heart.  The Council of Ten orders the Doge to abdicate, and, as the bells begin to toll to signify the election of a new Doge, the old one falls and dies.

== Composition and publication ==
[[File:The Two Foscari, Sardanapalus, and Cain.jpg|thumb|150px|First edition title page]]
Byron wrote ''The Two Foscari'' in [[Ravenna]] in less than a month, between 12 June and 9 July 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|1047665|The Two Foscari: an historical tragedy in five acts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] on 19 December 1821 in the same volume as his ''[[Sardanapalus (play)|Sardanapalus]]'' and ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]''.  Byron originally intended to dedicate ''The Two Foscari'' to his friend Sir [[Walter Scott]], but in the event he transferred that dedication to ''Cain'' and left ''Foscari'' without one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Leslie A. |editor1-last=Marchand |title=Born for Opposition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T8ArAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22the+first+two+appeared+without%22&amp;dq=%22the+first+two+appeared+without%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Vg3GUcrtLMfOOMqEgIgI&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg |accessdate=22 June 2013 |series=Byron’s Letters and Journals, Volume 8 |year=1978 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |isbn=0719534518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He added an appendix to ''The Two Foscari'' in which he launched a stinging attack on what he considered the hypocrisies of the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Robert Southey]].  Southey responded in a letter to a London newspaper in which he dared Byron to attack him again.  Byron initially wanted to challenge Southey to a duel, but then turned instead to poetry and wrote his stinging satire ''[[The Vision of Judgment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wolfson |first1=Susan J. |authorlink1=Susan J.

== ''The Two Foscari'' in other media ==

Verdi's opera ''I due Foscari'', with a [[libretto]] by [[Francesco Maria Piave]], was based on Byron's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Kennedy |editor1-link=Michael Kennedy (music critic) |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music |year=1980 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |isbn=0193113201 |page=191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also inspired two paintings, ''Les deux Foscari'' by [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], and ''L'ultimo abboccamento di Jacopo Foscari con la propria famiglia prima di partire per l'esilio cui era stato condannato'' by [[Francesco Hayez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekelhart |first1=Christine |title=Französische Zeichnungen und Aquarelle des 19. und 20.

}}'''''Tzar: The Burden of the Crown''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] game for the [[Personal computer|PC]] published by [[Take-Two Interactive]] and developed by the [[Bulgaria]]n game developer company [[Haemimont Games]]. It was released March 31, 2000 in the West. The game was met with moderate success; however, it got mild recognition and audience when it was published as a demo in several gaming [[magazines]].

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay is set in a fictional medieval age. The game is a basic real time strategy game that resembles the gameplay of the ''[[Age of Empires]]'' series. The basic goal is to conquer the neighbouring [[monarchy|kingdom]]s and destroy all traces of them, or destroy their [[castle]]s, depending on the selected playing mode. There are many different buildings and characters player can produce, each depending on which of the three [[Race (human categorization)|races]] the player chooses to play as: European, Asian or Arabian. The main differences are the types of special buildings and the types of troops available.

There are four types of resources a player has to gather: food, wood, stone and gold. Food can be gathered by harvesting crops, milking cows or killing them for meat, as well as fishing if the map has lakes or rivers. Wood is gathered by chopping down trees, and gold and stone are gathered by mining. All units have health (hit points) but sorcerers also have mana which gradually regenerates when used to cast spells or summon creatures.

The main buildings that can be constructed by all three races are houses, farms, blacksmiths, workshops, barracks, stables, towers, walls, gates and inns. The players usually starts the game with a castle and a few peasants. All types of resources can be carried to the castle.  Building houses increases the population limit. Farms can be used to produce cows and also as a place to gather food. Stables are required for some types of mounted soldiers, and blacksmiths provide various improvements to units' armour and fighting skills. Workshops are used to build siege machines. Towers are used for defence. Inns are the place where the player can exchange resources and later hire mercenaries and heroes. Docks can be built to fishing and travelling across the sea.

There are a number of elite buildings that are specific for each of the three races. For example, Europeans can build a cathedral, Asians a Shaolin monastery and Arabians a mosque. Another important building is the magician's tower where the player can create sorcerers who can summon different creatures - giants and bats (Europeans), genies (Arabians) and dragons (Asians). There are also many other buildings that create units unique to the race the player is playing.

There is also a campaign option for single players in which the player must complete specific goals, such as destroying an enemy force, or protecting a citadel from attack. The campaign has a total of 20 missions.[[Image:Tzarburdenofthecrownscreenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Screenshot of gameplay in ''Tzar: The Burden of the Crown'']]

The game also includes a map editor where players can create their own maps to play on with strategically placed rivers, forests, and resources to use to build their armies with. The game is best known for the first ever implementation of a full experience system for every unit in a RTS game. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The game doesn't have the commonly known system of ''[[Warcraft III]]'' for heroes but still every unit has the potential to reach level twelve and thus gaining a heroic status. There is no limit of the "hero" units a player can have, as long as they can keep them alive.

The game was considered by [[Linux Game Publishing]] to be ported to [[Linux]], it was however rejected due to concerns within the company about its gameplay and after hearing negative comments about the game from the Linux gaming community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120305205726/http://www.linuxgames.com/?s=Tzar Tzar related posts] [[LinuxGames]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The kingdom of Keanor is under attack by dark forces and much lie in ruins. The old king has died and the son Prince Sartor's whereabouts are unknown.

Sartor is raised as a lumberjack in a village, unaware of his royal lineage as Prince. One day, mercenaries seeking Sartor raid the village, killing his uncle. A wizard named Ghiron arrives in time and saves him, revealing his royal lineage and promises to help restore the kingdom to its previous glory. Ghiron takes him to find allies, such as his father's guard captain Woolin. They save the capitol from being completely destroyed. The trio seek more and more allies, growing enough to be confident in the final battle. Having enough resources, they lead massive armies against the Messiah of Evil, the manifestation of evil on Earth.

Sartor slowly gains allies. He travels far and wide to find people. He finds allies in the Asians on a far northern continent and finds favor when he kills their old time foes. Sartor soon finds Arabian allies on a far continent. He gets taken prisoner one time and his allies break him out of his imprisonment. Eventually, he gets the confidence and his allies to find the final allies.

Then the now-King Sartor leads his army to defeat the Messiah of Evil and his city in one large battle. In the end, he recognizes that evil shall always remain.

Protests during the playing of the [[United States national anthem]] have had many causes, including civil rights, anti-conscription and anti-war, anti-nationalism, and religious reservations. "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" was adopted as the official national anthem by U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931. Before that time, protests also occurred when a number of songs were used as unofficial national anthems, including "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]" and "[[Hail, Columbia]]".

==Early examples==
In 1892, three men, including a friend of [[Ida B. Wells]], were [[lynching|lynched]] by a white mob while in police custody in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in an event known as the [[Peoples Grocery|Peoples Grocery lynching]]. The act sparked a national outcry. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines' call for the crowd to sing the then ''de facto'' national anthem, "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, "I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'".&lt;ref name=sing/&gt; The Reverend substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, "[[John Brown's Body]]". Well's husband, [[Ferdinand Lee Barnett (Chicago)|Ferdinand L. Barnett]], closed the meeting appealing for calm and a careful response, but also expressing great frustration and concern that the violence against blacks may one day lead to reprisals.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;Wouldn't Sing America," ''The Evening World'' (New York, New York) March 28, 1892, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654115/wouldnt_sing_america_the_evening/, Not Their Country, ''The Decatur Herald'' (Decatur, Illinois) March 29, 1892, page 1, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6657652/not_their_country_the_decatur_herald/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[File:Goldman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emma Goldman]] was imprisoned for two years after opposing conscription in the US during World War I.]]
Refusal to stand during the national anthem became a widespread form of protest during [[World War I]]. In some cases, this was related to protest of [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;YMCA Boys Force A Slacker to Salute, The St. Louis Star and Times (St. Louis, Missouri) June 1, 1917, page 3, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116016//&lt;/ref&gt; It was also associated with support for [[Socialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Asked to Resign, The Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, California) October 30, 1917, page 13, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116078/asked_to_resign_the_los_angeles_times/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Men who Sat While Anthem was Played Escape Fines, Jail, The Oregon Daily Journal (Portland, Oregon) June 18, 1918, page 4, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116139//&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolshevism]],&lt;ref&gt;Disturbers Cheer the Bolshevists and Show Contempt For Anthem, Harrisburg Telegraph (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) December 9, 1918, page 16, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116158//&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Communism]]. In one case, supporters of the Communism refused to stand during the song at a trial of [[Emma Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Reds Turned Out at Trial of Emma, The Sun (New York, New York) July 7, 1917, page 4, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116037/reds_turned_out_at_trial_of_emma_the/&lt;/ref&gt; The act of protest was very controversial, and many people were highly offended, so that even accidentally remaining seated could result in violence.&lt;ref&gt;Labor Delegates Strike Man who Spurns Anthem, The St. Louis Star and Times (St. Louis, Missouri) December 10, 1917, page 3, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116113//&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests during the anthem continued after World War I. For example, during the build-up towards [[World War II]], a group of students at [[Haverford College]] in [[Philadelphia]] refused to stand because they felt the custom was leading to "rabid nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Students Refuse to Stand While Anthem is Sung, Wilkes=Barre Evening News (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania) May 31, 1934, page 21, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116195//&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 in [[Arizona]] a federal judge ruled that members of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] cannot be suspended from school for refusing to stand during the national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;Judge Rules for Religious Sect in Fight Over National Anthem, The San Bernardino County Sun, (San Bernardino, California) August 30, 1963, page 11, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116227//&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s and 1970s==

[[File:Jane Fonda 1975d.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jane Fonda]] at an anti-Vietnam War conference in The Hague in January 1975]]
In the 1960s, refusal to stand during the anthem took place for a number of reasons. In the late 1960s, the protest became increasingly common among athletes and at schools, both as a protest of the [[Vietnam War]] and as a protest of nationalism. In December 1968, Chris Wood, co-captain of the [[Adelbert College]] basketball team was removed from the team for not standing, saying, "We believe in the fellowship of man. We don't believe in nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;Didn't Stand For Anthem, Is Dismissed, El Paso Herald-Post (el Paso, Texas) December 11, 1968, page 24, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116260//&lt;/ref&gt; Five white high school students were suspended in [[Cumberland, Maryland]] in February 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Suspend Students Refusing to Stand for Pledge, Anthem, The Daily Courier (Connellsville, Pennsylvania) February 25, 1970, page 19, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116277//&lt;/ref&gt; A federal judge [[Joseph P. Kinneary]] ordered reinstatement of a pair of students in Columbus, Ohio, saying that forcing anyone to participate in "symbolic patriotic ceremonies" against their will was a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthem Protest Pair Reinstated, Lubbuck Avalanche-Journal (Lubbock, Texas (July 8, 1970), page 75, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116307/anthem_protest_pair_reinstated_lubbuck/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1970, [[Kaye Stevens]] refused to sing the national anthem before a [[NFL]] game between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]], although she had sung the previous week when the Steelers played the [[New York Jets]]. She said she was protesting the Steelers planned expenditure of $37 million on the new [[Three Rivers Stadium]] when local officials were underfunding treatment for drug users.&lt;ref&gt;Refuses to Sing Anthem, Traverse City Record-Eagle (Traverse City, Michigan) November 14, 1970, page 13, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116365//&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1968 onwards, [[Jimi Hendrix]] performed an instrumental version using feedback, distortion and other effects to deconstruct the music with the sonic images of rockets and bombs. Common interpretations link this to a protest against the [[Vietnam War]], opposed to Hendrix own explanation: "We're all Americans&amp;nbsp;... it was like 'Go America!'...&amp;nbsp;We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see".{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=271}}

[[Donald Sutherland]], [[Gary Goodrow]], [[Peter Boyle]], and [[Jane Fonda]] developed an anti-war comedy show which featured a skit about people refusing to stand during the anthem which toured about 20 cities in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-War Show has SRO Crowd, The Troy Record (Troy, New York) March 15, 1927, page 1, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116407/antiwar_show_has_sro_crowd_the_troy/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights movement===
At the same time, Civil Rights became an important cause which led to anthem protests. The [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]] was a political demonstration conducted by [[African-American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during their medal ceremony at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in the [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Mexico City]]. After having won gold and bronze medals, respectively, in the [[200 metres at the Olympics|200 meter]] running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". Each athlete [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]], and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist [[Peter Norman]] all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, ''Silent Gesture'', Smith stated that the gesture was not a "[[Black Power]]" salute, but a "human rights salute". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lewis |first=Richard |date=8 October 2006 |title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[University of Wyoming]] coach [[Lloyd Eaton]] dismissed 14 black football players who requested to wear black armbands to protest the racial slurs they faced during games, particularly against [[BYU]]. When the two teams played in 1971, about 50 students at UW refused to stand during the national anthem and wore black armbands during the game.&lt;ref&gt;Wyoming President Says Black 14 Issues Remain, The Daily Herald (Provo, Utah) October 21, 1971, page 19, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116500//&lt;/ref&gt; Another place where African Americans refused to stand during the anthem in 1971 was at [[Northern Illinois University]] basketball games, which led to widespread criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Banning Anthem Discraceful Action, Belvidere Daily Republican (Belvidere, Illinois) December 20, 1971, page 6, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116534//&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests became widespread, and in some cases, arrangements were made for the anthem to be played before athletes left the locker room. Lew Alcindor, later known as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], began to refuse to stand at [[UCLA]] basketball games, and in response the anthem was played before the players left the locker room in the UCLA-[[University of Washington]] game.&lt;ref&gt;Walt Brown, Athletes, Celebrities Personal Moments: The 60s and 70s, AuthorHouse, Mar 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The same was done when the five starters of [[Florida State University]]'s basketball team, all African American, played [[Tulane University]] in 1971 in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;FSU Starters Refuse to Stand for Anthem, Albuquerque Journal (Albuquerque, New Mexico) January 14, 1971, page 25, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116445//&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincent_Matthews_1968.jpg|thumb|[[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] in 1968]]
During the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], [[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] of [[New York City]] and [[Wayne Collett]] of [[Santa Monica, California]] came in first and second in the 400 meter race. The pair refused to stand at attention on the victory stand to boos and whistles from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Athletes Disregard National Anthem, The Bonham Daily Favorite (Bonham, Texas) September 8, 1972, page 5, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116591//&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were barred from running in the 1,600 meter relay later in the games.&lt;ref&gt;Two US Athletes Barred From Further Olympic Actions, Traverse City Record-Eagle (Traverse City, Michigan) September 8, 1972, page 14, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116613//&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights based protests continued into the late 1970s, In 1978, a student was barred from receiving his diploma in [[Dayton, Ohio]] for refusing to sing.&lt;ref&gt;Won't Sing Anthem, so no Diploma, The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) June 4, 1978, page 10, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116628/wont_sing_anthem_so_no_diploma_the/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turn of the millennium==
On August 24, 1990, Irish pop singer [[Sinead O'Connor]] threatened to boycott her scheduled performance that night at the [[Garden State Arts Center]] in [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]], if the U.S. national anthem were played. In her own words, she explained,

{{blockquote|I sincerely harbor no disrespect for America or Americans, but I have a policy of not having any national anthems played before my concerts in any country, including my own, because they have nothing to do with music in general...I am concerned though, because today, we're seeing other artists arrested at their own concerts...There is a disturbing trend towards censorship of music and art in this country and people should be alarmed over that far more than my actions...}}

The Center gave in to her demands, but not without controversy. [[Frank Sinatra]] criticized her the following evening while performing at the same venue, stating that he wished that he could "kick her in the ass." [[New York state]] Senator Nicholas Spano urged people to boycott O'Connor's subsequent show in [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]], saying "I'm sure Ms. O'Connor would be the first to complain if someone tried to censor her performance, yet she is trying to censor the national anthem by refusing to perform where it is played."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legislator Urges Boycott Over Sinead's Anthem Ban|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-28/entertainment/ca-409_1_national-anthem|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Times Wire Services|publisher=Times-Mirror Co.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, there was protest in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], when [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf]], guard for the [[Denver Nuggets]], refused to stand during the anthem before games in protest of [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] rhetoric. He was suspended for his actions and received hostile responses and death threats, but the issue receiving widespread attention.&lt;ref name=Hostile&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/sports/rodriguez-yankees-home-hostile-home.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=sports&amp;pagewanted=all Home, Hostile Home], ''[[New York Times]]'' (August 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jim Hodges|title=NBA Sits Abdul-Rauf for Stance on Anthem|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-13/sports/sp-46409_1_mahmoud-abdul-rauf|date=March 13, 1996|accessdate=December 6, 2016|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Sarah J. Black Celebrity, Racial Politics, and the Press: Framing Dissent. Routledge, 2014. p117-118&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that at the same time [[Sam Perkins]], who played for the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], is a [[Jehovah's Witness]] who refuse to pledge allegiance to any government; he stood apart from his teammates during the national anthem. [[George Shinn]], owner of the [[Charlotte Hornets]], threatened to trade any player who refused to stand.&lt;ref&gt;[[McCallum, Jack]], [https://www.si.com/vault/1996/03/25/211232/oh-say-should-we-sing-playing-the-national-anthem-is-a-vestige-of-wartime-fervor-so-why-is-it-still-a-part-of-us-sports-events "Oh Say Should We Sing?"] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', March 25, 1996, accessed October 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams2013"&gt;Abrams, Roger I.

UPNE, 2013. p4&lt;/ref&gt; After his suspension, Abdul-Rauf stood, but with his head bowed in silent prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams 2014, p 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, two women's basketball players, Toni Smith of [[Manhattanville College]] and Deidra Chatman of the [[Virginia Cavaliers women's basketball|University of Virginia]], made headlines for refusing to face the flag during the national anthem. Chatman, a Jehovah's Witness, protested for one game in March 2003 due to her anti-war views in light of the then-current tensions between the U.S. and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reedy|first1=Jim|title=U-Va.

During one of her team's games on February 23, 2003, a fan named Jerry Kiley, a self-described [[Vietnam conflict|Vietnam]] veteran, ran onto the court and confronted her with an American flag, saying, "She has not earned the right to disrespect the flag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pennington|first1=Bill|title=Player's Protest Over the Flag Divides Fans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/sports/college-basketball-player-s-protest-over-the-flag-divides-fans.html|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=New York Times|publisher=NY Times Company|date=February 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Carlos Delgado]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[Major League Baseball]] team decided he would no longer stand during the song, "God Bless America" out of protest at America's wars in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Abrams2013"/&gt;

==2016–present==
{{main|U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)}}
[[File:Colin Kaepernick in 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Colin Kaepernick]] in 2013]]
During 2016, several professional athletes protested [[police brutality]] during the [[United States]] (U.S.) [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]]. The protests began in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) after [[San Francisco 49ers]] [[quarterback]] (QB) [[Colin Kaepernick]] sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third [[National Football League preseason|preseason]] game of [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. Kaepernick also sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandritter|first1=Mark|title=A timeline of Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest and the NFL players who joined him|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/11/12869726/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-seahawks-brandon-marshall-nfl|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests have generated mixed reactions and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.

Stemming from the Kaepernick controversy, before the beginning of the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey]] tournament in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]], Team USA coach [[John Tortorella]] told in an interview that if any one of his players were to sit out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/world-cup-of-hockey/tortorella-will-sit-anthem-protests-team-usa/|title=Tortorella 'will sit' any Team USA player who protests anthem - Sportsnet.ca|newspaper=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
