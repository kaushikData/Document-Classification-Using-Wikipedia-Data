      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4053">The '''1983 Upper Voltan coup d'état attempt''' was an event which took place on 28 February 1983, in the [[Republic of Upper Volta]] (today [[Burkina Faso]]), just a few months after a previous ''[[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'état|coup d'état]]'' on 7 November 1982, carried out by radical elements of the [[Military of Burkina Faso|army]] against the regime of Colonel [[Saye Zerbo]], who himself came to power in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1980 coup]] against Major General [[Sangoulé Lamizana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manson |first1=Katrina |last2=Knight |first2=James |date=2012 |title=Burkina Faso |location=[[Chalfont St Peter]] |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |pages=26–27 |isbn=184-162-352-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coup attempt on 28 February, which targeted the Council of Popular Salvation and its leader Major [[Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo]], failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rupley |first1=Lawrence |last2=Bangali |first2=Lamissa |last3=Diamitani |first3=Boureima |date=2013 |title=Historical Dictionary of Burkina Faso|location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]] |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] |page=52 |isbn=081-088-010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several army officers intended to massacre the CSP in assembly and restore Zerbo's regime. When they delayed they were arrested by other officials. One of the leading putschists was a commandant who had been considered for the presidency following the 1982 coup. When questioned about the incident, Ouédraogo told the press, "Since our regime makes many people uneasy, it is quite normal that people should plan this sort of reaction."{{sfn|Recent Unsuccessful Coup Attempt Explained|1983|p=770}} He publicly declared his determination to "guarantee order and security" and asserted that "the army will not allow itself to be dissuaded by tribal fights and ideologies". He also stated that corruption and fraud in the business community had, in part, facilitated the state of "total anarchy" over which the government presided, and announced that the national administration would be restructured to mitigate the disorder.{{sfn|Coup Plot Discovered|1983|p=6781}}

President Ouédraogo would however not remain in power for long – large protest against his rule began on 17 May, after he purged the government of several radicals including Captain [[Thomas Sankara]]. Within a few months, he was deposed in a coup on 3 August, led by Captain [[Blaise Compaoré]], who made his close friend Sankara President. This began a period of societal transformation in Upper Volta, soon renamed Burkina Faso by the left-wing revolutionary Sankara, who himself would be overthrown in 1987 by Compaoré.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Heads of States and Governments Since 1945 |editor-last=Lentz |editor-first=Harris M. |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=122 |date=2014 |isbn=113-426-490-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1993 Monte Carlo Open''' was a men's [[tennis]] tournament played on [[Clay court|outdoor clay courts]]. It was the 87th edition of the [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo Open]], and was part of the [[ATP Masters Series|ATP Super 9]] of the [[1993 ATP Tour]]. It took place at the [[Monte Carlo Country Club]] in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]], France, near [[Monte Carlo]], [[Monaco]], from 19 April through 25 April 1993.

==Review==
[[Sergi Bruguera]] won his first title of the year. The Spaniard, 11th seed, defeated French rising star [[Cédric Pioline]] in 97 minutes. Sergi defeated Cedric in straight sets, 7–6, 6–0. 

The top 2 players in the world, [[Jim Courier]] and [[Pete Sampras]], were absent from the tournament. Only four seeds failed to win their first round matches: [[Fabrice Santoro]], [[Henrik Holm]], [[Karel Nováček]], and [[Arnaud Boetsch]]. The top eight players all received byes into round two. The highest seeded player not to make it into the third round was second seed [[Boris Becker]].  He was defeated by Swiss player [[Marc Rosset]]. Other casualties in the second round were [[Guy Forget]], [[Michael Stich]], and [[Goran Ivanišević]] 

In the third round, only one seed, [[Petr Korda]], lost to an unseeded player; however, seeded players [[Richard Krajicek]] and [[Ivan Lendl]] lost to fellow seeds [[Andrei Medvedev]] and [[Sergi Bruguera]] respectively. A qualifier managed to advance to the final eight. The quarter final draw was:

*[[Stefan Edberg]] [1] vs [[Andrei Medvedev]] [7]
*[[Cédric Pioline]] vs [[Jonas Svensson (tennis)|Jonas Svensson]] [WC]
*[[Sergi Bruguera]] v vs [[Carlos Costa (tennis)|Carlos Costa]] [14]
*[[Thomas Muster]] [8] vs [[Àlex Corretja]] [Q]

[[Stefan Edberg]], [[Cédric Pioline]], and [[Thomas Muster]] all eased through into the semi-finals. However, the other match lasted a little longer, as [[Sergi Bruguera]] defeated [[Carlos Costa (tennis)|Carlos Costa]] 7–6, 6–2.

In semi-finals, Pioline defeated Edberg in straights, while Bruguera scraped by Muster 6–4, 1–6, 7–6, saving match points. After over and hour and a half of tennis however, Bruguera was victorious defeating the Frenchman in straights.

Bruguera won his second title at Monte Carlo in 3 years, and was his final win in a Masters final.

The tournament, despite his loss in the final, started Pioline's long career.

[[File:Awraja of Ethiopia.png|thumb|right|350px|A map of the former Awrajjas of Ethiopia]]
'''Awrajja''' were the third level country subdivisions which subdivided the [[Provinces of Ethiopia]] prior to 1996. Awrajja roughly translates to "county" or "sub-province", and contained a number of "woreda" or districts, the fourth level subdivision of [[Ethiopia]].  In 1996 the Provinces and Awrajja of Ethiopia were replaced with Regions ([[Regions of Ethiopia|Kilil]]) and Zones, and Awrajja ceased to serve an administrative function, though they retain cultural significance.

'''Celemantia''' (or '''Kelemantia'''; the modern name of the site is '''Leányvár''') was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[castellum]] and settlement on the territory of the present-day municipality [[Iža]] (Hun: ''Izsa''), some 4&amp;nbsp;km to the east of [[Komárno]] in [[Slovakia]]. It is the biggest known Roman castellum in present-day Slovakia. It was a part of the Roman [[Limes]], the frontier-zone of the Empire.

A Germanic settlement "Celemantia" in this area is mentioned by [[Claudius Ptolemaios]] in the 2nd century AD. It can be identical with the remnants of a civil settlement found next to the castellum or with another unknown settlement or, as some historians assume, it is the name of both the castellum and the remnants of the civil settlement. 

The construction of the castellum started in the 2nd half of the 1st century. It was conquered during the [[Marcomannic Wars]] (166-180) and burned down by Germanic tribes, and was rebuilt later. It ceased to exist around 400 (beginning of the [[Migration Period]]). The ruins were very well visible up to the late 18th century, but afterwards people used stones from the constructions to build the fortress and other buildings in [[Komárno]].

According to a local legend, a Roman soldier, Valentin, kept his mistresses in the fortress. The fictitious story explains the origin of the name Leányvár, meaning Girl Castle in Hungarian. However the name probably refers to the fact that the ruins of the castle were donated by King [[Béla IV]] of Hungary to the Dominican nuns of [[Margitsziget]] who later built a small fortress among them.

'''Christian S. M. Turney''' [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] [[Geological Society of London|FGS]] [[Royal Meteorological Society|FRMetSoc]] [[Royal Geographical Society|FRGS]] [[Higher Education Academy|FHEA]] is Professor of Climate Change and Earth Science at the [[University of New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of New South Wales|url=https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-chris-turney|website=[[University of New South Wales]]|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turney was educated at [[St Bede's School]], graduated from the [[University of East Anglia]] with a BSc in Environmental Science and completed his PhD at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]]. He was previously Professor of Physical Geography at the [[University of Exeter]]. He was awarded the J.G. Russell Award (2004) by the [[Australian Academy of Science]], the inaugural Sir Nicholas Shackleton Medal by the [[International Union for Quaternary Research]] in 2007, a [[Philip Leverhulme Prize]] in 2008, the [[Bigsby Medal]] of the [[Geological Society of London]] in 2009, and the Frederick White Prize by the [[Australian Academy of Science]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick White Prize winner, 2014|url=https://www.science.org.au/past-winners/2014-awardees#white|website=[[Australian Academy of Science]]|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Turney was awarded a five-year [[Australian Research Council]] Laureate Fellowship. He has published four books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bones, Rocks and Stars: the Science of When Things Happened|url=https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781403985996|website=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice, Mud and Blood: Lessons from Climates Past|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3083413-ice-mud-and-blood|website=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1912: The Year the World Discovered Antarctica|url=https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/1912/|website=[[Text Publishing]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iced In: Ten Days Trapped on the Edge of Antarctica|url=http://www.kensingtonbooks.com/book.aspx/35466|website=[[Kensington Books]]|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 180 scientific research papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Turney Google Scholar|url=https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=BcKoMuoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en|website=[[Google Scholar]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013−14, Turney led a privately-funded expedition to the [[Antarctic]] called the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, in the "Spirit of Mawson", to investigate environmental changes across the region and communicate the value of scientific research. Scientific findings include the recognition of a 1965 [[Carbon-14]] peak preserved in "the Loneliest Tree in the World" and shrubs growing on [[Campbell Island, New Zealand]], that offer a possible marker for the proposed [[Anthropocene]] Epoch in the [[geological timescale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global peak in atmospheric radiocarbon provides a potential definition for the onset of the Anthropocene Epoch in 1965|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20970-5|website=[[Scientific Reports]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the return home, their ice-strengthened vessel became trapped by a substantial breakout of sea ice. His book on the expedition's discoveries and the team's experiences trapped by sea ice were published in ''Iced In: Ten Days Trapped on the Edge of Antarctica''.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iced In: Ten Days Trapped on the Edge of Antarctica|url=http://www.kensingtonbooks.com/book.aspx/35466|website=[[Kensington Books]]|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia and New Zealand, the same book was published under the name of ''Shackled''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shackled|url=https://www.penguin.com.au/books/shackled-9780670079117|website=[[Penguin Books]]|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Economic Cooperation Organization''' or '''ECO'''  is a [[Eurasia]]n political and economic [[intergovernmental organization]] which was founded in 1984 in [[Tehran]] by the leaders of [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Turkey]]. It provides a platform to discuss ways to improve development and promote trade and investment opportunities. The ECO is an ''[[ad hoc]]'' organisation under the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter8.shtml United Nations Charter (Chapter VIII)].&lt;/ref&gt; The objective is to establish a [[single market]] for goods and services, much like the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="tehrantimes.com"&gt;http://www.tehrantimes.com/economy-and-business/98000-official-irans-share-of-eco-trade-stands-at-10-billion-&lt;/ref&gt; The ECO's secretariat and cultural department are located in [[Iran]], its economic bureau is in [[Turkey]] and its scientific bureau is situated in [[Pakistan]].

The nature of the ECO is that it consists of predominantly Muslim-majority states as it is a trade bloc for the Central Asian states connected to the Mediterranean through Turkey, to the Persian Gulf via Iran, and to the Arabian sea via Pakistan. The current framework of the ECO expresses itself mostly in the form of bilateral agreements and arbitration mechanisms between individual and fully sovereign member states. This makes the ECO similar to [[ASEAN]] in that it is an organisation that has its own offices and bureaucracy for implementation of trade amongst sovereign member states.

This consists of the historically integrated agricultural region of the [[Ferghana Valley]] which allows for trade and common agricultural production in the border region of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Free trade agreements between the industrial nations of Iran and Turkey are due to be signed{{dubious|date=October 2017}} in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://theiranproject.com/blog/2017/01/04/turkey-hopes-sign-free-trade-agreement-iran/&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the [[Pakistan-Turkey Free Trade Agreement]] is due to be signed{{dubious|date=October 2017}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/180579-Pakistan-Turkey-sixth-round-of-talks-on-FTA-next-week|title=Pakistan-Turkey sixth round of talks on FTA next week|website=www.thenews.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan has free trade agreements with both Afghanistan and Iran which are signed and are in the process of implementation, and currently most of Afghanistan trade is through Pakistan. And the [[Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement]] is designed to facilitate trade for goods and services for Central Asia via both Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aric.adb.org/fta/pakistan-turkey-preferential-trade-agreement|title=Pakistan-Turkey Preferential Trade Agreement Free Trade Agreement|first=Asia Regional Integration|last=Center|website=aric.adb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in addition to the [[Ashgabat agreement]] which is a multi-modal transport agreement between the Central Asian states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/362727-Pakistan-announces-to-join-Ashgabat-Agreement-Lap|title=Pakistan announces to join Ashgabat Agreement, Lapis Lazuli Corridor - Pakistan - Dunya News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further cooperation amongst members is planned in the form of the [[Iran–Pakistan gas pipeline]], as well as a Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan pipeline. Current pipelines include the [[Tabriz–Ankara pipeline]] in addition to the planned [[Persian Pipeline]]. This is in addition to the transportation of oil and gas from resource rich Central Asian states such as Kazakshtan and Turkmenistan of minerals and agriculture that complements the industrialisation underway in Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. Pakistan plans to diversify its source of oil and gas supplies towards the Central Asian states including  petroleum import contracts with Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1316410/diversifying-energy-sources-away-gulf-pakistan-set-import-central-asia/|title=Away from Gulf, Pakistan set to import oil, gas from Central Asia - The Express Tribune|date=4 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Economic Cooperation Organization was the successor organisation of what was the [[Regional Cooperation for Development]] (RCD), founded in 1964, which ended activities in 1979. In 1985 Iran, Pakistan and Turkey joined to form the ECO. By the fall of 1992, the ECO expanded to include seven new members; [[Afghanistan]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. The date of the expansion to its present strength, 28 November, is referred to as "ECO Day". The status and power of the ECO is growing. However, the organisation faces many challenges. Most importantly, the member states are lacking appropriate infrastructure and institutions which the Organization is primarily seeking to develop, to make full use of the available resources in the region and provide sustainable development for the member nations. The Economic Cooperation Organisation Trade Agreement (ECOTA) was signed on 17 July 2003 in [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtradelaw.net/fta/agreements/ecota.pdf |title=ECOTA |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECO Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) is a new organization for trade promotion among member states located in Iran (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3323/html/economy.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502233616/http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3323/html/economy.htm |date=2 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the agreement reached between ECO members, the common trade market should be established by 2015.&lt;ref name="tehrantimes.com"/&gt;

'''Egypt–Sudan relations''' are [[bilateral relation]]s between [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]].

==History==

[[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] have enjoyed long-standing complex historical ties, centred on historical overlaps in antiquity when [[Nubians|Nubian]] kingdoms ([[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]]) in Sudan [[Nubian dynasty|controlled Egypt]], and [[Egypt Eyalet|Egyptian dynasties]] invaded Sudan, as well as cultural ties and Egypt's quest for controlling the [[Nile|Nile's]] waters. Prior to Sudanese independence in 1956, [[Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820–24|Sudan was incorporated into Egypt]] in 1821 through the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]] invasion and occupation of Sudan followed by the [[Mahdist Sudan]] national revolution in 1885 and the subsequent [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|reconquest of Sudan]] under [[British Empire|British]] rule in 1899.

Sudan was only one of two members of the [[Arab League]] to show solidarity with Egypt in its [[Camp David]] peace initiatives with [[Israel]] in the late 1970s. 

A major dispute between [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] is over the [[Hala'ib Triangle]]: Sudan claims the area, although Egypt has militarily occupied it since 1995, and [[Egypt]] refuses to take the dispute to international arbitration. Another disagreement is over dams in Ethiopia, specifically the [[Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]], which Sudan views as legitimate and of regional benefit whereas Egypt views as a threat to its water security.

Egypt's policy on Sudan is that it was in favour of a united Sudan. As such, Egypt was not directly involved in the Sudan Peace Process that was hosted in Kenya under the auspices of the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD) and that gave the peoples of [[South Sudan]] the right to secede and form an independent state in 2011 after the long [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Sudanese Civil War]] that cumulatively lasted more than 40 years and killed over 2 million people.

The '''Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony''' (''Evangelisch-Lutherische Landeskirche Sachsens'') is one of 22 member Churches of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD), covering most of the state of [[Saxony]]. Its headquarters are in [[Dresden]], and its bishop (styled Bishop of Saxony&lt;ref&gt;The Bishop's title on his/her own [http://www.evlks.de/en/the_church/bishop/index.html home page].&lt;/ref&gt;) has his or her seat at [[Meissen Cathedral]].

==Historical significance==
Historically, its organisation became an example for other [[Protestant]] churches to be founded throughout [[Europe]], the so-called "Saxon model" of a church as introduced by [[Martin Luther]] itself. It was closely tied to the state, whereby the [[Elector of Saxony]] protected the evangelical faith in his jurisdiction. Since the Reformation, the [[Lutheran orthodoxy]] (the "purest form" of [[Lutheranism]]) prevailed among the general population in Saxony and was secured first by its Ernestine and later Albertine Wettin rulers. Beginning in the 17th century, [[Pietism]] also gained a significant following, especially among the working class.

Struggling in making a difference and increasing awareness towards sustainable development in all societies, it made sense in creating Globe Award a truly global prize focusing on sustainability, instead of CSR, starting from 2009.
The award ceremony takes place annually in [[Stockholm]]. The initiative is supported by H.R.H. [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden]].
Despite the world-wide edition, there was a national edition in [[Poland]]. It took place in Gdansk in 2009. The Globe Award Polish Edition was handed out in two categories: Sustainability Innovation and Sustainable City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/polish_edition/en/about.html |title=About |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Carnet B''''': Created in 1886, the ''Carnet B'' was, initially, a list of foreigners suspected of espionage. Prior to [[World War I]], the list was gradually expanded to include all persons likely to disturb public order and [[antimilitarists]] who might oppose national mobilization. Those listed were to be arrested in the event of war. In July 1914 the list contained 2,481 names. However, after the assassination of socialist leader and committed antimilitarist [[Jean Jaurès]] a few days before the start of World War I, most of the left-wing rallied to the ''[[Union sacrée]]'' (Sacred Union) government and ''Carnet B'' was not used to detain individuals. The maintenance and use of ''Carnet B'' was discontinued on 18 July 1947.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This doesn't work: [[fr:Carnet B|"''Carnet B''"]] --&gt;[[:fr:Carnet B|"''Carnet B''"]], Wikipédia en français, 14 July 2013.

* '''Tulard database''': In the [[interwar period]], police officer [[André Tulard]] set up a database registering [[French Communist Party|communists]] and others activists. The database was used under [[Vichy France|Vichy]] to register Jews. These files were given to [[Theodor Dannecker]] of the [[Gestapo]] and greatly assisted the [[French police]] in carrying out raids against Jews, who were then interned at [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy camp]] before being deported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LPV14lGhF8gC&amp;q=Tulard#v=snippet&amp;q=Tulard&amp;f=false ''Verdict on Vichy: Power and Prejudice in the Vichy France Regime''], Michael Curtis, Arcade Publishing (New York), 2003, 440 pp, {{ISBN|1559706899}}.

* '''''Répertoire national d’identification des personnes physiques'' (''RNIPP'')''': a national directory for the identification of natural persons, maintained by INSEE since 1946. It is regularly updated through statistical bulletins on civil status changes, drawn up and sent to INSEE by municipalities and containing details of births, deaths, recognitions and marginal notes made in birth certificates for persons born in metropolitan France or its overseas departments. The directory serves four purposes: (i) to eliminate confusion arising from people sharing the same name; (ii) use by tax authorities and pension funds to verify the civil status of individuals; (iii) contributing to health monitoring by sending daily information on deaths to the Institute for Health Monitoring (InVS); and (iv) generating demographic statistics to assist in decision-making. RNIPP only includes information on the civil status of citizens: family name, sometimes the usual name (or marital name), given names, gender, date and place of birth,  number of birth certificate, date and place of death and death certificate number for the recently deceased, and national registration number. The National System of Management of the Identities managed by ''Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse'' (''CNAV''), the social security pension administrator, is a copy of the RNIPP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/en/methodes/default.asp?page=definitions/rnipp.htm "Definition: National Directory for the Identification of Natural Persons / RNIPP"], National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE).

Records are held for a maximum of 40 years. The STIC has sparked several controversies, as some people have not been able to find jobs because they were registered in the STIC (sometimes wrongly, others simply as victims). In 2005 the [[CNIL|CNiL]] discovered errors in 47% of the records included in the STIC database.&lt;ref name=LDH/&gt;
* '''''JUDEX''''': a system to register criminal offenders and plaintiffs used by the [[Gendarmerie]] is similar to the STIC.

* '''''Base-élèves'' system''': the Students-Base system, a database containing personal data on children age three and older and their families, including psychosocial data and information on competence, skills, and problems. Although initially accessed by educators and social actors, the new French law of March 2007 for the prevention of delinquency granted access to such information to Mayors for the purpose of preventing delinquency. However, after protests, data related to citizenship, language, and culture of origin were removed in October 2007. The ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'', the highest administrative jurisdiction, held in two decisions of 19 July 2010 that the "''Base-élèves''" and the computerised file of student identifiers ("''Base nationale des identifiants des élèves''" or BNIE) were not functioning in compliance with the Data Protection Act. Further, the Conseil déetat considered that the collection of health data in the "Base-élèves" relating to children was not relevant and reminded in its decisions that parents have a right to object to the collection and processing of their children's data. It also held that the retention period of 35 years for the children identifiers contained in the BNIE was excessive.&lt;ref name="PI-France-2011"/&gt;

The new database would be interconnected with the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons (''[[Fichier des personnes recherchées]]'' or FPR). The CNiL protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR.&lt;ref name=Parafes&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-942808@51-931629,0.html "''Généralisation du fichage biométrique volontaire des voyageurs dans les aéroports français''"] (Generalization of the voluntary filing of biometric profiles for travelers in French Airports), ''[[Le Monde]]'' (AFP), 8 August 2007, {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fingerprints''': In a decision delivered on 18 April 2013, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found that a 1987 French Decree related to storing fingerprint data is a privacy violation because:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=93cc918e-5827-4059-9452-063def250630 "European Court of Human Rights finds that storing fingerprint data is privacy violation"], Cédric Lindenmann, Lexology, 14 June 2013.

** the scope of the Decree is not limited to certain serious crimes, such as sexual offences or organised crime, but includes all offences, even the minor ones; 
** the database did not distinguish between those data subjects who were convicted and those who were not, nor did it make a distinction on whether the data subjects had been officially charged; and
** the maximum data retention period of 25 years was disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of the Decree.

===Schengen area===

* '''[[Schengen Information System]]''' (SIS), a database system used by 27 European countries to maintain and distribute information on individuals and property of interest for national security, border control, and law enforcement purposes. The countries using the system in 2013 are the five original participants (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands), twenty additional countries (Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland), as well as two countries (Ireland and the United Kingdom) that participate under the terms of the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]]. The database contains more than 46 million entries, called alerts, mostly dealing with lost identity documents. Person alerts comprise roughly 885,000 of the entries (1.9%). The person alerts include: first and last names; middle initial, aliases, date of birth, sex, nationality, is the person armed and/or violent, reason for the alert, and the action to be taken if person is encountered. The remainder of the database contains alerts relating to lost, stolen, or misappropriated property, including: firearms, identity documents, blank identity documents, motor vehicles, and banknotes. SIS does not record travellers' entries into or exits from the [[Schengen Area]] or individual countries, although 14 Schengen participants have separate national databases which do record travellers' entries and exits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33020_en.htm "The Schengen Information System (SIS)"], The Schengen area and cooperation, ''Europa'', 3 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)''': [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] is a tiered set of databases at the local, state, and national levels. The tiered architecture allows crime laboratories to control their own data—each laboratory decides which profiles it will share with the rest of the country. State law governs which specific crimes are eligible for CODIS. A record in the CODIS database, known as a CODIS DNA profile, consists of an individual's DNA profile, together with the sample's identifier and an identifier of the laboratory responsible for the profile. CODIS does not contain any personal identity information, such as names, dates of birth, or social security numbers. CODIS consists of the Convicted Offender Index (profiles of individuals convicted of crimes), the Forensic Index (profiles developed from biological material found at crime-scenes), the Arrestee Index, the Missing or Unidentified Persons Index, and the Missing Persons Reference Index. As of 2006, approximately 180 laboratories in all 50 states participate in CODIS. At the national level, the National DNA Index System (NDIS), is operated by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/biometric-analysis/codis/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the CODIS Program and the National DNA Index System"], Federal Bureau of Investigation.

'''Hewad TV''' (meaning ''"Country TV"'' in [[Pashto language|Pashto]]) is a private television station based in [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]]. The channel broadcasts news, shows, and entertainment programs to certain parts of the country. It may expand coverage in the future as [[communications in Afghanistan]] are rapidly growing.

Hewad  
Hewad was established in 2006. It is owned by Mr. Kazi Mohammad Omar, who 
also owns AIR. And managed by, Mr. Ahmad Wali Ahmadi. Its 36-40m antenna is located 
in Shaedanu Chawk in Nawe Shar (“New City”), and its 2.5kW transmitter has a 50km broadcast 
radius.  Through  a  more  powerful  transmitter,  the  plan  is  to  increase  both  radio  and  TV 
coverage. Hewad’s  technology  is  reported  to  be  of  a  higher  standard  than  that  of  Kandahar 
RTA. Hewad broadcasts 20 hours a day, mainly in Pashto (95%). Programming includes music 
(six hours a week) and local reporting (seven hours a week). Rural areas are also covered, owing 
to security  constraints.  Interactive programming includes Shkulai Sahar (“Nice Morning”)  and 
Defeker Tal (“Quiz”). Advertising is broadcast for 20 minutes a day at a price of $50 a minute.

'''Irbene''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Ance parish]], northwestern [[Latvia]]. In 1971, the [[Soviet Union]] established a secret radar center "Звезда" ("Star" in [[Russian language|Russian]]; later acquired by [[Ventspils Starptautiskais Radioastronomijas Centrs]] in 1990s) and built a settlement for military officers and their families, naming it Irbene because of nearby river [[Irbe (river)|Irbe]]. The town had a school, shop, sport and concert halls. However, the town was not marked on maps.&lt;ref name="Rasmussen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Johannes|title=Travel guide : traces of the Cold War period : the countries around the Baltic Sea|date=2010|publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers|location=Copenhagen|isbn=9789289321211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the holders of a special permit were able to access Irbene. After the withdrawal of the [[Soviet Army]] in 1993 the town became abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niekonaujo.lt/20101022/vaiduokliu-miestas-irbene |title=Vaiduoklių miestas Irbene |date=2010-10-22 |publisher=niekonaujo.lt |access-date=2015-07-21 |language=Lithuanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"La Mirada Interior"''' ("The Inner Glance") was the [[Andorra]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]], performed in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] by [[Marian van de Wal]]. As Andorra's previous entry had not finished in the top ten, the song was performed in the semi-final.

The composers are Rafael Artesero, Daniel Aragay &amp; Rafael Fernández.

The song was performed 18th on the night, following the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]'s [[Martin Vučić]] with "[[Make My Day (Martin Vučić song)|Make My Day]]" and preceding [[Switzerland]]'s [[Vanilla Ninja]] with "[[Cool Vibes]]". At the close of voting, it had received 27 points, thus ending in 23rd place and forcing Andorra to qualify from the semi-final in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 contest]].

The song itself deals with the need to find one's own beauty before one can find it in the wider world - hence the need for "the inner look" of the title. Backsing singer was at the performance [[Anabel Conde]].

An English version of the song was also produced, titled '''"A Look Inside Yourself"''', with much the same theme.

The song was succeeded as Andorran entry at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 contest]] by [[Jenny (singer)|Jenny]] with "[[Sense tu]]".

'''Lega''' is a [[Bantu language]], or [[dialect cluster]], of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. There are two major varieties, '''Shabunda Lega''' and '''Mwenga Lega'''; Mwenga Lega, with about 10% of speakers, finds Shabunda difficult to understand. ''Kanu'' has been assigned a separate ISO code but is a dialect of Shabunda, and no more divergent than other dialects. 

Variant spellings of 'Lega' are ''Rega, Leka, Ileka, Kilega, Kirega.'' Shabunda is also known as ''Igonzabale'', and Mwenga as ''Shile'' or ''Ishile''. [[Gengele language|Gengele]] is reported to be a Shabunda-based [[creole language|creole]].

According to ''Ethnologue'', '''[[Bembe language (Ibembe)|Bembe]]''' is part of the same dialect continuum. [[Nyindu language|Nyindu]] is a dialect of Shi that has been heavily influenced by Lega.

'''Les Wanyika''' was a prominent band with [[Tanzanian]] and [[Kenyan]] members and was based in Kenya. It was formed in 1978 when guitarist [[Omar Shabani]], bassist [[Tom Malanga]] and two other members left [[Simba Wanyika]]. They were joined by [[John Ngereza]] and [[Issa Juma]]. Les Wanyika made many popular recordings, but are best remembered for their 1979 classic ''Sina Makosa'' and ''Paulina''. Vocalist Issa Juma left the band soon afterwards to concentrate on other musical projects. The group continued until Omar Shabani's death in 1998. John Ngereza died two years later.

==Formation and history==
In 1971, two brothers from the coastal region of [[Tanga Region|Tanga]] Tanzania, [[Wilson Kinyonga|Wilson]] and [[George Kinyonga]] formed a band they would call [[Simba Wanyika]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] for ''Savannah Lions''. Due to unsteady economic conditions in Tanzania in the 70s which strained the music industry, most of the artists of that time migrated to Kenya and other neighbouring countries in search of greener environments.

During that time, travelling between the two countries was made easy by the [[East African Community]], a tripartite agreement of understanding among [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]]. After the collapse of the community in 1977, border crossings were made difficult, hence the eventual establishment of permanent base in Kenya by the group. With its development and growth, the band created several offshoots, but most notable was Les Wanyika.  

With Les Wanyika, new members of the group included both Tanzanians and Kenyans. The famous John Ngereza, Issa Juma and Omar Shabani were all from Tanzania, and one Tom Malanga was from Kenya. This band established a permanent base in Nairobi, playing in nightclubs and on various resorts. Most of the group members have either died or fallen victims of age toll.     

Les Wanyika was formed in November 1978 by Shabani, Malanga, Rashid Juma, Phoney Mkwanyule, Stanely Mtambo and others. It was later joined by John Ngereza from [[Orch. Bwambe Bwambe]], Issa Juma, Joseph Just, Mohammed Tika Abdallah and Victor Boniface.&lt;ref name="widow"&gt;Daily Nation, February 19, 2010: [http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/865012/-/vql73q/-/index.html Widow to mark 12 years since death of ‘Sina Makosa’ composer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Issa Juma later left the band and formed [[Super Wanyika]]. In 1988 Shabani left the group to join [[Everest Kings Band]] led by Abdul Muyonga, but eventually rejoined Les Wanyika.&lt;ref name="widow" /&gt; 

One of their hits was "Pamela", which was written by Shabani and dedicated to his wife Pamela Omari. The song was originally recorded by Simba Wanyika and recorded later by Les Wanyika.&lt;ref name="widow" /&gt;

In 2006 it was reported that the group would be reformed with a new line-up [http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=60&amp;newsid=77278]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The '''Moni''' (also known as the '''Migani''', the '''Megani''', the '''Djonggunu''', or the '''Jonggunu''')  are an indigenous people in the Indonesian [[Paniai Regency|Paniai regency]] (kabupaten) of the [[Papua (province)|Papua province]] (formerly Central Irian Jaya) of [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] (western part of the island of [[New Guinea]]). They speak the [[Moni language]]. They revere a large black and white whistling [[tree kangaroo]] called a [[Dingiso|bondegzeu]] as an ancestor. The bondegzeu was unknown to the [[scientific community]] until the [[zoologist]] [[Tim Flannery]] described it in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The book of lists: the original compendium of curious information|author1=David Wallechinsky |author2=Amy Wallace |author3=Ira Basen |author4=Jane Farrow | publisher=Alfred A.

Niger is bordered by [[Libya]] to the northeast, [[Chad]] to the east, [[Nigeria]] to the south, [[Benin]] to the southwest, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]] to the west, and [[Algeria]] to the northwest. Niger covers a land area of almost {{convert|1,270,000|km2|abbr=on}}, making it the largest country in West Africa. Over 80% of its land area lies in the [[Sahara Desert]]. The country's predominantly [[Islam in Niger|Islamic]] population of about {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Niger}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million{{UN_Population|ref}} live mostly in clusters in the far south and west of the country. The capital city is [[Niamey]], located in Niger’s southwest corner.

Niger is a [[developing country]], which consistently ranks near the bottom in the [[United Nations]]' [[Human Development Index]] (HDI); it was ranked 187th of 188 countries for 2015 and 189th out of 189 countries in the 2018 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latest Human Development Index (HDI) Ranking (2018) |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/2018-update |website=hdr.undp.org |publisher=UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and [[desertification]]. The economy is concentrated around [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence]], with some export agriculture in the more fertile south, and export of raw materials, especially [[uranium ore]].

[[Demographics of Niger|Nigerien society]] reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state. Historically, what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large states. Since independence, Nigeriens have lived under five constitutions and three periods of [[military dictatorship|military rule]]. After the military coup in 2010, Niger became a democratic, multi-party state. A majority of the population lives in rural areas, and have little access to advanced education. As of 2015, 71.3% of Niger’s population cannot read, one of the lowest literacy rates in the world.

==History==
{{Main|History of Niger}}

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:1997 278-10 Sahara glyph.jpg|thumb|Ancient rock engraving showing herds of giraffe, ibex, and other animals in the southern Sahara near Tiguidit, Niger.]]
Early human settlement in Niger is evidenced by numerous archaeological remains. In prehistoric times, the climate of the Sahara (Tenere desert in Niger) was wet and provided favorable conditions for agriculture and livestock herding in a fertile grassland environment five thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Gwin, Peter. [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/green-sahara/gwin-text/1 "Lost Tribes of the Green Sahara"], ''National Geographic'', September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005–06, a graveyard in the Tenere desert was discovered by [[Paul Sereno]], a paleontologist from the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=5593387  Ancient cemetery found in 'green' Sahara Desert]. By Randolph E. Schmid. Associated Press /ABC News.&lt;/ref&gt; His team discovered 5,000-year-old remains of a woman and two children in the Tenere Desert.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The evidence along with remains of animals that do not typically live in desert are among the strongest evidence of the 'green' Sahara in Niger. It is believed that progressive desertification around 5000 BCE pushed sedentary populations to the south and south-east (Lake Chad).&lt;ref name="larousse-history"&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/pays/Niger/135284 Niger]. ''Encyclopédie Larousse'' &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photo1906 Zinder overview.jpg|thumb|Overlooking the town of [[Zinder]] and the Sultan's Palace from the French fort (1906). The arrival of the French spelled a sudden end for precolonial states like the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]], which carried on only as ceremonial "chiefs" appointed by the colonial government.]]

=== Empires and kingdoms in pre-colonial Niger ===
By at least the 5th century BCE, Niger had become an area of trans-Saharan trade, led by the Berber tribes from the north, who used camels as a well-adapted means of transportation through the desert. This trade made [[Agadez]] a pivotal place of the trans-Saharan trade. This mobility, which would continue in waves for several centuries, was accompanied with further migration to the south and interbreeding between southern black and northern white populations. It was also aided by the introduction of [[Islam]] to the region at the end of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="larousse-history" /&gt; Several empires and kingdoms also flourished during this era, up to the beginning of colonization in Africa.

==== Songhai Empire (600–1591) ====
{{Main|Songhai Empire}}
The [[Songhai Empire]] was an empire bearing the name of its main ethnic group, the [[Songhai people|Songhai or Sonrai]], located in western Africa on the bend of the [[Niger River]] in present-day Niger, [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]]. In the 7th century, Songhai tribes settled down north of modern-day [[Niamey]] and founded the Songhai city-states of Koukia and [[Gao]]. By the 11th century, Gao had become the capital of the [[Songhai Empire]].&lt;ref name="boubou-hama"&gt;Boubou Hama and M Guilhem, "L’histoire du Niger, de l’Afrique et du Monde"; Edicef, ''Les royaumes Haoussa'', pp. 104–112&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1000 to 1325, The Songhai Empire prospered and managed to maintain peace with its neighboring empires including the [[Mali Empire]]. In 1325 the Songhai Empire was conquered by the Mali Empire but was freed in 1335 by prince Ali Kolen and his brother, Songhai princes held captive by [[Musa I of Mali|Moussa Kankan]], the ruler of the Mali Empire.&lt;ref name="boubou-hama"/&gt; From the mid-15th to the late 16th century, Songhai was one of the largest Islamic empires in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africankingdoms.com African Kingdoms] African kingdoms – The Songhai Empire&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kaouartal-bei-Bilma.jpg|thumb|The [[Kaouar]] escarpment, forming an oasis in the [[Ténéré]] desert.]]

==== Hausa kingdoms (mid-14th century – 1808) ====
{{Main|Hausa Kingdoms}}
Between the Niger River and Lake Chad lay [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] kingdoms and fertile areas. These kingdoms flourished from the mid-14th century up until the early 19th century, when they were conquered by [[Usman dan Fodio]], founder of the [[Sokoto Empire]]. The Hausa kingdoms were not a compact entity but several federations of kingdoms more or less independent of one other. Their organization was somewhat democratic: the Hausa kings were elected by the notables of the country and could be removed by them.&lt;ref name="boubou-hama"/&gt;

The Hausa Kingdoms began as seven states founded according to the [[Bayajidda]] legend by the six sons of Bawo. Bawo was the only son of the Hausa queen [[Daurama]] and [[Bayajidda]] or ([[Abu Yazid]] according to certain Nigerien historians) who came from [[Baghdad]]. The seven original Hausa states were: Daoura (state of queen [[Daurama]]), Kano, Rano, Zaria, Gobir, Katsena and Biram.&lt;ref name="boubou-hama"/&gt;

==== Mali Empire ====
{{Main| Mali Empire}}
The Mali Empire was a [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] empire founded by [[Sundiata Keita]] ''circa'' 1230 that existed up to 1600. At its peak circa 1350, the empire extended as far west as Senegal and Guinee Conakry and as far east as western Niger.

==== Kanem-Bornu Empire ====
{{Main|Kanem-Bornu Empire}}
The Kanem-Bornu Empire was an empire that existed in modern-day Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Libya. The empire first existed and prospered as the [[Kanem Empire]] as early as the 9th century and later as the Kingdom of Bornu until 1900.

=== French Niger (1900–58) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
In the 19th century, contact with Europe began with the first European explorers—notably Monteil (French) and Barth (German)—to travel to Niger.

Following the [[Berlin Conference|1885 Berlin conference]] during which colonial powers outlined the division of Africa into colonial spheres, French military efforts to conquer existing African states were intensified in all French colonies including Niger. This included several military expeditions including the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission|Voulet Chanoine Mission]], which became notorious for pillaging, looting, raping and killing many local civilians on its passage. On 8 May 1899, in retaliation for the resistance of queen [[Sarraounia]], captain Voulet and his men murdered all the inhabitants of the village of Birni-N'Konni in what is regarded as one of the worst massacres in French colonial history. French military expeditions met great resistance from several ethnic groups, especially Hausa and Tuareg groups. The most notable Tuareg revolt was the [[Kaocen Revolt]]. The French authorities also abolished the widespread slavery among Tuareg communities.

By 1922, all resistance to colonial rule was eliminated and [[Colony of Niger|Niger]] became a French colony. Niger's colonial history and development parallel that of other French West African territories. France administered her West African colonies through a governor general at Dakar, Senegal, and governors in the individual territories, including Niger. In addition to conferring a limited form of French citizenship on the inhabitants of the territories, the 1946 French constitution provided for decentralization of power and limited participation in political life for local advisory assemblies.

The end of the colonial era was characterized by a transformation of the political environment in French West Africa and Niger. The Nigerien Progressive Party, the Nigerien section of the African Democratic Rally Party, founded in May 1946, united various tendencies of Nigerien people in the movement for national independence. In alliance with progressive French elements and other independence African movements, the movements acquired the suppression of forced labor and arbitrary requisitions as well as legal equality between the African and the French citizens.

=== Independence (1958) ===
Following the Overseas Reform Act (''Loi Cadre'') of 23 July 1956 and the establishment of the [[Fifth French Republic]] on 4 December 1958, Niger became an autonomous state within the [[French Community]]. On 18 December 1958, the Republic of Niger was officially created with [[Hamani Diori]] as the head of the Counsel of Ministers of the Republic of Niger. On 11 July 1960, Niger decided to leave the French Community and acquired full independence on 3 August 1960 with Diori as its first [[List of Presidents of Niger|president]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F028554-0009, Niger, Staatsbesuch Bundespräsident Lübke.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|President [[Hamani Diori]] and visiting [[German President]] Dr. [[Heinrich Lübke]] greet crowds on a state visit to Niamey, 1969. Diori's single party rule was characterized by good relations with the west and a preoccupation with foreign affairs.]]
For its first fourteen years as an independent state, Niger was run by a single-party civilian regime under the presidency of Diori. In 1974, a combination of devastating [[drought]] and accusations of rampant corruption resulted in a [[coup d'état]] that overthrew the Diori regime.

==== First military regime: The Supreme Military Council and Second Republic 1974–1991 ====
Col. [[Seyni Kountché]] and a small military group under the name of Supreme Military Council deposed Diori in April 1974, following a military coup, the first of many in the post-colonial history of Niger. President Kountché ruled the country until his death in 1987.&lt;ref name="Decalo1997"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first action of the Kountché military government was to address the food crisis which was one of the catalysts of the military coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://perspective.usherbrooke.ca/bilan/servlet/BMEve?codeEve=574 Renversement du président Hamani Diori au Niger]. ''Perspective monde'', 15 avril 1974&lt;/ref&gt; While political prisoners of the Diori regime were released after the coup and the country was stabilized, political and individual freedom deteriorated in general during this period. Political parties were banned. Several attempted coups (1975, 1976 and 1983) were thwarted and authors and associates were severely punished.

Despite the restriction in freedom, the country enjoyed improved economic development with the creation of new companies, the construction of major infrastructure (building and new roads, schools, health centers) and minimal corruption in government agencies, which Kountché did not hesitate to punish severely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nigerdiaspora.net/index.php/societe/2547-niamey-une-forte-tendance-a-la-depravation-des-moeurs Kountché: 30 ans après son coup d'état]. ''Nigerdiaspora'', 10 novembre 2007 (republished on 6 November 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

This economic development was helped by the uranium boom as well as optimal usage of public funds.
Kountché was succeeded by his Chief of Staff, Col. [[Ali Saibou]], who was confirmed as Chief of the Supreme Military Council on 14 November 1987, four days after Kountché's death. He introduced political reforms and drafted a new constitution, with the creation of a single party. He went on to rule the country as the Chief of the Supreme Military Council.

The 1989 referendum led to the adoption a new constitution and the creation of the Second Republic of Niger. General Saibou became the first president of the Second Republic after winning the presidential election on 10 December 1989. His presidency started during the Second Republic largely following his efforts at the end of the previous military regime with attempts at normalizing the political situation in the country with the release of [[political prisoner]]s, liberalization of laws and policies.

President Saibou's efforts to control political reforms failed in the face of trade union and student demands to institute a [[multi-party democracy|multi-party democratic system]]. On 9 February 1990, a violently repressed student march led to the death of three students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Historical Dictionary of Niger"|author="Abdourahmane Idrissa, Samuel Decalo"|publisher="Scarecrow Press"|date=2012|page=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to increased national and international pressure for a National Conference. The Saibou regime acquiesced to these demands by the end of 1990.

==== National Conference and Third Republic 1991–1997 ====
The National Sovereign Conference of 1991 marked a turning point in the post-independence era of Niger and brought about multi-party democracy. From 29 July to 3 November, a national conference gathered all fringes of society to examine the political, economic and social situation of the country and make recommendations for the future direction of the country. The conference was presided over by Prof. [[André Salifou]] and developed a plan for a [[transitional government]]. This transitional government was installed in November 1991 to manage the affairs of state until the institutions of the Third Republic were put into place in April 1993.

While the economy deteriorated over the course of the transition, there were certain notable accomplishments, including the successful conduct of a constitutional referendum; the adoption of key legislation such as the electoral and rural codes; and the holding of several free, fair, and non-violent nationwide elections. [[Freedom of the press]] flourished, with the appearance of several new independent newspapers.

After the National Sovereign Conference, the transitional government drafted a new constitution that eliminated the previous single-party system of the 1989 Constitution and guaranteed more freedom. The new constitution was adopted by a referendum on 26 December 1992. Following this, presidential elections were held and [[Mahamane Ousmane]] became the first president of the Third Republic on 27 March 1993. The presidency of Mahamane Ousmane was characterized by political turbulence, with four government changes and early legislative elections called in 1995.

The parliamentary election forced [[cohabitation (politics)|cohabitation]] between a rival president and prime minister and ultimately led to governmental paralysis. As part of an initiative started under the National Sovereign Conference the government signed peace accords in April 1995 with [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and [[Tubu people|Toubou]] groups that had been in rebellion since 1990. These groups claimed they lacked attention and resources from the central government. The government agreed to absorb some of the former rebels into the military and, with French assistance, to help others return to a productive civilian life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Publications|first1=USA International Business|title=Niger Foreign Policy and Government Guide|date=2007|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9781433036873|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gwInUH18i8wC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=The+niger+agreed+to+absorb+some+of+the+former+rebels+into+the+military+and,+with+French+assistance,+to+help+others+return+to+a+productive+civilian+life.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RqsgKXIDqT&amp;sig=gcaZwF0S_92s8WlZgEcauTjpTf0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR4KaFrN7YAhVM62MKHeX4D2MQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20niger%20agreed%20to%20absorb%20some%20of%20the%20former%20rebels%20into%20the%20military%20and%2C%20with%20French%20assistance%2C%20to%20help%20others%20return%20to%20a%20productive%20civilian%20life.&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Second military regime, Fourth Republic, third military regime 1997–1999 ====
The government paralysis and the political tension was used as a motivation for a second military coup. On 27 January 1996, Col. [[Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara]] led a military coup that deposed President Ousmane and ended the Third Republic. Col. Maïnassara created the [[Conseil de Salut National|National Salvation Council]] composed of military officials, which he headed. The Council carried out a six-month transition period during which a new constitution was drafted and adopted on 12 May 1996.

Presidential campaigns were organized in the months that followed. General Maïnassara entered the campaign as an independent candidate and won the election on 8 July 1996. The elections were viewed nationally and internationally as irregular since the electoral commission was replaced during the campaign.

Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara became the first president of the Fourth Republic. His efforts to justify questionable elections failed to convince donors to restore [[multilateralism|multilateral]] and [[bilateralism|bilateral]] economic assistance; a desperate Maïnassara ignored an international [[embargo]] against [[Libya]] and sought Libyan funds to aid Niger's economy. In repeated violations of basic civil liberties by the regime, opposition leaders were imprisoned and journalists often arrested, and deported by an unofficial militia composed of police and military.

On 9 April 1999, Maïnassara was assassinated during a military coup led by Maj. [[Daouda Malam Wanké]], who established a transitional National Reconciliation Council to oversee the drafting of a constitution for the Fifth Republic with a French-style [[semi-presidential system]]. The new constitution was adopted on 9 August 1999 and was followed by presidential and legislative elections in October and November of the same year. The elections were generally found to be free and fair by international observers. Wanké withdrew himself from government affairs after the new and democratically elected president was sworn in office.

==== Fifth republic 1999–2009 ====
After winning the election in November 1999, President [[Tandja Mamadou]] was sworn in office on 22 December 1999 as the first president of the Fifth Republic. The first mandate of Tandja Mamadou brought about many administrative and economic reforms that had been halted due to the military coups since the Third Republic. In August 2002, serious unrest within military camps occurred in [[Niamey]], [[Diffa]], and [[Nguigmi]], but the government was able to restore order within several days. On 24 July 2004, the first municipal elections in the history of Niger were held to elect local representatives, previously appointed by the government. These elections were followed by presidential elections. President Tandja Mamadou was re-elected for a second term, thus becoming the first president of the republic to win consecutive elections without being deposed by military coups. The legislative and executive configuration remained quite similar to that of the first term of the President: [[Hama Amadou]] was reappointed as Prime Minister and [[Mahamane Ousmane]], the head of the CDS party, was re-elected as the President of the National Assembly (parliament) by his peers.

By 2007, the relationship between President Tandja Mamadou and his prime minister had deteriorated, leading to the replacement of the latter in June 2007 by [[Seyni Oumarou]] following a successful vote of no confidence at the Assembly. From 2007 to 2008, the [[Second Tuareg Rebellion]] took place in northern Niger, worsening economic prospects at a time of political limited progress. The political environment worsened in the following year as President Tandja Mamadou sought out to extend his presidency by modifying the constitution which limited presidential terms in Niger. Proponents of the extended presidency, rallied behind the [[Tazartche]] movement, were countered by opponents (anti-Tazartche) composed of opposition party militants and civil society activists.

==== Sixth republic and fourth military regime 2009–2010 ====
In 2009, President Tandja Mamadou decided to organize a constitutional referendum seeking to extend his presidency claiming to respond to the desire of the people of Niger. Despite opposition from opposition political parties and against the decision of the Constitutional Court which ruled earlier that the referendum would be unconstitutional, President Tandja Mamadou modified and adopted a new constitution by referendum. It was declared illegal by the Constitutional Court but the President dissolved the Court and assumed emergency powers. The opposition boycotted the referendum and the new constitution was adopted with 92.5% of voters and a 68% turnout, according to official results. The adoption of the new constitution created a Sixth Republic, with a [[presidential system]], as well as the suspension of the 1999 Constitution and a three-year interim government with Tandja Mamadou as president. Political and social unrest spiraled before, during and after the referendum project and ultimately led to a military coup in 2010 that ended the brief existence of the 6th Republic.

In a [[2010 Nigerien coup d'état|February 2010 coup d'état]], a military junta led by captain [[Salou Djibo]] was established in response to Tandja's [[2009–2010 Nigerien constitutional crisis|attempted extension of his political term]] by modifying the constitution. The [[Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy]] led by General Salou Djibo carried out a one-year transition plan, drafted a new constitution and held elections in 2011 that were judged internationally as free and fair.

==== Seventh republic 2010–present ====
Following the adoption of the newest constitution of 2010 and the presidential elections, [[Mahamadou Issoufou]] was elected as the first president of the Seventh Republic.

==Geography, climate, and ecology==
{{Main|Geography of Niger}}

[[File:Ng-map.png|thumb|upright=1.15|A map of Niger]]
{{MapLibrary|Niger sat.png|Niger}}
Niger is a [[landlocked]] nation in West Africa located along the border between the [[Sahara]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] regions. It borders [[Nigeria]] and [[Benin]] to the south, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]] to the west, [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]] to the north and [[Chad]] to the east.

Niger lies between latitudes [[11th parallel north|11°]] and [[24th parallel north|24°N]], and longitudes [[prime meridian|0°]] and [[16th meridian east|16°E]]. Niger's area is {{convert|1267000|km2|sqmi|0}} of which {{convert|300|km2|sqmi|0}} is water. This makes it slightly less than twice the size of [[France]], and the world's twenty-second largest country.

Niger borders seven countries and has a total perimeter of {{convert|5697|km|mi|0}}. The longest border is with [[Nigeria]] to the south ({{convert|1497|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). This is followed by [[Chad]] to the east, at {{convert|1175|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Algeria]] to the north-northwest ({{convert|956|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and [[Mali]] at {{convert|821|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Niger also has small borders in its far southwest with [[Burkina Faso]] at {{convert|628|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and [[Benin]] at {{convert|266|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and to the north-northeast [[Libya]] at {{convert|354|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

The lowest point is the [[Niger River]], with an elevation of {{convert|200|m|ft|0}}. The highest point is [[Mont Idoukal-n-Taghès]] in the [[Aïr Mountains]] at {{convert|2022|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

===Climate===
[[File:Niger map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Niger map of Köppen climate classification.]]

Niger's [[subtropical]] climate is mainly very hot and very dry, with much [[desert]] area. In the extreme south there is a tropical climate on the edges of the Niger River basin. The terrain is predominantly desert plains and [[sand dune]]s, with flat to rolling savanna in the south and hills in the north.

=== Environment ===
{{Further|Wildlife of Niger}}
[[File:Elephant dust bath park w niger.jpg|thumb|An elephant in the [[W National Park]].]]
The north of Niger is covered by large deserts and semi deserts. The typical mammal fauna consists of [[Addax]] antelopes, [[Scimitar-horned oryx]], gazelles and in mountains Barbary sheep. One of the largest reserves of the world, the [[Aïr and Ténéré National Nature Reserve]], was founded in the northern parts of the Niger to protect these rare species.

The southern parts of Niger are naturally dominated savannahs. The [[W National Park]], situated in the bordering area to [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Benin]], belongs to one of the most important areas for wildlife in Western Africa, which is called the WAP (W–[[Arli National Park|Arli]]–[[Pendjari National Park|Pendjari]]) Complex. It has the most important population of the rare [[West African lion]] and one of the last populations of the [[Northwest African cheetah]].

Other wildlife includes elephants, buffaloes, [[roan antelopes]], [[Kob|kob antelopes]] and warthogs. The [[West African giraffe]] is currently not found in the W National Park, but further north in Niger, where it has its last relict population.

Environmental issues in Niger include destructive farming practices as a result of population pressure. Illegal hunting, bush fires in some areas and human encroachment upon the flood plains of the Niger River for paddy cultivation are environmental issues. Dams constructed on the Niger River in the neighboring countries of Mali and Guinea and also within Niger itself are also cited as a reason for a reduction of water flow in the Niger River—which has a direct effect upon the environment. A lack of adequate staff to guard wildlife in the parks and reserves is another factor cited for loss of wildlife.&lt;ref name="Geels2006" /&gt;

==Governance and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Niger|Government of Niger}}
[[File:Mahamadou Issoufou-IMG 3628.jpg|thumb|[[Mahamadou Issoufou]], President of Niger.]]
Niger's new constitution was approved on 31 October 2010. It restored the semi-presidential system of government of the 1999 constitution (Fifth Republic) in which the president of the republic, elected by [[universal suffrage]] for a five-year term, and a prime minister named by the president share [[executive power]].

As a reflection of Niger's increasing population, the [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Niger|National Assembly]] was expanded in 2004 to 113 deputies elected for a five-year term under a majority system of representation. Political parties must attain at least 5 percent of the vote in order to gain a seat in the legislature.

The constitution also provides for the popular election of municipal and local officials, and the first-ever successful municipal elections took place on 24 July 2004. The National Assembly passed in June 2002 a series of decentralization bills. As a first step, administrative powers will be distributed among 265 communes (local councils); in later stages, regions and departments will be established as decentralized entities. A new electoral code was adopted to reflect the decentralization context. The country is currently divided into 8 regions, which are subdivided into 36 districts (departments). The chief administrator (Governor) in each department is appointed by the government and functions primarily as the local agent of the central authorities.

On 26 May 2009, President Tandja dissolved parliament after the country's constitutional court ruled against plans to hold a referendum on whether to allow him a third term in office. According to the constitution, a new parliament was elected within three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/05/2009526174440137316.html |title=Africa&amp;nbsp;– Niger leader dissolves parliament |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began a political struggle between Tandja, trying to extend his term-limited authority beyond 2009 through the establishment of a Sixth Republic, and his opponents who demanded that he step down at the end of his second term in December 2009. See [[2009 Nigerien constitutional crisis]]. The military took over the country and President Tandja was put in prison, charged with corruption.

The military kept their promise to return the country to democratic civilian rule. A constitutional referendum and national elections were held. A presidential election was held on 31 January 2011, but as no clear winner emerged, run-off elections were held on 12 March 2011. [[Mahamadou Issoufou]] of the [[Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism]] was elected president. A parliamentary election was held at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Romoke W.

===Foreign relations===
[[File:Drapeau Niger ambassade Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Niger's flag waving at the embassy in Paris.]]
{{Main|Foreign relations of Niger}}
Niger pursues a moderate foreign policy and maintains friendly relations with the West and the Islamic world as well as non-aligned countries. It belongs to the UN and its main specialized agencies and in 1980–81 served on the [[UN Security Council]]. Niger maintains a special relationship with former colonial power France and has close relations with its West African neighbors.

It is a charter member of the [[African Union]] and the [[West African Monetary Union]] and also belongs to the [[Niger Basin Authority]] and [[Lake Chad Basin Commission]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] and the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]). The westernmost regions of Niger are joined with contiguous regions of Mali and Burkina Faso under the [[Liptako-Gourma Authority]].

The border dispute with Benin, inherited from colonial times and concerning inter alia [[Lété Island]] in the [[Niger River]], was solved by the [[International Court of Justice]] in 2005 to Niger's advantage.

=== Government finance ===
Government finance is derived revenue exports (Mining, oil and agricultural exports) as well as various forms of taxes collected by the government. In the past, foreign aid has contributed to large percentages of the budget. In 2013, Niger's government has adopted a zero-deficit budget of 1.279 trillion CFA francs ($2.53 billion) which is claimed to balance revenues and expenditures by an 11% reduction in the budget from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/22/niger-budget-idINL5E8KM1TI20120922 Niger government adopts $2.53 bln budget for 2013]. [[Reuters]], September 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 budget was 1.867 trillion CFA which is distributed as follows according to: public debt (76,703,692,000 CFA), personnel expenditures (210,979,633,960 CFA), operating expenditures (128,988,777,711 CFA); subsidies and transfers: 308,379,641,366 CFA) and Investment (1,142,513,658,712 CFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://nigerexpress.info/2013/11/28/niger-le-budget-2014-porte-a-1-867-milliards/ Niger : le budget 2014 porté à 1.867 milliards]. ''Niger Express'', 28 November 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;

==== Foreign aid ====
The importance of external support for Niger's development is demonstrated by the fact that about 45% of the government's FY 2002 budget, including 80% of its capital budget, derives from donor resources.&lt;ref name=ussd2009 /&gt; The most important donors in Niger are France, the [[European Union]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and various [[United Nations]] agencies ([[UNDP]], [[UNICEF]], [[FAO]], [[World Food Program]], and [[United Nations Population Fund]]).

Other principal donors include the United States, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and [[Saudi Arabia]]. While [[USAID]] does not have an office in Niger, the United States is a major donor, contributing nearly $10 million each year to Niger's development. The U.S. also is a major partner in policy coordination in such areas as food security and HIV/AIDS.

=== Judicial system ===
{{Main|Judiciary of Niger}}
The current Judiciary of Niger was established with the creation of the Fourth Republic in 1999. The constitution of December 1992 was revised by national referendum on 12 May 1996 and, again, by referendum, revised to the current version on 18 July 1999. It is based on the [[Code Napoleon]] "''[[Inquisitorial system]]''", established in Niger during French colonial rule and the 1960 Constitution of Niger. The Court of Appeals reviews questions of fact and law, while the Supreme Court reviews application of the law and constitutional questions. The High Court of Justice (HCJ) deals with cases involving senior government officials. The justice system also includes civil criminal courts, customary courts, traditional mediation, and a military court.&lt;ref name=Sory&gt;[http://www.etat.sciencespobordeaux.fr/institutionnel/niger.html#Syst%E8me%20judiciaire Niger:Système judiciaire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081126022100/http://www.etat.sciencespobordeaux.fr/institutionnel/niger.html |date=26 November 2008 }}. NIGER Situation institutionnelle. Sory Baldé, CEAN, IEP-Université Montesquieu-Bordeaux IV (2007) Accessed 2009-04-13&lt;/ref&gt; The military court provides the same rights as civil criminal courts; however, customary courts do not. The military court cannot try civilians.&lt;ref name=USHRR2008&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/af/119017.htm 2008 Human Rights Report: Niger] in 2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.

Portions of it may be used here verbatim.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law enforcement ===
{{Main|Law enforcement in Niger}}
Law enforcement in Niger is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense through the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (Niger)|National Gendarmerie]] and the Ministry of the Interior through the [[National Police (Niger)|National Police]] and the [[National Guard of Niger|National Guard]]. The [[National Police (Niger)|National Police]] is primarily responsible for law enforcement in urban areas. Outside big cities and in rural areas, this responsibility falls on the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (Niger)|National Gendarmerie]] and the [[National Guard of Niger|National Guard]].

===Military===
{{Further|Niger Armed Forces}}
The Niger Armed Forces (Forces armées nigériennes) are the military and paramilitary forces of Niger, under the president as supreme commander. They consist of the Niger Army (Armée de Terre), the Niger Air Force (Armée de l'Air) and the auxiliary paramilitary forces, such as the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (Niger)|National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale)]] and the [[National Guard of Niger|National Guard (Garde Nationale)]]. Both paramilitary forces are trained in military fashion and have some military responsibilities in wartime. In peace time their duties are mostly policing duties.

The armed forces are composed of approximately 12,900 personnel, including 3,700 [[Gendarmerie Nationale (Niger)|gendarmes]], 3200 [[National Guard of Niger|national guards]], 300 air force personnel, and 6,000 army personnel. The armed forces of Niger have been involved several military coups over the years with the most recent in 2010. Niger's armed forces have a long history of military cooperation with France and the United States. {{As of|2013}}, Niamey is home to a U.S. drone base.

===Administrative divisions===
[[File:Niger administrative divisions.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|Administrative divisions of Niger]]
{{Main|Regions of Niger|Departments of Niger|Communes of Niger}}
Niger is divided into 7 [[Regions of Niger|Regions]] and one capital district. These Regions are subdivided into 36 [[Departments of Niger|departments]]. The 36 Departments are currently broken down into Communes of varying types. {{As of|2006}} there were 265 communes, including communes urbaines (Urban Communes: as subdivisions of major cities), communes rurales (Rural Communes), in sparsely populated areas and postes administratifs (Administrative Posts) for largely uninhabited desert areas or military zones.

Rural communes may contain official villages and settlements, while Urban Communes are divided into quarters. Niger subvisions were renamed in 2002, in the implementation of a decentralisation project, first begun in 1998. Previously, Niger was divided into 7 Departments, 36 Arrondissements, and Communes. These subdivisions were administered by officials appointed by the national government. These offices will be replaced in the future by democratically elected councils at each level.

The ''pre-2002'' departments (renamed as regions) and capital district are:
* [[Agadez Region]]
* [[Diffa Region]]
* [[Dosso Region]]
* [[Maradi Region]]
* [[Tahoua Region]]
* [[Tillabéri Region]]
* [[Zinder Region]]
* [[Niamey]] {{smaller|(capital district)}}

===Largest cities and towns===

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Niger}}

[[File:Niamey night.jpg|thumb|[[Niamey]], Niger's capital and economic hub.]]
The economy of Niger centers on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's largest uranium deposits. Drought cycles, desertification, a 2.9% population growth rate, and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut the economy.

Niger shares a common currency, the [[CFA franc]], and a common central bank, the [[Central Bank of West African States]] (BCEAO), with seven other members of the [[West African Monetary Union]]. Niger is also a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] (OHADA).&lt;ref name="ohada.com"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program for [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) and concluded an agreement with the Fund for [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]] (PRGF). Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations, freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care, primary education, HIV/AIDS prevention, rural infrastructure, and other programs geared at poverty reduction.

In December 2005, it was announced that Niger had received 100% multilateral [[debt relief]] from the [[IMF]], which translates into the forgiveness of approximately $86&amp;nbsp;million USD in debts to the IMF, excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived from foreign donor resources. Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources. Uranium prices have recovered somewhat in the last few years. A drought and locust infestation in 2005 led to food shortages for as many as 2.5&amp;nbsp;million Nigeriens.

===Economic sectors===

==== Agriculture ====
{{Main|Agriculture in Niger}}
[[File:Niger Safari.jpg|thumb|The fertile south of Niger near the [[Niger River]].]]
The agricultural economy is based largely upon internal markets, [[subsistence agriculture]], and the export of raw commodities: foodstuffs and cattle to neighbors. Foreign exchange earnings from livestock, although difficult to quantify, are considered the second source of export revenue behind mining and oil exports. Actual exports far exceed official statistics, which often fail to detect large herds of animals informally crossing into Nigeria. Some hides and skins are exported, and some are transformed into handicrafts.
&lt;ref name=ussd2009&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5474.htm Background Notes for Niger: January 2009] Bureau of African Affairs, United States State Department. Retrieved 26 February 2009. Portions of the "Economy" section are here used verbatim, as this document is in the public domain.&lt;/ref&gt;

Niger's agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18% of the population.&lt;ref name=ussd2009 /&gt; 14% of Niger's GDP is generated by livestock production (camels, goats, sheep and cattle), said to support 29% of the population. Thus 53% of the population is actively involved in crop production.&lt;ref name=ussd2009 /&gt; The 15% of Niger's land that is arable is found mainly along its southern border with Nigeria.

[[File:Niger Farm sand tv 16aug05.jpg|thumb|Drought has turned farmland into useless soil. A farmer examines the soil in drought-stricken Niger during the 2005 famine.]]
In these areas, [[Pearl millet]], [[sorghum]], and [[cassava]] are the principal rain-fed subsistence crops. Irrigated rice for internal consumption is grown in parts of the [[Niger River]] valley in the west. While expensive, it has, since the devaluation of the CFA franc, sold for below the price of imported rice, encouraging additional production. [[Cowpea]]s and onions are grown for commercial export, as are small quantities of garlic, [[capsicum|peppers]], potatoes, and wheat. Oasis farming in small patches of the north of the country produces onions, [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]], and some market vegetables for export.&lt;ref name=ussd2009 /&gt;

But for the most part, rural residents engaged in crop tending are clustered in the south centre and south west of the nation, in those areas (the [[Sahel]]) which can expect to receive between {{convert|300|to|600|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually. A small area in the southern tip of the nation, surrounding [[Gaya, Niger|Gaya]] can expect to receive {{convert|700|to|900|mm|0|abbr=on}} or rainfall. Northern areas which support crops, such as the southern portions of the [[Aïr Massif]] and the [[Kaouar oasis]], rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to mountain effects. Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation, while within the Sahara desert, see just enough seasonal rainfall to support semi-nomadic animal husbandry. The populations of these areas, mostly [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Wodaabe]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Fula people|Fula]], and [[Toubou]], travel south (a process called [[transhumance]]) to pasture and sell animals in the dry season, north into the Sahara in the brief rainy season.&lt;ref name="Decalo1997" /&gt;

Rainfall varies and when it is insufficient, Niger has difficulty feeding its population and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food requirements.&lt;ref name=ussd2009 /&gt; Rains, as in much of the Sahel, have been marked by annual variability. This has been especially true in the 20th century, with the [[Sahel drought|most severe drought on record]] beginning in the late 1960s and lasting, with one break, well into the 1980s. The long-term effect of this, especially to pastoralist populations, remains in the 21st century, with those communities which rely upon cattle, sheep, and camels husbandry losing entire herds more than once during this period. Recent rains remain variable. For instance, the rains in 2000 were not good, while those in 2001 were plentiful and well distributed.

Soils that have become degraded, for example by intensive cereal production, cover 50 per cent of Niger's land. Laterite soils have a high clay content, which means they have higher [[Cation Exchange Capacity]] and water-holding capacity than sandy soils. If laterite soils become degraded, a hard crust can form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration and the emergence of seedlings. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called the [[Bioreclamation of Degraded Lands]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[http://www.icrisat.org/impacts/impact-stories/Converting-degraded-soils-into-productive-land.pdf''Bio-reclamation&amp;nbsp;– Converting degraded lateritic soils into productive land''], ''Rural'' 21, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits and trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought conditions. The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite soils in Niger and increase smallholder farmers' incomes. Trials have demonstrated that a {{convert|200|m²|0|abbr=on}} plot can yield an income of around US$100, which is what men traditionally earn from millet production per hectare (10000m²). As women are often given degraded soils, using this practice has helped to improve livelihoods for women in Niger.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The [[Kandadji Dam]] on the Niger River, whose construction started in August 2008, is expected to improve agricultural production in the [[Tillaberi Department]] by providing water for the irrigation of 6,000 hectares initially and of 45,000 hectares by 2034.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/ADF-BD-IF-2008-51-EN-NIGER-KANDADJI-ECOSYSTEMS-REGENERATION-DETAILED-POPULATION-RESETTLEMENT-PLAN.PDF "Kandadji" Ecosystems Regeneration and Niger Valley Development Programme (KERNVDP), Detailed Population Resettlement Plan], Executive Summary, Republic of Niger, Prime Minister's Office, High Commission for Niger Valley / African Development Bank, February 2008, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drought and food crisis ====
{{Main|Sahel drought|2005–06 Niger food crisis|2010 Sahel drought}}
As one of the Sahelian nations in West Africa, Niger has faced several droughts which led to food shortages and, in some cases, famines since its independence in 1963. This includes a series of droughts in the 1970s and 1980s and more recently in 2005–2006 and again in 2010. The existence of widespread famine in 2005–2006 was debated by the government of Niger as well some local NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eden-foundation.org/project/articles_niger_crisis_2005.html When Endemic Malnutrition is Labeled as Famine].  Eden Foundation (Sweden), May 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mining ====
{{Main|Mining in Niger|Coal mining in Niger}}
The Niger mining industry is the main source of national exports, of which uranium is the largest export. Niger has been a uranium exporter since the 1960s and has had substantial export earnings and rapid economic growth during the 1960s and 1970s. The persistent [[uranium]] price slump has brought lower revenues for Niger's uranium sector, although it still provides 72% of national export proceeds. When the uranium-led boom ended in the early 1980s the economy stagnated, and new investment since then has been limited. Niger's two uranium mines—[[SOMAIR]]'s open pit mine and [[COMINAK]]'s underground mine—are owned by a French-led consortium and operated by French company [[Areva]].&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/05/26/areva-niger-idUKL6N0OC2TB20140526|title=UPDATE 3-Areva signs uranium deal with Niger, delays new mine|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/niger-sets-new-terms-in-uranium-ore-deal-with-areva/a-17667618|title=Niger sets new terms in uranium ore deal with Areva|work=DW.DE|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2007}}, many licences have been sold to other companies from countries such as India, China, Canada and Australia in order to exploit new deposits. In 2013, the government of Niger sought to increase its uranium revenue by subjecting the two mining companies to a 2006 Mining Law. The government argued that the application of the new law will balance an otherwise unfavorable partnership between the government and [[Areva]]. The company resisted the application of the new law that it feared would jeopardize the financial health of the companies, citing declining market uranium prices and unfavorable market conditions. In 2014, following nearly a year long negotiation with the government of Niger, Areva agreed to the application of 2006 Mining Law of Niger, which would increase the government's uranium revenues from 5 to 12%.&lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de" /&gt;

[[File:Niger millet Koremairwa 1214.jpg|thumb|A farmer collecting [[millet]] in [[Koré Maïroua|Koremairwa]] village in the [[Dosso (department)|Dosso]] department.]]
In addition to uranium, exploitable deposits of gold are known to exist in Niger in the region between the Niger River and the border with Burkina Faso. In 2004, the first Nigerien gold ingot was produced from the [[Samira Hill Gold Mine]], in [[Tera Department]]. The [[Samira Hill Gold Mine]] thus became the first commercial gold production in the country. The reserves at the location were estimated at 10,073,626 tons at an average grade of {{convert|2.21|g|oz}} per ton from which {{convert|19,200|kg|lb}} will be recovered over a six-year mine life. Other gold deposits are believed to be in nearby areas known as the "Samira Horizon", which is located between [[Gotheye]] and [[Ouallam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5474.htm Background Note:Niger], United States State Department, Bureau of Public Affairs: Electronic Information and Publications Office.

SONICHAR (Société Nigerienne de Charbon) in [[Tchirozerine]] (north of [[Agadez]]) extracts coal from an open pit and fuels an electricity generating plant that supplies energy to the uranium mines. Based on 2012 reports by the government of Niger, 246016 tons of coal were extracted by SONICHAR in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat-niger.org/statistique/file/Annuaires_Statistiques/INS_2012/AS2007-2011INDUSTRIEEXT.pdf|title=– Coal Production and Utilization 2007–2011 Report P218|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are additional coal deposits to the south and west that are of a higher quality and may be exploitable. Substantial deposits of [[phosphates]], coal, [[Iron ore|iron]], [[limestone]], and [[gypsum]] have also been found in Niger.

==== Oil ====
{{Main|Petroleum industry in Niger}}
[[File:Niger 2008 oilrig.jpg|thumb|A test [[oil well]] in the [[Tenere Desert]], January 2008]]
The history of oil prospecting and discovery goes back to the independence era with the first discovery of Tintouma oil field in [[Madama]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="oilhistory"&gt;{{fr}} {{cite web |url=http://www.lesahel.org/index.php/component/k2/item/1651-le-petrole-nigerien--dagadem-a-la-soraz |title=Le Petrole Nigerien: D'Agadem a la Soraz|accessdate=2014-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714120718/http://www.lesahel.org/index.php/component/k2/item/1651-le-petrole-nigerien--dagadem-a-la-soraz |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; It is the Agadem basin that has attracted much attention since 1970 with Texaco and then Esso prospecting in the basin until 1980. Exploration permits on the same basin were held successively by [[Elf Aquitaine]] (1980–1985), [[Esso]]-Elf (1985–1998), Esso (1998–2002) and Esso-[[Petronas]] (2002–2006). While the reserves were estimated at 324 millions barrels for oil and 10 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for gas, Esso-Petronas relinquished the permit because it deemed the quantities too small for production.&lt;ref name="oilhistory" /&gt;

With the sudden increase in oil price, this assessment was no longer true by 2008. the government transferred the Agadem block rights to [[CNPC]]. Niger announced that in exchange for the US$5&amp;nbsp;billion investment, the Chinese company would build wells, 11 of which would open by 2012, a {{convert|20000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|sing=on}} refinery near [[Zinder]] and a pipeline out of the nation. The government estimates the area has reserves of {{convert|324|Moilbbl|m3}}, and is seeking further oil in the [[Tenere Desert]] and near [[Bilma]]. Niger began producing its first barrels of oil in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hQcHDblgbEGuRpUaW4jhV6n_e5hw?docId=CNG.f2c02c700bcf33947db7403f3c93a92b.81 As refinery opens, Niger joins club of oil producers], Agence France-Presse. 28 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth rates===
The economic competitiveness created by the January 1994 devaluation of the [[CFA franc|Communauté Financière Africaine (CFA) franc]] contributed to an annual average economic growth of 3.5% throughout the mid-1990s. But the economy stagnated due to the sharp reduction in foreign aid in 1999 (which gradually resumed in 2000) and poor rains in 2000. Reflecting the importance of the agricultural sector, the return of good rains was the primary factor underlying economic growth of 5.1% in 2000, 3.1% in 2001, 6.0% in 2002, and 3.0% in 2003.

In recent years, the Government of Niger drafted revisions to the investment code (1997 and 2000), petroleum code (1992), and mining code (1993), all with attractive terms for investors. The present government actively seeks foreign private investment and considers it key to restoring economic growth and development. With the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), it has undertaken a concerted effort to revitalize the private sector.

[[File:To market.jpg|thumb|right|A market in [[Maradi, Niger|Maradi]].]]

===Economic reforms===
In January 2000, Niger's newly elected government inherited serious financial and economic problems including a virtually empty treasury, past-due salaries (11 months of unpaid salaries) and scholarship payments, increased debt, reduced revenue performance, and lower public investment. In December 2000, Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the [[International Monetary Fund]] program for [[Highly Indebted Poor Countries]] and concluded an agreement with the Fund on a [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]] (PRGF).&lt;ref name="ussd2009"/&gt;

In addition to changes in the budgetary process and public finances, the new government has pursued economic restructuring towards the IMF promoted [[privatization]] model. This has included the privatization of water distribution and telecommunications and the removal of price protections for petroleum products, allowing prices to be set by world market prices. Further privatizations of public enterprises are in the works.

In its effort to comply with the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility plan, the government is also taking action to reduce corruption and, as the result of a participatory process encompassing civil society, has devised a Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan that focuses on improving [[Health care in Niger|health]], [[Education in Niger|primary education]], rural infrastructure, and [[Judiciary of Niger|judicial]] restructuring.&lt;ref name=ussd2009 /&gt;

A long planned privatization of the Nigerien power company, [[NIGELEC]], failed in 2001 and again in 2003 due to a lack of buyers. [[SONITEL]], the nation's telephone operator which was separated from the post office and privatised in 2001, was renationalised in 2009. Critics have argued that the obligations to creditor institutions and governments have locked Niger into a process of trade liberalization that is harmful for small farmers and in particular, rural women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061007155426/http://www.3dthree.org/pdf_3D/3DCEDAWNigerAg.pdf Niger: Agricultural trade liberalization and women’s rights].

=== Infrastructure ===

While the [[Maradi Region]] is the breadbasket of Niger, the 20th century saw three severe [[Sahel drought]]s which brought dramatic food insecurity to even the most fertile regions of Niger.]]

====Transportation infrastructure====
{{Main|Transport in Niger}}
[[File:Highway to tahoua 2007 002.jpg|thumb|right|One of the roads leading to [[Tahoua]], central Niger]]
[[File:Niameyairport 2005 crop.JPG|thumb|right|View of Diori Hamani International Airport at Niamey]]

Transport is crucial to the economy and culture of this vast landlocked nation, with cities separated by huge uninhabited deserts, mountain ranges, and other natural features. Niger's transport system was little developed during the [[History of Niger|colonial period]] (1899–1960), relying upon animal transport, human transport, and limited river transport in the far south west and south east. No railways were constructed in the colonial period.
Construction of a network of paved roads linking major cities began after the independence reaching its heights during the uranium boom in the 1970s and 1980s. Primary or paved road systems are limited to bigger cities or connection between major cities. Road connections or networks in rural areas are mostly unpaved, all-weather laterite surfaces to grated dirt or sand plowed roads with various degrees of maintenance. In 2012, there was {{convert|19,675|km|mi}} of road network throughout Niger, of which {{convert|4,225|km|mi}} were paved.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} ''Annuaire statistique du Niger 2008- 2012 .'' [http://www.stat-niger.org/statistique/file/Annuaires_Statistiques/INS_2012/AS2008-2012TRANSPORTROUTIER.pdf  Transport routier]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Niger River, which crosses the southwestern part of the country, is unsuitable for river transport of any large scale, as it lacks depth for most of the year, and is broken by rapids at many spots. Camel caravan transport was historically important in the Sahara desert and [[Sahel]] regions which cover most of the north.

Air transport is mainly concentrated in Niamey. Niger's only [[international airport]] is [[Diori Hamani International Airport]], is located in the capital, Niamey. Other [[List of airports in Niger|airports in Niger]] include the [[Mano Dayak International Airport]] in Agadez city and [[Zinder Airport]] in [[Zinder, Niger|Zinder city]] but as of January 2015, they were not regularly serviced by any carriers.

In 2014, construction for the railway extension connecting Niamey (Niger) to Cotonou via Parakou (Benin) began and is expected to be completed by 2016. It includes the construction of {{convert|574|km|mi}} new railway from [[Niamey]] to connect to the existing line in [[Parakou]] ([[Benin]]). Besides Niamey, the railway line will go through [[Dosso, Niger|Dosso city]] and [[Gaya, Niger|Gaya]].

{{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}}}, the population of Niger was {{UN_Population|Niger}}{{UN_Population|ref}}. Expanding from a population of 1.7 million in 1960, Niger's population has rapidly increased with a current growth rate of 3.3% (7.1 children per mother&lt;ref name="irin-demographics"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/75801/niger-population-explosion-threatens-development-gains Niger: Population explosion threatens development gains].

This growth rate is one of the highest in the world and is a source of concern for the government and international agencies.&lt;ref name="irin-demographics"/&gt; The population is predominantly young, with 49.2% under 15 years old and 2.7% over 65 years, and predominantly rural with only 21% living in urban areas.&lt;ref name="ins-demographics"/&gt;

=== Ethnic groups ===
{{Main|Hausa people|Zarma people|Tuareg people|Fula people|Kanuri people|Tubu people|Diffa Arabs|Gurma people}}
Niger has a wide variety of ethnic groups as in most West African countries. The ethnic makeup of Niger is as follows: [[Hausa people|Hausa]] (53.0%), [[Zarma people|Zarma-Songhai]] (21.2%), [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (10.4%), [[Fula people|Fula]] ({{lang-fr|Peuls}}; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}) (9.9%), [[Kanuri people|Kanuri Manga]] (4.4%), [[Tubu people|Tubu]] (0.4%), [[Diffa Arabs|Arab]] (0.3%), [[Gurma people|Gourmantche]] (0.3%), other (0.2%).&lt;ref name="ins-demographics"/&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{Main| Languages of Niger}}
French, inherited from the colonial period, is the [[official language]]. It is spoken mainly as a second language by people who have received a formal western education and serves as the administrative language. Niger has been a member of the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.

Niger has ten official [[national language]]s, namely [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Buduma language|Buduma]], [[Fula language|Fulfulde]], [[Gurma language|Gourmanchéma]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], [[Songhay languages|Zarma &amp; Songhai]], [[Tuareg languages|Tamasheq]], [[Tasawaq language|Tassawaq]], [[Tebu languages|Tebu]].&lt;ref name="axl.cefan.ulaval.ca"/&gt; Each is spoken as a first language primarily by the ethnic group with which it is associated.&lt;ref&gt;Ethologue.

Niger is a [[secular country]] and separation of state and religion is guaranteed by Articles 3 and 175 of the 2010 Constitution, which dictate that future amendments or revisions may not modify the secular nature of the republic of Niger. [[Religious freedom]] is protected by Article 30 of the same constitution. [[Islam]], widespread in the region since the 10th century, has greatly shaped the culture and mores of the people of Niger. Islam is the most dominant religion, practiced by 99% of the population according to the 2012 census.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.stat-niger.org/statistique/file/RGPH2012/ETAT_STRUCTURE_POPULATION.pdf | title = Recensement général de la population et de l'habitat 2012 | last = Institut national de la statistique | date = November 2015 | access-date =July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other two main religions of Niger are [[Christianity]], practiced by 0.3% of the population, and Animism ([[African traditional religion|traditional indigenous religious beliefs]]), practiced by 0.2% of the population.&lt;ref name="census" /&gt; Christianity was established earlier in the country by missionaries during the French colonial years. Other urban Christian expatriate communities from Europe and West Africa are also presented. Religious persecution is rare in Niger which is ranked last (#50) on the [[World Watch List]] for severity of persecution that Christians face for actively pursuing their faith.

The numbers of Animist practitioners are a point of contention. As recently as the late 19th century, much of the south center of the nation was unreached by Islam, and the conversion of some rural areas has been only partial. There are still areas where animist based festivals and traditions (such as the [[Bori (religion)|Bori religion]]) are practiced by [[syncretic]] Muslim communities (in some Hausa areas as well as among some [[Toubou]] and [[Wodaabe]] pastoralists), as opposed to several small communities who maintain their pre-Islamic religion. These include the Hausa-speaking [[Maouri people|Maouri]] (or ''Azna'', the Hausa word for "pagan") community in [[Dogondoutci]] in the south-southwest and the [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] speaking Manga near [[Zinder]], both of whom practice variations of the pre-Islamic Hausa [[Maguzawa]] religion. There are also some tiny Boudouma and Songhay animist communities in the southwest.&lt;ref name=Decalo79/&gt;

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Islam was spread into what is now Niger beginning in the 15th century, by both the expansion of the [[Songhai Empire]] in the west, and the influence of the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] traveling from the [[Maghreb]] and [[Egypt]]. [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] expansion from the north, culminating in their seizure of the far eastern oases from the [[Bornu Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]] in the 17th centuries, spread distinctively [[Berber mythology|Berber]] practices.

Both [[Zarma people|Zarma]] and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] areas were greatly influenced by the 18th- and 19th-century [[Fula jihads|Fula led]] [[Sufi]] brotherhoods, most notably the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] (in today's Nigeria). Modern Muslim practice in Niger is often tied to the [[Tijaniya]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Tariqah|brotherhoods]], although there are small minority groups tied to [[Hammallism]] and [[Nyassist]] Sufi orders in the west, and the [[Sanusiya]] in the far northeast.&lt;ref name=Decalo79&gt;Decalo, James.

A small center of followers of Salafi movement within Sunni Islam have appeared in the last thirty years, in the capital and in [[Maradi, Niger|Maradi]].&lt;ref&gt;Decalo (1997) p. 261–2, 158, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; These small groups, linked to similar groups in [[Jos]], Nigeria, came to public prominence in the 1990s during a series of religious riots.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Amara, Ramzi.

Despite this, Niger maintains a tradition as a [[secular state]], protected by law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5684.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2001: Niger].

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Niger}}
[[File:Niger primary school MCC3500.jpg|thumb|A primary classroom in Niger.]]
The [[literacy rate]] of Niger is among the lowest in the world; in 2005 it was estimated to be only 28.7% (42.9% male and 15.1% female).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ng.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary education in Niger is compulsory for six years.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/Niger.htm "Niger"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205044526/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/niger.htm |date=5 December 2008 }}.

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Niger}}

The child mortality rate in Niger (deaths among children between the ages of 1 and 4) is high (248 per 1,000) due to generally poor health conditions and inadequate nutrition for most of the country's children. According to the organization [[Save the Children]], Niger has the world's highest [[infant mortality rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff |last=Green |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/parenting/05/08/mothers.index/index.html |title=U.S. has second worst newborn death rate in modern world, report says | publisher=CNN |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niger also has the highest [[fertility rate]] in the world (6.49 births per woman according to 2017 estimates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;); this means that nearly half (49%) of the Nigerien population is under age 15. Niger has the 11th highest [[maternal mortality]] rate in the world at 820 deaths/100,000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html?countryName=Niger&amp;countryCode=ng&amp;regionCode=afr&amp;rank=11#ng |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 3 physicians and 22 nurses per 100,000 persons in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angellite.org.uk/where-we-work.html|title=Niger|accessdate=20 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123142319/http://www.angellite.org.uk/where-we-work.html|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Niger}}
[[File:Zinder sultans horsemen festival.jpg|thumb|Horsemen at the traditional [[Ramadan]] festival at the [[Sultanate of Damagaram|Sultan's]] Palace in the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] city of [[Zinder]].]]
[[File:Ancient home zinder niger.jpg|thumb|A traditional home in [[Zinder]].]]

Nigerien culture is marked by variation, evidence of the cultural crossroads which [[French colonial empires|French colonialism]] formed into a unified state from the beginning of the 20th century. What is now Niger was created from four distinct cultural areas in the pre-colonial era: the [[Zarma people|Zarma]] dominated [[Niger River]] valley in the southwest; the northern periphery of [[Hausaland]], made mostly of those states which had resisted the [[Sokoto Caliphate]], and ranged along the long southern border with Nigeria; the [[Chad basin|Lake Chad basin]] and [[Kaouar]] in the far east, populated by [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] farmers and [[Toubou]] pastoralists who had once been part of the [[Bornu Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]]; and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomads of the [[Aïr Mountains]] and Saharan desert in the vast north.

Each of these communities, along with smaller ethnic groups like the pastoral [[Wodaabe]] [[Fula people|Fula]], brought their own cultural traditions to the new state of Niger. While successive post-independence governments have tried to forge a shared national culture, this has been slow forming, in part because the major Nigerien communities have their own cultural histories, and in part because Nigerien ethnic groups such as the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], Tuareg and Kanuri are but part of larger ethnic communities which cross borders introduced under colonialism.

Until the 1990s, government and politics was inordinately dominated by [[Niamey]] and the [[Zarma people]] of the surrounding region. At the same time the plurality of the population, in the Hausa borderlands between [[Birni-N'Konni]] and [[Maine-Soroa]], have often looked culturally more to Hausaland in Nigeria than Niamey. Between 1996 and 2003, primary school attendance was around 30%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/Niger_statistics.html |title=At a glance: Niger |accessdate=2007-06-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130170853/http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/Niger_statistics.html |archivedate=30 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including 36% of males and only 25% of females. Additional education occurs through [[madrasa]]s.

===Festivals and cultural events===

[[File:1997 274-5 Gerewol.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Participants in the [[Guérewol]] perform the ''Guérewol'' dance, 1997.]]
The Guérewol festival is a traditional Wodaabe cultural event that takes place in [[Abalak]] in [[Tahoua Region|Tahoua region]] or [[In-Gall|In'Gall]] in [[Agadez Region]]. It is an annual traditional courtship ritual practiced by the Wodaabe (Fula) people of Niger. During this ceremony, young men dressed in elaborate ornamentation and made up in traditional face painting gather in lines to dance and sing, vying for the attention of marriageable young women. The Guérewol festival is an internationally attraction and was featured in films and magazines as prominent as the [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]].

==== Cure Salée festival ====
{{Main|Cure Salee}}

"La Cure salée" (English: Salt Cure) is a yearly festival of Tuareg and Wodaabe nomads in [[In-Gall|In'Gall]] in [[Agadez Region]] traditionally to celebrate the end of the rainy season. For three days, the festival features a parade of [[Tuareg]] camel riders followed with camel and horse races, songs, dances, and storytelling.

===Media===
{{Main|Media of Niger}}
Niger began developing diverse media in the late 1990s. Prior to the Third Republic, Nigeriens only had access to tightly controlled state media.&lt;ref name=sainforeport2002fr&gt;[http://africa.ifj.org/pdfs/sainforeport2002fr.pdf SEMINAIRE-ATELIER DE FORMATION ET DE SENSIBILISATION "Mission de service public dans les entreprises de presse d’Etat et privée"].

In addition to the national and regional radio services of the state broadcaster [[Office of Radio and Television of Niger|ORTN]], there are four privately owned radio networks which total more than 100 stations. Three of them—the [[Anfani FM|Anfani Group]], Sarounia and Tenere—are urban-based commercial-format [[FM broadcasting|FM]] networks in the major towns.&lt;ref name=ussd9506&gt;U.S. Department of State.

The independent-sector radio networks are collectively estimated by CPRP officials to cover some 7.6&amp;nbsp;million people, or about 73% of the population (2005).

Aside from Nigerien radio stations, the [[BBC]]'s Hausa service is listened to on FM repeaters across wide parts of the country, particularly in the south, close to the border with Nigeria. [[Radio France Internationale]] also rebroadcasts in French through some of the commercial stations, via satellite. Tenere FM also runs a national independent television station of the same name.&lt;ref name=ussd9506 /&gt;

Despite relative freedom at the national level, Nigerien [[Journalism|journalists]] say they are often pressured by local authorities.&lt;ref name=issa04&gt;[http://www.panos-ao.org/ipao/spip.php?article39 Niger : Conseil de presse.

The sector is governed by the [[High Council for Communication (Niger)|Conseil Supérieur de Communications]], established as an independent body in the early 1990s, since 2007 headed by Daouda Diallo. International human rights groups have criticised the government since at least 1996 as using regulation and police to punish criticism of the state.&lt;ref name=cpj2006&gt;[http://cpj.org/2007/02/attacks-on-the-press-2006-niger.php Attacks on the press: Niger 2006].

'''Njoku Ji''' is the guardian deity of the [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] for the [[Igbo people]] of southeastern [[Nigeria]]. In parts of Igboland there are still annual rituals in honor of the yam deity known as Ifejioku. In some parts children who were dedicated to the service of the deity were named Njoku. As adults, such children were expected to become prosperous yam farmers which made them into nobility.

==''Ihu-ji na-ama'' festival==
The priests of Njoku Ji performed ceremonies such as the ''Ihu-ji na-ama'', where the priest would lead the village council of elders in roasting yams in the village square. The ''Ihu-ji na-ama'' festival acted as the beginning of the yam planting season, and in fact, no yams were allowed to be planted before this ceremony had been performed, with the consequences of planting yams early being a curse of bad luck upon the offender and his household.&lt;ref name="Njoku"&gt;{{cite book |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zg-3AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=njoku+ji&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=njoku+ji |title=Pre-colonial economic history of Nigeria |author=Onwuka N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10140">The '''Pan American Association of Anatomy''' ('''PAA''') is a public, nonprofit, scientific organization that brings together professionals engaged in the study of [[Anatomy]] and related sciences in the American continent.

==Origins and objectives==
The Pan American Association of Anatomy (PAA) was created in July 1966 in [[Mexico City]] at the 1st Pan American Congress of Anatomy, which was held together with the 3rd National Congress of the Mexican Society of Anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socmexanat.com Official Web Mexican Society of Anatomy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217082929/http://www.socmexanat.com/ |date=2010-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mentor was the Prof. Dr. Liberato J. A. Didio.

The need for a Pan American Association of Anatomy was proposed by Prof. Di Dio during the 74th meeting of the American Association of Anatomy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anatomy.org Official Web American Association of Anatomy]&lt;/ref&gt; held in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], USA, in March 1961.

Its objectives include stimulating the development and improvement of [[teaching]] and [[research]] of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological sciences]] on the American continent, facilitating scientific exchange in all its aspects. Since then and through its meetings, it has spread and updated progress of morphological sciences on the American continent.

==Organizational structure==
The PAA is a member of the [[International Federation of Associations of Anatomists]] (IFAA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifaa.net Official Web IFAA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of the Pan American Association of Anatomy consists on the General Assembly (performed with partners in the Congress), the Board of Directors (composed by advisers or delegates from each country) and the Executive Committee (headed by the President, who is elected by the General Assembly).

There are two counselors or delegates for each American country concerned; one as owner and another alternate.

When the mandate of the President of the Executive Committee is finished, he is named Honorary President of the Association and he automatically joins the Honorary Presidents Committee of the PAA, which works with the Executive Committee.

The headquarters of the congresses vary from one congress to another, but they are always within the Americas and in a rotative form. The designation of the host country is resolved at the General Assembly by a vote of its partners and it is usually held every 3 years.

Since 2013, the Association Executive Committee has been chaired by Prof. Dr. Manuel Arteaga Martínez, from Mexico (2013–2017). The next Pan-American Congress of Anatomy will be held in [[Peru]], 2017; its President is Prof. Dr. Germán Molina Albornoz, from Peru.

The statutes of the Association and the Pan American Congress of Anatomy, adopted by majority vote by the General Assembly of the Association, can be found on the.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apanatomia.weebly.com PAA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pan American Congress==
In 50 years of Association life, 18 congresses have been held, with an interval of 3 years (sometimes 2 years) between them. The following countries have hosted at least one congress: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela.

The Congress covers various topics of morphological sciences and related sciences that have application to the [[biology]] and health sciences, especially in medicine and dentistry. It involves research, teaching and medical care. In particular, issues related to [[development anatomy]] ([[embryology]]), [[microscopic anatomy]] ([[histology]] and [[cell biology|Citology]]), [[human anatomy]], [[veterinary anatomy]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[neuroanatomy]], [[neurobiology]], radiological anatomy, clinical anatomy, [[anthropology]], [[biophysics]] and [[biochemistry]], etc. are discussed.

==Symposia Iberian-Latin-American==
In 2009, during the 43rd anniversary of the Pan American Association of Anatomy, the 1st Iberian-Latin-American Terminology Symposium (SILAT) was held, with the purpose of disseminating the [[International Morphological Terminology]]. [[Educational institutions]] of medical and other health areas which spoke Spanish and Portuguese used it on a daily basis. Its mentor was Prof. Dr. Rolando Cruz Gutiérrez.

Up today, there have been sixteen symposia: four in [[Costa Rica]], two in [[Brasil]], three in [[Mexico]], four in [[Chile]], two in [[Peru]] and one in [[Nicaragua]]. In these symposia, participants are divided into groups to work with the anatomical, histological and embryological terminology from the [[Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology|Terminology Committee]] ([[FICAT]]) of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA). Meetings are held every day. The symposia also develops the presentation of free papers concerning different aspects and considerations of terminology.

These groups of experts review, analyse and discuss the morphological terms; possible errors and defects in the studied structures are also discussed. It was determined that the future meetings are planned in other countries (such as Honduras, Ecuador, Argentina, etc.).

==Official publications==
The PAA has the support of various magazines, which are the official organ of publication, showing summaries of scientific congresses communications and other aspects. They are: International Journal of Morphology (Revista Internacional de Morfología),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/revistas/ijmorphol/iaboutj.htm|title=ABOUT THE JOURNAL|work= SCIELO website|date=|accessdate= February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian Journal of Morphology Sciences, Venezuelan Magazine of Morphological Sciences and Medical Journal of Costa Rica and Central America.

The '''Sedetani''' were an ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]] (Pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]) people of the [[Iberian peninsula]] (the Roman [[Hispania]]). They are believed to have spoken a form of the [[Iberian language]].

The Sedetani minted their own coins. Their territory extended from central to southern present-day [[Aragon]], bordering with the land of the [[Ilercavones]] in the east and the [[Edetani]] in the south. Some of their main towns were ''Salduie'', ''Salduba'' in [[ancient Roman]] sources, located in present-day [[Zaragoza]], and the [[Cabezo de Alcalá]] near [[Azaila]].

A wave of [[Serbs]] came with the influx of other [[Southern Europe]]ans ([[Italians]], [[Spaniards]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], and [[Greeks]]) in the 1920s. A minority are (descendants of) people of Serbian origin who were established in France in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] (e.g. [[Michel Auclair]]). Most Serbs however moved to [[France]] during the 1960s and 1970s, some also came as refugees during the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the 1990s.

The '''Sultanate of Dawaro''' was a [[Somalis|Somali]] [[Muslim]] [[Sultanate]] founded around the 10th century by the Jarso people sub-clan of the [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] clan centred in Hararghe.&lt;ref name="Dawaro Sultanate"&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HGnyk8Pg9NgC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=southern+ethiopian+muslim+sultanates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtwKOP9vPZAhXCAsAKHfCdCu4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=southern%20ethiopian%20muslim%20sultanates&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
By Somali reckoning, the founder of Dawaro Sultanate was Jārso people belonging to the Ali Madaḥweyne branch which is a sub-clan of [[Dir (clan)|Dir]]. After the [[Oromo migrations]], the ʿAli Madaḥweyne Dir were absorbed into the Afran Qallo Barentuma confederation, and today the Jarso are reckoned as Jārsō Daggā Qāllō Barentuma Oromō.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fg1zCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Oromo+assimilated+dir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicnLTF9fPZAhWFXMAKHUz6ArcQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vassal state==
Emperor [[Amda Seyon I]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] conquered many of the adjacent independent Muslim sultanates during his reign. In 1329, Sulṭān Ḥaydar of Dawaro was captured and imprisoned together with his ally Sulṭān [[Sabr ad-Din I|Sabir ad-Dīn Maḥamed]]. Despite several rebellions and a brief period when [[Badlay ibn Sa'ad ad-Din|Ahmeduddin Badlay]] a powerful [[Somalis|Somali]] ruler from [[Adal Sultanate]] captured Dawaro and turned it into a vessel of Adal and after the weakening of [[Adal Sultanate]], the opportunist [[Oromos]] captured the vessel state and assimilated the local native Somali population. Just like many [[Somalis]] in Hararghe, the Jarso people were also assimilated into the Oromo confederation after the weakening of Adal Sultanate by its war with the [[Ethiopian Empire]] and [[Portuguese Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Futūḥ al-Ḥabasha. (n.d.). Christian-Muslim Relations 1500 - 1900. doi:10.1163/2451-9537_cmrii_com_26077&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Dawaro was a major power prior to its defeat and subjugation. It was roughly equal in size, population and power to the early [[Ifat Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia: Collected Essays&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Žmuidzinavičius Museum''', known as the '''Devils' Museum''' ({{lang-lt|Velnių muziejus}}), is a museum in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]], dedicated to collecting and exhibiting sculptures and carvings of [[devil]]s from all over the world. The collection was started by artist [[Antanas Žmuidzinavičius]] (1876–1966), and a memorial museum was established in his house after his death. In 1966, the devil collection consisted of 260 sculptures but visitors began to leave their own devils as gifts to the museum.&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt; In 1982, a three-story extension was built to house the expanding collection and, as of 2009, the museum's holdings had grown to 3,000 items.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

Most of the devils are sculptures in wood, ceramic, stone, or paper. Others are masks or paintings on silk or canvas. The devils, collected from all over the world, are diverse in style. Many of the devils are art objects, for display only, but other devils have been incorporated into usable objects such as pipes and nutcrackers.&lt;ref name=fortean /&gt; Many of the items represent folk myths and others express modern political ideas. For example, one sculpture depicts [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] as devils in a [[Danse Macabre|dance of death]] over a pile of human bones.&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt;&lt;ref name=lonelyplanet /&gt;

==Exhibits==
The first floor of the museum contains Žmuidzinavičius's collection which he acquired despite [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] law against religious artefacts. One of the devils is so small that it is viewed through a magnifying glass.&lt;ref name=fortean /&gt;

On the second floor, is a huge wooden devil – given to the museum by someone who believed that the devil was causing bad luck. There are many wooden carvings of Scandinavian origin, plus donated items such as pebbles containing the devil's image.&lt;ref name=travel /&gt;

The third floor contains many devils from former Soviet territories&lt;ref name=travel /&gt; but others come from countries around the world including Japan, Cuba, and Mexico.&lt;ref name=fortean /&gt;
