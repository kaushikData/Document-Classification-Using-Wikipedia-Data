'''Allegorical sculpture''' refers to sculptures that symbolize and particularly personify abstract ideas as in [[allegory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_A.html|title=Literary Terms and Definitions A|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common in the [[western world]], for example, are statues of [[Lady Justice]] representing [[justice]], traditionally holding scales and a [[Sword of Justice|sword]], and the statues of [[Prudence]], representing Truth by holding a mirror and squeezing a serpent.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thake |first1=Conrad |title=The Architectural legacy of Grand Master Pinto (2) |url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-05-16/local-news/The-Architectural-legacy-of-Grand-Master-Pinto-(2)-207685 |work=[[The Malta Independent]] |date=16 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192321/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-05-16/local-news/The-Architectural-legacy-of-Grand-Master-Pinto-%282%29-207685 |archivedate=1 August 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This approach of using human form and its posture, gesture and clothing to wordlessly convey [[Value system|social value]]s and [[Theme (arts)|theme]]s.
It may be seen in [[church monument|funerary art]] as early as 1580. They were used on [[renaissance]] monuments when [[patron saint]]s became unacceptable. Particularly popular were the [[four cardinal virtues]] and the [[Theological virtues|three Christian virtues]], but others such as [[Pheme|fame]], [[Victoria (mythology)|victory]], [[hope]] and [[Father time|time]] are also represented. The use of allegorical sculpture was fully developed under the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. It is sometimes associated with [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, and is commonly found in works dating from around 1900.

==Life and work==

After a childhood and early youth spent in Budapest and London, Szántó attended the Budapest University of Economics (now [[Corvinus University]]), and, in 1988, moved to New York for graduate studies in sociology. At [[Columbia University]], as a [http://pfl-css.columbia.edu/programs/lazarsfeld-fellowship-program.html Lazarsfeld Fellow], his research interests turned to the social and commercial ramifications of the visual arts. He completed his Ph.D. dissertation in 1996 on New York art galleries and the transformation of the art world in the 1980s, working closely with [[Arthur Danto]], the Columbia philosopher and art critic.

While in graduate school, Szántó worked as a research analyst at the Media Studies Center at Columbia.

'''''Arabian Knights''''' is an [[animation|animated]] segment of ''[[The Banana Splits|The Banana Splits Adventure Hour]]'', created by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]]. The series is based on the ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', a classic work of Middle Eastern literature.

==Plot: Secret origins==
Once a peaceful country, Persia was overrun by the powerful forces of the evil conqueror Bakaar the Black Sultan. When all the states of Persia were overthrown, Bakaar invaded the capital city of [[Baghdad]]. Bakaar and his forces breached the royal palace and forcibly claimed the throne from Prince Turhan and ordered the prince to be killed. Prince Turhan fled the palace, pursued by the guards of Bakaar. In his escape, the prince is helped by a magician named Fariik, who, with his magic, slipped away from the guards. On their way to the state of El-Rabaul to seek aid from his uncle the Caliph, Turhan and Fariik meet Raseem while being chased by the guards in the Caves of Doom. Raseem tells them that Bakaar's forces have already usurped the throne of El-Rabaul and imprisoned the Caliph and his daughter, Princess Nida. The trio then heads to El-Rabaul on Zazuum, Raheem's donkey.

In El-Rabaul they rescue Princess Nida, who is about to be sold into slavery. There, Princess Nida demonstrates her mastery of disguise and voice mimicry by tricking the guards, but they soon find themselves cornered by Bakaar's men. There Bez jumps into the scene, shapeshifts into an elephant, charges through the guards, and carries everyone to safety. In the Caves of Doom, they decide to form a heroic band and swear to protect their land from the tyranny of Bakaar, thus forming an alliance called the Arabian Knights.

==Series direction==
''Arabian Knights'' was one of several animated miniseries used as filler segments for Hanna-Barbera's ''Banana Splits Adventure Hour'' show. Each episode ran between 9 and 10 minutes in length. For the most part, it competed with the other series, namely the animated ''[[The Three Musketeers (cartoon)|The Three Musketeers]]'', the part live action, part animated ''[[Micro Ventures]]'', and the live action ''[[Danger Island (TV series)|Danger Island]]'' segments.

Often, the general thrust of the ''Arabian Knights'' adventures deals with the Knights trying to effect some action against Bakaar’s soldiers, finding a means to further complete their goal of turning the tables on the evil dictator, or dealing with another villain set within the Knights' universe.

For the most part, these adventures were done with a semi-serious slant, with a goodly portion of action and comedy mixed in. Hardly anyone was injured or harmed—save for Bakaar's minions (with a usually comic effect), and the episodes usually had an upbeat, happy ending for the Knights.

==Characters==
===The Arabian Knights===
* '''Prince Turhan''' (voiced by [[Jay North]]) - The prince of Baghdad and rightful heir to the throne of the Sultan, Turhan is a young and handsome teenage boy. Apart from being brave and bold, he is an agile acrobat, an athlete, and a master swordsman. Turhan gathers a small group of friends to lead a revolt against the tyranny of Bakaar and reclaim his throne to restore the peace and prosperity in his state. Turhan is the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the Knights and the driving force behind fighting Bakaar and ending the usurper’s reign. He owns a magic [[scimitar]] that can be thrown and returns like a [[boomerang]], in unique ways.

* '''Princess Nida''' (voiced by [[Shari Lewis]]) -  Daughter of the Caliph of El-Rabaul, Princess Nida is a lovely teenage girl who is the cousin of Prince Turhan. She is a master of disguise and an expert of voice mimicry. Nida is also skilled in martial arts and can hold her own in the Knights' battles.

* '''Fariik the Magician''' (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) - A short, tubby, jolly little man, Fariik is a skilled practitioner and spell-master of the mystical arts who lends a magical hand when needed. To cast his spell, Fariik would quote "Rosan Kobar." He is the first to have offered aid to Turhan after Prince Turhan is deposed by Bakaar. Sometimes, the magic gets very difficult and can take a lot of energy out of him. Fariik can animate [[carpet]]s and pillows for the occasional airborne transport of the team. Fariik can render himself and others invisible for stealth or [[camouflage]] purposes. At times, he can dissolve himself and others into smoke to make an escape from narrow places. He can levitate objects, alter the size of things and persons, create things out of thin air, and alter the form of one thing into another.

* '''Raseem the Strong''' (voiced by [[Frank Gerstle]]) - A tall muscular man with brief costume and fez, Raseem is the powerhouse of the team with incredible physical strength, endurance, and stamina. He first met Turhan and Fariik when they hid in the Caves of Doom that he occupies. Raseem mistakes them for Bakaar's men and attacks them. However, upon learning they are against Bakaar, he befriends them, and he goes with them to find the Caliph (to get his aid against Bakaar). He often boasts of his strength, saying he is as strong as 30 men. At one time, Raseem said he was as strong as seven elephants. Strong enough to shatter stone walls, lift and catch boulders, catch and throw back cannonballs, and fight off scores of Bakaar’s soldiers at a time, Raseem's power makes for a good equalizer in the Knights' battles.

* '''Zazuum''' (voiced by [[Don Messick]]) - Raheem's faithful little [[donkey]] with long ears, Zazuum was first used by Turhan, Fariik, and Raheem to get to El-Rabaul. Zazuum is quite an intelligent donkey as he aids his fellow team members. Zazuum can spin himself so fast he becomes like a destructive miniature tornado that can defeat any enemy or destroy anything coming his way. He does not like his tail to be pulled, as it enrages him to the point of being a berserk loose cannon that can shatter rocks into pebbles. In addition, Zazuum can smell gold very precisely.

* '''Bez The Beast''' (voiced by [[Henry Corden]]) - A dark-skinned man with a turban and green clothing, Bez can shapeshift into an animal or bird, from a mighty [[elephant]] to a tiny [[mouse]]. Often, he triggers this ability by speaking the phrase “Size of a —!” and naming the animal or bird he wishes to turn into, followed by a loud boom that proclaims his transformation. Sometimes the magical phrase is followed by clapping his hands together. If the creature is small enough, Bez can turn into multiple versions of it, such as turning into a million [[bee]]s. Bez is known to turn into some larger animals which often serve as alternate modes of transportation for the knights, like an elephant or a camel for land transportation. He can also transform into mythical creatures like a [[Pegasus|winged stallion]] or [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] for the occasional airborne transportation. His shapeshifting makes him a handy spy for the Knights in order to find out what Bakaar is planning.

===Villains===
* '''Bakaar the Black Sultan''' (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) - The corrupt conqueror and nemesis of the Arabian Knights, Bakaar usurps the throne of Turhan’s father and takes control of Baghdad. Clearly wishing to command all of the kingdoms that bow to Baghdad, he sets all of his forces to the goal of capturing Turhan (and later all of the Knights) to secure his place on the throne. While cruel, Bakaar does not usually involve himself directly in the fight against the Knights. He prefers to let his soldiers and minions to do the job. Bakaar's distinctive manner of dress—a single-spiked, fur-lined helmet in place of a crown—hints at ancestry from the [[Mongols]].
** '''Vangore''' (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]) - Bakaar's enforcer and captain of his guards. Often hatches plots to capture the Knights. Apparently, Vangore's father was a camel driver. He has red hair shaved to a topknot (which would historically be an indication of [[Galatians (people)|Galatian]] ancestry and of being enslaved).
** '''Sundar''' - Bakaar's court magician.

The '''Basel Paper Mill''' ([[German Language|German:]] ''Basler Papiermühle''), also known as the '''Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing''' ([[German Language|German:]] ''Schweizerisches Museum für Papier, Schrift und Druck'') in [[Basel]], is primarily dedicated to [[papermaking]], the art of book [[printing]] and [[writing]] in general. Through a combination of pictures and objects, visitors gain insights into the old artisanal techniques of dipping paper, printing and [[bookbinding]].

The museum is located in a carefully restored building that began its life as a [[paper mill]] 500 years ago. It is a [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage site of national significance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance]] (1995), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bespoke tailoring''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bespoke.ogg|b|i|ˈ|s|p|oʊ|k}} is clothing made to an individual buyer's specifications by a [[tailor]]. 

==Clothing==

===Meaning of the term===
The word ''[[bespoke]]'' is derived from the verb "bespeak", to speak for something, in the specialised meaning "to give order for it to be made".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Nathan (1756). ''An Universal Etymological English Dictionary''. R. Ware.&lt;/ref&gt; The term bespoke in fashion is reserved for individually patterned and crafted men's clothing, analogous to women's [[haute couture]],&lt;ref&gt;''Art of Textile Designing''. Global Media. {{ISBN|81-89940-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with mass-manufactured [[ready-to-wear]] (also called off-the-peg or off-the-rack). The term originated from [[Savile Row]], a street in London considered the "Golden Mile of tailoring".&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Kate|title=Savile Row Never Goes Out of Style|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-10-31/savile-row-never-goes-out-of-stylebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=31 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bespoke clothing is traditionally cut from a pattern drafted from scratch for the customer, and so differs from [[ready-to-wear]], which is factory made in finished condition and standardised sizes, and from [[made to measure]], which is produced to order from an adjusted block pattern. The opposition of terms did not initially imply that a bespoke garment was necessarily well built, but since the development of ready-to-wear in the beginning of the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Ugolini, Laura (2003). ''Men and Menswear: Sartorial Consumption in Britain 1880–1939'', p. 181. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7546-0384-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; bespoke clothing is now more expensive and is generally accompanied by a high quality of construction.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In article published in ''[[Textile History]]'' (Volume 34, Number 2, November 2003 , pp. 192–213. ''Ready-to-wear or Made-to-measure? Consumer Choice in the British Menswear Trade'') Laura Ugolini concluded that "interested and well-informed male consumers generally preferred to buy bespoke suits: while usually more expensive than their ready-made counterparts, these were also perceived to be better quality, better looking, and better value, and therefore most likely to enhance the wearer's sense of self-worth as a manly, discerning and successful consumer".&lt;/ref&gt;

While the distinction conferred by haute couture is protected by law in France,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;A certain number of formal criteria, including the design for private customers with one or more fittings, must be met for a fashion house to use the label and a list of eligible houses is made official every year by the French Ministry of Industry.&lt;/ref&gt; the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has ruled it is a fair practice to use the term "bespoke" for products that do not fully incorporate traditional construction methods.&lt;ref name="Cockroft"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2149810/Savile-Row-tailors-lose-fight-to-preserve-the-term-bespoke.html |first=Lucy| last=Cockroft| title=Savile Row tailors lose fight to preserve the term bespoke|work = The Telegraph |date=2008-06-19 |accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Savile Row Bespoke Association]], a trade group of traditional tailors, disagrees.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The tailor Richard Anderson wrote an article in the Telegraph to explain that "the ASA has got the ruling wrong" ({{cite web
|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2151888/Savile-Row-tailor-Richard-Anderson-bespoke-must-mean-bespoke.html|title=Savile Row tailor Richard Anderson: bespoke must mean bespoke |accessdate=2008-10-10|first=Richard|last=Anderson|date=2008-06-18|work=The Telegraph}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0ea5cbf6-4eed-11dd-ba7c-000077b07658.html|title=The b-word: not cut and dried|accessdate=2008-10-10 |first=Josh|last=Sim|date=2008-07-12|work=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared to made-to-measure===
Between the extremes of bespoke and ready-to-wear, there has existed since the end of the 19th century&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In 1895, the [[Leeds]] Factory Clothing Co. veered between calling itself "manufacturing clothiers" and "bespoke tailors" (''cf.'' {{cite book
|author     = Benson, John
|year       = 2003
|title      = A Nation of Shopkeepers: Five Centuries of British Retailing
|publisher  = Houghton Mifflin Cookbooks
|isbn       = 1-86064-708-1
|page       = 102
}}).&lt;/ref&gt; a "grey area of garments for which the customer was measured, but that were then made up to the closest standard size, often, but by no means always, in a factory."&lt;ref&gt;Benson, John (2003). ''A Nation of Shopkeepers: Five Centuries of British Retailing'', p.102. I.B.Tauris. {{ISBN|1-86064-708-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction made here is between bespoke, created without use of a pre-existing pattern, and [[made to measure]], which alters a standard-sized pattern to fit the customer.&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt; Technological change makes this distinction more subtle, since fittings are increasingly required for   made-to-measure. A bespoke service may require an individually-cut pattern, which is then kept should further suits be required;    made-to-measure measurements are often stored on a computer. Even hand-work, often cited as a benchmark of bespoke, is now increasingly found in made-to-measure garments, while machine-making plays some part in the creation of most bespoke suits. With a bespoke suit, a pattern is designed and made from scratch based on the client's measurements, often from 20+ measurements involving multiple fittings, and takes considerably longer to produce than a made-to-measure garment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sharpsense.ca/blogs/style-guide/made-to-measure-vs-bespoke-vs-off-the-rack |title=Made to Measure vs Bespoke vs Off the Rack |publisher=sharpsense.ca |accessdate=2017-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ensures a precise fit, particularly in the shoulders as well as the posture areas. This [[custom-fit|custom fit]] is handy for clients with short or long necks, high or low shoulders, excess girth, high hips, large or flat seats, and more. Made-to-measure cannot adjust for these shapes and slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joeydimz.com/bespoke |title=Bespoke |publisher=joeydimz.com |accessdate=2017-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, new technologies have allowed for bespoke garments to be made with [[lean manufacturing]] practices and digital patterning, making new patterns within minutes and fully bespoke garments in hours, at a price point similar to made to measure or even [[mass production]].

===Advertising Standards Authority ruling===
In June 2008, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA), a British advertising regulator, ruled that an advertisement describing a suit "put into a 'working-frame' where it would be cut and sewn by machine"&lt;ref name="Asa"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_44555.htm

 |archivedate=2008-11-22 
 |df= 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as a "bespoke suit uniquely made according to your personal measurements &amp; specification"&lt;ref name="Asa"/&gt; was not breaching the Authority's self-proclaimed advertising codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/about/

 |archivedate=2008-10-15

}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably the truthfulness rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/codes/cap_code/ShowCode.htm?clause_id=1502 
 |title=The CAP Code: truthfulness rule 
 |author=Advertising Standards Authority

 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915153343/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/codes/cap_code/ShowCode.htm?clause_id=1502 
 |archivedate=2008-09-15 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the use of the term bespoke was not deemed likely to confuse. The ruling was significant in formalising a less traditional definition of bespoke clothing, even though the older distinction with made-to-measure was recognised.

The ruling cited the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' definition of bespoke as "made to order", and considered that despite the fact a bespoke suit was "fully hand-made and the pattern cut from scratch, with an intermediary baste stage which involved a first fitting so that adjustments could be made to a half-made suit",&lt;ref name="Asa"/&gt; while a suit made-to-measure "would be cut, usually by machine, from an existing pattern, and adjusted according to the customer's measurements",&lt;ref name="Asa"/&gt; "both fully bespoke and made-to-measure suits were "made to order" in that they were made to the customer's precise measurements and specifications, unlike off-the-peg suits".&lt;ref name="Asa"/&gt;

Some, such as the etymologist [[Michael Quinion]], considered the ruling showed that "the historic term of art had moved on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bes4.htm |title= Bespoke|accessdate=2008-10-09 |first=Michael |last=Quinion |date= 2008-09-13| work=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some others concluded that "bespoke tailoring has traditionally, if unofficially, meant something more than the dictionary definition allows"&lt;ref name="Sim"/&gt; and that the ASA "took a rather ignorant decision to declare that there is no difference between bespoke and made-to-measure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Critical reception==
The Film opened to mostly positive reviews from the Critics.

* Times of India gave 4/5 stars and said "Shivarajkumar has combined all his experiences to give a brilliant performance. Be it action, sentiment or romance, Shivanna is at his best. Aindrita Ray too is at her best throughout, especially in the climax. Music by Arjun Janya is apt for the story and quite remarkable. Lokesh shines as a villain. Jai Anand is simply superb in his camerawork." &lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/movie-reviews/Bhajarangi/movie-review/27451889.cms Bhajarangi movie review: Wallpaper, Story, Trailer at Times of India].

* Chitraloka said "Shivarajkumar takes the cake for his easy in portraying both a lover boy and an action hero equally well. When he sheds his shirt to show off his six packs in the end, the joy of the fans sees no end. Harsha has done an excellent job all over. Arjun Janya's music has four good songs including the 'Boss' song with guest appearance by six other film stars. Aindrita is bubbly as ever in a cute role. The actors who have played villains like Madhu, Chetan and Guru are a welcome change from the usual villains. If you have not booked your tickets already for Bhajarangi, do it fast. You will not get tickets easily for what is sure to be a blockbuster." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chitraloka.com/movie-reviews/4263-bhajarangi-review.html Bhajarangi Movie Review - chitraloka.com | Latest Kannada Movie News, Reviews | Images]. chitraloka.com.

'''Book trade in the United Kingdom''' has its roots as far back as the 14th century, however the emergence of [[E-commerce|internet]] [[booksellers]] such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] partnered with the introduction of the [[e-Book]] has drastically altered the scope of the industry. Book retailers such as the [[Borders Group]] have failed to adjust to these changes, thus there has been a steep decline in the number of operating traditional and independent bookshops. However, still heavily influential on the trade globally, British publishers such as [[Penguin Books]] and  [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] remain dominant players within the industry and continue to publish titles gloablly.

[[File:Charles Dickens - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|Charles Dickens: [http://www.gutenberg.org Project Gutenberg]]]

==History==

By the 14th century a commercial book trade had been established in the UK, and before printing was introduced to Europe by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439 the trade consisted of scribes who wrote manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005)P.9&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 15th century the majority of those engaged in these activities were situated in London and belonged to a trade guild called the Company of [[Stationers]].&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005)p.23&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 16th century publishers and printers controlled the book trade and introduced a commercial aspect, relying for much of their income on the sales of popular religious books, almanacs, prognostications and similar literature.&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005) p.26&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 20th century, as literacy became increasingly universal within society and disposable income increased, publishers were faced with new opportunities. In 1900 the [[Net Book Agreement]] was introduced to ‘help to maintain a chain of stock holding bookshops while giving the publishers sufficient confidence to publish new titles’&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005) P150&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction and demise of the [[Net Book Agreement]] heavily impacted the [[publishing industry]]. First established in 1900, the Act involved an agreement between booksellers and publishers to fix the price of books in order to "help maintain a chain of stock holding bookshops while giving the publishers sufficient confidence to publish new titles"&lt;ref&gt;Feather, John, ''A History of British Publishing'', 2nd ed (GB:Routledge Ltd, 2005)p.150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
The structure of the industry within the UK has altered significantly over the last few decades, which now establishes itself as part of wider industry globally dominated by international giants such a [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] (UK), [[Muse Corporation]] (United States), and [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] (France). The gap between small independent booksellers and giant chain sellers has vastly increased, leading to the dissolution of many medium-sized companies; "Overall the number of significant companies has dropped by ten percent in the last decade".&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Paul; Taylor, Graham, ''A Guide to the UK Publishing Industry'', (London: The Publishers Association, 2008) p15&lt;/ref&gt; 
Technology has extensively affected developments within the publishing industry. Due to having one of the highest levels of internet connectivity in Europe, the industry in the UK experiences the prevalent threat and the vast opportunity of revolutionary technological advances such as the [[e-book]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]; almost all book publishers in the UK now utilize the standard book number.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Paul; Taylor, Graham, ''A Guide to the UK Publishing Industry'', (London: The Publishers Association, 2008)p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookshops have begun to decline over the years, with just over 73 closures in 2013 alone, the UK lost 7% of its remaining Independent book stores.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Alison, ''Decline in Independent Bookshops continues with 73 closures in 2012'', The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/22/independent-bookshops-73-closures-2012) [accessed 03/12/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of independent book shops has now fallen below 1,000 (2014) whilst even bigger booksellers such as [[Borders]] went into liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Mike,''Borders forced to liquidate, Close all stores'', The Wall Street Journal (http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303661904576454353768550280) [accessed 03/12/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the publishing contributed to the UK creative economy with 231,000 jobs that had an almost equal split between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/industries/publishing/publishing-facts-and-figures], The Creative Industries website, accessed 10 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014, brick and mortar shops have been performing better, seeing a light at the end of the Recession period and the boom of the Kindle. Looking at the data provided, Richard Mollet, chief executive of The Publishers Association, explains that "those who ever tried to maintain that this was a binary choice have been shown to have been posing the question in the wrong way. It is not a question of either physical or digital winning out, but rather of the sector coalescing around a balanced marketplace where all formats have place. While publishing has been efficient and effective in its adaptation, the underlying driver of the evolution is of course the reader. What the 21st-century consumer desires above all is choice. As long as publishers can give readers the option of paper or screen, the market will - and is - taking care of itself. The ebook is no more a challenge to the lifespan of paper than television is to the theatre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = PA statistics yearbook 2014|last = Clee|first = Nicholas|publisher = Publishers Association|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0853863694|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK publishers of online, publicly accessible [[open access]] books include [[Open Book Publishers]], [[Ubiquity Press]], and [[UCL Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://re.ukri.org/blog/helen-snaith/open-access-and-monographs/ |title=Open access and monographs |date=27 July 2018 |work= Re.ukri.org |publisher=[[Research England]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''capitalist realism'''" has been used, particularly in [[Germany]], to describe commodity-based art, from [[Pop Art]] in the 1950s and 1960s to the commodity art of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been used to describe the ideological-aesthetic aspect of contemporary [[corporate capitalism]] in the West. When used in this way, it is a play on the term "[[socialist realism]]".

==In art==
Although attested earlier,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. by [[Abraham Polonsky]] of [[Edward Dmytryk|Edward Dmytryk's]] ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'': William Pechter and Abraham Polonsky, 'Abraham Polonsky and "Force of Evil"', ''Film Quarterly'', 15.3 [Special Issue on Hollywood] (Spring, 1962), 47-54 (p. 53); https://www.jstor.org/stable/1210628.&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase "capitalist realism" was first used in the title of the 1963 [[art exhibition]] in [[Düsseldorf, Germany|Düsseldorf]], ''Demonstration for Capitalist Realism'', which featured the work of [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Wolf Vostell]], and [[:de:Konrad Fischer (Maler)|Konrad Lueg]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, Hugh. ''A World History of Art'', Laurence King Publishing, p847. {{ISBN|1-85669-451-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition's participants focused upon depictions of Germany's growing consumer culture and media-saturated society with strategies, in part, influenced by those of their American Pop&lt;ref name="Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://observer.com/2014/07/living-with-pop-a-reproduction-of-capitalist-realism-at-artists-space/ | title=Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space | publisher=The New York Observer | date=23 July 2014 | accessdate=20 November 2014 | author=Pollack,  Maika | quote=It was a reaction to Pop from a postwar Germany divided between East and West.}}&lt;/ref&gt; counterparts. The recent rise in [[Pop art|Pop Art]] in German culture was coupled by a fascination with America, which served as a stimulation for the piece. They were inspired primarily by the iconography depicted in newspapers and magazines.

==Sigmar Polke==
{{main|Sigmar Polke}}

Capitalist realism is a German art movement co-founded in 1963 by artist [[Sigmar Polke]].&lt;ref name="German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/12/AR2010061203694.html | title=German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69 | publisher=The Washington Post | date=13 June 2010 | accessdate=17 November 2014 | author=Schudel, Matt | quote=In the 1960s, Mr. Polke was at the vanguard of a German artistic movement called capitalist realism, along with fellow painter Gerhard Richter -- who later expressed reservations about his colleague's work, saying "he refuses to accept any borders, any limits."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polke embraced the advertising and publicity commonly found in the popular press in renderings of everyday consumer items. Often ironic and with critical overtones of society and politics the Capitalist Realism movement is considered more explicitly political than conventional Pop Art.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, Thomas. ''The Rise of the Sixties: American and European Art in the age of Dissent'' {{ISBN|1856694267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Schudson==
{{main|Michael Schudson}}

In the mid-1980s, [[Michael Schudson]] used the term "capitalist realism" to describe mainstream practices in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter seven of Schudson's ''Advertising: The Uneasy Persuasion'' compares the messages and appeals of advertising to those found in the Socialist Realism of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, 'Advertising as Capitalist Realism', in ''Advertising, The Uneasy Persuasion: Its Dubious Impact on American Society'' (New York: Basic Books, 1984), pp. 209-33 (repr. in ''
Advertising &amp; Society Review'', vol. 1, issue 1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In his account, the realism of advertising promotes a way of life based on private consumption, rather than social, public achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Harry; MacRury, Isin; Botterill, Jackie. ''The Dynamics of Advertising'', Routledge, 2000, p99. {{ISBN|90-5823-085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mark Fisher==
{{main|Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?}}

The term next appeared in 2009 with the publication of Mark Fisher's book ''[[Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009); {{ISBN|978-1-84694-317-1}} (pbk.); 1846943175 (pbk.).&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher argues that the term "capitalist realism" best describes the current global political situation, which lacks visible alternatives to the capitalist system which became dominant following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His argument is a response to, and critique of, [[neo-liberalism]] and new forms of government which apply the logic of [[capitalism]] and the market to all aspects of governance.

His ideology refers to a perceived "widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Winchester, UK|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a philosophical concept, capitalist realism is influenced by the [[Althusserian]] conception of ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1846943171|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher proposes that within a capitalist framework there is no space to conceive of alternative forms of social structures, adding that younger generations are not even concerned with recognizing alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism. Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=O Books|year=2009|isbn=9781846943171|location=|pages=8|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He proposes that the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; compounded this position. Rather than catalyzing a desire to seek alternatives for the existing model, the crisis reinforced the notion that modifications must be made within the existing system. The crash confirmed within the populace the necessity of capitalism rather than shake it loose from its foundations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Capitalist realism as I understand it cannot be confined to art or to the quasi-propagandistic way in which advertising functions. It is more like a pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is there no Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fisher argues that capitalist realism has propagated a 'business [[ontology]]' which concludes that everything should be run as a business including education and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009, pg15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of Fisher's work, the term has been picked up by other literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;Prominently Mark Fisher and Jeremy Gilbert, 'Capitalist Realism and Neoliberal Hegemony: A Dialogue', ''New Formations'', 80--81 (2013), 89--101 DOI:10.3898/NEWF.80/81.05.2013; ''Reading Capitalist Realism'', ed. by Alison Shonkwiler and Leigh Claire La Berge (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Capitole de Québec''' is a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts-style]] theatre in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. It is located in [[Old Quebec]] on [[:fr:Place D'Youville (Québec)|Place d'Youville]]. It was listed on the [[Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec]] in 1984, and became a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="CRHP" /&gt;

==History==
Constructed in 1903 based on plans by [[United States|American]] architect [[Walter S. Painter]], it was renovated in 1927 by [[Thomas W. Lamb]]. It was closed and abandoned in the late 1980s, and underwent a complete restoration in 1992.

Le Capitole was classified as a [[Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec|historic monument]] on May 3, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.patrimoine-culturel.gouv.qc.ca/RPCQ/detailBien.do?methode=consulter&amp;bienId=92467 |title=Théâtre Capitole  |publisher=Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec |language=French |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designated as a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] on November 14, 1986.&lt;ref name="CRHP" /&gt;

The '''Capitoline Museums''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Musei Capitolini'') is a single museum containing a group of art and [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[museum]]s in [[Capitoline Hill#Michelangelo|Piazza del Campidoglio]], on top of the [[Capitoline Hill]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. The historic seats of the museums are [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] and [[Palazzo Nuovo]], facing on the central [[trapezoid]]al [[piazza]] in a plan conceived by [[Michelangelo]] in 1536 and executed over a period of more than 400 years. The history of the museums can be traced to 1471, when [[Pope Sixtus IV]] donated a collection of important ancient [[bronze sculpture|bronzes]] to the people of Rome and located them on the Capitoline Hill. Since then, the museums' collection has grown to include a large number of [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] statues, inscriptions, and other artifacts; a collection of [[medieval art|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] art; and collections of [[Gemstone|jewel]]s, [[coin]]s, and other items. The museums are owned and operated by the municipality of [[Rome]].

The [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|statue of a mounted rider]] in the centre of the piazza is of [[Marcus Aurelius|Emperor Marcus Aurelius]]. It is a copy, the original being housed on-site in the Capitoline museum. 

Opened to the public in 1734 under [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII]], the Capitoline Museums are considered the first museum in the world, understood as a place where art could be enjoyed by all and not only by the owners.&lt;ref&gt;AA.

''This section contains collections sorted by building, and brief information on the buildings themselves.  For the history of their design and construction, see [[Capitoline Hill#Michelangelo]].''

The Capitoline Museums are composed of three main buildings surrounding the Piazza del Campidoglio and interlinked by an underground gallery beneath the piazza.

The three main buildings of the Capitoline Museums are:

*[[Palazzo Senatorio]], built in the 12th century and modified according to Michelangelo's designs;
*[[Palazzo dei Conservatori]], built in the mid-16th century and redesigned by Michelangelo with the first use of the [[giant order]] [[column]] design; and
*[[Palazzo Nuovo]], built in the 17th century with an identical exterior design to the Palazzo dei Conservatori, which it faces across the palazzo.

In addition, the 16th century [[Palazzo Caffarelli-Clementino]], located off the piazza adjacent to the Palazzo dei Conservatori, was added to the museum complex in the early 20th century.

===Palazzo dei Conservatori===
The collections here are ancient sculpture, mostly Roman but also [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]].

====Main staircase====
Features the relief from the honorary monument to [[Marcus Aurelius]].

====2nd floor====
The second floor of the building is occupied by the Conservator's Apartment, a space now open to the public and housing such famous works as the [[Capitoline Wolf|bronze she-wolf]] nursing [[Romulus and Remus]], which has become the emblem of Rome. The Conservator's Apartment is distinguished by elaborate interior decorations, including [[fresco]]es, [[stucco]]s, [[tapestry|tapestries]], and carved ceilings and doors.

====3rd floor====
The third floor of the Palazzo dei Conservatori houses the Capitoline Art Gallery, housing the museums' painting and applied art galleries. The Capitoline Coin Cabinet, containing collections of [[coin]]s, [[medal]]s, [[Gemstone|jewel]]s, and [[jewelry]], is located in the attached Palazzo Caffarelli-Clementino.

===Palazzo Nuovo===
Statues, inscriptions, [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], busts, [[mosaic]]s, and other ancient Roman artifacts occupy two floors of the Palazzo Nuovo.

In the Hall of the Galatian can also be appreciated the marble statue of the "[[Dying Gaul]]" also called “Capitoline Gaul” and the statue of ''[[Cupid and Psyche (Roman sculpture)|Cupid and Psyche]]''. Also housed in this building are:
*The colossal statue restored as Oceanus, located in the museum courtyard of this building
*A fragment of the ''[[Tabula Iliaca]]'' located at the Hall of the Doves
*The statue of [[Capitoline Venus]], from an original by [[Praxiteles]] (4th century BC)

===Galleria Congiunzione===
The Galleria Congiunzione is located beneath the Palazzo dei Conservatori and the piazza itself, and links the three palazzos sitting on the piazza. The gallery was constructed in the 1930s. It contains ''[[in situ]]'' 2nd century ruins of ancient Roman dwellings, and also houses the Galleria Lapidaria, which displays the Museums' collection of [[epigraph (archeology)|epigraph]]s.

===New wing===
The new great glass covered hall &amp;mdash; the ''Sala Marco Aurelio'' &amp;mdash; created by covering the Giardino Romano is similar to the one used for the [[Baths of Diocletian|Sala Ottagonale]] and [[British Museum|British Museum Great Court]]. The design is by the architect Carlo Aymonino. Its volume recalls that of the oval space designed by Michelangelo for the piazza.

Its centerpiece is the bronze equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, which was once in the centre of Piazza del Campidoglio and has been kept indoors ever since its modern restoration. Moving these statues out of the palazzo allows those sculptures temporarily moved to the [[#Centrale Montemartini|Centrale Montemartini]] to be brought back. It also houses the remaining fragments of the bronze [[Colossus of Constantine]] and the archaeological remains of the [[tuff]] foundations of the temple of Capitoline Jupiter, with a model, drawn and computer reconstructions and finds dating from the earliest occupation on the site (in the mid Bronze Age: 17th-14th centuries B.C.) to the foundation of the temple (6th century BC).

In the three halls adjacent to the ''Appartamento dei Conservatori'' are to be found the showcases of the famous [[Castellani]] Collection with a part of the set of Greek and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] vases that was donated to the municipality of Rome by [[Augusto Castellani]] in the mid-19th century.

==Centrale Montemartini==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The Centrale Montemartini&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centralemontemartini.org/it/index_net.htm Centrale Montemartini] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005083509/http://www.centralemontemartini.org/it/index_net.htm |date=October 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former power station of [[:it:ACEA|Acea]] (active as a power-station between the 1890s and 1930s) in southern Rome, between [[Pyramid of Cestius|Piramide]] and the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|basilica of San Paolo Fuori le Mura]], close to the [[Rome Metro|Metro]] station [[Garbatella (Rome Metro)|Garbatella]]. 
In 1997, the Centrale Montemartini was adapted to temporarily accommodate a part of the antique sculpture collection of the Capitoline museums, at that time closed for renovation; the temporary exhibition was so appreciated that the venue was eventually converted into a permanent museum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Centrale Montemartini | url=http://www.inexhibit.com/mymuseum/centrale-montemartini-archaeological-museum-rome |publisher=Inexhibit magazine|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its permanent collection comprises 400 ancient statues, moved here during the reorganisation of the Capitoline Museums in 1997, along with tombs, busts, and mosaics. Many of them  were excavated in the ancient Roman horti (e.g. the [[Gardens of Sallust]]) between the 1890s and 1930s, a fruitful period for Roman archaeology.  They are displayed there along the lines of [[Tate Modern]], except that (unlike there) the machinery has ''not'' been moved out.

'''CaseMap''' was introduced 1998 as [[relational database]] [[software]] for law offices to store and retrieve [[evidence]] and sources of evidence in litigation. It includes [[Table (database)|database table]]s (the program's documentation refers to them as ''spreadsheets'') for facts, issues, documents, [[physical evidence]], [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s, [[pleading]]s, persons, organizations, places, and other types of data. The program's documentation refers to these types of data as ''objects''. Using the program involves linking the various sources of evidence (e.g., documents, [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s, and persons) to facts that are relevant in the case and to the issues to be decided in the case. The facts table can be sorted by date to provide a chronology of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The use of large volumes of [[digital evidence]] and [[e-discovery]] in modern litigation has led law offices to increase their use of litigation support programs such as CaseMap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5201">'''Contemporary Tibetan art''' refers to the art of modern Tibet, or Tibet after 1950. It can also refer to art by the [[Tibetan diaspora]], which is explicitly political and religious in nature. Contemporary Tibetan art includes modern [[thangka]] (religious scroll paintings) that resemble ancient thangka, as well as radical, [[avant-garde]], works.

==Historical Tibetan art==
For more than a thousand years, [[Tibetan art]]ists have played a key role in the cultural life of [[Tibet]]. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, for the most part being distemper on cloth or murals. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and were manufactured in large workshops by uncredited artists. These works not only document spiritual concepts but also demonstrate the vitality of Tibetan [[aesthetics]] over the centuries in terms of the cross-fertilisation of stylistic influences from other Chinese, Nepalese, and Indian styles.

== After 1950 ==
Historical Tibetan art followed a formal system of art making that was used to spread Tibetan religious culture.  However, in 1950, the [[People's Republic of China]] gained sovereignty over [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] while still granting autonomy to the area.  This changed the social reality of life in Tibet, and modern Tibetan artists use their work as a mode of self-expression and exploration of their new, complex national identity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anonymous: Contemporary Tibetan Art|last=Weingeist|first=Rachel Perera|publisher=ArtAsiaPacific|year=2013|isbn=|location=Hong Kong|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Tibetan artwork often conflicts with traditional artwork commissioned for religious purposes, and identity was largely tied to place, family lines, [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]], and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], with art serving as the transmission of the religion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Tibetan art after 1950 raises questions of how [[globalization]] effects national and [[cultural identity]], the conflict between tradition and modernity, and the influence of religion in a more [[Secularity|secular]] age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyatso|first=Nathalie|date=July 1, 2008|title=Tibetan Art Today|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=ip,uid&amp;db=aft&amp;AN=505320320&amp;scope=site|journal=Art Press|volume=347|pages=52–59|via=EBSCO Host}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dreams of a Life''''' is a 2011 drama-[[documentary film]], released by [[Dogwoof Pictures]], directed by [[Carol Morley]] and starring [[Zawe Ashton]].

==Plot==
The film tells the story of [[Joyce Carol Vincent]], whose skeletal remains were found in her flat in [[Wood Green]], [[North London]], in January 2006. Joyce was found surrounded by wrapped Christmas gifts and with her TV still switched on, having remained undiscovered since December 2003.&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morley|first=Carol|authorlink1=Carol Morley|title=Joyce Carol Vincent: How could this young woman lie dead and undiscovered for almost three years?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/09/joyce-vincent-death-mystery-documentary|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to advanced decomposition, the cause of death was unable to be determined.

The film features interviews with various friends, acquaintances and former partners in an attempt to tell the story of Joyce, who is played in reconstructions by Ashton.

==Production==
Director Carol Morley was inspired to make the documentary on Joyce's life after reading an article on her that failed to mention her age, race or any detailed information. She tracked down interviewees by taking out ads in newspapers and hiring a cab to drive around [[London]] asking people to contact her if they knew Joyce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=D|title=Carol Morley, Dreams of a Life|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/49581-carol-morley-dreams-of-a-life/#.Vd_WebxViko|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was surprised to learn that many of the respondents did not know Joyce was dead until she spoke to them even though some of them remembered hearing of her death when it was reported on in newspapers.

Morley was criticized for an extended fictionalized sequence that featured Zawe Ashton as Joyce performing "[[A Smile is Just a Frown]]". She stated that she was inspired to keep the sequence in the film by a similar sequence in [[Agnès Varda]]'s ''[[Cléo from 5 to 7]]'' and also credited Varda's documentary work with inspiring much of her movie.

Morley was also in contact with Joyce's four sisters, all of whom refused to be in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch a video of 'Dreams of a Life' director Carol Morley chatting to filmmaker Kevin Macdonald|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/carol-morley-vs-kevin-macdonald-video-interview-exclusive|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they asked Morley not to make the film, she went ahead with production, but gave them an advance screening in order to show that she had been respectful in remembering their sister.

==Reception==
The film received a rating of 62 on aggregate movie review website [[Metacritic]] and 70% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], indicating an overall positive reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dreams of a Life|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dreams-of-a-life|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DREAMS OF A LIFE (2012)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dreams_of_a_life/|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Wilson]]'s album ''[[Hand. Cannot. Erase.]]'' was inspired by his viewing of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/steven-wilson-at-air-studios-part-2-concept-and-inspiration/|title=Steven Wilson at Air Studios - Part 2: Concept and Inspiration - Steven Wilson|date=4 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2495">An '''''ekkyklêma''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|s|ᵻ|ˈ|k|l|iː|m|ə}}; {{lang-el|εκκύκλημα}}; "roll-out machine") was a wheeled platform rolled out through a ''[[Skene (theatre)|skênê]]'' in [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theatre]]. It was used to bring interior scenes out into the sight of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 30), Csapo and Slater (1994, 61, 270-273, 428), Davidson (2005, 201), Goldhill (2007, 9), Ley (2007, xiv-xv), and Rehm (1992, 37).&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient sources suggest that it may have been revolved or turned.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 30) and Csapo and Slater (1994, 270-273).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mainly used in [[Tragedy|tragedies]] for revealing dead bodies, such as Hippolytus' dying body in the final scene of [[Euripides]]' [[Hippolytus (play)|play of the same name]], or the corpse of Eurydice draped over the household altar in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 67).&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses include the revelation in Sophocles' ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'' of Ajax surrounded by the sheep he killed whilst under the delusion that they were Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 69).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ekkyklêma'' is also used in comedy to [[parody]] the tragic effect.  An example of this is in [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' when Agathon, portrayed as an [[effeminate]], is wheeled onstage on an ''ekkyklêma'' to enhance the comic absurdity of the scene.

'''Emily Catherine Fields''' is a [[fictional character]] created in 2006 by author [[Sara Shepard]]. She is a character of both ''Pretty Little Liars''{{'}} [[Pretty Little Liars|books]] and [[Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|television series]], and initially appears as a "[[Jock (stereotype)|jock girl]]" and one of the main [[protagonists]] of the stories. She is part of the group known as [[The Liars (Pretty Little Liars)|the Liars]]; and is best friend to the four other members, whose are also protagonists. Emily is known for her description and shyness, as well as for being member of a conservative family, the Fields.

Emily's characteristics and stories have the same methodology in both books and television. However, there are some perceptual differences between the two versions, since the television series usually doesn't follows the books' scripts. As an example, Emily's parents on the screen have different names from the books ones; and, in the books, she has siblings, while in the television series she doesn't. Another noticeable difference between the two versions are the physical and psychological characteristics.

For her portrayal, Mitchell was nominated twice in the [[Teen Choice Award]]s.

== Character in print ==
''[[Pretty Little Liars (book series)|Pretty Little Liars]]'' is a series of novels which follows the lives of four teenage girls nicknamed the Pretty little Liars or simply the Liars, whose clique falls apart after the disappearance of their [[Queen bee (subculture)|queen bee]] leader, Alison DiLaurentis. Three years after her disappearance, the girls begin receiving threatening messages from an anonymous character named "A", who threatens to expose their secrets, including long-hidden ones they thought only Alison knew. Shortly after the messages begin, Alison's body is discovered buried in her yard. The books progress with the four girls trying to figure out who "A" is and facing many dangerous obstacles and twists.

In the first book, Emily is introduced as loyal, sweet girl who struggles with her sexuality.&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepard|first1=Sara|title=[[Pretty Little Liars (novel)|Pretty Little Liars]]|date=October 3, 2006|publisher=Harper Teen}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is described as having hazel eyes and a strawberry-blonde hair that is tinted green due to chlorine. At her school, Emily is recognized by the students for her achievements in swimming. Emily is largely motivated by matters surrounding [[family]], [[Romance (love)|romance]], and [[wikt:ambition|ambition]]. Emily is also [[superstitious]], although most of her superstitions are unique only to her; for example, making a wish at "4:56" instead of "[[11:11 (numerology)|11:11]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Emily Fields|date=August 6, 2011|url=http://prettylittleliars.alloyentertainment.com/pretty-little-liars-meet-emily-fields/|website=Pretty Little Liars|publisher=Alloy Entertainment|accessdate=July 30, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215022645/http://prettylittleliars.alloyentertainment.com/pretty-little-liars-meet-emily-fields/|archivedate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Story lines ===
Emily was a friend of Alison DiLaurentis and deeply attracted to her.&lt;ref name=book1/&gt; She dated a boy named Ben Coogan before realizing her true feelings were for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepard|first=Sara|title=Pretty Little Liars: Flawless|year=2007|publisher=Harper Teen|isbn=978-0-06-205987-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She falls for and secretly dates Maya St. Germain. When "A" [[outing|outs]] Emily to the whole school, her parents force her to go to Tree Tops, a [[conversion therapy|"de-gaying"]] rehabilitation center. Failing that, Emily is shipped off to [[Iowa]] to live with relatives; deeply unhappy there, she [[runaway (dependent)|runs away]]. Her parents ask her to come home, stating that they will learn to accept Emily for who she is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepard|first=Sara|title=Pretty Little Liars: Unbelievable|year=2008|publisher=Harper Teen|isbn=978-0-06-088741-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily comes to discover that she's actually bisexual, when she falls for and eventually sleeps with a boy named Isaac Colbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepard|first=Sara|title=Pretty Little Liars: Killer|year=2009|publisher=Harper Teen|isbn=0-06-156611-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they break up soon after, Emily learns she's pregnant and secretly gives the baby up for [[adoption]] during summer break.&lt;ref name="Twisted"&gt;{{cite book| last=Shepard| first=Sara| title=Pretty Little Liars: Twisted| year=2011| publisher=Harper Teen|isbn=978-0-06-208101-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a senior in high school, she accidentally meets Kelsey, a girl who Spencer framed for [[drug possession]] the past summer; Emily ends up falling for her, but the relationship is ended when Kelsey attempts suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shepard| first=Sara| title=Pretty Little Liars: Ruthless| year=2011| publisher=Harper Teen| isbn=978-0-06-208186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Burned'', while on a school-hosted cruise for [[spring break]], Emily begins a new relationship with Jordan, a criminal who is on the run and being pursued by the FBI. On a tip from "A"/Alison, Jordan is arrested and set to prison. She is later murdered by someone paid by Alison, who had Jordan killed out of revenge for "stealing" Emily from her. Severely depressed and increasingly desperate, Emily contemplates committing suicide and very nearly attempts it; she is only talked out of it when the Liars remind her that that is what Alison wants: for them to die.

In the last book, Emily and the other Liars are later put on trial after Alison fakes her own death and frames them for it (setting it up to look like the Liars took revenge on Alison for everything she did to them). Emily, unbeknownst the other Liars, fakes her own suicide in order to trick Alison. Emily tracks down Alison and Alison's mother, who are in hiding, and after a confrontation with them, is able to expose them as criminals. After Alison's trial, she moves out to California and begins a new relationship with a girl named Laura, finally feeling at peace.

After, in "[[These Boots Were Made for Stalking]]", Emily is accused by high school student Addison Derringer ([[Ava Allan]]) of being inappropriate, while Addison gathers photos of Emily with Alison. Paige tries to solve the situation, but Emily ends up screaming at Addison; ultimately, Paige calls Addison's father and she's called to the Principal's room. Following, in "[[Hold Your Piece]]", Aria and Emily team up to investigate Sydney for more information about Jenna and her connection to "A.D".

Baron '''Ferenc Hatvany'''  (29 October 1881 – 7 February 1958) was a Hungarian painter and art collector. A son of [[Sándor Hatvany-Deutsch]] and a member of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Hatvany-Deutsch family|hu|3=Hatvany-Deutsch család}}, he graduated in the [[Académie Julian]] in Paris. His collection&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeweb.hu/dialog2000/8.html Inventory of art works which Hatvany placed in the strongrooms of major Budapest banks in 1942] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525162759/http://www.freeweb.hu/dialog2000/8.html |date=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; included paintings from [[Tintoretto]], [[Cézanne]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] and [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], most notably ''[[L'Origine du monde]]'' and  ''[[Femme nue couchée]]''.

Towards the end of the [[Second World War]] his paintings were looted by Soviet troops but some were ransomed by Hatvany. In 1947 he emigrated to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2008/02/01/the-mysterious-journey-of-an-erotic-masterpiece/ ARTNews; The Mysterious Journey of an Erotic Masterpiece]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 ''L'Origine du monde'' was sold at auction for 1.5 million francs (the buyer was psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]).

Paintings that were looted from Hatvany's collection are still hanging on museum walls in Budapest, Moscow, and Nizhny Novgorod.{{Specify |reason=Add the name of the museums rather than just the cities. |date=August 2016}} [[John Constable]]'s "Beaching A Boat, Brighton" was identified in the collection of [[The Tate]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10728354/Tate-to-return-Constable-painting-looted-by-Nazis.html "Tate to return Constable painting looted by Nazis"] The Telegraph;  28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatvany died in [[Lausanne]] in 1958.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3915">[[File:Horatius Cocles.jpg|thumb|[[Horatius Cocles]], engraving by [[Hendrick Goltzius]] – an example of a Figura serpentinata]]
'''Figura serpentinata''' (Italian - [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpentine]] figure) is a style in painting and sculpture, intended to make the figure seem more dynamic, that is typical of [[Mannerism]]. It is similar, but not identical, to [[contrapposto]], and features figures often in a [[spiral]] pose.&lt;ref name="mma"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/dona/hd_dona.htm|title=Donatello (ca. 1386–1466)|accessdate=November 20, 2007|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=2007|author=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early examples can be seen in the work of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]].

Emil Maurer writes of the painter and theorist [[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo]] (1538–1600): "The recommended ideal form unites, after Lomazzo, three qualities: the pyramid, the "serpentinata" movement and a certain numerical proportion, all three united to form one whole. At the same time, precedence is given to the "moto", that is, to the meandering movement, which should make the pyramid, in exact proportion, into the geometrical form of a cone."

[[File:Laokoon-Gruppe-02.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Laocoön group]]
Bousquet holds that the "serpentinata" style arose as a result of the discovery of the [[Laocoön and His Sons|Laocoön group]] in 1506, and its deep impact on all artists, but on Michelangelo in particular.  [[John Shearman]] also argues that it was invented by Michelangelo, citing the "Victors" that he produced for [[Pope Julius II]]'s tomb.  Maurer, on the other hand, can only detect this style rarely in Michelangelo's work and cites [[Beccafumi]] instead as its pioneer. Beccafumi's student [[Marco Pino]] connected Beccafumi's style with those of [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Salviati]], [[Parmigianino]] and perhaps even Michelangelo, and his work as a whole is marked by "serpentinata" motifs. [[Paolo Pino]] himself says in his "Dialogo della Pittura", that his figures' poses are many and varied, and that in all his works to find one single figure, that completely and utterly distorts, is ambivalent and difficult.

As Maurer writes, painters are freer than sculptors and less closely tied-down to nature.  Thus they can play around with their figures, reshaping, overstretching, geometricising, dissolving, caricaturing, colouring, meandering, according to the painting's goal and intended effect.  With the loosening of the norms of the [[Renaissance]] and the development of the "Serpentita" style, that style's structures and rules began to be systematised.  A style of form began by which figures showed physical power, passion, tension and semantic perfection.  Movements were not without motivation, nor even simply done with a will, but with will shown in a pure form.  Also their actions arose not out of power, but powerlessness.

The style exerted an influence even into the 1620s, with [[Bernini]]'s ''[[The Rape of Proserpina (Bernini)|The Rape of Proserpina]]''.

[[File:Origine della Compagnia della Misericordia in Firenze.jpg|thumb|The body of a dead woman is brought before the Gonfaloniere of Justice in 1425, the legendary origin of the ''Compagnia della Misericordia'', by [[Eleuterio Pagliano]].]]
'''Gonfaloniere of Justice''' (''Gonfaloniere di Giustizia'') was a post in the government of [[history of Florence|medieval and early Renaissance Florence]]. Like Florence's Priori, it was introduced in 1293 when [[Giano Della Bella]]'s [[Ordinances of Justice]] came into force.

He was one of the nine citizens selected by drawing lots every two months, who formed the government, or [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]]. As ''Gonfaloniere di Giustizia'' he was the temporary standard-bearer of the [[Republic of Florence]] and custodian of the city's banner, which was displayed from the yardarm of a portable cross. Along with the voting rights of the other Priori, he was also in charge of the internal security forces and the maintenance of public order.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Najemy, ''A History of Florence, 1200–1575'' (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2008), 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish him from his other eight colleagues, his crimson coat, lined with [[ermine (heraldy)|ermine]], was further embroidered with golden stars. Each of Florence's neighborhoods, or ''rioni'', had its own ''priore'' who might be selected to serve on the council, and its own ''gonfaloniere di compagnia'' selected from the first families of each quarter.

==History==

===Prelude===
[[Image:Fiorino 1340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Florin (1332–1348)]]
13th century Italy was a 'land of cities' and Florence was one of the richest and most politically restless among them. The most obvious signs of this prosperity and economic power were its striking of 3.5 gram gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] and the presence of the city's large mercantile and financier companies right across Europe and Africa. These companies' leaders demanded increasing involvement in the city's political life, claiming equal or greater dignity than the old noble families who held now unproductive rural land outside the town. In the 13th and 14th centuries the Arti Maggiori would be key to the city's economic ascent and the middle class's revenge on the feudal nobility. This state of affairs would last until at least 1347, when the English monarchy's bankruptcy due to its high military expenditure in the [[Hundred Years' War]] dragged even the Bardi and Peruzzi businesses (the latter alone owed around 600,000 guilders) into ruin.
&lt;!---
===Government of the first people===
[[Image:Fleur de lis.svg|thumb|right|220pxl|Guelph arms]]
Il dualismo politico caratterizza l’evoluzione delle istituzioni cittadine nel corso del ‘200; la lotta tra [[guelfi]]
e [[ghibellini]] (in cui tutta la nobiltà fiorentina è confluita) rientra nel generale andamento delle vicende italiane ed europee del XIII secolo, con fasi vittoriose alterne e la relativa espulsione del partito avverso in caso di sconfitta. Nel [[1250]], dopo la morte di [[Federico II di Svevia]], la fazione guelfa riesce ad imporsi grazie al cosiddetto Governo del Primo Popolo, che segna l’inizio dell’ascesa delle Arti nel governo cittadino; i membri delle [[corporazioni]] entrano infatti a far parte dei Consigli delle due massime Magistrature, il Consiglio degli Anziani e del [[Capitano del Popolo]], la nuova carica introdotta per affiancare il Podestà nelle sue funzioni. Podestà e Capitano si trovano così a svolgere i medesimi incarichi (l'emanazione di leggi, l'imposizione di tasse e gli ordini di carattere militare) e sono entrambi a capo di due Consigli, uno composto da 300 e l'altro da 90 membri, affiancati appunto dal Consiglio dei 12 Anziani e da quello dei cosiddetti 36 ''[[boni homines]]'', cittadini molto selezionati che hanno il difficile compito di dirimere le eventuali controversie e cercare un accordo tra tutti i partecipanti al governo. Sono presenti nei consigli anche i Gonfalonieri, che ancora indicano semplicemente coloro che guidano le milizie cittadine, divise in “popoli”, o parrocchie, ognuna di queste contraddistinte dal proprio vessillo, detto appunto [[Gonfalone]]. Nel [[1260]], però, [[Siena]] sconfigge i fiorentini nella [[battaglia di Montaperti]] e ciò consente il rientro degli esponenti ghibellini a Firenze che decretano la fine del Governo del Primo Popolo. Il predominio della fazione ghibellina del resto non è di lunga durata perché nel [[1266]] [[Manfredi]], figlio di Federico II, viene sconfitto nella battaglia di Benevento e così i guelfi rientrano nuovamente a Firenze, dando vita stavolta al brevissimo Governo di Parte Guelfa, composto dai membri degli strati più alti della popolazione ma già abolito l’anno successivo per l’intervento di [[Carlo d’Angiò]], che in cambio della propria protezione si autoproclama Podestà fino al [[1274]].

===The Priory of Arts===
[[Image:Palazzo dell'Arte dei Beccai.JPG|thumb|left|The palazzo dell'Arte dei Beccai]]
Si giunge così al [[1282]] ed alla creazione del Priorato delle Arti, un nuovo organo composto inizialmente da 3 e poi da 6 membri eletti tra gli appartenenti alle ventuno [[Corporazioni delle arti e mestieri]], che raggiungono così il massimo riconoscimento giuridico-politico necessario per ambire alla guida delle istituzioni cittadine; il provvedimento più significativo infatti è dato dal fatto che la partecipazione alla vita politica è vincolata all’iscrizione, anche solo formale, ad una delle Arti Maggiori o Medie. 
Il Priorato si affianca ai Consigli già presenti nelle magistrature fiorentine con a capo un Capitano Difensore delle Arti; i suoi membri, i priori, termine peraltro già esistente ma che indicava una carica con diverse funzioni, restano in carica per soltanto due mesi e questo, oltre a consentire una certa "mobilità" tra i suoi esponenti, evita l'accentramento del potere nelle mani di una sola persona, mettendo così la città al riparo dall'avvento di un [[tiranno]]. 

Il governo del Priorato, che aveva grandi poteri sia decisionali che esecutivi, decreta il successo delle Corporazioni maggiori, soprattutto quella dell'Arte della Lana e dell'Arte dei Giudici e dei Notai; bisogna del resto tenere presente, che sia il Governo del Primo Popolo che quello del Priorato, pur allargando la base sociale rispetto al vecchio comune aristocratico, è monopolizzato sia dal [[popolo grasso]] che dalle famiglie magnatizie ormai molto vicine tra loro; le [[Arti Medie]] ottennero di fatto la propria rappresentanza nei Consigli solo nel [[1285]], mentre le [[Arti Minori]] dovettero accontentarsi di funzioni alquanto ristrette qualche anno più tardi; le maggiori casate di origine mercantile infatti si erano lentamente inserite nell’antica aristocrazia feudale, assimilandone le caratteristiche, mentre le altre appartenenti al popolo grasso avevano preferito non discostarsi troppo dalla moltitudine degli artigiani e dei commercianti più modesti ma molto numerosi in città.

===The Gonfaloniere of Justice===

È in quest’ottica che risulta meglio comprensibile la portata più marcatamente “democratica” degli  Ordinamenti di Giustizia emanati nel [[1293]] da Giano della Bella, che pur essendo di nobili origini, volle dare voce alle istanze della “piccola borghesia”, riuscendo ad escludere i [[magnati]] dalle cariche amministrative ed imponendo l’esercizio effettivo di un’Arte per accedere al Priorato. È in questo contesto che viene creata la figura del Gonfaloniere di Giustizia, un magistrato che doveva guidare il Collegio dei Priori e la milizia cittadina contro le eventuali infrazioni dei magnati. Gli Ordinamenti di Giustizia vennero ben presto ridimensionati e nel 1295 Giano venne esiliato da Firenze; il popolo grasso aveva ormai ottenuto la propria vittoria e per non vedersi estromessi dalla vita politica cittadina gli esponenti dell’antica aristocrazia dovettero passare nelle file del partito guelfo; si formano così due nuove fazioni, i [[Bianchi]], riuniti intorno ai Cerchi, famiglia borghese arricchitasi con i propri affari e disposta ad una maggiore apertura verso le Arti Minori ed i [[Neri]], riuniti intorno ai Donati, famiglia della nobiltà feudale contraria ad ogni forma di partecipazione popolare e che incontra il consenso di buona parte delle Arti Maggiori, che si sentono indubbiamente più vicine ai magnati “convertiti” che non ai ceti artigiani.
---&gt;
===After the Ordinances===
[[File:Siege of Florence.JPG|thumb|right|350pxl|Siege of Florence in 1530]]

The post of Gonfaloniere survived practically until the abolition of the Republican constitution by the [[Medici]] on their return to the city in 1530. Indeed, in the 15th century the post was given to many members of the Medici family and their neighbouring and allied families, giving them a kind of recognised power within the republican framework and ''de facto'' (though never ''de jure'') allowing them to take over the powers of the other old magistracies.

After the expulsion of [[Piero the Unfortunate]] in 1494 and during the brief rule of [[Girolamo Savonarola]] (executed in 1498), the Florentine families tried to reorganise the city government on the model of the old communal magistracies. [[Pier Soderini]] was in 1502 appointed gonfaloniere for life, but only held it until the end of 1512, when the Medici returned and Piero decided to abandon the city. During his tenure, Soderini held more direct political responsibility than either [[Cosimo de' Medici]] or [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. [[Machiavelli]] served as his secretary. Although many of the ''Ottimati'' or aristocrats had supported Soderini's candidacy for Gonfaloniere a Vita, believing he would support their interests, they turned against him when his popular leanings became clear.&lt;ref&gt;Najemy (2008), 405–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1512, after fierce resistance to imperial troops under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[pope Julius II]], it was finally forced to surrender. This marked the end of the republican dream and its offices, with the start of the ascent of the grand-ducal Medici dynasty.

'''Helmets for Peace''' is a work of art by [[Batuz]], consisting of military helmets and attached to them shields made of dyed paper pulp, straw and various other materials. The work of art aims to raise awareness among people about the important role of the peacekeeping missions of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr (2015). ''Helmets for Peace - Batuz: English''. Sandstein Verlag, Dresden. {{ISBN|978-3-95498-168-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Hans-Peter von Kirchbach]] (former General Inspector of the Bundeswehr) inspired Batuz to create a permanent installation from the helmets and the attached to them shields, which should turn into a symbol of peace to be followed by many armies around the world. In the summer of 2007 Batuz finished assembling the first installation of the work which was called “Helmets for Peace”. It was exhibited in an abandoned hall in [[Chemnitz]]. The work included 167 helmets and was 5,50 meter high and 11,30 meter wide.&lt;ref&gt;Batuz Foundation (2007). ''Helmets for Peace'' catalog&lt;/ref&gt;

The shields, which were used as vital parts of the artwork "Helmets for Peace", have been painted five years earlier by dozens of international artists in another project – the “border crossing” at the Neisse River at the border between Germany and Poland in 2002, in which the [[Bundeswehr]] played a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;Batuz Foundation &amp; Auswärtiges Amt der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (2003). ''no más fronteras''. Kloster Altzella/Nossen&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 “Helmets for Peace” was vandalized and a few weeks later disassembled and stored away.&lt;ref&gt;Mehlhorn, Th. "Star-Künstler packt ein", BILD, July 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of General Hans-Peter von Kirchbach and Minister [[Christian Schmidt (politician)|Christian Schmidt]] (at that time Parliamentary State Secretary in the German Federal Ministry of Defence) "Helmets for Peace" found a new home in the [[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr]]. The exhibition opening took place on March 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Rieckmann, Adina. MDR Sachsenspiegel. March 4, 2015 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5ZJCO07X9Q&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Dr. [[Dieter Ronte]] acknowledges the importance of “Helmets for Peace”, drawing similarities to [[Picasso]]'s artwork [[Guernica]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronte, Dieter (2007). ''Batuz - Helmets for Peace'' http://societeimaginaire.net/prof-dr-dieter-ronte-batuz-helmets-for-peace/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hurricane''''' is a 1944 [[oil painting]] by American artist [[John Marin]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. He used quick brushstrokes and thickly daubed paint to depict a turbulent ocean such as he experienced near his summer home in [[Maine]].&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Although Marin is best known for his [[watercolor]]s, beginning in the 1930s he developed an interest in the more expressive brushwork and rugged quality of oil paint. Marin was influenced by [[Cubism]], with its flattened spaces and angularity. He honed a style of frenetic brushwork to create this dynamic image of water, wind, and clouds. He was so successful in his recreation of nature that a sailor purportedly declared it the first time he had "really seen a sea painted as the sea really is."&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

===Historical information===
''Hurricane'' was painted the same year the [[1944 Great Atlantic hurricane|Great Atlantic hurricane]] smashed into Maine.&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Tyler|title=John Marin: Painter with a syringe|url=http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2011/11/john-marin-painter-with-a-syringe/|work=Modern Art Notes|accessdate=26 May 2013|date=30 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
''Hurricane'' was first displayed in 1944 in the famous [[Alfred Stieglitz#The Intimate Gallery and An American Place (1925–1937)|An American Place]] gallery. It was borrowed from the IMA to be part of a 1987 retrospective of Marin's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=John Marin's Hurricane: "Certainly a Masterpiece"|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''Hurricane'' was loaned out again for a traveling exhibit called "John Marin: Modernism at Midcentury," of which it was a highlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Rita|title=Art review: John Marin: Modernism at Midcentury at the Amon Carter in Fort Worth|url=http://www.pegasusnews.com/news/2011/nov/09/art-review-john-marin-modernism-amon-carter-fort/|publisher=The Assignment Desk, DFW|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition took it to the [[Portland Museum of Art]] in [[Portland, Maine]]; the [[Amon Carter Museum]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and the [[Addison Gallery of American Art]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Marin Modernism at Midcentury|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300149937|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
[[Caroline Marmon Fesler]] acquired ''Hurricane'' the same year it was painted, from Marin's long-time friend and art dealer, [[Alfred Stieglitz]]. He congratulated Fesler on her purchase, writing "The ''Hurricane'' is certainly a masterpiece, Every one agrees with every one else as to that." It was donated to the IMA as part of her estate in 1961, and was given the accession number 61.42.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurricane|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/hurricane-marin-john|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|OM|RA}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|m|ə|_|ˈ|t|æ|d|ᵻ|m|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Miller, ''BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names'' (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Lourens Alma Tadema''' {{IPA-nl|ˈlʌurəns ˈɑlmaː ˈtaːdəˌmaː}}; 8 January 1836 – 25 June 1912) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] painter of special [[Denization|British denizenship]].  Born in [[Dronrijp]], the Netherlands, and trained at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Antwerp]], Belgium, he settled in England in 1870 and spent the rest of his life there. A classical-subject painter, he became famous for his depictions of the luxury and [[decadence]] of the [[Roman Empire]], with languorous figures set in fabulous marbled interiors or against a backdrop of dazzling blue [[Mediterranean Sea]] and sky.  Though admired during his lifetime for his draftsmanship and depictions of [[Classical antiquity]], his work fell into disrepute after his death, and only since the 1960s has it been re-evaluated for its importance within [[Art of the United Kingdom|nineteenth-century British art]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Dronrijp.Dûbelestreek.2-01.JPG|thumb|Lourens Alma Tadema's birth house and statue in [[Dronrijp]], Netherlands]]
[[File:Still Life with Tulips by Lawrence Alma-Tadema.jpg|thumb|One of Alma-Tadema's earliest works. Still Life with Tulips, circa 1850.]]

Lourens Alma Tadema was born on 8 January 1836 in the village of [[Dronrijp]] in the province of [[Friesland]] in the north of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=" Swanson 8"&gt;Swanson, ''Alma-Tadema'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The surname ''Tadema'' is an old Frisian [[patronymic]], meaning 'son of Tade', while the names ''Lourens'' and ''Alma'' came from his godfather.&lt;ref name=" Barrow 10"&gt;Barrow, ''Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; He was the sixth child of Pieter Jiltes Tadema (1797–1840), the village [[notary]], and the third child of Hinke Dirks Brouwer ({{circa|1800}}–1863). His father had three sons from a previous marriage. His parents' first child died young, and the second was Atje ({{circa|1834|lk=no}}–1876), Lourens' sister, for whom he had great affection.

The Tadema family moved in 1838 to the nearby city of [[Leeuwarden]], where Pieter's position as a notary would be more lucrative.&lt;ref name=" Swanson 8"/&gt; His father died when Lourens was four, leaving his mother with five children: Lourens, his sister, and three boys from his father's first marriage. His mother had artistic leanings, and decided that drawing lessons should be incorporated into the children's education. He received his first art training with a local drawing master hired to teach his older half-brothers.

It was intended that the boy would become a lawyer; but in 1851 at the age of fifteen he suffered a physical and mental breakdown. Diagnosed as [[Tuberculosis|consumptive]] and given only a short time to live, he was allowed to spend his remaining days at his leisure, drawing and painting. Left to his own devices he regained his health and decided to pursue a career as an artist.&lt;ref name=" Barrow 10"/&gt;

=== Move to Belgium ===
In 1852 he entered the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy]] of [[Antwerp]] in [[Belgium]] where he studied early Dutch and Flemish art, under [[Gustaf Wappers]]. During Alma-Tadema's four years as a registered student at the Academy, he won several respectable awards.

[[File:Alma-Tadema The Education of the Children of Clovis.jpg|thumb|''The Education of the Children of Clovis'' (1861), oil on canvas, 127 × 176.8&amp;nbsp;cm, [[private collection]]. Queen [[Clotilde]], wife of King [[Clovis I|Clovis]], is shown training her three young children the art of hurling the ax to avenge the death of her father.&lt;ref name = " Swanson 129"&gt;Swanson, ''Alma-Tadema'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Before leaving school, towards the end of 1855, he became assistant to the painter and professor Louis (Lodewijk) Jan de Taeye, whose courses in history and historical costume he had greatly enjoyed at the Academy. Although de Taeye was not an outstanding painter, Alma-Tadema respected him and became his studio assistant, working with him for three years. De Taeye introduced him to books that influenced his desire to portray [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] subjects early in his career. He was encouraged to depict historical accuracy in his paintings, a trait for which the artist became known.

Alma-Tadema left Taeye's studio in November 1858 returning to Leeuwarden before settling in Antwerp, where he began working with the painter Baron [[Jan August Hendrik Leys]],&lt;ref name = " Barrow 15"&gt;Barrow, ''Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; whose studio was one of the most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: ''The Education of the children of Clovis'' (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation.&lt;ref name = " Swanson 12"&gt;Swanson, '' Alma-Tadema'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought the completed painting better than he had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese.&lt;ref name=" Swanson 12"/&gt;

Alma-Tadema took this criticism very seriously, and it led him to improve his technique and to become the world's foremost painter of marble and variegated granite. Despite any reproaches from his master, ''The Education of the Children of Clovis'' was honorably received by critics and artists alike and was eventually purchased and subsequently given to King Leopold of Belgium.&lt;ref name = " Barrow 16"&gt;Barrow, '' Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860 he befriended the Anglo Dutch painters Dommersen /(van)Dommelshuizen in Utrecht where he portrayed in 1862 in Utrecht in pencil drawings of Mrs. Cornelia Dommershuizen and one of her sons, Thomas Hendrik Dommersen / Dommershuizen. The latter brothers were the painters [[Pieter Cornelis Dommersen ]] and [[Cornelis Christiaan Dommersen]].

===Early works===
[[File:Egyptian chess players.jpg|right|thumb|''Egyptian [[History of chess|Chess]] Players'' (1865), oil on wood, 39.8 × 55.8&amp;nbsp;cm. Private collection.]]

Merovingian themes were the painter's favourite subject up to the mid-1860s. It is perhaps in this series that we find the artist moved by the deepest feeling and the strongest spirit of romance. However Merovingian subjects did not have a wide international appeal, so he switched to themes of life in ancient [[Egypt]] that were [[Egyptomania|more popular]]. On these scenes of Frankish and Egyptian life Alma-Tadema spent great energy and much research. In 1862 Alma-Tadema left Leys's studio and started his own career, establishing himself as a significant classical-subject European artist.
[[File:Anna Alma Tadema (1864-1940) and Laurense Alma Tadema (1865-1940), by Lawrence Alma-Tadema.jpg|thumb|left|Anna (in front) and Laurence (Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 1873)]]
1863 was to alter the course of Alma-Tadema's personal and professional life: on 3 January his invalid mother died, and on 24 September he was married, in [[Antwerp City Hall]], to Marie-Pauline Gressin Dumoulin, the daughter of Eugène Gressin Dumoulin, a French journalist living near [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name = " Swanson 13"&gt;Swanson, '' Alma-Tadema'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of their meeting and little of Pauline herself, as Alma-Tadema never spoke about her after her death in 1869. Her image appears in a number of oils, though he painted her portrait only three times, the most notable appearing in ''My studio'' (1867).&lt;ref name = " Barrow 20"&gt;Barrow, '' Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had three children. Their eldest and only son lived only a few months dying of smallpox. Their two daughters, [[Laurence Alma-Tadema|Laurence]] (1864–1940) and [[Anna Alma-Tadema|Anna]] (1867–1943), both had artistic leanings: the former in literature, the latter in art. Neither would marry.

Alma-Tadema and his wife spent their honeymoon in [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Naples]] and [[Pompeii]]. This, his first visit to Italy, developed his interest in depicting the life of ancient Greece and Rome, especially the latter since he found new inspiration in the ruins of Pompeii, which fascinated him and would inspire much of his work in the coming decades.

During the summer of 1864, Tadema met [[Ernest Gambart]], the most influential print publisher and art dealer of the period. Gambart was highly impressed with the work of Tadema, who was then painting ''Egyptian chess players'' (1865). The dealer, recognising at once the unusual gifts of the young painter, gave him an order for twenty-four pictures and arranged for three of Tadema's paintings to be shown in London.&lt;ref name = " Swanson 15"&gt;Swanson, '' Alma-Tadema'', , p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, Tadema relocated to Brussels where he was named a knight of the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].

On 28 May 1869, after years of ill health, Pauline died at Schaerbeek, in Belgium, at the age of thirty-two, of smallpox.&lt;ref name = " Barrow 41"&gt;Barrow, '' Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Her death left Tadema disconsolate and depressed. He ceased painting for nearly four months. His sister Artje, who lived with the family, helped with the two daughters then aged five and two. Artje took over the role of housekeeper and remained with the family until 1873 when she married.&lt;ref name=" Barrow 41"/&gt;

During the summer Tadema himself began to suffer from a medical problem which doctors in Brussels were frustratingly unable to diagnose. Gambart eventually advised him to go to England for another medical opinion. Soon after his arrival in London in December 1869, Alma-Tadema was invited to the home of the painter [[Ford Madox Brown]]. There he met [[Laura Theresa Alma-Tadema|Laura Theresa Epps]], who was seventeen years old, and fell in [[Love at first sight|love with her at first sight]].&lt;ref name = " Barrow 60"&gt;Barrow, '' Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to England===

The outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in July 1870 compelled Alma-Tadema to leave the continent and move to London. His infatuation with Laura Epps played a great part in his relocation to England and Gambart felt that the move would be advantageous to the artist's career. In stating his reasons for the move, Tadema simply said "I lost my first wife, a French lady with whom I married in 1863, in 1869. Having always had a great predilection for London, the only place where, up till then my work had met with buyers, I decided to leave the continent and go to settle in England, where I have found a true home."

With his small daughters and sister Atje, Alma-Tadema arrived in London at the beginning of September 1870. The painter wasted no time in contacting Laura, and it was arranged that he would give her painting lessons. During one of these, he proposed marriage. As he was then thirty-four and Laura was now only eighteen, her father was initially opposed to the idea. Dr Epps finally agreed on the condition that they should wait until they knew each other better. They married in July 1871. Laura, under her married name, also won a high reputation as an artist, and appears in numerous of Alma-Tadema's canvases after their marriage (''The Women of Amphissa'' (1887) being a notable example). This second marriage was enduring and happy, though childless, and Laura became stepmother to Anna and Laurence. Anna became a painter and Laurence became a novelist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Alma-Tadema|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA35 |publisher=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He would initially adopt the name ''Laurence Alma Tadema'' instead of ''Lourens Alma Tadema'' and later adopt the more English ''Lawrence'' for his forename, and incorporate ''Alma'' into his surname so that he appeared at the beginning of exhibition catalogues, under "A" rather than under "T".&lt;ref name=" Barrow 10"/&gt; He did not actually hyphenate his last name, but it was done by others and this has since become the convention.&lt;ref name="Ash"&gt;Ash, ''Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition is balanced by the flowers in bloom.]]

After his arrival in England, where he was to spend the rest of his life, Alma-Tadema's career was one of continued success. He became one of the most famous and highly paid artists of his time, acknowledged and rewarded. By 1871 he had met and befriended most of the major [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters and it was in part due to their influence that the artist brightened his palette, varied his hues, and lightened his brushwork.

In 1872 Alma-Tadema organised his paintings into an identification system by including an opus number under his signature and assigning his earlier pictures numbers as well. ''Portrait of my sister, Artje'', painted in 1851, is numbered opus I, while two months before his death he completed ''Preparations in the Coliseum'', opus CCCCVIII. Such a system would make it difficult for fakes to be passed off as originals.&lt;ref name = " Barrow 62"&gt;Barrow, '' Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|in Council]] by [[letters patent]] made Alma-Tadema and his wife what are now the last British [[Denization|Denizens]] (the legal process has theoretically not yet been abolished in the United Kingdom), with some limited special rights otherwise only accorded to and enjoyed by British subjects (what would now be called British citizens). The previous year he and his wife made a journey on the Continent that lasted five and a half months and took them through Brussels, Germany, and Italy. In Italy they were able to take in the ancient ruins again; this time he purchased several photographs, mostly of the ruins, which began his immense collection of folios with archival material sufficient for the documentation used in the completion of future paintings. In January 1876, he rented a studio in Rome. The family returned to London in April, visiting the Parisian Salon on their way back. In London he regularly met with fellow-artist [[Emil Fuchs (artist)|Emil Fuchs]].&lt;ref name="Ronald Alley 1981" &gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/emil-fuchs-1130 Quoted on Tate website:] Ronald Alley, ''Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists'', Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.227–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ThomasCool" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomascool.eu/Painting/TC1851-EmilFuchs.html|title=Emil Fuchs 1866–1929|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most important of his pictures during this period was ''An Audience at Agrippa's'' (1876). When an admirer of the painting offered to pay a substantial sum for a painting with a similar theme, Alma-Tadema simply turned the emperor around to show him leaving in ''After the Audience''.

On 19 June 1879, Alma-Tadema was made a full Academician, his most personally important award. Three years later a major retrospective of his entire oeuvre was organised at the Grosvenor Gallery in London, including 185 of his pictures.

In 1883 he returned to Rome and, most notably, [[Pompeii]], where further excavations had taken place since his last visit. He spent a significant amount of time studying the site, going there daily. These excursions gave him an ample source of subject matter as he began to further his knowledge of daily Roman life. At times, however, he integrated so many objects into his paintings that some said they resembled museum catalogues.

One of his most famous paintings is ''[[The Roses of Heliogabalus]]'' (1888) – based on an episode from the life of the debauched [[Roman Emperor]] [[Elagabalus]] (Heliogabalus), the painting depicts the Emperor suffocating his guests at an orgy under a cascade of rose [[petals]]. The blossoms depicted were sent weekly to the artist's London studio from the Riviera for four months during the winter of 1887–1888.

Among Alma-Tadema's works of this period are: ''An Earthly Paradise'' (1891), ''Unconscious Rivals'' (1893) ''[[Spring (painting)|Spring]]'' (1894), ''The Coliseum'' (1896) and ''The Baths of Caracalla'' (1899). Although Alma-Tadema's fame rests on his paintings set in Antiquity, he also painted portraits, landscapes and watercolours, and made some [[etching]]s himself (although many more were made of his paintings by others).

===Personality===
[[File:Alma Tadema Spring.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Spring (painting)|Spring]]'' (1894), oil on canvas,179.2 × 80.3&amp;nbsp;cm, J. Paul [[Getty Museum]], Los Angeles. It depicts the [[Cerealia|festival of Cerealia]] in a Roman street. One of Tadema's most famous and popular works, it took him four years to complete. The models for many of the participants and spectators were Tadema's friends and members of his family.&lt;ref name = " Swanson 130"&gt;Swanson, ''Alma-Tadema'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;]]

For all the quiet charm and erudition of his paintings, Alma-Tadema himself preserved a youthful sense of mischief. He was childlike in his practical jokes and in his sudden bursts of bad temper, which could as suddenly subside into an engaging smile.

In his personal life, Alma-Tadema was an extrovert and had a remarkably warm personality.&lt;ref name = " Swanson 35"&gt;Swanson, '' Alma-Tadema'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He had most of the characteristics of a child, coupled with the admirable traits of a consummate professional. A perfectionist, he remained in all respects a diligent, if somewhat obsessive and pedantic worker. He was an excellent businessman, and one of the wealthiest artists of the nineteenth century. Alma-Tadema was as firm in money matters as he was with the quality of his work.&lt;ref name = " Swanson 34"&gt;Swanson, ''Alma-Tadema'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a man, Lawrence Alma-Tadema was a robust, fun loving and rather portly gentleman. There was not a hint of the delicate artist about him; he was a cheerful lover of wine, women and parties.

===Later years===
Alma-Tadema's output decreased with time, partly on account of health, but also because of his obsession with decorating his new home, to which he moved in 1883. Nevertheless, he continued to exhibit throughout the 1880s and into the next decade, receiving a plentiful amount of accolades along the way, including the medal of Honour at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889]], election to an honorary member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society in 1890, the Great Gold Medal at the [[Brussels International (1897)|International Exposition in Brussels of 1897]]. In 1899 he was [[Knight Bachelor|Knighted]] in England, only the eighth artist from the Continent to receive the honour. Not only did he assist with the organisation of the British section at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris]], he also exhibited two works that earned him the Grand Prix Diploma. He also assisted with the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's Fair of 1904]] where he was well represented and received.

[[File:Portrait of Lawrence Alma-Tadema.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Alma-Tadema]]

During this time, Alma-Tadema was very active with theatre design and production, designing many costumes. He also spread his artistic boundaries and began to design furniture, often modelled after Pompeian or Egyptian motifs, illustrations, textiles, and frame making. His diverse interests highlight his talents. Each of these exploits were used in his paintings, as he often incorporated some of his designed furniture into the composition, and must have used many of his own designs for the clothing of his female subjects. Through his last period of creativity Alma-Tadema continued to produce paintings, which repeat the successful formula of women in marble terraces overlooking the sea such as in ''Silver Favourites'' (1903).&lt;ref name = " Barrow 179"&gt;Barrow, ''Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1906 and his death six years later, Alma-Tadema painted less but still produced ambitious paintings like ''[[The Finding of Moses (Alma-Tadema painting)|The Finding of Moses]]'' (1904).&lt;ref name = " Barrow 186"&gt;Barrow, ''Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 1909 Alma-Tadema's wife, Laura, died at the age of fifty-seven. The grief-stricken widower outlived his second wife by less than three years. His last major composition was ''Preparation in the Coliseum'' (1912).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vcrfl.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/sir-lawrence-alma-tadema-preparation-in-the-coliseum-1912/ |title=Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema: Preparation in the Coliseum (1912) &amp;#124; Vivat! Crescat! Floreat! |publisher=Vcrfl.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1912, Alma-Tadema was accompanied by his daughter Anna to Kaiserhof Spa, [[Wiesbaden]], Germany where he was to undergo treatment for ulceration of the stomach.&lt;ref name = " Barrow 194"&gt;Barrow, '' Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; He died there on 28 June 1912 at the age of seventy-six. He was buried in a crypt in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London.&lt;ref name=" Barrow 194"/&gt;

==Style==

An example of Alma-Tadema's contrasting gleaming white marble against a backdrop of dazzling blue Mediterranean sea.&lt;ref name = " Swanson 131"&gt;Swanson, '' Alma-Tadema'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The artist obliterated the middle-ground, and the foreground is abruptly juxtaposed with the distant horizon, creating a dramatic effect.&lt;ref name = " Swanson 54"&gt;Swanson, '' Alma-Tadema'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Alma-Tadema's works are remarkable for the way in which flowers, textures and hard reflecting substances, like metals, pottery, and especially marble, are painted – indeed, his realistic depiction of marble led him to be called the 'marbellous painter'. His work shows much of the fine execution and brilliant colour of the old Dutch masters. By the human interest with which he imbues all his scenes from ancient life he brings them within the scope of modern feeling, and charms us with gentle sentiment and playfulness.

From early in his career, Alma-Tadema was particularly concerned with architectural accuracy, often including objects that he would see at museums – such as the [[British Museum]] in London – in his works. He also read many books and took many images from them. He amassed an enormous number of photographs from ancient sites in Italy, which he used for the most precise accuracy in the details of his compositions.

Alma-Tadema was a perfectionist. He worked assiduously to make the most of his paintings, often repeatedly reworking parts of paintings before he found them satisfactory to his own high standards. One humorous story relates that one of his paintings was rejected and instead of keeping it, he gave the canvas to a maid who used it as her table cover. He was sensitive to every detail and architectural line of his paintings, as well as the settings he was depicting. For many of the objects in his paintings, he would depict what was in front of him, using fresh flowers imported from across the continent and even from Africa, rushing to finish the paintings before the flowers died. It was this commitment to veracity that earned him recognition but also caused many of his adversaries to take up arms against his almost encyclopaedic works.

Alma-Tadema's work has been linked with that of European Symbolist painters.&lt;ref name = " Barrow 192"&gt;Barrow, '' Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; As an artist of international reputation, he can be cited as an influence on European figures such as [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Fernand Khnopff]].&lt;ref name=" Barrow 192"/&gt; Both painters incorporate classical motifs into their works and use Alma-Tadema's unconventional compositional devices such as abrupt cut-off at the edge of the canvas. They, like Alma-Tadema, also employ coded imagery to convey meaning to their paintings.&lt;ref name=" Barrow 192"/&gt;

[[File:An eloquent silence, by Lawrence Alma-Tadema.jpg|thumbnail|''An Eloquent Silence'', 1890]]
Alma-Tadema was among the most financially successful painters of the Victorian era, though never matching [[Edwin Henry Landseer]]. For over sixty years he gave his audience exactly what they wanted: distinctive, elaborate paintings of beautiful people in classical settings. His incredibly detailed reconstructions of ancient Rome, with languid men and women posed against white marble in dazzling sunlight provided his audience with a glimpse of a world of the kind they might one day construct for themselves at least in attitude if not in detail. As with other painters, the reproduction rights for prints were often worth more than the canvas, and a painting with its rights still attached may have been sold to Gambart for £10,000 in 1874; without rights it was sold again in 1903, when Alma-Tadema's prices were actually higher, for £2,625. Typical prices were between £2,000 and £3,000 in the 1880s, but at least three works sold for between £5,250 and £6,060 in the 1900s. Prices held well until the general collapse of Victorian prices in the early 1920s, when they fell to the hundreds, where they remained until the 1960s; by 1969 £4,600 had been reached again (the huge effect of inflation must of course be remembered for all these figures).&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 243–244, also Vol III, 31–32 for 1960s&lt;/ref&gt;

The last years of Alma-Tadema's life saw the rise of [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], of which he heartily disapproved. As his pupil [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]] wrote, 'it is impossible to reconcile the art of Alma-Tadema with that of [[Matisse]], [[Gauguin]] and [[Picasso]].'&lt;ref name = " Swanson 43"&gt;Swanson, '' Alma-Tadema'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

His artistic legacy almost vanished. As attitudes of the public in general and the artists in particular became more sceptical of the possibilities of human achievement, his paintings were increasingly denounced. He was declared "the worst painter of the 19th century" by [[John Ruskin]], and one critic even remarked that his paintings were "about worthy enough to adorn bourbon boxes." After this brief period of being actively derided, he was consigned to relative obscurity for many years. Only since the 1960s has Alma-Tadema's work been re-evaluated for its importance within the nineteenth century, and more specifically, within the evolution of English art.

He is now regarded{{bywhom|date=January 2017}} as one of the principal classical-subject painters of the nineteenth century whose works demonstrate the care and exactitude of an era mesmerised by trying to visualise the past, some of which was being recovered through archaeological research.

Alma-Tadema's meticulous archaeological research, including research into Roman architecture (which was so thorough that every building featured in his canvases could have been built using Roman tools and methods) led to his paintings being used as source material by Hollywood directors in their vision of the ancient world for films such as [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben Hur]]'' (1926),'' [[Cleopatra]]'' (1934), and most notably of all, [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s epic remake of ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956).&lt;ref name=" Swanson 43"/&gt; Indeed, [[Jesse Lasky Jr.]], the co-writer on ''The Ten Commandments'', described how the director would customarily spread out prints of Alma-Tadema paintings to indicate to his set designers the look he wanted to achieve. The designers of the Oscar-winning Roman epic ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' used the paintings of Alma-Tadema as a central source of inspiration.&lt;ref name = " Barrow 197"&gt;Barrow, '' Lawrence Alma-Tadema'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Alma-Tadema's paintings were also the inspiration for the design of the interior of Cair Paravel castle in the 2005 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Andrew Adamson]]|title=The Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe &lt;nowiki&gt;[Crew Commentary]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|medium=DVD|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, New York art dealer [[Robert Isaacson]] mounted the first show of Alma-Tadema's work in fifty years;&lt;ref name="Isaacson"&gt;''An Exhibition to Commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Death of Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 1836–1912''.

After Funt was robbed by his accountant (who subsequently committed suicide), he was forced to sell his collection at Sotheby's in London in November 1973.&lt;ref name = " Swanson 59"&gt;Swanson, ''Alma-Tadema'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; From this sale, the interest in Alma-Tadema was re-awakened.{{citation needed|date = January 2016}}

In 1960, the Newman Gallery firstly tried to sell, then give away (without success) one of his most celebrated works, ''[[The Finding of Moses (Alma-Tadema painting)|The Finding of Moses]]'' (1904). The initial purchaser had paid £5,250 for it on its completion, and subsequent sales were for £861 in 1935, £265 in 1942, and it was "bought in" at £252 in 1960 (having failed to meet its reserve),&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 243–244&lt;/ref&gt; but when the same picture was auctioned at Christies in New York in May 1995, it sold for £1.75 million. On 4 November 2010 it was sold for $35,922,500 to an undisclosed bidder at [[Sotheby's]] New York, a new record for the artist and a Victorian painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?sale_number=N08673&amp;live_lot_id=56|title=Sotheby's – Page Not Found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May 2011 his ''The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra: 41 BC'' was sold at the same auction house for $29.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/ecatalogue/fhtml/index.jsp?event_id=30495#/r=index-fhtml.jsp?event_id=30495%7cr.main=lot.jsp?event_id=30495&amp;id=65|title=Sotheby's – Page Not Found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: آرامگاه عمر خیام ) is a modern monument of white marble erected over [[Omar Khayyam]]'s tomb located in [[Omar Khayyam Square]], [[Nishapur]].

==History==
[[File:WILLIAM SIMPSON, FRGS RI (1823-1899).jpg|thumb|200px|The Tomb of Omar Khayyam in 1886 depicted by [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]]. Prior to the construction of the monument, it can be seen next to the mosque which it adjoins.]]

Omar Khayyam died on 4 December 1131. The earliest account of Omar's final resting place is provided by his pupil [[Nizami Aruzi]] who visited his tomb in 1135-6. In [[Balkh]], in 1112-13, Nizami heard Omar make a prophecy about his place of burial, that his grave "would be where flowers in the springtime would shed their petals over his dust". He describes visiting his grave in what was then the ''cemetery of Hayrah'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;[his prophecy] seemed to me impossible, though I knew that one such as he would not speak idle words. When I arrived at Nishapur in the year A.H. 530, it being then four years since that great man had veiled his countenance in the dust, and this nether world had been bereaved of him. Since he was my master, on the eve of a Friday, with a companion, I went to visit his grave in the Hayrah Cemetery, I turned left and saw a grave situated at the foot of a garden-wall, over which pear-trees and peach-trees thrust their heads, and on his grave had fallen so many flower-leaves that his dust was hidden beneath the flowers. This reminded me of the conversation I had heard from him in the city of Balkh, I wept, for in the four corners of the world I had seen no one like him.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran"&gt;The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4. Cambridge University Press (1975): Richard Nelson Frye&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|661}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The tomb itself survived various calamities; including several major earthquakes (Nishapur being on a seismic fault-line)&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom"&gt;Mehdi Aminrazavi, ''The Wine of Wisdom: The Life, Poetry and Philosophy of Omar Khayyam'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}}, raids by some Turkic tribes, and the [[Mongol_conquest_of_Khwarezmia#Nishapur|Mongol invasion]].&lt;ref name = "Sarton"&gt;''The Tomb of Omar Khayyâm'', George Sarton, '''Isis''', Vol. 29, No. 1 (Jul., 1938), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

In the succeeding centuries, Omar's grave had become a part of the mosque containing the shrine of a certain Islamic saint called ''[[Imamzadeh]] Muhammad Mahruk'' (d. eighth century), the brother of [[Ali_al-Ridha|Reza]]. The mosque had a turquoise dome and was likely erected in the seventeenth century. Some pilgrims to Omar's grave, such as the Iranologist [[A. V. Williams Jackson]] who visited his tomb in 1911, described his tomb as a simple case made of brick and cement with no inscription.&lt;ref name="Sarton" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The reconstruction of the mausoleum was commissioned by the Iranian government in 1934 during [[Ferdowsi]]'s millenary.&lt;ref name="Sarton" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Omar's tomb was separated from the mosque, and a white marble monument, designed by the architect [[Hooshang Seyhoun]], was erected over it. The construction was completed in 1963.

==Plot==
Oscar Ramirez is a rice farmer who lives in [[Banaue|Banaue Province]] with his wife Mai and their children Angel and Baby. When his rice crops are no longer profitable, he relocates his family to [[Metro Manila]] in hopes of obtaining a higher quality of life. While searching for a job, they are offered shelter at a low-income apartment building, but are shortly evicted by the police for [[squatting]], as the men who offered them the apartment turn out to be swindlers.

The next day, the family moves into a vacated house in the slums of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] while Oscar secures a job as a security officer for Manila Armored Couriers after the other guards discover his military background. He befriends his senior officer Ong and quickly bonds with his co-workers while earning the respect of Buddha, the president of the armoured truck company. On Oscar's first day at work, Ong tells him he lost his previous partner during a failed robbery six months prior. Ong is also concerned about Oscar's residence in Tondo, which is a hotbed for criminals. One night, Oscar tells Ong the story of Alfred Santos, a man who held up an airliner and jumped off the plane to his death after losing his father and his family's silk factory to a rival company. Oscar feels responsible, as he had previously worked at the factory and did not stand up for his former employer. Ong offers Oscar a spare apartment unit in [[Makati]] for his family to live in. Meanwhile, Mai lands a job as a bar hostess at a nightclub in Makati. While undergoing the mandatory physical checkup, she is revealed to be pregnant. Mai quickly learns of the hardships she must endure as a bar hostess. When she fails to make her drink quota and her pregnancy becomes more evident, her boss proposes to have nine-year-old Angel work for special clients.

During a routine job, Oscar discovers that the client is a drug dealer and sees Ong take a handout for the delivery. The duo have a tense discussion on the corruption that shrouds Metro Manila. When Ong pulls over to find a wall to urinate on, Oscar suddenly sees a black [[Honda Civic (sixth generation)|Honda Civic]] pull over with a group of men headed toward Ong's direction. Going against his protocol, he exits the armoured van and follows the gang on foot, only to discover that they are in cahoots with Ong. After the gang leaves, Ong reveals to Oscar that after the failed robbery, he took one of the security boxes with him, and he is plotting with the gang to have the box opened by staging a robbery and having himself "debriefed" in the company's processing centre while Oscar makes an imprint of the key in another room. He also threatens to blackmail Oscar with the truth about his wife working as a bar hostess, as well as the clever scheme of renting out the spare apartment under Oscar's name and hiding the box there. Just as Ong prepares to surrender the box, he realizes that the robber in front of him is not part of the gang but the same man who killed his former partner. The man guns him down and runs away while the gang speeds off. Oscar is then given the grievous task of "postman", having to deliver Ong's personal effects and severance pay to his wife. He does not disclose Ong's plot to Buddha. As per company procedure, his pay is suspended until the investigation is closed.

Upon learning that Ong's wife is aware of the security box, Oscar races back home and finds it under the floor. He and Mai face the dilemma of what to do with the box as she tells him it was a mistake for them to move to the city. One night, after a job, Oscar sneaks into the processing centre and takes an imprint of the key while stealing another one, but is quickly caught on security camera by Buddha and immediately cornered. He is shot in the chest and dies with the key in his hand. Misled by the different key Oscar stole, the company rushes armed men to the address of the drug dealer client while JJ, Oscar's new partner, becomes the "postman" to deliver Oscar's personal effects to Mai. She notices a locket that Oscar had stolen from a shop earlier that morning; upon opening it, she discovers a clay imprint of the key to the security box in her possession. After having the key duplicated, she takes her children and the money back to the province.

==Production==
Director Sean Ellis took inspiration from his first trip to the Philippines when he witnessed two armoured truck drivers arguing with each other &lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/16/metro-manila-sean-ellis |title=Metro Manila's Sean Ellis: 'You don't need to know what an actor is saying' |author=Wise, Damon |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2013-09-16 |accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot on location in the Philippines in 2011 with a Filipino cast and crew members. The script was written in English, but Ellis encouraged the cast to interpret their lines in [[Tagalog language | Tagalog]]. Ellis used a [[Canon EOS 5D]] [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR]] camera to capture the footage.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

The story of Alfred Santos is based on the [[Philippine Airlines Flight 812]] hijacking on 25 May 2000.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0005/26/i_wn.05.html|title=Philippine Hijacker Found Buried In Mud|date=2000-05-26|accessdate=2018-11-16|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Metro Manila'' had its International premiere at the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13049/metro_manila|title=Metro Manila|publisher=Sundance Organization|date=2013-02-20|accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 20 January 2013. It was also released on 17 July 2013 in France, 28 August 2013 in Belgium, 29 August 2013 in the Netherlands, and 20 September 2013 in the UK. It had its Philippine premiere on 9 October 2013.

The film was re-released with special screenings to raise money for the victims of [[Typhoon Haiyan]]/Yolanda that had hit the Philippines and killed close to 6000 people. Ellis said: "The people of the Philippines were tremendously supportive during the making of Metro Manila, and it's only right that we should now use the film to raise money to help the victims of this terrible disaster."

==Critical reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] lists a rating of 94% based on 31 reviews as of May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/metro_manila/|title=''Metro Manila'' |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]/[[Flixster]] |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning the Hamburg Film Critic Award at the 2013 [[Filmfest Hamburg]], the jury said of the film: "The themes of our times are what define this film: rural exodus and impoverishment, exploitation and poverty in the Moloch of overcrowded metropolises. Director Sean Ellis filmed this story in a language that is foreign to him - and yet still always manages to hit the right tone. He is emotional, yet never impassioned; poetic, yet never tawdry; raw without any hint of cynicism. A social drama that becomes a thriller, breathless and unstoppable. "Metro Manila" deserves to be seen by many. This film belongs in the cinema. ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfesthamburg.de/en/presse/2013/2013.10.05_Preise.php|title=Hamburg Film Critic Award|publisher=Filmfest Hamburg|date=2013-09-25|accessdate=2014-09-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403092954/http://www.filmfesthamburg.de/en/presse/2013/2013.10.05_Preise.php|archivedate=3 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar''' was a [[Half dollar (United States coin)|fifty-cent piece]] struck by the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]]. Bearing portraits of former U.S. Presidents [[James Monroe]] and [[John Quincy Adams]], the coin was issued in commemoration of the centennial of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] and was produced at the [[San Francisco Mint]] in 1923. Sculptor [[Chester Beach]] is credited with the design, although the [[obverse and reverse|reverse]] closely resembles an earlier work by [[Raphael Beck (artist)|Raphael Beck]].

In 1922, the motion picture industry was faced with a number of scandals, including manslaughter charges against star [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]]. Although Arbuckle was eventually acquitted, motion picture executives sought ways of getting good publicity for Hollywood. One means was an exposition, to be held in Los Angeles in mid-1923. To induce Congress to issue a commemorative coin as a fundraiser for the fair, organizers associated the exposition with the 100th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, and legislation for a commemorative half dollar for the centennial was passed.

The exposition was a financial failure. The coins did not sell well, and the bulk of the mintage of over 270,000 was released into circulation. Beach faced accusations of plagiarism because of the similarity of the reverse design to a work by Beck, though he and fellow sculptor [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]] denied any impropriety. Many of the pieces that had been sold at a premium and saved were spent during [[Great Depression|the Depression]]; most surviving coins show evidence of wear.

== Background ==
{{main|Monroe Doctrine}}

In the early 1820s, the United States deemed two matters untoward interference by European powers in its zone of influence.  The first was the Russian [[Ukase of 1821]], asserting exclusive territorial and trading rights along much of what is today Canada's Pacific coast.  The United States considered this area to be part of the [[Oregon Country]] and hoped to eventually gain control of it.  The second was possible European threats against the [[Latin America]]n nations, newly independent from Spain.   United States officials feared that a [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]] of Prussia, Austria, Russia, and France would restore Spain to power in the Americas.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=55–56}}

[[File:James Monroe White House portrait 1819.jpg|thumb|left|upright|President [[James Monroe]]]]
[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British foreign minister]] [[George Canning]] was concerned that in the event of a Spanish restoration in Latin America, his nation would lose the trade which it had gained there since the Spanish had been ousted.  In 1823, he proposed to the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American minister to Great Britain]], [[Richard Rush]], that their two nations issue a joint statement against the retaking of the former Spanish colonies by force.  Rush asked for instructions from President [[James Monroe]]. The President consulted with his predecessors, [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], who favored the joint statement, as an alliance with Britain would protect the United States.  Nevertheless, Monroe's [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], future president [[John Quincy Adams]], felt that if the United States was going to set forth its principles, it should speak for itself and not seem to be following the lead of powerful Britain.  Accordingly, Rush was instructed to decline the opportunity to enter into a joint statement, although he was to inform the British that the two nations agreed on most issues.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=56}}

The policy which would, some 30&amp;nbsp;years later, come to be called the "Monroe Doctrine" was contained in the President's [[State of the Union|annual message to Congress]] on December&amp;nbsp;2, 1823.  It warned European nations against new colonial ventures in the Americas, and against interference with Western Hemisphere governments.  The doctrine had little practical effect at the time, as the United States lacked the ability to enforce it militarily and most European powers ignored it, considering it beneath their dignity even to respond.  When Britain and other powers seized additional land in [[the Guianas]] in the 1830s, the United States did not issue a formal protest.  The [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–1848 increased Latin American suspicions over the doctrine, as many south of the border felt that the American purpose in warning European powers to keep out was to reserve the land for itself.  Nevertheless, the Monroe Doctrine became an important part of United States foreign policy in the second half of the 19th and into the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=55–57}}

== Inception ==

[[File:Mabelnormandportrait.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A scandal involving actress [[Mabel Normand]] was one event which led to the issuance of the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar.]]
By 1922, the Hollywood film industry was in serious trouble. Established in the Los Angeles area during the 1910s after moving from such eastern venues as [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], the industry had been rocked by a number of scandals.  These included the mysterious shooting death of film director [[William Desmond Taylor]], and the subsequent evasive testimony concerning it by actress [[Mabel Normand]], which helped destroy her career. Another notorious scandal of the early 1920s was the death of actress [[Virginia Rappe]] following an orgy at a San Francisco hotel.  Actor [[Fatty Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]] was, after three trials, acquitted of manslaughter, but the negative publicity ended his career as well.  These scandals, together with the death of romantic lead [[Wallace Reid]] from a drug overdose and a number of instances of onscreen sexual explicitness, led to nationwide calls for a boycott of Hollywood films.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 35}}{{sfn|Cregan|pp=24–25}}

Film moguls sought means of damage control.  They hired former [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Will H. Hays]] as censor to the industry; the [[Hays Code]] would govern how explicit a motion picture could be for decades to come. Another idea was an exposition and film festival to give good publicity to the industry, with the profits to be used for the making of educational films.{{sfn|Cregan|p=25}}  Planning for this fair, to be held in Los Angeles in mid-1923, began in 1922. As other fairs, such as the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] and the [[Panama–Pacific Exposition]], had procured the issuance of commemorative coins as a fundraiser, organizers sought a piece for the film fair.{{sfn|Pike|p=48}}{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=166}} The city of Los Angeles wanted to use the fair to show it had come of age, as had Chicago for the Columbian Exposition and San Francisco with the Panama-Pacific event.{{sfn|Garofalo|p=36}}

Realizing that Congress might not pass legislation for a coin to commemorate a film industry celebration, the organizers sought a historical event with a major anniversary to occur in 1923, which could be honored both at the fair and on the coin.  The obvious candidate was the [[Boston Tea Party]] of 1773, but according to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]] in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, that episode "could not be tortured into even the vaguest relevance to California, let alone to Los Angeles".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=166}} On December&amp;nbsp;18, 1922, California Congressman [[Walter Franklin Lineberger]] introduced a bill to strike a half dollar in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine, with the Los Angeles Clearing House (an association of banks){{efn|Swiatek and Breen suggest that the Clearing House was designated as the sponsoring organization to make the issue appear less connected with the controversial movie industry. See {{harvnb|Swiatek &amp; Breen|pp=166–167}}}} given the exclusive right to purchase the pieces from the government at face value.  Lineberger claimed that Monroe's declaration had kept California, then owned by Mexico, out of the hands of European powers.  The bill was questioned in the House of Representatives by Michigan Congressman [[Louis Cramton]], and in the Senate by Vermont's [[Frank L. Greene|Frank Greene]], who stated, "it seems to me that the question is not one of selling a coin at a particular value or a particular place. The question is whether the United States government is going to go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry."{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 35}} Despite these objections, the bill was enacted on January&amp;nbsp;24, 1923; a mintage of 300,000&amp;nbsp;pieces was authorized.{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 35}}

== Preparation ==

[[File:Chester Beach.jpg|thumb|upright|Chester Beach in 1910]]
The fair organizers did not await congressional approval to begin planning the coin.  According to Swiatek and Breen, the fair's director general Frank B. Davison came up with the concept for the designs. On December&amp;nbsp;7, 1922, [[Commission of Fine Arts]] chairman [[Charles Moore (Commission of Fine Arts)|Charles Moore]] wrote to [[Buffalo nickel]] designer and sculptor member of the commission [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], "The Los Angeles people are planning to celebrate the Monroe Doctrine Centennial.  They are going to have a 50-cent piece and have decided that on the obverse shall be the heads of President Monroe and John Quincy Adams&amp;nbsp;... On the reverse will be the western continents from Hudson Bay to Cape Horn with some dots for the West Indies and some indication of the Panama Canal&amp;nbsp;... It strikes me that the designs having been settled upon, the [plaster] models could be worked out quite readily and that a pretty swell thing could be made."{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=167}}{{sfn|Taxay|pp=62–63}}

Fraser contacted fellow New York sculptor [[Chester Beach]], who agreed to do the work.  On December&amp;nbsp;27, Moore wrote to Davison, informing him of Beach's hiring, and that Fraser and Beach had decided to change the reverse.  Moore quoted Beach's description of the revised design:

{{quote |
Map of North and South America.  North America is in the form of a draped figure, with the laurel of Peace [an olive branch], reaching to South America, also a draped figure carrying a Horn of Plenty.  Their hands to touch at the Panama Canal.  The West Indies are indicated.  The current of the oceans are lightly shown.  Between the dates 1823–1923 are a scroll and a quill pen, symbolizing the "Treaty".{{efn|Likely the message to Congress in which Monroe set forth his policy}}{{sfn|Taxay|p=63}}
}}

Moore informed Davison that the commission had concurred with the revision, and that Beach had been instructed to complete work as quickly as possible so as to have the coins available at an early date.{{sfn|Taxay|p=63}} On February&amp;nbsp;24, 1923, commission secretary Hans Caemmerer showed the completed models to Assistant Director of the Mint [[Mary Margaret O'Reilly]], who was pleased with them.  O'Reilly suggested that if Beach was certain there would be no further changes, that he send photographs of the models to the commission's offices, to be forwarded with its endorsement to the Bureau of the Mint in Washington.  This was done, and the designs were approved by both Mint Director [[Frank Edgar Scobey]] and Secretary of the Treasury [[Andrew Mellon]] on March&amp;nbsp;8.  Moore was enthusiastic about the designs, writing to Davison on March&amp;nbsp;21 that "I feel great exultation over the way the model&amp;nbsp;... has turned out&amp;nbsp;... I do not know of a memorial [commemorative] coin which for sheer beauty equals this&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Taxay|pp=67–68}}

== Design ==

William E. Pike, in his 2003 article in ''[[The Numismatist]]'' about the coin, deems the design "uninspired" and complains that the low relief of the coin leaves it without sufficient detail.{{sfn|Pike|p=48}}  Coin dealer and numismatic historian [[Q. David Bowers]] states that because of the shallow relief, "newly minted coins had an insipid appearance.  Few if any observers called them attractive."{{sfn|Bowers|p=73}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]] also complained about the relief, stating that it made the allegorical figures on the reverse "seem like mounted cut-outs&amp;nbsp;... the way the females are contoured to achieve their appearance of continents is a clever tour de force of calligraphic relief but an aesthetic monstrosity, a bad pun in art."{{sfn|Vermeule|p=165}} He had no more praise for the obverse, "Adams, with his staring eye, is scarcely a portrait, and Monroe would not be recognized even by an expert."{{sfn|Vermeule|p=165}}

[[File:Becklogo.jpg|thumb|left|Seal of the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]].  Its designer, [[Raphael Beck (artist)|Raphael Beck]], considered Beach to have plagiarized his work.]]
The faint lines in the field around the continents represent various ocean currents, with the [[Gulf Stream]] to the upper right of the reverse.  Swiatek and Breen speculate that the reason ocean currents were shown was to symbolize the trade routes between the continents.  They also consider the design to have an [[Art Deco]] look, though noting that the lettering has more of an older, [[Art Nouveau]] appearance.  Beach's [[monogram]], CB made into a circle, is found at lower right of the reverse.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=166}}

On July&amp;nbsp;23, 1923, [[Raphael Beck (artist)|Raphael Beck]], who had designed the seal for the 1901&amp;nbsp;[[Pan-American Exposition]], wrote to Mint Director Scobey to complain that the reverse design resembled his seal, which he had copyrighted in 1899, and that Beach should be given no further credit for it. The letter was forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts for comment. In October, Fraser wrote to Beck, stating that he had suggested to Beach that he use figures to represent the continents instead of maps, and that he had never seen the Pan-American seal until Scobey forwarded the letter.{{sfn|Taxay|p=68}} According to Bowers, "A comparison of the 1901 and 1923 designs, however, shows that this was highly unlikely."{{sfn|Bowers|p=73}}

== Distribution and collecting ==

In May and June 1923, 274,077 of the new half dollars were struck at the [[San Francisco Mint]].  Most of these were sent to the Los Angeles Clearing House,{{sfn|Bowers|p=73}} though 77&amp;nbsp;pieces were set aside for transmission to Philadelphia and examination by the 1924 [[United States Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 37}}

[[File:Expo model.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the exposition; the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] shown at center]]
The American Historical Revue and Motion Picture Industry Exposition was open from July&amp;nbsp;2 to August&amp;nbsp;4, 1923.  The fair was located off of Figueroa Street in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]], just to the east of the brand-new [[Los Angeles Coliseum]], where every evening a complimentary show for exposition visitors, "Montezuma and the Fall of the Aztecs", was given.  Admission to the fair was fifty cents, though fairgoers could purchase a coin for a dollar at the box office and enter without further charge.  After the first week, organizers realized the public was not interested in the historical theme, but was there to see favorite movie stars. Exhibitors accordingly greatly expanded the space devoted to movie attractions, but the exposition was a financial failure. Those in charge of the fair had hoped to attract a million visitors; the actual attendance was about 300,000, many of whom were teenagers given complimentary admission in the final two weeks of the fair.{{sfn|Cregan|pp=25–26}}{{sfn|Swiatek|p=142}}{{sfn|Garofalo|p=40}} With the fair flirting with insolvency throughout its run, officials hoped the planned visit of President [[Warren Harding]] on August 6 would increase gate receipts, but Harding fell ill in San Francisco and died on August 2.{{sfn|Garofalo|p=40}} According to Pike in his article, "its effect on the industry [was] hard to measure.  However, if Hollywood owes its current status in any way to the event, then it was quite a success indeed."{{sfn|Pike|p=48}}

Approximately 27,000&amp;nbsp;half dollars were sold at the price of $1, by mail, at banks, and at the fair.  Sales continued after it closed, but by October 1923, they had dropped off to almost nothing, and the banks holding them released the remaining nine-tenths of the mintage into circulation, which accounts for the wear on most surviving specimens.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=142}} Of those set aside, thousands more were spent during [[Great Depression|the Depression]].{{sfn|Bowers ''Encyclopedia'', Part 36}} The 2015 edition of ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'' lists it at $75 in [[uncirculated MS-60]].{{sfn|Yeoman|p=292}}  Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, notes that many specimens have been treated to make them appear brighter or less worn; these, like other circulated pieces, are worth less.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=143}}  An exceptional specimen, certified in MS-67 condition, sold at auction for $29,900 in 2009.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=144}}

'''''Music''''' (''La Musique'') is a wall-size painting made by [[Henri Matisse]] in 1910. The painting was commissioned by [[Sergei Shchukin]], who hung it with ''[[Dance (Matisse)|Dance]]'' on the staircase of his Moscow mansion. Matisse made the painting without any preparatory sketches, and thus the painting bears many traces of modifications. One can virtually trace the steps Matisse took to find the intended effect. Like in ''Dance'', the aim was to show man's attainment of a state of completeness by immersion in creativity. The painting is now in the collection of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;State Hermitage Museum - [http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/fcgi-bin/db2www/descrPage.mac/descrPage?selLang=English&amp;indexClass=PICTURE_EN&amp;PID=GJ-9674&amp;numView=1&amp;ID_NUM=11&amp;thumbFile=/tmplobs/XUXNV409V_403G9_23HX6.jpg&amp;embViewVer=&amp;comeFrom=quick&amp;sorting=no&amp;thumbId=6&amp;numResults=64&amp;tmCond=matisse&amp;searchIndex=TAGFILEN&amp;author=Matisse,%26%2332;Henri Music  ]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Neue Bachgesellschaft''', or New Bach Society, is an organisation based in [[Leipzig]], Germany, devoted to the music of the composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].  It was founded in 1900 as the successor to the [[Bach Gesellschaft]], which between 1850 and 1900 produced a complete edition of Bach's works, publishing many pieces for the first time. On completion of these collected works (the ''Bach-Ausgabe''), the original Society dissolved itself.

The new Society approved three enduring projects: 
* the annual edition of a ''Bach-Jahrbuch'' (Bach yearbook)&lt;ref name="Bach Archive"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bach-leipzig.de/index.php?id=173&amp;L=1 | title=Bach Jahrbuch | publisher=[[Bach-Archiv Leipzig|Bach Archive Leipzig]] | accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* biannual (today: annual) ''Bachfeste'' (Bach festivals). The venues of the Bachfest have mainly been in Germany, but the 2012 Festival had an international dimension, being held in [[Görlitz]]-[[Zgorzelec]] on the [[German-Polish border]].
* the founding of a Bach museum. In 1907 the Society opened the first museum dedicated to Bach at [[Eisenach]], the town where he was born. This [[Bachhaus Eisenach|Bachhaus]] is managed by the ''Bachhaus Eisenach gemeinnützige GmbH'', a registered charitable company, with the New Bach Society as its sole associate.

The Society has not been directly involved in publishing scores in the way that its predecessor was.  However, in 1950 it recommended that the second complete edition of Bach's music be undertaken, the [[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]] (NBA, in English: New Bach Edition). The project was a joint venture of musicologists in Göttingen, then [[West Germany]], and Leipzig, then [[East Germany]], in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was undivisible.

'''Pedro Américo de Figueiredo e Melo''' (29 April 1843 – 7 October 1905) was a Brazilian [[novelist]], [[poet]], [[scientist]], [[artist|art theorist]], [[essayist]], [[philosopher]], [[politician]] and [[professor]], but is best remembered as one of the most important [[academic art|academic]] [[Painting|painter]]s of [[Brazil]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Americo-noite.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Night escorted by the geniuses of Love and Study'']]
He moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1854, where he was granted a scholarship to study in the [[Academia Imperial de Belas Artes]] (Imperial Academy of Fine Arts). Later he furthered his studies in [[Europe]], at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]], being a pupil of [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], [[Hippolyte Flandrin]] and [[Antoine Charles Horace Vernet|Carle-Horace Vernet]], winning much praise for his paintings, and achieving the Doctorate in Sciences at the [[University of Brussels]], in 1868.

Returning to Brazil, he produced one of the most well known works of art in Brazil: ''[[Independence or Death (painting)|Independence or Death!]],'' depicting the moment when [[Peter I of Brazil|Prince Peter]] declared the country independent from [[Portugal]], a work that has illustrated [[History]] books for elementary schools in Brazil for decades.

Living mostly in Florence, Italy but traveling extensively back and forth from Rio de Janeiro, Pedro Américo managed to work also as  a lecturer and an art historian.

He married [[Carlota de Araújo Porto-alegre]] (1844–1918), daughter of painter and diplomat [[Manuel de Araújo Porto-alegre]], and they had children. Knighted by the German Crown he was also Great Knight of the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]]. With the proclamation of the Republic in Brazil in 1889, he was elected a deputy of the National Assembly.

The '''Poolewe Stone''' is a Class-I [[Pictish stone]] discovered in 1992 in the cemetery at [[Poolewe]] (Poll Iùbh) in [[Wester Ross]]. The stone carries the common Pictish depictions of a [[Crescent (Pictish symbol)|crescent and v-rod]]. Chiseled inside the crescent are some hollows and two spirals meeting to form a [[pelta]]. Today the stone lies in the church yard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21819">'''The psychology of film''' is a sub-field of the [[psychology of art]] that studies the characteristics of [[film]] and its production in relation to [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[narrative]] understanding, and [[emotion]]. A growing number of psychological scientists and brain scientists have begun conducting empirical studies that describe the cognitive and biological underpinnings of motion pictures or what has been called "psychocinematics".&lt;ref name=Shimamura&gt;{{cite book|last=Shimamura|first=Arthur P. (Editor)|title=Psychocinematics: Exploring Cognition at the Movies|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early theoretical approaches included works by psychologists [[Hugo Münsterberg]]&lt;ref name="Münsterberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Münsterberg|first=Hugo|title=The Photoplay. A psychological study|year=1916|publisher= Appleton.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rudolf Arnheim]].&lt;ref name=Arnheim&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolf|title=Film as Art: 50th Anniversary Printing|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive film theorists [[David Bordwell]] and [[Noël Carroll]] fostered its philosophical underpinnings.

==Sensory Features==
Film is rather unusual as it involves an integration of visual and auditory stimuli. In [[Fictional film|narrative films]], plots are guided by camera placement and movement, dialogue, sound effects, and editing. Some aspects of film are driven by bottom-up or sensory guided factors (such as light, motion or sound), whereas other aspects depend more on top-down or conceptually driven factors, like past experiences and internal motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Whan|author2=Daniel C. Smith |title=Product Level Choice: A Top-Down or Bottom-Up Process?|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=December 1989|volume=16|issue=3|pages=289–299|doi=10.1086/209215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editing===

Cuts and flashbacks represent types of editing that alter the normal temporal sequencing of events, creating non-linear narrative structures. Editing creates the transition between events. Research focusing on recall ability for linear versus non-linear narratives suggests that temporal changes impact memory of events, but not comprehension.&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowe|first=Phillip J.|author2=Durkin, Kevin |title=The effect of flashback on children's understanding of television crime content|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=1 January 1999|volume=43|issue=1|pages=83–97|doi=10.1080/08838159909364476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film cuts are instantaneous, perceptual, and sometimes temporal discontinuities that do not exist in our own realities. However, despite this, viewers accept cuts as a natural storytelling technique in film. Even though we see reality in a continuous flow of linked images, in movies, cuts seem to work, regardless of how experienced a viewer is. [[Walter Murch]] suggests that this is because viewers are in fact used to cuts in their everyday lives through the act of [[blinking]]. When you turn to look at an object, for example, you normally blink, thus creating a visual break in continuity between what you ''were'' looking at and what you are now looking at. Another possibility that Murch explores to explain humans’ innate acceptance of film cuts is the way in which we [[dream]]. Our dreams tend to jump around from place to place and situation to situation without any real sense of continuity. Thus the [[Oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]] nature of [[film]]s is familiar to viewers and allows them to innately understand the [[editing]] despite discontinuities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33334569|title=In the blink of an eye : a perspective on film editing|last=1943-|first=Murch, Walter,|date=1995|publisher=Silman-James Press|isbn=9781879505230|edition= 1st |location=Los Angeles|oclc=33334569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwan &amp; Ildirar (2010), who focused solely on inexperienced viewers’ ability to comprehend film, found that the comprehensibility of films was determined by whether or not they followed a familiar line of action. Overall, our brains accept the perceptual discontinuities found in films, but it is ultimately easier for viewers, regardless of their experience, to understand cuts that follow a continuous and familiar line of action as opposed to ones that are more discontinuous. When a familiar line is not present, more experienced viewers are significantly better at comprehending a complex narrative by “filtering” out editing discontinuities.&lt;ref name="schwan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwan|first=S.|author2=Ildirar, S.|date=7 June 2010|title=Watching Film for the First Time: How Adult Viewers Interpret Perceptual Discontinuities in Film|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=7|pages=970–976|doi=10.1177/0956797610372632|pmid=20530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, however, [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] linearity that creates temporal continuity is more important than [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] for recall and understanding of a [[Narrative structure|narrative’s]] events.[[Psychology of film#cite note-cowen-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Sequence of events===

[[Cognitive neuroscience]] research demonstrates that some movies can exert considerable control over brain activity and eye movements. Studying the neuroscience of film is based on the hypothesis that some films, or film segments, lead viewers through a similar sequence of perceptual, emotional and cognitive states. Using [[fMRI]] brain imaging, researchers asked participants to watch 30 minutes of [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]] (1966) as they lay on their backs in the MRI scanner. Despite the seemingly uncontrolled task and complex nature of the stimulus, brain activity was similar across viewers’ brains, particularly in spatiotemporal areas. When compared to a random sequence of scenes, the specific order of events seemed to be strongly associated with this similarity in brain activity. It was also determined that the level of control a movie has on someone’s mental state is highly dependent upon the cinematic devices (pans, cuts and close-ups) it contains. Tightly edited films exert more control on brain activity and eye-movement than open-ended films. However, similar eye-movement and similarity in visual processing does not guarantee similar brain responses.&lt;ref name=hasson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hasson|first=Uri|author2=Landesman, Ohad |author3=Knappmeyer, Barbara |author4=Vallines, Ignacio |author5=Rubin, Nava |author6= Heeger, David J. |title=Neurocinematics: The Neuroscience of Film|journal=Projections|date=30 August 2008|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.3167/proj.2008.020102|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.2650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the average correlation in taste between individual viewers is rather low and not well predicted by film critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.3167/proj.2017.110107|title = Strikingly Low Agreement in the Appraisal of Motion Pictures|journal = Projections|volume = 11|year = 2017|last1 = Wallisch|first1 = Pascal|last2 = Alden Whritner|first2 = Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spatial Information===

Viewing spaces on screen from a stable point of view is important for short-term spatial coding and long term spatial memory. Long-time viewers of the television show ''[[Friends]]'' were significantly better at accurately recalling spatial information about the show's set, because the camera never moves away from the "[[fourth wall]]". Equally experienced viewers of the show "[[ER (TV series)|E.R.]]" were less likely to recall information about the set and be able to mentally orient themselves inside it, because the show is filmed from many different angles.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Daniel T.|author2=Wang, Caryn |title=Spatial Representation in Cognitive Science and Film|journal=Projections|date=1 June 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24–52|doi=10.3167/proj.2009.030103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study,&lt;ref name=hirose&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirose|first=Yoriko|title=Perception and memory across viewpoint changes in moving images|journal=Journal of Vision|date=1 January 2010|volume=10|issue=4|pages=1–19|doi=10.1167/10.4.2|pmid=20465322}}&lt;/ref&gt; observers were instructed to look at short movies involving changes in point of view. They used 15 movie clips featuring a handbag, whose properties (color, position, identity, and shape) were manipulated across cuts. Observers' reactions were recorded by examining eye-movement, changes in behavior and memory performance. The researchers later asked the observers if they had noticed anything unusual occur during the clips, without directly referring to the handbag. Changing the position of objects, i.e. the handbag, between scenes was the only variable that did not appear to affect eye-movement or memory. Overall, observers were more likely to draw their attention and look sooner at the handbag-stimulus at the moment right after its properties changed. When specifically asked about it, they were more likely to describe the handbag in terms of its post-cut properties, after a change had occurred. Even though their visual system appeared to pick up on the changes, observers were not consciously aware of them or able to report noticeable differences across cuts. The results illustrate that observers construct and maintain internal visual representations of complex visual environments while viewing dynamic scenes. This also helps explain why movie viewers usually are not aware of continuity errors in editing.&lt;ref name="hirose"/&gt;

===Cinematic techniques===

Cinematic techniques are often regarded as grammatical structures or components of the cinematic art as a language made up of images.&lt;ref name=Messaris94&gt;{{cite book|last=Messaris|first=Paul|title=Visual "Literacy": Image, Mind, Reality|year=1994|publisher=Westview|location=Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A period of visual adaptation is necessary before being able to understand images in movies or on [[television]].  Viewers need sufficient exposure to cinematic techniques and the meanings attributed to them to adequately interpret the images on the screen. At a very young age, we learn how to watch videos and understand different editing techniques. One study looked at adult participants who had very little exposure to film to see if they were able to understand simple editing techniques, such as [[point of view shot]]s, [[establishing shot]]s, [[Panning (camera)|pan shots]], [[Shot reverse shot|shot/reverse shot]], ellipsis of time, and [[cross-cutting]]. These viewers were able to understand some of the techniques, such as ellipses of time; however, more complex techniques, like shot/reverse shot were more difficult for them to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwan|first=Stephan|author2=Sermin Ildirar |title=Watching Film for the First Time: How Adult Viewers Interpret Perceptual Discontinuities in Film|journal=Association for Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=21|issue=7|pages=969–976|doi=10.1177/0956797610372632|pmid=20530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[filmmaking]] techniques derive meaning through past experiences or [[Ideology|ideologies]] that influence the way viewers see certain images or sequence of images. An example of this would be how [[camera angle]]s can affect our perception of what is occurring on screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baranowski|first=Andreas|last2=Hecht|first2=Heiko|date=2017-05-30|title=Effect of Camera Angle on Perception of Trust and Attractiveness|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317237444|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|volume=36|pages=90–100|doi=10.1177/0276237417710762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low angle shots in which the camera is pointed up at a subject tend to make the subject appear more powerful or stronger. While high angle shots can make a subject appear weaker. These interpretations of [[camera angle]]s, however, ultimately derive from the notion that bigger is better. The lateral movement of a subject across the screen can also influence an audience's interpretation of the subject.  For example, characters that move from left-to-right are perceived more positively than characters who move right-to-left. This partiality toward rightward movement likely has its roots in the predominance of right-handedness in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L Egizii|first=Matthew|last2=Denny|first2=James|last3=Neuendorf|first3=Kimberly|last4=D Skalski|first4=Paul|last5=Campbell|first5=Rachel|date=2012-05-01|title=Which Way Did He Go? Directionality of Film Character and Camera Movement and Subsequent Spectator Interpretation|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the practice of reading left-to-right in [[Western Romance languages|Western languages]].

====Changes in film techniques====

One study compiled data on the changing trends in techniques by examining 160 English-language films released from 1935-2010.&lt;ref name=cutting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutting|first=James E|author2=Brunick, Kaitlin L |author3=DeLong, Jordan E |author4=Iricinschi, Catalina |author5= Candan, Ayse |title=Quicker, faster, darker: Changes in Hollywood film over 75 years|journal=I-Perception|date=1 January 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=569–576|doi=10.1068/i0441aap|pmid=23145246|pmc=3485803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cutting" /&gt;  The findings demonstrate that over time shot lengths have become shorter, while the shorter the shot the more motion it is likely to contain. In addition, contemporary films have significantly more motion and movement than older ones. Motion is the optical change created by moving objects, people, and shadows; movement is that change created by camera motion or gradual lens change.
Presumably, the film industry has capitalized on the results of previous psychological research that shows motion and the onset of motion capture our attention.&lt;ref name=hillstrom&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillstrom|first=Anne P.|author2=Yantis, Steven |title=Visual motion and attentional capture|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=1 July 1994|volume=55|issue=4|pages=399–411|doi=10.3758/BF03205298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, films have become darker over time, as the overall brightness of the images on the movie screen has decreased.&lt;ref name="cutting" /&gt;

These changes in film-making choices increase attention manipulation and are thought to facilitate comprehension.

==Top-down factors==
Top-down factors refer to expectations and background knowledge that influence viewers' perception, understanding and appreciation of film. Expertise, attention and eye-movements are top-down factors that guide how viewers experience film.

===Expertise and awareness of audience manipulation===

Explicit awareness about the processes by which meaning is created by the visual media could be regarded as one measure of film expertise and sophistication. Increased awareness of the subtle techniques employed by filmmakers to “manipulate” audiences leads to increased admiration and aesthetic responses to film,&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=L.|title=Art as the communication of competence|journal=Social Science Information|date=1 December 1973|volume=12|issue=6|pages=115–141|doi=10.1177/053901847301200604}}&lt;/ref&gt;   as in other forms of visual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=D.W.|title=When the Movies Were Young|year=1975|publisher=Benjamin Blom|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Researchers have identified a strong relationship between prior film experience and conscious awareness of visual manipulations, especially for people with practical experience in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Sol|title=Through Navajo Eyes: An Exploration in Film Communication and Anthropology|year=1972|publisher=Indiana University Press.|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study compared the participants’ ability to understand narrative in Hollywood versus experimental film, by measuring interpretational awareness. Subjects with significant, moderate and no formal background or experience in film viewed a film that contained both scenes with Hollywood-style and experimental-style editing. Regardless of expertise level, participants described the Hollywood-like scenes in “naturalistic terms,” as if their events had occurred in reality and tended not to make explicit references to stylistic techniques. This interpretational tendency reflects Hollywood’s “invisible style.” When describing the experimental scenes, inexperienced viewers struggled to construct a cohesive “naturalistic” narrative. More experienced viewers were more likely to make explicit reference to the “breaking of conventions” and the intentions behind them.&lt;ref name=messaris81&gt;{{cite journal|last=Messaris|first=Paul|title=The Film Audience's Awareness of the Production Process|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|year=1981|volume=33|issue=4|pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film editing seems to be a barrier of awareness for conventional Hollywood-type movies, as they create an illusion of “real life”.

===Segmentation===

Segmentation or event segmentation is a fundamental component of attention that facilitates understanding, object recognition and planning. Event segmentation constitutes breaking down dynamic scenes into spatial and temporal parts or units of events.

Event segmentation is viewed as “the brain’s cutting-room floor.”&lt;ref name=zacksj /&gt; 
It is considered to be an automatic and ongoing process that depends on meaningful changes in a perceived situation. To test this, researchers measured brain activity while participants viewed an extended narrative film. They used MRI scanning to show transient evoked brain responses (changes in brain activity) at those points they identified as event boundaries (changes in situation). Situational changes were coded frame by frame into spatial, temporal, object, character, causal and goal changes. Participants were then instructed to perform an event segmentation task by watching a movie and pressing a button to identify units of activity that were natural and meaningful to them. Paying attention to situational changes gives rise to a neural cascade that is consciously perceived at the end of one event and the beginning of another.&lt;ref name=zacksj&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=J|title=Human Brain Activity Time-locked to Perceptual Event Boundaries|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=4|pages=651–655|doi=10.1038/88486|pmid=11369948|year=2001|last2=Braver|first2=TS|last3=Sheridan|first3=MA|last4=Donaldson|first4=DI|last5=Snyder|first5=AZ|last6=Ollinger|first6=JM|last7=Buckner|first7=RL|last8=Raichle|first8=ME|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Event Segmentation Theory (EST),&lt;ref name=zacks&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=Jeffrey M.|author2=Speer, Nicole K. |author3=Swallow, Khena M. |author4=Braver, Todd S. |author5= Reynolds, Jeremy R. |title=Event perception: A mind-brain perspective|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 2007|volume=133|issue=2|pages=273–293|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.273|pmid=17338600|pmc=2852534}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the perception of event boundaries is a side effect of prediction during ongoing perception. Prediction is an adaptive mechanism made up of cognitive event models that represent “what is going on now” to create expectations and attentive biases for ongoing processing. Prediction errors occur at situational changes and cause information processing segmentation.

Broader narrative comprehension theories have also been applied to the perception and memory of movies.&lt;ref name=zacks2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=Jeffrey M.|author2=Speer, Nicole K. |author3=Reynolds, Jeremy R. |title=Segmentation in reading and film comprehension|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=1 January 2009|volume=138|issue=2|pages=307–327|doi=10.1037/a0015305|pmid=19397386|citeseerx=10.1.1.496.1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflects the hypothesis that the same mechanisms are used to understanding stories and real life.

===Eye-movement===

Using an [[Eye tracking|eyetracker]], researchers have discovered a strong center-of-screen bias with a distribution of gaze points approximately peaking at the screen center. However, eye gazes rarely focus on the same location. Visual dispersion across the screen increases over time and particularly, after repeated exposure to the same video stimulus. Because of this, there is greater gaze dispersion when viewers are watching advertisements compared to a television show.&lt;ref name=brasel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brasel|first=S Adam|author2=Gips, James |title=Points of view: Where do we look when we watch TV?|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2008|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1890–1894|doi=10.1068/p6253|pmid=19227380|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230036|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driver|first=J.|title=Parietal neglect and visual awareness|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–22|year=1998|doi=10.1038/217|pmid=10195103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Armin.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of Armin's ''The History of the two Maids of More-Clacke'', 1609. The woodcut shows Armin onstage.]]

'''Robert Armin''' (c. 1563 – 1615) was an English actor, a member of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]]. He became the leading comedy actor with the troupe associated with [[William Shakespeare]] following the departure of [[William Kempe|Will Kempe]] around 1600. Also a popular comic author, he wrote a comedy, ''The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke'', as well as ''Foole upon Foole'', ''A Nest of Ninnies'' (1608) and ''The Italian Taylor and his Boy''.

Armin changed the part of the clown or fool from the rustic servingman turned comedian to that of a high-comedy domestic wit.

==Early life==
:"…the clown is wise because he plays the fool for money, while others have to pay for the same privilege." – [[Leslie Hotson]] in ''Shakespeare's Motley''

Armin was one of three children born to John Armyn II of [[King's Lynn]], a successful tailor and friend to [[John Lonyson]], a [[goldsmith]] also of King's Lynn. His brother, John Armyn III, was a merchant tailor in London. Armin did not take up his father's craft; instead, his father apprenticed him to Lonyson in the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths|Goldsmiths' Company]] in 1581. Lonyson was the Master of Works at the [[Royal Mint]] in the [[Tower of London]], a position of great responsibility. The arrangement moved Armin to a life and a social circle quite different from what he might have expected as a Norfolk tailor. Lonyson died in 1582, and the apprenticeship was transferred to another master. According to a tale preserved in ''Tarlton's Jests'', Armin came to the attention of the Queen's famous jester [[Richard Tarlton]]. In the course of his duties, the story contends, Armin was sent to collect money from a lodger at Tarlton's inn. Frustrated by the man's refusal to pay, Armin wrote verses in chalk on the wall; Tarlton noticed and, approving their wit, wrote an answer in which he expressed a desire to take Armin as his apprentice. Though not corroborated, this anecdote is far from the least plausible in ''Tarlton's Jests''. Influenced by Tarlton or not, Armin already had a literary reputation before he finished his apprenticeship in 1592. In 1590, his name is affixed to the preface of a religious tract, ''A Brief Resolution of the Right Religion''. Two years later, both [[Thomas Nashe]] (in ''Strange News'') and [[Gabriel Harvey]] (in ''Pierce's Supererogation'') mention him as a writer of [[ballad]]s; none of his work in this vein, however, is known to have survived.

==The Chandos company==
At some point in the 1590s, Armin joined a company of players patronised by [[William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos]]. With this company, about which little is known, he is presumed to have travelled from the western [[English Midlands|Midlands]] to [[East Anglia]]. The nature of his work for the company may be estimated from his parts in ''The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke''. The preface to the 1609 [[book size|quarto]] indicates that he played Blue John, a clown in the vein of Tarlton and Kempe; he also seems to have doubled in the role of Tutch, a witty fool of the type he later played in London. The late quarto is associated with a revival by the [[King's Revels Children]], a short-lived troupe of [[boy player]]s led by [[Nathan Field]], but it was almost certainly written around 1597.

Little else is known precisely of Armin's time with [[Chandos's Men]]. A dedication to his patron's widow in 1604 suggests some personal acquaintance with the Brydges family; on the other hand, a reference in another work suggests he may have spent some time, like Kempe, as a solo performer. The pair of books Armin published around the turn of the century demonstrate a performer with an interest in his craft. ''Fool Upon Fool'' (1600, 1605; reissued in 1608 as ''A Nest of Ninnies''), offers the wit of assorted natural fools, some of whom Armin knew personally. The same year he published ''Quips upon Questions'', a collection of seemingly extemporaneous dialogues with his [[marotte]], named by him Signor Truncheon. In this he demonstrates his style; instead of having a conversation with the audience, as Tarlton did, and entering into a battle of wits, he jests using multiple [[persona]]s, improvised song, or by commenting on a person or event. Rather than exchanging words, he gave words freely. Armin reported in that work that on either Tuesday 25 December 1599, or Tuesday 1 January 1600, he would be travelling to [[Hackney Village|Hackney]] to wait on his "right honourable good lord". This was possibly Baron Chandos, who may have been visiting [[Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche]] over the holidays, or more likely [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] who lived in Hackney.&lt;ref&gt;Bednarz. James P. (2001) ''Shakespeare and the Poet's War'', New York: Columbia UP, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCrea, Scott (2005), ''The Case for Shakespeare: The End of the Authorship Question'', Westport: Praeger, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first editions of these two books were credited to "Clonnico de Curtanio Snuffe"—that is, to the "Clown of the [[Curtain Theatre|Curtain]]". The 1605 edition changes "Curtain" to "Mundo" (that is, [[Globe Theatre|Globe]]); only in 1608 was he credited by name, though the earlier title pages would have sufficed to identify him for Londoners.

Another work of uncertain date (it was published in 1609) is ''The Italian Tailor and his Boy''. A translation of a tale from [[Gianfrancesco Straparola]], the subject matter may reflect his family background of tailors. He was a tailor's son, who paralleled in the Italian tailor's apprentice, and the [[ruby]] ring of the play's lore parallels the goldsmith apprentice.

Sutcliffe argues that Armin wrote a pamphlet published in 1599, ''A Pil to Purge Melancholie'', on the grounds that it was published by the same press, mentions a clown with Armin's nickname, and contains verbal echoes of ''Two Maids of More-clacke''.

==Lord Chamberlain's Men==
The timing of Armin's joining the Chamberlain's Men is as mysterious as its occasion. That it was connected to Kempe's departure has been generally accepted; however, the reasons for that departure are not clear. One traditional view—that the company in general or [[Shakespeare]] specifically had begun to tire of Kempe's old-fashioned clowning—is still current, though the main evidence for this view consists of Kempe's departure and the type of comic roles Shakespeare wrote after 1600. Armin played on the Globe stage by August 1600; Wiles theorizes that he may have joined the Chamberlain's Men in 1599, but continued to perform solo pieces at the Curtain; however, he may also have played with the company at the Curtain, while Kempe was still a member.

Armin is generally credited with all the "licensed fools" in the repertory of the Chamberlain's and [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]: Touchstone in ''[[As You Like It]]'', Feste in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', the Fool in ''[[King Lear]]'', Lavatch in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'', and perhaps Thersites in ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', the Porter in ''[[Macbeth]]'', the Fool in ''[[Timon of Athens]]'', and Autolycus in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.  Of these eight, Touchstone is the fool about which there is the most critical discussion. [[Harold Bloom]] describes him as "rancidly vicious," and writes that "this more intense rancidity works as a [[touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]] should, to prove the true gold of Rosalind's spirit". [[John Palmer (author)|John Palmer]] disagrees and writes that "he must be either a true [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]] or one that affects his cynicism to mask a fundamentally genial spirit". Obviously, as Palmer continues, a true cynic does not belong in [[As you like it#Setting|Arden]], so the clown "must be a thoroughly good fellow at heart". Touchstone affects the front of a malcontented cynic, thus serving as proof of Rosalind's quick wit. When she confronts both Jaques and Touchstone, she exposes their silliness and prevents the fools from making Arden out to be worse than it really is.

Feste was almost certainly written for Armin, as he is a scholar, a singer, and a wit. Feste's purpose is to reveal the foolishness of those around him. Lear's fool differs from both Touchstone and Feste as well as from other clowns of his era. Touchstone and Feste are philosopher-fools; Lear's fool is the natural fool of whom Armin studied and wrote. Armin here had the opportunity to display his studies. The fool speaks the prophecy lines, which he tells—largely ignored—to [[King Lear|Lear]] before disappearing from the play altogether. Lear's fool is hardly around for entertainment purposes; rather, he is present to forward the plot, remain loyal to the king, and perhaps to stall his madness.

Although Armin typically played these intelligent clown roles, it has been suggested by a few scholars that he originated the role of [[Iago]] in ''[[Othello]]'', on the grounds that Iago sings two drinking songs (most of the songs in Shakespeare's plays from 1600 to 1610 were sung by Armin's characters) and that this was the sole play between ''As You Like It'' and ''Timon of Athens'' that has no fool or clown for Armin to play.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=um9w6Ws_Q0IC&amp;pg=PT88 Verdi's Shakespeare: Men of the Theater], Garry Wills, p. 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A-7akkQjFFQC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=robert+armin+iago&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp7pnyx8vRAhUK4YMKHXbBBxQQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=robert%20armin%20iago&amp;f=false Shakespeare and the Poet's Life], Gary Schmidgall, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-Shakespearean roles, he probably played Pasarello in [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]'s ''[[The Malcontent]]''; indeed, Marston may have added the part for him when the play was produced by the King's Men. Armin appears in the cast list for [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''; he may have played Drugger. He is also presumed to have been the clown in [[George Wilkins]]'s ''[[The Miseries of Enforced Marriage]]''.

He is not named in the cast list for Jonson's ''Catiline'' (1611), and other evidence suggests that he retired in 1609 or 1610. The preface to the ''Two Maids'' quarto confides, "I would have again enacted John myself, but ''tempora mutantur in illis'', and I cannot do as I would". He was buried in late 1615.

In London, he resided in the parish of [[St Botolph's Aldgate]]; three of his children named in the parish register appear to have died before adulthood. Fellow King's Man [[Augustine Phillips]] bequeathed him twenty [[shilling]]s as a "fellow"; [[John Davies of Hereford]] wrote Armin a complimentary [[epigram]]. His burial is recorded in the Registers of St Botolph's as 30 November 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofacto00nung/dictionaryofacto00nung_djvu.txt  Nungezer, Edwin (1929), "A Dictionary of Actors and of Other Persons Associated with the Public Representation of Plays in England, before 1642", OUP]&lt;/ref&gt;

==A new fool==
Armin may have played a key role in the development of [[Shakespearian fool]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foolsforhire.com/info/history.html History of the Fool]&lt;/ref&gt;  "If any player breathed," Hotson tells us, "who could explore with Shakespeare the shadows and fitful flashes of the borderland of insanity, that player was Armin". Robert Armin explored every aspect of the clown, from the natural idiot to the philosopher-fool; from serving man to retained jester. In study, writing, and performance, Armin moved the fool from rustic zany to trained motley. His characters—those he wrote and those he acted—absurdly point out the absurdity of what is otherwise called normal. Instead of appealing to the identity of the English commoner by imitating them, he created a new fool, a high-comic jester for whom wisdom is wit and wit is wisdom.
When Robert Armin replaced Kemp in the Chamberlain's Men, it was considered the "taming of the clown". Armin's new style of comedy brought into play the "world-wisely fool". This urged Shakespeare to create [[Feste]] in his ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', who was a philosophical social insurgence. He had a place everywhere, but belonged nowhere.
[[Ken Kesey]] told an interviewer of this notion of a fool. "That fool of Shakespeare's, the actor Robert Armin, became so popular that finally Shakespeare wrote him out of Henry IV. In a book called ''A Nest of Ninnies'', Armin wrote about the difference between a fool artificial and a fool natural. And the way Armin defines the two is important: the character Jack Oates is a true fool natural. He never stops being a fool to save himself; he never tries to do anything but anger his master, Sir William. A fool artificial is always trying to please; he’s a lackey."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1830/the-art-of-fiction-no-136-ken-kesey  The Paris Review, "Ken Kesey, The Art of Fiction No. 136 (Interviewed by Robert Faggen)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romanticism''' (also known as the '''Romantic era''') was an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical. &lt;!-- Please do not adjust these dates without raising the matter on the talk page first --&gt;  It was partly a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9083836 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013060413/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9083836 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 October 2005 |title=''Romanticism''.

The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of [[aesthetic]] experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as [[apprehension (fear)|apprehension]], [[horror and terror]], and [[Awe (emotion)|awe]]—especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] and beauty of nature. It elevated [[folk art]] and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic (as in the musical [[impromptu]]). In contrast to the [[Rationalism]] and [[Classicism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romanticism revived [[medievalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Núria Perpinyà|Perpinya]], Núria. [http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/buch/isbn/3794 Ruins, Nostalgia and Ugliness. Five Romantic perceptions of Middle Ages and a spoon of Game of Thrones and Avant-garde oddity]. Berlin: Logos Verlag. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early [[urban sprawl]], and [[Industrial Revolution|industrialism]].

Although the movement was rooted in the German ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the [[French Revolution]] were also proximate factors. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of "heroic" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;"'A remarkable thing,' continued Bazarov, 'these funny old romantics! They work up their nervous system into a state of agitation, then, of course, their equilibrium is upset.'" ([[Ivan Turgenev]], ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'', chap. 4 [1862])&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of Romanticism during this time was associated with multiple processes, including social and political changes and the spread of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/901360| jstor = 901360| title = The Decline of Romanticism: End of the Century, Turn of the Century-- Introductory Sketch of an Essay| journal = Studia Musicologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae| volume = 12| issue = 1/4| page = 263| year = 1970| last1 = Szabolcsi | first1 = B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining Romanticism==

===Basic characteristics===
The nature of Romanticism may be approached from the primary importance of the free expression of the feelings of the artist. The importance the Romantics placed on emotion is summed up in the remark of the German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]], "the artist's feeling is his law".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 96&lt;/ref&gt; To [[William Wordsworth]], poetry should begin as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings", which the poet then "recollect[s] in tranquility", evoking a new but corresponding emotion the poet can then mold into art.&lt;ref&gt;From the Preface to the 2nd edition of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', quoted Day, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

To express these feelings, it was considered the content of art had to come from the imagination of the artist, with as little interference as possible from "artificial" rules dictating what a work should consist of. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and others believed there were natural laws the imagination—at least of a good creative artist—would unconsciously follow through [[artistic inspiration]] if left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 3&lt;/ref&gt; As well as rules, the influence of models from other works was considered to impede the creator's own imagination, so that [[originality]] was essential. The concept of the [[genius]], or artist who was able to produce his own original work through this process of ''creation from nothingness'', is key to Romanticism, and to be derivative was the worst sin.&lt;ref name="Ruthven01p40"&gt;Ruthven (2001) p. 40 quote: "Romantic ideology of literary authorship, which conceives of the text as an autonomous object produced by an individual genius."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spearing87"&gt;Spearing (1987) quote: "Surprising as it may seem to us, living after the Romantic movement has transformed older ideas about literature, in the Middle Ages authority was prized more highly than originality."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco94"&gt;Eco (1994) p. 95 quote:
Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness", with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is often called "romantic originality."&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1926), throughout; Smith (1924); Millen, Jessica ''Romantic Creativity and the Ideal of Originality: A Contextual Analysis'', in [http://eview.anu.edu.au/cross-sections/vol6/pdf/ch07.pdf ''Cross-sections'', The Bruce Hall Academic Journal – Volume VI, 2010 PDF]; Forest Pyle, The Ideology of Imagination: Subject and Society in the Discourse of Romanticism (Stanford University Press, 1995) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Translator and prominent Romantic [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] argued in his ''Lectures on Dramatic Arts and Letters'' that the most phenomenal power of human nature is its capacity to divide and diverge into opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Romanticism: A Brief History with Documents|last=1963–|first=Breckman, Warren|date=2008|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|others=Rogers D.

Not essential to Romanticism, but so widespread as to be normative, was a strong belief and interest in the importance of nature. This particularly in the effect of nature upon the artist when he is surrounded by it, preferably alone. In contrast to the usually very social art of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romantics were distrustful of the human world, and tended to believe a close connection with nature was mentally and morally healthy. Romantic art addressed its audiences with what was intended to be felt as the personal voice of the artist. So, in literature, "much of romantic poetry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Day 3–4; quotation from M.H. Abrams, quoted in Day, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Isaiah Berlin]], Romanticism embodied "a new and restless spirit, seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms, a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness, a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual movement and change, an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life, a passionate effort at self-assertion both individual and collective, a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The group of words with the root "Roman" in the various European languages, such as "romance" and "Romanesque", has a complicated history, but by the middle of the 18th century "romantic" in English and ''romantique'' in French were both in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets, in a sense close to modern English usage but without the amorous connotation. The application of the term to literature first became common in Germany, where the circle around the Schlegel brothers, critics [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]], began to speak of ''romantische Poesie'' ("romantic poetry") in the 1790s, contrasting it with "classic" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating.  Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his ''Dialogue on Poetry'' (1800), "I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived."&lt;ref&gt;Ferber, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In both French and German the closeness of the adjective to ''roman'', meaning the fairly new literary form of the [[novel]], had some effect on the sense of the word in those languages.  The use of the word, invented by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], did not become general very quickly, and was probably spread more widely in France by its persistent use by [[Germaine de Staël]] in her ''[[De l'Allemagne]]'' (1813), recounting her travels in Germany.&lt;ref name="Ferber, 7"&gt;Ferber, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the "romantic harp" and "classic lyre",&lt;ref name="Ferber, 7"/&gt; but in 1820 [[Lord Byron|Byron]] could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously, "I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the [[Académie française]] took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period===
The period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. [[Margaret Drabble]] described it in literature as taking place "roughly between 1770 and 1848",&lt;ref&gt;in her ''Oxford Companion'' article, quoted by Day, 1&lt;/ref&gt; and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, [[M. H. Abrams]] placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 1–5&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have proposed 1780–1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British Literature 1780–1830|last = Mellor|first = Anne|publisher = Harcourt Brace &amp; Co./Wadsworth|year = 1996|isbn = 978-1413022537|location = NY|pages = |last2 = Matlak|first2 = Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; [[Romantic music|musical Romanticism]], for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of [[Richard Strauss]] are described stylistically as "Late Romantic" and were composed in 1946–48.&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Kravitt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WpR6Ja9eQzYC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22Four+Last+Songs%22+%22Late+Romantic%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FC92T8K_JIWA8gPP3JCeDQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Four%20Last%20Songs%22%20%22Late%20Romantic%22&amp;f=false The Lied: Mirror of Late Romanticism]'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1996): 47. {{ISBN|0300063652}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in most fields the Romantic Period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier.

The early period of the Romantic Era was a time of war, with the French Revolution (1789–1799) followed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] until 1815.  These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Greenblatt et al., ''Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, "The Romantic Period – Volume D" (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company Inc., 2006): {{Page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795–1805 had, in the words of one of their number, [[Alfred de Vigny]], been "conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 147, inc. quotation&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jacques Barzun]], there were three generations of Romantic artists. The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, 469&lt;/ref&gt;

===Context and place in history===
The more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of [[intellectual history]] and [[literary history]] throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging.  That it was part of the [[Counter-Enlightenment]], a reaction against the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is generally accepted in current scholarship.  Its relationship to the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions.  Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views,&lt;ref&gt;Day, 1–3; the arch-conservative and Romantic is [[Joseph de Maistre]], but many Romantics swung from youthful radicalism to conservative views in middle age, for example Wordsworth. [[Samuel Palmer]]'s only published text was a short piece opposing the [[Repeal of the corn laws]].&lt;/ref&gt; and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.

In philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading "to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth",&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, 57&lt;/ref&gt; and hence not only to nationalism, but also [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]], with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Several of Berlin's pieces dealing with this theme are collected in the work referenced. See in particular: Berlin, 34–47, 57–59, 183–206, 207–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Romantics, Berlin says, &lt;blockquote&gt;in the realm of ethics, politics, aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered; this applied equally to individuals and groups—states, nations, movements. This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism, where the notion of eternal models, a Platonic vision of ideal beauty, which the artist seeks to convey, however imperfectly, on canvas or in sound, is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom, individual creativity. The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some "external" voice—church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste—is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- yes, 2 semi-colons &amp; about 15 commas in the quote --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[John William Waterhouse]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'', 1888, after a poem by [[Tennyson]]; like many [[Victorian painting]]s, romantic but not Romantic.]]

[[Arthur Lovejoy]] attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article "On The Discrimination of Romanticisms" in his ''Essays in the [[History of ideas|History of Ideas]]'' (1948); some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present, some like [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] see in it the inaugural moment of [[modernity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp Linda Simon ''The Sleep of Reason'' by Robert Hughes]&lt;/ref&gt; and some like [[Chateaubriand]], [[Novalis]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge see it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism—a "Counter-Enlightenment"—&lt;ref&gt;''[[Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder]]'', Pimlico, 2000 {{ISBN|0712664920}} was one of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and organic,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Darrin McMahon|Darrin M. McMahon]], "The Counter-Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revolutionary France" ''Past and Present'' No. 159 (May 1998:77–112) p. 79 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; to be associated most closely with [[German Romanticism]]. An earlier definition comes from [[Charles Baudelaire]]: "Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth, but in the way of feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Salon_de_1846_%28Curiosit%C3%A9s_esth%C3%A9tiques%29#II._.E2.80.94_Qu.E2.80.99est-ce_que_le_romantisme.3F |title=Baudelaire's speech at the "Salon des curiosités Estethiques |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], which affected literature, especially the novel and drama, painting, and even music, through [[Verismo]] opera. This movement was led by France, with [[Balzac]] and [[Flaubert]] in literature and [[Courbet]] in painting; [[Stendhal]] and [[Goya]] were important precursors of Realism in their respective media. However, Romantic styles, now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled, continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond. In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as "Late Romantic"  and by others as "Neoromantic" or "Postromantic", but other fields do not usually use these terms; in English literature and painting the convenient term "Victorian" avoids having to characterise the period further.

In northern Europe, the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished, and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was. Elsewhere, including in very different ways the United States and Russia, feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible. Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent, as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics, but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced, often replaced with meticulous technique, as in the poems of [[Tennyson]] or many paintings.  If not realist, late 19th-century art was often extremely detailed, and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with. Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art, above all the pre-eminent importance of originality, remained important for later generations, and often underlie modern views, despite opposition from theorists.

In literature, Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past, the cult of "[[sensibility]]" with its emphasis on women and children, the isolation of the artist or narrator, and respect for nature. Furthermore, several romantic authors, such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], based their writings on the [[supernatural]]/[[occult]] and human [[psychology]]. Romanticism tended to regard [[satire]] as something unworthy of serious attention, a prejudice still influential today.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, James (1958) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''English Satire''] p. 1. There were a few exceptions, notably Byron, who integrated satire into some of his greatest works, yet shared much in common with his Romantic contemporaries. Bloom, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The romantic movement in literature was preceded by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and succeeded by [[Literary realism|Realism]].

Some authors cite 16th century poet [[Isabella di Morra]] as an early precursor of Romantic literature. Her lyrics covering themes of isolation and loneliness, which reflected the tragic events of her life, are considered "an impressive prefigurement of Romanticism",&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Grendler, [[Renaissance Society of America]], ''Encyclopedia of the Renaissance'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]], 1999, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; differing from the [[Petrarch]]ist fashion of the time based on the [[philosophy of love]].

The precursors of Romanticism in English poetry go back to the middle of the 18th century, including figures such as [[Joseph Warton]] (headmaster at [[Winchester College]]) and his brother [[Thomas Warton]], [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="John Keats page 106"&gt;John Keats. By Sidney Colvin, p. 106. Elibron Classics&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet. [[Thomas Chatterton]] is generally considered the first Romantic poet in English.&lt;ref name="Thomas Chatterton 1971, page 11"&gt;Thomas Chatterton, Grevel Lindop, 1972, Fyffield Books, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish poet [[James Macpherson]] influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his [[Ossian]] cycle of poems published in 1762, inspiring both [[Goethe]] and the young [[Walter Scott]]. Both Chatterton and Macpherson's work involved elements of fraud, as what they claimed was earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was, in fact, entirely their own work. The [[Gothic novel]], beginning with [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764), was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism, with a delight in horror and threat, and exotic picturesque settings, matched in Walpole's case by his role in the early [[Gothic Revival|revival of Gothic architecture]]. ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', a novel by [[Laurence Sterne]] (1759–67) introduced a whimsical version of the anti-rational [[sentimental novel]] to the English literary public.

===Germany===
[[File:Des Knaben Wunderhorn III (1808).jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume III of ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'', 1808]]
An early German influence came from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], whose 1774 novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist, a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament. At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states, and Goethe's works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of [[nationalism]].  Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], making [[Jena]] (where Fichte lived, as well as Schelling, [[Hegel]], [[Schiller]] and the brothers [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]]) a center for early [[German Romanticism]] (see [[Jena Romanticism]]). Important writers were [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Novalis]] (''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]'', 1799), [[Heinrich von Kleist]] and [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]. [[Heidelberg]] later became a center of German Romanticism, where writers and poets such as [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Achim von Arnim]], and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] (''[[Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts]]'') met regularly in literary circles.

Important motifs in German Romanticism are travelling, nature, for example the [[German Forest]], and [[Germanic mythology|Germanic myths]]. The later German Romanticism of, for example [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s ''[[Der Sandmann]]'' (''The Sandman''), 1817, and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]]'s ''Das Marmorbild'' (''The Marble Statue''), 1819, was darker in its motifs and has [[gothic novel|gothic]] elements.  The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to [[folk literature]], non-classical [[mythology]] and [[children's literature]], above all in Germany.  Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' ("The Boy's Magic Horn" or [[cornucopia]]), a collection of versified folk tales, in 1806–08.  The first collection of ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was published in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=1988 |title=The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World |edition = 1st |publisher= Routledge |isbn=978-0415900812 |pages= 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the much later work of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835, these German works were at least mainly based on collected [[Folklore|folk tales]], and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions, though later rewriting some parts.  One of the brothers, [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]], published in 1835 ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', a long academic work on Germanic mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack| year=2000 |title=The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages=13–14,  218–19 |isbn=978-0198601159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strain is exemplified by Schiller's highly emotional language and the depiction of physical violence in his play ''[[The Robbers]]'' of 1781.

[[File:Byronharlow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Henry Harlow]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] c. 1816]]
In [[English literature]], the key figures of the Romantic movement are considered to be the group of poets including [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and the much older [[William Blake]], followed later by the isolated figure of [[John Clare]]; also such novelists as [[Walter Scott]] from Scotland and [[Mary Shelley]], and the essayists [[William Hazlitt]] and [[Charles Lamb]]. The publication in 1798 of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement.  The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native [[Lake District]], or his feelings about nature—which he more fully developed in his long poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', never published in his lifetime.  The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the [[Lake Poets]] were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer [[William Hazlitt]] and others.
[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]], ''[[Chateaubriand]]'' in Rome, 1808]]

In contrast [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]] achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings; Goethe called Byron "undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' in 1805, followed by the full [[epic poem]] ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past, already evoked in ''Ossian''; [[Romanticism in Scotland|Romanticism and Scotland]] were to have a long and fruitful partnership.  Byron had equal success with the first part of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' in 1812, followed by four "Turkish tales", all in the form of long poems, starting with ''[[The Giaour]]'' in 1813, drawing from his [[Grand Tour]], which had reached Ottoman Europe, and [[Orientalism|orientalizing]] the themes of the Gothic novel in verse.  These featured different variations of the "[[Byronic hero]]", and his own life contributed a further version. Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the [[historical novel]], beginning in 1814 with ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', set in the [[1745 Jacobite rising]], which was an enormous and highly profitable success, followed by over 20 further [[Waverley Novels]] over the next 17 years, with settings going back to the [[Crusades]] that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 192–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on [[Lake Geneva]] with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by Shelley's wife-to-be [[Mary Shelley]] and the [[novella]] ''[[The Vampyre]]'' by Byron's doctor [[John William Polidori]].  The lyrics of [[Robert Burns]] in Scotland and [[Thomas Moore]], from Ireland reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature, but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work.

Though they have modern critical champions such as [[György Lukács]], Scott's novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that composers continued to base on them over the following decades, such as [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[I puritani]]'' (both 1835).  Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings, especially his letters, and his unfinished [[satire]] ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 197–200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike many Romantics, Byron's widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work, and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the [[Greek War of Independence]] appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end, entrenching his legend.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 213–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy, Blake (at almost 70) in 1827, and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s.  Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded, holding a government [[sinecure]], but wrote relatively little.  In the discussion of English literature, the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s, or sometimes even earlier, although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values.

The most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period, other than Walter Scott, was [[Jane Austen]], whose essentially conservative world-view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries, retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules, though critics {{who|date=December 2015}} have detected tremors under the surface of some works, especially ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1817).&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt; But around the mid-century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the [[Yorkshire]]-based [[Brontë family]] appeared.  Most notably [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte's]] ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Brontë|Emily's]] ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', both published in 1847, which also introduced more gothic themes. While these two novels were written and published after the Romantic period is said to have ended, their novels were heavily influenced by Romantic literature they'd read as children.

Byron, Keats and Shelley all wrote for the stage, but with little success in England, with Shelley's ''[[The Cenci]]'' perhaps the best work produced, though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death. Byron's plays, along with dramatizations of his poems and Scott's novels, were much more popular on the Continent, and especially in France, and through these versions several were turned into operas, many still performed today.  If contemporary poets had little success on the stage, the period was a legendary one for performances of [[Shakespeare]], and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan "improvements" to them. The greatest actor of the period, [[Edmund Kean]], restored the tragic ending to ''[[King Lear]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Or at least he tried to; Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, and with regret, he reverted to [[Nahum Tate]]'s version with a comic ending, which had been standard since 1689.

Although after [[Acts of Union 1707|union with England]] in 1707 Scotland increasingly adopted English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0060558881}}, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Macpherson]] (1736–96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard [[Ossian]], he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0060558881}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also popularised in France by figures that included [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Gaskill, ''The Reception of Ossian in Europe'' (Continuum, 2004), {{ISBN|0826461352}}, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.&lt;ref&gt;D. Thomson, ''The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's "Ossian"'' (Aberdeen: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Burns]] (1759–96) and [[Walter Scott]] (1771–1832) were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" is often sung at [[Hogmanay]] (the last day of the year), and "[[Scots Wha Hae]]" served for a long time as an unofficial [[national anthem]] of the country.&lt;ref&gt;L. McIlvanney, "Hugh Blair, Robert Burns, and the Invention of Scottish Literature", ''Eighteenth-Century Life'', vol. 29 (2), Spring 2005, pp. 25–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work, ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Whetter, ''Understanding Genre and Medieval Romance'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), {{ISBN|0754661423}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It launched a highly successful career, with other historical novels such as ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]'' (1817), ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' (1818) and ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' (1820). Scott probably did more than any other figure to define and popularise Scottish cultural identity in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;N. Davidson, ''The Origins of Scottish Nationhood'' (Pluto Press, 2008), {{ISBN|0745316085}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major literary figures connected with Romanticism include the poets and novelists [[James Hogg]] (1770–1835), [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] (1784–1842) and [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] (1779–1839).&lt;ref&gt;A. Maunder, ''FOF Companion to the British Short Story'' (Infobase Publishing, 2007), {{ISBN|0816074968}}, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant figures of the Romantic movement, [[Lord Byron]], was brought up in Scotland until he inherited his family's [[Baron Byron|English peerage]].&lt;ref&gt;P. MacKay, E. Longley and F. Brearton, ''Modern Irish and Scottish Poetry'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0521196027}}, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sir Henry Raeburn - Portrait of Sir Walter Scott.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Raeburn|Raeburn's]] portrait of [[Walter Scott]] in 1822]]  Scotland was also the location of two of the most important literary magazines of the era, ''[[The Edinburgh Review]]'' (founded in 1802) and ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' (founded in 1817), which had a major impact on the development of British literature and drama in the era of Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;A. Jarrels, "'Associations respect[ing] the past': Enlightenment and Romantic historicism", in [[Jon Paul Klancher|J. P. Klancher]], ''A Concise Companion to the Romantic Age'' (Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009), {{ISBN|0631233555}}, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

Benchimol, ed., ''Intellectual Politics and Cultural Conflict in the Romantic Period: Scottish Whigs, English Radicals and the Making of the British Public Sphere'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0754664465}}, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish "national drama" emerged in the early 1800s, as plays with specifically Scottish themes began to dominate the Scottish stage. Theatres had been discouraged by the [[Church of Scotland]] and fears of Jacobite assemblies. In the later eighteenth century, many plays were written for and performed by small amateur companies and were not published and so most have been lost. Towards the end of the century there were "[[closet dramas]]", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and [[Joanna Baillie]] (1762–1851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and [[Gothic literature|Gothic]] Romanticism.&lt;ref name=Brown2007pp229-30&gt;I.

===France===
Romanticism was relatively late in developing [[19th-century French literature#Romanticism|in French literature]], more so than in the visual arts. The 18th-century precursor to Romanticism, the cult of sensibility, had become associated with the [[Ancien regime]], and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first-hand. The first major figure was [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], a minor aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential [[novella]] of exile ''[[René (novella)|René]]'' (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (''[[Génie du christianisme]]'' 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous [[autobiography]] ''[[Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe]]'' ("Memoirs from beyond the grave").&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 202–03, 241–42.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jean-Jacques Grandville - Frenzied Romans at the First Performance of Hernani - WGA10359.jpg|thumb|The "battle of ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''" was fought nightly at the theatre in 1830]]
After the [[Bourbon Restoration]], French Romanticism developed in the lively world of [[Theatre of France#19th century|Parisian theatre]], with productions of [[Shakespeare]], Schiller (in France a key Romantic author), and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors, several of whom began to write in the late 1820s. Cliques of pro- and anti-Romantics developed, and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides, including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that "Shakespeare, c'est l'aide-de-camp de Wellington" ("Shakespeare is [[Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] [[aide-de-camp]]").&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 239–46, 240 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre Dumas]] began as a dramatist, with a series of successes beginning with ''Henri III et sa cour'' (1829) before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott, most famously ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', both of 1844. [[Victor Hugo]] published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''—a historical drama in a quasi-Shakespearian style that had famously riotous performances on its first run in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 244–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Dumas, Hugo is best known for his novels, and was already writing ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831), one of the best known works, which became a paradigm of the French Romantic movement. The preface to his unperformed play "Cromwell" gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism, stating that "there are no rules, or models". The career of [[Prosper Mérimée]] followed a similar pattern; he is now best known as the originator of the story of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', with his novella published 1845. [[Alfred de Vigny]] remains best known as a dramatist, with his play on the life of the English poet ''Chatterton'' (1835) perhaps his best work. [[George Sand]] was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene, famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with [[Chopin]] and several others;&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen&lt;/ref&gt; she too was inspired by the theatre, and wrote works to be staged at her [[House of George Sand|private estate]].

French Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and the flamboyant [[Théophile Gautier]], whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872.

[[Stendhal]] is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period, but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism, and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism, qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction. As a survivor of the French [[retreat from Moscow]] in 1812, fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him, and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism. His most important works are ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', 1830) and ''La Chartreuse de Parme'' (''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', 1839).

=== Poland ===
[[File:Adam Mickiewicz.PNG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Portrait of Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag Cliff|''Adam Mickiewicz on the Ayu-Dag'']], by [[Walenty Wańkowicz]], 1828]]
{{Main|Romanticism in Poland}}
[[Romanticism in Poland]] is often taken to begin with the publication of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s first poems in 1822, and end with the crushing of the [[January Uprising]] of 1863 against the Russians. It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Dyczewski, ''Values in the Polish cultural tradition'' (2002) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Polish Romanticism revived the old "Sarmatism" traditions of the ''[[szlachta]]'' or Polish nobility. Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz (''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''), [[Juliusz Słowacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]], as well as prose writers such as [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] period, differentiating it from that of other countries. They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760–1850'' (2004) vol. 2. p. 742&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the general spirit and main ideas of European Romanticism, the literature of Polish Romanticism is unique, as many scholars have pointed out, in having developed largely outside of Poland and in its emphatic focus upon the issue of Polish [[nationalism]]. The Polish intelligentsia, along with leading members of its government, left Poland in the early 1830s, during what is referred to as the "[[Great Emigration]]", resettling in France, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States.
[[File:Juliusz Słowacki 1.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Juliusz Słowacki]], a Polish poet considered one of the [[Three Bards|"Three National Bards" of Polish literature]]—a major figure in the Polish Romantic period, and the father of modern Polish drama.]]
Their art featured [[wikt:emotionalism|emotionalism]] and [[Irrationalism and Aestheticism|irrationality]], fantasy and imagination, personality cults, [[folklore]] and country life, and the propagation of ideals of freedom. In the second period, many of the [[Polish Romantics]] worked abroad, often banished from Poland by the occupying powers due to their politically subversive ideas. Their work became increasingly dominated by the ideals of political struggle for freedom and their country's [[sovereignty]]. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. There developed the idea of the ''[[Three Bards|poeta wieszcz]]'' (the prophet). The ''[[wieszcz]]'' (bard) functioned as spiritual leader to the nation fighting for its independence. The most notable poet so recognized was [[Adam Mickiewicz]].

[[Zygmunt Krasiński|Zygmunt Krasinski]] also wrote to inspire political and religious hope in his countrymen. Unlike his predecessors, who called for victory at whatever price in Poland's struggle against Russia, Krasinski emphasized Poland's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] role in its fight for independence, advocating an intellectual rather than a military superiority. His works best exemplify the [[Messianism|Messianic movement in Poland]]: in two early dramas, ''Nie-boska komedyia''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nie-Boska komedia|url = https://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nie-Boska_komedia&amp;oldid=41481531|language = pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1835; ''The Undivine Comedy)'' and ''[[Irydion]]'' (1836; ''Iridion)'', as well as in the later ''Psalmy przyszłości'' (1845), he asserted that Poland was the [[Christ of Europe]]: specifically chosen by God to carry the world's burdens, to suffer, and eventually be resurrected.

=== Russia ===
Early Russian Romanticism is associated with the writers [[Konstantin Batyushkov]] (''A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe'', 1809), [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] (''The Bard'', 1811; ''Svetlana'', 1813) and [[Nikolay Karamzin]] (''Poor Liza'', 1792; ''Julia'', 1796; ''Martha the Mayoress'', 1802; ''The Sensitive and the Cold'', 1803). However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is [[Alexander Pushkin]] (''[[The Prisoner of the Caucasus (poem)|The Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', 1820–1821; ''The Robber Brothers'', 1822; ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', 1820; ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', 1825–1832). Pushkin's work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia's greatest poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/dostoevsky/texts/devil_pushkinbio.html|title=Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799–1837) |publisher=University of Virginia Slavic Department|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Russian Romantic poets include [[Mikhail Lermontov]] (''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'', 1839), [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] (''Silentium!'', 1830), [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] (''Eda'', 1826), [[Anton Delvig]], and [[Wilhelm Küchelbecker]].

Influenced heavily by Lord Byron, Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self, while Tyutchev's poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love. Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Baratynsky's style was fairly classical in nature, dwelling on the models of the previous century.

===Spain===
{{Main|Romanticism in Spanish literature}}
[[File:José de Espronceda (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[El escritor José de Espronceda]]'', [[portrait]] by [[Antonio María Esquivel]] ({{circa|1845}}) ([[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El escritor José de Espronceda |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/obra-de-arte/jose-de-espronceda/e97beaab-f0a3-4f73-8302-1c8185110410 |access-date=March 27, 2013 |website=[[Museo del Prado]] |location=Madrid |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Romanticism in Spanish literature]] developed a well-known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights. The most important Spanish poet during this movement was [[José de Espronceda]]. After him there were other poets like [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]], [[Mariano José de Larra]] and the dramatists [[Ángel de Saavedra]] and [[José Zorrilla]], author of ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''. Before them may be mentioned the pre-romantics [[José Cadalso]] and [[Manuel José Quintana]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip W. Silver, ''Ruin and restitution: reinterpreting romanticism in Spain'' (1997) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  The plays of [[Antonio García Gutiérrez]] were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi's operas ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures. For example, in [[Catalonia]] and in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] there was a national boom of writers in the local languages, like the Catalan [[Jacint Verdaguer]] and the Galician [[Rosalía de Castro]], the main figures of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revivalist]] movements [[Renaixença]] and [[Rexurdimento]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Brenan, ''The literature of the Spanish people: from Roman times to the present'' (1965) p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

There are scholars who consider Spanish Romanticism to be Proto-Existentialism because it is more anguished than the movement in other European countries. Foster et al., for example, say that the work of Spain's writers such as Espronceda, Larra, and other writers in the 19th century demonstrated a "metaphysical crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spanish Literature : Current debates on Hispanism|last=Foster|first=David|last2=Altamiranda|first2=Daniel|last3=de Urioste|first3=Carmen|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=978-0815335634|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observers put more weight on the link between the 19th-century Spanish writers with the existentialist movement that emerged immediately after. According to Richard Caldwell, the writers that we now identify with Spain's romanticism were actually precursors to those who galvanized the literary movement that emerged in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Richard|date=1970|title=The Persistence of Romantic Thought in Spain|url=|journal=Modern Language Review|volume=65|pages=803–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion is the subject of debate for there are authors who stress that Spain's romanticism is one of the earliest in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El primer romantico 'europeo' de España|last=Sebold|first=Russell|publisher=Editorial Gredos|year=1974|isbn=978-8424905910|location=Madrid|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some assert that Spain really had no period of literary romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Donald|date=1963|title=Towards an Understanding of Spanish Romanticism|url=|journal=Modern Language Review|volume=58|pages=190–95|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy underscores a certain uniqueness to Spanish romanticism in comparison to its European counterparts.

===Portugal===
[[File:Almeida Garrett - litografia sobre papel.png|thumb|upright|Portuguese poet, novelist, politician and playwright [[Almeida Garrett]] (1799–1854)]]
Romanticism began in [[Portugal]] with the publication of the poem ''Camões'' (1825), by [[Almeida Garrett]], who was raised by his uncle D. Alexandre, bishop of [[Angra do Heroísmo|Angra]], in the precepts of [[Neoclassicism]], which can be observed in his early work. The author himself confesses (in ''Camões''' preface) that he voluntarily refused to follow the principles of epic poetry enunciated by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], as he did the same to [[Horace]]'s [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|''Ars Poetica'']]. Almeida Garrett had participated in the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|1820 Liberal Revolution]], which caused him to exile himself in England in 1823 and then in France, after the [[Vilafrancada|Vila-Francada]]. While living in Great Britain, he had contacts with the Romantic movement and read authors such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Scott, Ossian, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine and de Staël, at the same time visiting feudal castles and ruins of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches and abbeys, which would be reflected in his writings. In 1838, he presented ''Um Auto de Gil Vicente'' ("A Play by [[Gil Vicente]]"), in an attempt to create a new national theatre, free of Greco-Roman and foreign influence. But his masterpiece would be ''Frei Luís de Sousa'' (1843), named by himself as a "Romantic drama" and it was acclaimed as an exceptional work, dealing with themes as national independence, faith, justice and love. He was also deeply interested in Portuguese folkloric verse, which resulted in the publication of ''Romanceiro'' ("Traditional Portuguese Ballads") (1843), that recollect a great number of ancient popular ballads, known as "romances" or "rimances", in ''redondilha maior'' verse form, that contained stories of [[chivalry]], life of [[saint]]s, [[crusades]], [[courtly love]], etc. He wrote the novels ''Viagens na Minha Terra'', ''O Arco de Sant'Ana'' and ''Helena.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Obras Completas de Almeida Garrett – 2 Volumes|last=Almeida Garrett|first=João Baptista|publisher=Lello Editores|year=1990|isbn=978-9724801926|location=Porto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$almeida-garrett|title=Artigo de apoio Infopédia – Almeida Garrett|last=Infopédia|website=Infopédia – Dicionários Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="José"&gt;{{Cite book|title=História da literatura portuguesa|last=José.|first=Saraiva, António|date=1996|publisher=Porto Editora|others=Lopes, Oscar|isbn=978-9720301703|edition= 17a|location=[Porto, Portugal]|oclc=35124986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandre Herculano]] is, alongside Almeida Garrett, one of the founders of Portuguese Romanticism. He too was forced to exile to Great Britain and France because of his [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideals. All of his poetry and prose are (unlike Almeida Garrett's) entirely Romantic, rejecting [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman myth]] and history.&lt;ref&gt;file:///C:/Users/Utilizador/Downloads/portoeditora_herculano_aharpacrente.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He sought inspiration in medieval Portuguese poems and [[chronicle]]s as in the [[Bible]]. His output is vast and covers many different genres, such as historical essays, poetry, novels, opuscules and theatre, where he brings back a whole world of Portuguese legends, tradition and history, especially in ''Eurico, o Presbítero'' ("Eurico, the Priest") and ''Lendas e Narrativas'' ("Legends and Narratives"). His work was influenced by Chateaubriand, Schiller, [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]], Walter Scott and the Old Testament [[Psalms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$alexandre-herculano|title=Artigo de apoio Infopédia – Alexandre Herculano|last=Infopédia|website=Infopédia – Dicionários Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[António Feliciano de Castilho]] made the case for [[Ultra-Romanticism]], publishing the poems ''A Noite no Castelo'' ("Night in the Castle") and ''Os Ciúmes do Bardo'' ("The Jealousy of the Bard"), both in 1836, and the drama ''Camões''. He became an unquestionable master for successive Ultra-Romantic generations, whose influence would not be challenged until the famous Coimbra Question. He also created polemics by translating [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' without knowing German, but using French versions of the play. Other notable figures of Portuguese Romanticism are the famous novelists [[Camilo Castelo Branco]] and [[Júlio Dinis]], and [[António Augusto Soares de Passos|Soares de Passos]], Bulhão Pato and Pinheiro Chagas.&lt;ref name="José"/&gt;

Romantic style would be revived in the beginning of the 20th century, notably through the works of poets linked to the Portuguese Renaissance (Renascença Portuguesa), such as [[Teixeira de Pascoaes|Teixeira de Pascoais]], [[Jaime Cortesão]], Mário Beirão, among others, who can be considered Neo-Romantics. An early Portuguese expression of Romanticism is found already in poets such as [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]] (especially in his sonnets dated at the end of the 18th century) and [[Leonor de Almeida Portugal, 4th Marquise of Alorna|Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna]].&lt;ref name="José"/&gt;

===Italy===

Romanticism in Italian literature was a minor movement, yet still important; it began officially in 1816 when [[Germaine de Staël]] wrote an article in the journal ''Biblioteca italiana'' called "Sulla maniera e l'utilità delle traduzioni", inviting Italian people to reject [[Neoclassicism]] and to study new authors from other countries. Before that date, [[Ugo Foscolo]] had already published poems anticipating Romantic themes. The most important Romantic writers were [[Ludovico di Breme]], Pietro Borsieri and [[Giovanni Berchet]]. Better known authors such as [[Alessandro Manzoni]] and [[Giacomo Leopardi]] were influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as well as by Romanticism and Classicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La nuova enciclopedia della letteratura|publisher=Garzanti|location=Milan|year=1985|page=829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
[[File:Grecian-Gothic neoclassical-romantic style-contrast 1816-Repton.jpg|thumb|A print exemplifying the contrast between neoclassical vs. romantic styles of landscape and architecture (or the "Grecian" and the "Gothic" as they are termed here), 1816]]
Spanish-speaking South American Romanticism was influenced heavily by [[Esteban Echeverría]], who wrote in the 1830 and 1840s. His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], and filled with themes of blood and terror, using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas' dictatorship.

Brazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods. The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity, using the ideal of the heroic Indian. Some examples include [[José de Alencar]], who wrote ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', and [[Gonçalves Dias]], renowned by the poem "[[Canção do exílio]]" (Song of the Exile). The second period, sometimes called [[Ultra-Romanticism]], is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love.

[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Savage State 1836.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cole]], ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]: The Savage State'' (1 of 5), 1836]]
In the United States, at least by 1818 with William Cullen Bryant's "[[To a Waterfowl]]", Romantic poetry was being published. American Romantic [[Gothic literature]] made an early appearance with [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820) and ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1819), followed from 1823 onwards by the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'' of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already-exotic mythicized frontier peopled by "[[noble savage]]s", similar to the philosophical theory of [[Rousseau]], exemplified by [[Uncas]], from ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. There are picturesque "local color" elements in Washington Irving's essays and especially his travel books. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home, but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and [[melodrama]] of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850). Later [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] writers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] still show elements of its influence and imagination, as does the [[romantic realism]] of [[Walt Whitman]]. The poetry of [[Emily Dickinson]]—nearly unread in her own time—and [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature. By the 1880s, however, psychological and [[social realism]] were competing with Romanticism in the novel.

====Influence of European Romanticism on American writers====
The European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century. American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe. Like the Europeans, the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm, commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self, an emphasis on intuitive perception, and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good, while human society was filled with corruption.&lt;ref name="George L 1997 p 613"&gt;George L. McMichael and Frederick C. Crews, eds. ''Anthology of American Literature: Colonial through romantic'' (6th ed. 1997) p. 613&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanticism became popular in American politics, philosophy and art. The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement. The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect. It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism, which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained. The Romantic movement gave rise to [[New England]] [[Transcendentalism]], which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe. The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God. Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion, for both privileged feeling over reason, individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. It often involved a rapturous response to nature. It encouraged the rejection of harsh, rigid Calvinism, and promised a new blossoming of American culture.&lt;ref name="George L 1997 p 613"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Romanticism, American", in ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'' ed by Ann Lee Morgan (Oxford University Press, 2007) [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t238.e1140 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

American Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition. The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers. Novels, short stories, and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore. Romantic literature was personal, intense, and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature. America's preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy. They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters, and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship of the American poet Wallace Stevens to Romanticism is raised in the poem "[[Another Weeping Woman]]" and its commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:The Bard (1774).jpeg|thumb|largethumb|[[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]], ''The Bard'', 1774, a prophetic combination of Romanticism and nationalism by the Welsh artist]]

In the visual arts, Romanticism first showed itself in [[landscape painting]], where from as early as the 1760s British artists began to turn to wilder landscapes and storms, and [[Gothic architecture]], even if they had to make do with [[Welsh art|Wales as a setting]]. [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] were born less than a year apart in 1774 and 1775 respectively and were to take German and English landscape painting to their extremes of Romanticism, but both their artistic sensibilities were formed when forms of Romanticism was already strongly present in art. [[John Constable]], born in 1776, stayed closer to the English landscape tradition, but in his largest "six-footers" insisted on the heroic status of a patch of the working countryside where he had grown up—challenging the traditional [[hierarchy of genres]], which relegated landscape painting to a low status. Turner also painted very large landscapes, and above all, seascapes. Some of these large paintings had contemporary settings and [[staffage]], but others had small figures that turned the work into [[history painting]] in the manner of [[Claude Lorrain]], like [[Salvator Rosa]] a [[late Baroque]] artist whose landscapes had elements that Romantic painters repeatedly turned to.  Friedrich often used single figures, or features like crosses, set alone amidst a huge landscape, "making them images of the transitoriness of human life and the premonition of death."&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 96–101, 99 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups of artists expressed feelings that verged on the mystical, many largely abandoning classical drawing and proportions.  These included [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]] and the other members of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] in England, and in Germany [[Philipp Otto Runge]]. Like Friedrich, none of these artists had significant influence after their deaths for the rest of the 19th century, and were 20th century rediscoveries from obscurity, though Blake was always known as a poet, and Norway's leading painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]] was heavily influenced by Friedrich. The Rome-based [[Nazarene movement]] of German artists, active from 1810, took a very different path, concentrating on medievalizing history paintings with religious and nationalist themes.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 112–21&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', 1800–02]]

The arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of [[Neoclassicism]] on the academies, but from the [[Napoleonic]] period it became increasingly popular, initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime, of which [[Girodet]]'s ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', for Napoleon's [[Château de Malmaison]], was one of the earliest.  Girodet's old teacher [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil's direction, saying: "Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 184–190, 187 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  A new generation of the French school,&lt;ref&gt;Walter Friedlaender, ''From David to Delacroix'', 1974, remains the best available account of the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; developed personal Romantic styles, though still concentrating on history painting with a political message. [[Théodore Géricault]] (1791–1824) had his first success with ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'', a heroic military figure derived from [[Rubens]], at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1812 in the years of the Empire, but his next major completed work, ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' of 1821, remains the greatest achievement of the Romantic history painting, which in its day had a powerful anti-government message.

[[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863) made his first Salon hits with ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822), ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827). The second was a scene from the Greek War of Independence, completed the year Byron died there, and the last was a scene from one of Byron's plays. With Shakespeare, Byron was to provide the subject matter for many other works of Delacroix, who also spent long periods in North Africa, painting colourful scenes of mounted Arab warriors. His ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830) remains, with the ''Medusa'', one of the best-known works of French Romantic painting. Both reflected current events, and increasingly "[[history painting]]", literally "story painting", a phrase dating back to the Italian Renaissance meaning the painting of subjects with groups of figures, long considered the highest and most difficult form of art, did indeed become the painting of historical scenes, rather than those from religion or mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm|title=Romanticism|website=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Goya]] was called "the last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 142&lt;/ref&gt;  But the extent to which he was a Romantic is a complex question. In Spain, there was still a struggle to introduce the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in which Goya saw himself as a participant.  The demonic and anti-rational monsters thrown up by his imagination are only superficially similar to those of the Gothic fantasies of northern Europe, and in many ways he remained wedded to the classicism and realism of his training, as well as looking forward to the Realism of the later 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 133–42&lt;/ref&gt; But he, more than any other artist of the period, exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist's feelings and his personal imaginative world.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 279–80&lt;/ref&gt;  He also shared with many of the Romantic painters a more free handling of paint, emphasized in the new prominence of the brushstroke and [[impasto]], which tended to be repressed in neoclassicism under a self-effacing finish.
[[File:Cavalier gaulois pont d'iena RG am face.jpg|thumb|''Cavalier gaulois'' by [[Antoine-Augustin Préault]], [[Pont d'Iéna]], Paris]]

[[Sculpture]] remained largely impervious to Romanticism, probably partly for technical reasons, as the most prestigious material of the day, marble, does not lend itself to expansive gestures. The leading sculptors in Europe, [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], were both based in Rome and firm Neoclassicists, not at all tempted to allow influence from medieval sculpture, which would have been one possible approach to Romantic sculpture. When it did develop, true Romantic sculpture—with the exception of a few artists such as [[Rudolf Maison]]—&lt;ref&gt;McKay, James, ''The Dictionary of Sculptors in Bronze'', Antique Collectors Club, London, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; rather oddly was missing in Germany, and mainly found in France, with [[François Rude]], best known from his group of the 1830s from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, [[David d'Angers]], and [[Auguste Préault]]. Préault's plaster relief entitled ''Slaughter'', which represented the horrors of wars with exacerbated passion, caused so much scandal at the 1834 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] that Préault was banned from this official annual exhibition for nearly twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 397, 379–84&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the most important Romantic sculptor was [[Lorenzo Bartolini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dizionario di arte e letteratura|publisher=Zanichelli|location=Bologna|year=2002|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, historical painting on idealized medieval and Renaissance themes is known as the [[Troubadour style|''style Troubadour'']], a term with no equivalent for other countries, though the same trends occurred there. Delacroix, [[Ingres]] and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] all worked in this style, as did lesser specialists such as [[Pierre-Henri Révoil]] (1776–1842) and [[Fleury-François Richard]] (1777–1852). Their pictures are often small, and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments, as well as those of high drama. The lives of great artists such as [[Raphael]] were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted. Fleury-Richard's ''Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband'', shown in the [[Paris Salon]] of 1802, marked the arrival of the style, which lasted until the mid-century, before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like [[Paul Delaroche]].&lt;ref&gt;Noon, throughout, especially pp. 124–155&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hayez, Fracesco - Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem - 1836-50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Francesco Hayez]], ''Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem'']]

Another trend was for very large apocalyptic history paintings, often combining extreme natural events, or divine wrath, with human disaster, attempting to outdo ''The Raft of the Medusa'', and now often drawing comparisons with effects from Hollywood. The leading English artist in the style was [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and worked his way through the biblical disasters, and those to come in the [[Christian eschatology|final days]]. Other works such as Delacroix's ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially [[Poussin]] and [[Rubens]], with extra emotionalism and special effects.

Elsewhere in Europe, leading artists adopted Romantic styles: in Russia there were the portraitists [[Orest Kiprensky]] and [[Vasily Tropinin]], with [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] specializing in [[marine painting]], and in Norway [[Hans Gude]] painted scenes of [[fjord]]s. In Italy [[Francesco Hayez]] (1791–1882) was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid-19th-century [[Milan]].  His long, prolific and extremely successful career saw him begin as a Neoclassical painter, pass right through the Romantic period, and emerge at the other end as a sentimental painter of young women. His Romantic period included many historical pieces of "Troubadour" tendencies, but on a very large scale, that are heavily influenced by [[Gian Battista Tiepolo]] and other [[late Baroque]] Italian masters.

Literary Romanticism had its counterpart in the American visual arts, most especially in the exaltation of an untamed American [[Landscape art|landscape]] found in the paintings of the [[Hudson River School]]. Painters like [[Thomas Cole]], [[Albert Bierstadt]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church]] and others often expressed Romantic themes in their paintings. They sometimes depicted ancient ruins of the old world, such as in Fredric Edwin Church's piece ''Sunrise in Syria''. These works reflected the Gothic feelings of death and decay. They also show the Romantic ideal that Nature is powerful and will eventually overcome the transient creations of men. More often, they worked to distinguish themselves from their European counterparts by depicting uniquely American scenes and landscapes. This idea of an American identity in the art world is reflected in [[W. C. Bryant]]'s poem, ''To Cole, the Painter, Departing for Europe'', where Bryant encourages Cole to remember the powerful scenes that can only be found in America.

Some American paintings (such as Albert Bierstadt's ''[[The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak]]'') promote the literary idea of the "[[noble savage]]" by portraying idealized Native Americans living in harmony with the natural world. Thomas Cole's paintings tend towards [[allegory]], explicit in ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series painted in the early 1840s, showing the stages of life set amidst an awesome and immense nature.

==Music==

[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]], painted by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]], 1820]]
Musical Romanticism is predominantly a German phenomenon—so much so that one respected French reference work defines it entirely in terms of "The role of music in the aesthetics of German romanticism".&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 1961, 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Another French encyclopedia holds that the German temperament generally "can be described as the deep and diverse action of romanticism on German musicians", and that there is only one true representative of Romanticism in French music, [[Hector Berlioz]], while in Italy, the sole great name of musical Romanticism is [[Giuseppe Verdi]], "a sort of [Victor] Hugo of opera, gifted with a real genius for dramatic effect". Nevertheless, the huge popularity of German Romantic music led, "whether by imitation or by reaction", to an often nationalistically inspired vogue amongst Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Czech, and Scandinavian musicians, successful "perhaps more because of its extra-musical traits than for the actual value of musical works by its masters".&lt;ref&gt;Ferchault 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term "Romanticism" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of "romantic" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation. Indeed, one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789, in the ''Mémoires'' of [[André Grétry]].&lt;ref&gt;Grétre 1789.&lt;/ref&gt; This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans, but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (himself a composer, amongst other things) and, by so doing, establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally.&lt;ref name="Samson 2001"&gt;Samson 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810 [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] named [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as "the three masters of instrumental compositions" who "breathe one and the same romantic spirit". He justified his view on the basis of these composers' depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality. In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, "a child-like, serene disposition prevails", while Mozart (in the late [[Symphony No. 39 (Mozart)|E-flat major Symphony]], for example) "leads us into the depths of the spiritual world", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, "a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of "the monstrous and immeasurable", with the pain of an endless longing that "will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann 1810, col. 632.&lt;/ref&gt; This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder|Wackenroder]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and later by writers such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 1961, 585–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

This chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century, when [[Richard Wagner]] denigrated the music of [[Meyerbeer]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] as "[[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]]": "The Opera, to which we shall now return, has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz, too, as a plump, fine-flavoured oyster, whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well-to-do appearance."&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1995, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of ''Musikwissenschaft'' ([[musicology]])—itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age—attempted a more scientific [[periodization]] of music history, and a distinction between [[Classical period (music)|Viennese Classical]] and Romantic periods was proposed. The key figure in this trend was [[Guido Adler]], who viewed Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]] as transitional but essentially Classical composers, with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post-Beethoven generation of [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Robert Schumann]], Berlioz, and [[Franz Liszt]]. From Adler's viewpoint, found in books like ''Der Stil in der Musik'' (1911), composers of the [[New German School]] and various late-19th-century [[Musical nationalism|nationalist]] composers were not Romantics but "moderns" or "realists" (by analogy with the fields of painting and literature), and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Samson 2001"/&gt;

By the second quarter of the 20th century, an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint, and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past. This in turn led historians such as [[Alfred Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;Einstein 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; to extend the musical "[[Romantic music|Romantic Era]]" throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th. It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]''&lt;ref&gt;Warrack 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Jay Grout|Grout's]] ''History of Western Music''&lt;ref&gt;Grout 1960, 492.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not unchallenged. For example, the prominent German musicologist [[Friedrich Blume]], the chief editor of the first edition of ''[[Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'' (1949–86), accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century, but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century, including such pre–World War II developments as [[Expressionist music|expressionism]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blume 1970; Samson 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''&lt;ref name="Samson 2001"/&gt; and the new edition of ''[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wehnert 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contemporary music culture, the romantic musician followed a public career depending on sensitive middle-class audiences rather than on a courtly patron, as had been the case with earlier musicians and composers. Public persona characterized a new generation of virtuosi who made their way as soloists, epitomized in the concert tours of [[Paganini]] and [[Liszt]], and the conductor began to emerge as an important figure, on whose skill the interpretation of the increasingly complex music depended.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 176–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sciences===
{{Main|Romanticism in science}}
The Romantic movement affected most aspects of intellectual life, and [[Romanticism in science|Romanticism and science]] had a powerful connection, especially in the period 1800–40. Many scientists were influenced by versions of the ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and others, and without abandoning [[empiricism]], sought in their work to uncover what they tended to believe was a unified and organic Nature. The English scientist Sir [[Humphry Davy]], a prominent Romantic thinker, said that understanding nature required "an attitude of admiration, love and worship, [...] a personal response."&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that knowledge was only attainable by those who truly appreciated and respected nature.  Self-understanding was an important aspect of Romanticism.  It had less to do with proving that man was capable of understanding nature (through his budding intellect) and therefore controlling it, and more to do with the emotional appeal of connecting himself with nature and understanding it through a harmonious co-existence.&lt;ref&gt;Bossi, M., and Poggi, S., ed. ''Romanticism in Science: Science in Europe, 1790–1840'', p.xiv; Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historiography===
[[Historiography|History writing]] was very strongly, and many would say harmfully, influenced by Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Sreedharan|title=A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJVoi3PIejwC&amp;pg=PR9|year=2004|publisher=Orient Blackswan|pages=128–68|isbn=978-8125026570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In England [[Thomas Carlyle]] was a highly influential essayist who turned historian; he both invented and exemplified the phrase "hero-worship",&lt;ref&gt;in his published lectures ''[[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History]]'' of 1841&lt;/ref&gt; lavishing largely uncritical praise on strong leaders such as [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Frederick the Great]] and Napoleon.  Romantic nationalism had a largely negative effect on the writing of history in the 19th century, as each nation tended to [[Historiography and nationalism|produce its own version of history]], and the critical attitude, even cynicism, of earlier historians was often replaced by a tendency to create romantic stories with clearly distinguished heroes and villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ceri Crossley|title=French Historians and Romanticism: Thierry, Guizot, the Saint-Simonians, Quinet, Michelet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovaIAgAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134976683}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Nationalist ideology of the period placed great emphasis on racial coherence, and the antiquity of peoples, and tended to vastly over-emphasize the continuity between past periods and the present, leading to [[national mysticism]].  Much historical effort in the 20th century was devoted to combating the romantic historical myths created in the 19th century.

===Theology===
To insulate theology from [[reductionism]] in science, 19th-century post-Enlightenment German theologians moved in a new direction, led by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Albrecht Ritschl]]. They took the Romantic approach of rooting religion in the inner world of the human spirit, so that it is a person's feeling or sensibility about spiritual matters that comprises religion.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Clayton and Zachary Simpson, eds. ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science'' (2006) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Romantic chess]] was the style of [[chess]] which emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.&lt;ref name="Shenk, 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Shenk |title=The Immortal Game: A History of Chess |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWf71WaEnLgC&amp;pg=PT99 |year=2007 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=99|isbn=978-0307387660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic era in chess is generally considered to have begun with Joseph MacDonnell and Pierre LaBourdonnais, the two dominant chess players in the 1830s. The 1840s was dominated by Howard Staunton, and other leading players of the era included Adolf Anderssen, Daniel Harrwitz, Henry Bird, Louis Paulsen, and Paul Morphy. The "[[Immortal Game]]", played by [[Adolf Anderssen]] and [[Lionel Kieseritzky]] on [[21 June]] 1851 in London—where Anderssen made bold [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]] to secure victory, giving up both [[rook (chess)|rooks]] and a bishop, then his [[queen (chess)|queen]], and then [[checkmate|checkmating]] his opponent with his three remaining [[minor piece]]s—is considered a supreme example of Romantic chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Teach Yourself Chess |author=[[William Hartston|Hartston, Bill]] |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |isbn=978-0340670392 |year=1996 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the Romantic era in chess is considered to be the [[Vienna 1873 chess tournament|1873 Vienna Tournament]] where [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] popularized positional play and the closed game.

One of Romanticism's key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of [[national language]]s and [[folklore]], and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning. One of the most important functions of medieval references in the 19th century was nationalist. Popular and epic poetry were its workhorses. This is visible in Germany and Ireland, where underlying Germanic or Celtic [[Stratum (linguistics)|linguistic substrates]] dating from before the Romanization-Latinization were sought out.

Early Romantic nationalism was strongly inspired by [[Rousseau]], and by the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], who in 1784 argued that the geography formed the natural economy of a people, and shaped their customs and society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The nature of nationalism changed dramatically, however, after the [[French Revolution]] with the rise of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]], and the reactions in other nations. Napoleonic nationalism and republicanism were, at first, inspirational to movements in other nations: self-determination and a consciousness of national unity were held to be two of the reasons why France was able to defeat other countries in battle. But as the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] became [[First French Empire|Napoleon's Empire]], Napoleon became not the inspiration for nationalism, but the object of its struggle. In [[Prussia]], the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in [[Napoleonic Wars|the struggle against Napoleon]] was argued by, among others, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], a disciple of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The word ''[[Volkstum]]'', or nationality, was coined in German as part of this resistance to the now conquering emperor. Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his address "To the German Nation" in 1806:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole. ...Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality—then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be.&lt;ref name="Fichte"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1806fichte.asp | title=Address to the German Nation | publisher=Fordham University | date=1806 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | author=Fichte, Johann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view of nationalism inspired the collection of [[folklore]] by such people as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the revival of old epics as national, and the construction of new epics as if they were old, as in the ''[[Kalevala]]'', compiled from Finnish tales and folklore, or ''[[Ossian]]'', where the claimed ancient roots were invented. The view that fairy tales, unless contaminated from outside literary sources, were preserved in the same form over thousands of years, was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists, but fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people. For instance, the Brothers Grimm rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by [[Charles Perrault]], which they thought proved they were not truly German tales;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 31 {{ISBN|0691067228}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' survived in their collection because the tale of [[Brynhildr]] convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German. [[Vuk Karadžić]]  contributed to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation. He regarded the oral literature of the peasants as an integral part of Serbian culture, compiling it to use in his collections of folk songs, tales, and proverbs, as well as the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prilozi za književnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=Државна штампарија Краљевине Срба, Хрвата и Словенаца|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&amp;dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar projects were undertaken by the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846, {{ISBN|039397636X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polish nationalism and messianism ===
Romanticism played an essential role in the national awakening of many Central European peoples lacking their own national states, not least in Poland, which had recently failed to restore its independence when [[Imperial Russian Army|Russia's army]] crushed the [[November Uprising|Polish Uprising]] under [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Revival and reinterpretation of ancient myths, customs and traditions by Romantic poets and painters helped to distinguish their indigenous cultures from those of the dominant nations and crystallise the mythography of [[Romantic nationalism]]. Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. Arguably, the most distinguished Romantic poet of this part of Europe was [[Adam Mickiewicz]], who developed an idea that [[Christ of Europe|Poland was the Messiah of Nations]], predestined to suffer just as [[Jesus]] had suffered to save all the people. The Polish self-image as a "[[Christ of Europe|Christ among nations]]" or the martyr of Europe can be traced back to its history of [[Christendom]] and suffering under invasions. During the periods of foreign occupation, the Catholic Church served as bastion of Poland's national identity and language, and the major promoter of [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]]. The [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] came to be seen in Poland as a Polish sacrifice for the security for [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. Adam Mickiewicz wrote the patriotic drama [[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]] (directed against the Russians) where he depicts Poland as the Christ of Nations. He also wrote "Verily I say unto you, it is not for you to learn civilization from foreigners, but it is you who are to teach them civilization ... You are among the foreigners like the Apostles among the idolaters". In "[[Books of the Polish nation and Polish pilgrimage]]" Mickiewicz detailed his vision of Poland as a Messias and a Christ of Nations, that would save mankind. Dziady is known for various interpretation. The most known ones are the moral aspect of part II, [[individualist]] and romantic message of part IV, as well as deeply patriotic, messianistic and Christian vision in part III of poem. Zdzisław Kępiński, however, focuses his interpretation on [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan]] and [[occult]] elements found in the drama. In his book ''Mickiewicz hermetyczny'' he writes about [[Hermeticism|hermetic]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophic]] and [[Alchemy|alchemical]] philosophy on the book as well as [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] symbols.

'''Simka Simkhovitch''' ({{lang|ru|Симха Файбусович Симхович}}) (aka Simka Faibusovich Simkhovich) ([[Novozybkov]], Russia May 21, 1885 [[Old Style and New Style dates#Eastern Europe|O.S.]]/June 2, 1885 N.S.—[[Greenwich, Connecticut]] February 25, 1949) was a Russian artist and immigrant to the United States. He painted theater scenery in his early career and then had several showings in galleries in [[New York City]]. Winning [[Works Progress Administration]] commissions in the 1930s, he completed murals for the post offices in Jackson, Mississippi and Beaufort, North Carolina. His works are in the permanent collections of the Dallas Museum of Art, the National Museum of American Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

==Biography==
Simka Faibusovich Simkhovitch was born on May 21, 1885 [[Old Style and New Style dates#Eastern Europe|O.S.]]/June 2, 1885 N.S. into a [[History of the Jews in Russia|Jewish]] family in [[Novozybkov]], Russia,{{sfn|Art Investment Russia|2010}} who owned a small department store. During a severe case of measles when he was seven, Simkhovitch sketched the views outside his window and decided to become an artist, over his father's objections.{{sfn|''Life''|1941|p=38}} Beginning in 1905, he studied at the [[Grekov Odessa Art school|Grekov Odessa Art School]] and upon completion of his studies in 1911 received a recommendation to be admitted to the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. Though he enrolled to begin classes in architecture, painting, and sculpture at the Imperial Academy, he was dropped from the school roster in December because of the quota on the number of Jewish students and drafted into the army. Simkhovitch served as a private in the {{Interlanguage link multi|175th Infantry Regiment Baturyn|ru|3=Батуринский 175-й пехотный полк}} until his demobilization in 1912. Re-enrolling in the Imperial Academy, he audited classes.{{sfn|Art Investment Russia|2010}}

==Career==
Simkhovitch exhibited paintings and sculptures in 1918 as part of an exhibition of Jewish artists and in 1919 placed 1st in the competition "The Great Russian Revolution"{{sfn|Art Investment Russia|2010}} with a painting called "Russian Revolution" which was hung in the [[Museum of Political History of Russia (St. Petersburg)|State Museum of Revolution]].{{sfn|Watson|1931|p=8}} In 1922, Simkhovitch exhibited at the International Book Fair in Florence ({{lang-it|Fiera Internazionale del Libro di Firenze}}).{{sfn|Art Investment Russia|2010}} In 1924, Simkhovitch came to the United States{{sfn|''The Bridgeport Post''|1947|p=31}} to make illustrations for Soviet textbooks and decided to immigrate instead. Initially he supported himself by doing commercial art and a few portrait commissions.{{sfn|''Life''|1941|p=38}} In 1927, he was hired to paint a screen for a scene in the play "The Command to Love" by [[Fritz Gottwald]] and [[Rudolf Lothar|Rudolph Lothar]] which was playing at the [[Longacre Theatre]] on [[Theater District, Manhattan|Broadway]]. Art dealers began clamoring for the screen and Simkhovitch began a career as a screen painter for the theater.{{sfn|Halasz|1927|p=63}} Catching the attention of the screenwriter, [[Ernest Pascal]], he worked as an illustrator for Pascal, who then introduced him to gallery owner, Marie Sterner.{{sfn|Christie's|2012}} Simkhovitch's works appeared at the Marie Sterner Gallery beginning with a 1927 exhibit and were repeated the following year.{{sfn|Art Investment Russia|2010}} Simkhovitch had an exhibit in 1929 at Sterner's on circus paintings.{{sfn|''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle''|1929|p=57}} In 1931, he held a showing of works at the Helen Hackett Gallery, in New York City{{sfn|Watson|1931|p=8}} and later that same year he was one of the featured artists of a special exhibit in [[San Francisco]] at the [[Legion of Honor (museum)|California Palace of the Legion of Honor]] in [[Lincoln Park (San Francisco)|Lincoln Park]]. The exhibit was coordinated by Marie Sterner and included four watercolors, including one titled "Nudes".{{sfn|''Berkeley Daily Gazette''|1947|p=5}}

In 1936, Simkhovitch was selected to compete the mural for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] [[United States post office murals|Post office project]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. The mural was hung in the post office and courthouse in 1938 depicted a plantation theme. In the 1970s, it was the source of repeated controversy for its depiction of stereotypical imagery and during various courthouse remodels was covered.{{sfn|''Biloxi Sun Herald''|1976|p=52}}{{sfn|''The Delta Democrat-Times''|1971|p=3}} The following year, his painting "Holiday" won praise at an exhibition in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]].{{sfn|''Lincoln Sunday Journal and Star''|1939|p=29}} In 1940, Simkhovitch's second WPA post office project was completed when four murals, "The Cape Lookout Lighthouse and the Orville W. Mail Boat", "The Wreck of the Crissie Wright", "Sand Ponies" and "Canada Geese" were installed in [[Beaufort, North Carolina]]. The works were commissioned in 1938 and did not generate the controversy that the Jackson mural had.{{sfn|Davis|2008|p=24}} The main mural is "The Wreck of the Crissie Wright" and depicts a shipwreck which had occurred in Beaufort in 1866. "The Cape Lookout Lighthouse and the Orville W. Mail Boat" depicted the lighthouse built in 1859 and the mail boat that was running mail during the time which Simkhovitch was there. The boat ran mail for the area until 1957. "Sand Ponies" shows the wild horses common to the North Carolina barrier islands and "Canada Geese" showed the importance of hunting and fishing in the area. All four murals were restored in the 1990s by [[Elisabeth Speight]], daughter of two other WPA muralists, [[Francis Speight (painter)|Francis Speight]]{{sfn|Davis|2008|p=25}} and his wife [[Sarah Blakeslee (painter)|Sarah Jane Blakeslee]].{{sfn|Davis|2008|p=81}}

Simkhovitch's work was selected for a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'' article and in 1940 the artists whose work would appear were highlighted in an exhibit at Morrill Hall on the campus of the [[University of Nebraska]].{{sfn|''The Lincoln Star''|1941|p=8}} He also had a one-man show that year in [[Manhattan]]. The 4-page ''Life'' feature appeared in the December 29, 1941 edition of the magazine{{sfn|''Life''|1941|p=38-41}} and showed Simkhovich's home and studio in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]{{sfn|''Life''|1941|p=39}} as well as photographs of his wife, the model Elsa Forne, and two of their three daughters, Sonya and Naomi.{{sfn|Christie's|2012}}{{sfn|''Life''|1941|p=41}} Simkhovitch continued to paint and do illustrations. In 1946, he sold a painting "Sonya with Fruit" to [[Upjohn]] to use in cough medicine advertising, which was included in an exhibit of the Upjohn Collection.{{sfn|''The Saturday Spectator''|1946|p=6}} The following year, he did his first gallery showing in Connecticut at the [[Sterling House]] in [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]].{{sfn|''The Bridgeport Post''|1947|p=31}} In February 1949, Simkhovitch and his wife bought a new home in [[Milford, Connecticut]], but Simkhovitch contracted pneumonia during the move. He died after a brief illness on 25 February 1949{{sfn|Christie's|2012}} in Greenwich, Connecticut.{{sfn|Art Investment Russia|2010}}

==Legacy==
Subsequent to his death, Simkhovitch's papers were donated to the Archives of American Art at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1989.{{sfn|Smithsonian Institution|1989}} His works are part of the permanent collections of the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], the
[[National Museum of American Art]] and the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], as well as other collections.{{sfn|AskArt|2016}}

'''Stephen James Joyce''' (born 15 February 1932) is the grandson of [[James Joyce]] and the [[executor]] of Joyce's estate. He was born in France, the son of James Joyce's son, [[Giorgio Joyce|Giorgio]], and Helen Joyce, née Kastor.  Stephen attended [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1958. At Harvard, he once roomed with [[Paul Matisse]], grandson of French impressionist painter [[Henri Matisse]], and with [[Sadruddin Aga Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050244.html Pure Fabrications (May-June 2002)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203192353/http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050244.html |date=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he worked for the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] on African development.  He retired from the OECD in 1991 to focus on managing his grandfather's estate.  He and his wife, Solange Raythchine Joyce, live in the [[Île de Ré]] in France.  They have no children; Stephen is James Joyce's sole living descendant.&lt;ref&gt;Max, D. T.

Stephen Joyce and Seán Sweeney are the joint trustees of the Estate of James Joyce. Stephen Joyce has taken an active role in all legal matters relating to Joyce's works.&lt;ref&gt;The International James Joyce Foundation. [https://joycefoundation.osu.edu/joyce-copyright Joyce &amp; Copyright].  Retrieved on 6 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has brought numerous [[lawsuit]]s or threats of legal action against scholars, biographers, and artists attempting to quote from Joyce's literary work or personal correspondence.&lt;ref name=bowker/&gt;  

In 2004, Stephen Joyce threatened legal action against the Irish government when the ''Rejoyce Dublin 2004'' festival proposed public reading of excerpts of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' on [[Bloomsday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol2-3/bloomsday.asp|title=Bloomsday: Copyright Estates and Cultural Festivals|first=Matthew|last=Rimmer|publisher=SCRIPTed|year=2005|accessdate=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he destroyed a collection of letters written by [[Lucia Joyce]], his aunt.&lt;ref&gt;(Stanley, Alessandra.

Retrieved 9 July 2007). Stephen Joyce stated in a letter to the editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "Regarding the destroyed correspondence, these were all personal letters from Lucia to us. They were written many years after both Nonno and Nonna [i.e. Mr and Mrs Joyce] died and did not refer to them. Also destroyed were some postcards and one telegram from [[Samuel Beckett]] to Lucia. This was done at Sam's written request."{{cite news | url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DB103DF932A05751C1A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 | last= Joyce | first= Stephen | title=  The Private Lives of Writers | work= The New York Times|date = 31 December 1989|accessdate=9 November 2009|format=Letter to the Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 he forced [[Brenda Maddox]] to delete a postscript concerning Lucia from her biography ''Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom''.&lt;ref name=bowker/&gt; After 1995 he announced no permissions would be granted to quote from his grandfather's work.&lt;ref name=bowker/&gt; Libraries holding letters by James Joyce were unable to show them without permission.&lt;ref name=bowker/&gt; Versions of his work online were disallowed.&lt;ref name=bowker/&gt; Stephen Joyce claimed to be protecting his grandfather's and his family's reputation, but would sometimes grant permission to use material in exchange for fees that were often "extortionate".&lt;ref name=bowker&gt;Bowker, Gordon.

On 13 January 2011, on the 70th anniversary of James Joyce's death, all of his works entered the [[public domain]]&lt;ref name=bowker/&gt; in much of the world, a transition "talked up in certain quarters as though it were a bookish version of the destruction of the Death Star, with Stephen Joyce cast as a highbrow Darth Vader suddenly no longer in a position to breathe heavily down the necks of rebel Joyceans."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/has-james-joyce-been-set-free Has James Joyce Been Set Free?], ''The New Yorker'', January 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, however, some of his work remains protected by copyright. Prior to this, in 2007, Stephen Joyce's hold on the estate had already been delimited by a fair use suit brought by Carol Loeb Schloss and the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society's Fair Use Project.&lt;ref name=bowker/&gt;

When the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] issued a ten euro James Joyce [[Commemorative coins of Ireland|commemorative coin]] on 10 April 2013, Stephen Joyce described the coin and the circumstances of its issue as "one of the greatest insults to the Joyce family that has ever been perpetrated in Ireland". He complained of a lack of consultation over the coin; he objected to an error in a Joycean quotation inscribed on the coin; he was upset by the design of the portrait of the writer on the coin, calling it "the most unlikely likeness of Joyce ever produced"; and he described as highly insensitive and offensive the decision to issue the coin on the anniversary of the death of his grandmother, [[Nora Barnacle|Nora Joyce]], who died in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/joyce-grandson-describes-central-bank-coin-one-of-the-greatest-insults-to-joyce-family-1.1359033 Joyce grandson describes Central Bank coin ‘one of the greatest insults to Joyce family’] Irish Times, 2013-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TabulaRogeriana upside-down.jpg|thumb|350px|A modern copy of the ''Tabula Rogeriana'' made by {{ill|Konrad Miller|de}}, upside-down with North oriented up.]]
[[File:Al-Idrisi's world map.JPG|thumb|300px|Al-Idrisi's world map from 'Alî ibn Hasan al-Hûfî al-Qâsimî's 1456 copy. According to the French National Library, "Ten copies of the Kitab Rujar or Tabula Rogeriana exist worldwide today. Of these ten, six contain at the start of the work a circular map of the world which is not mentioned in the text of al-Idris". The original text dates to 1154. Note that south is at the top of the map.]]
The '''''Nuzhat al-mushtāq fi'khtirāq al-āfāq''''' ({{lang-ar|نزهة المشتاق في اختراق الآفاق}}, lit. "the book of pleasant journeys into faraway lands"), most often known as the '''''Tabula Rogeriana''''' (lit. "'''''The Book of Roger'''''" in [[Latin]]), is a description of the world and [[world map]] created by the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]], [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], in 1154. Al-Idrisi worked on the commentaries and illustrations of the map for fifteen years at the court of the [[Normans|Norman]] King [[Roger II of Sicily]], who commissioned the work around 1138.&lt;ref name=houben&gt;Houben, 2002, pp. 102-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley &amp; Woodward, 1992, pp. 156-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book, written in [[Arabic]], is divided into seven climate zones (in keeping with the [[Clime|established Ptolemaic system]]), each of which is sub-divided into ten sections, and contains maps showing the [[Eurasia]]n continent in its entirety, but only the northern part of the [[Africa]]n continent. The map is [[South-up map orientation|oriented with the North at the bottom]]. It remained the most accurate world map for the next three centuries.&lt;ref name=harley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt; The text incorporates exhaustive descriptions of the physical, cultural, political and socioeconomic conditions of each region and each of the seventy sections has a corresponding map.&lt;ref name=harley/&gt;&lt;ref name=bacharach&gt;Bacharach, 2006, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

To produce the work, al-Idrisi interviewed experienced travelers individually and in groups on their knowledge of the world and compiled "only that part... on which there was complete agreement and seemed credible, excluding what was contradictory."&lt;ref name=houben/&gt; Roger II had his map engraved on a silver disc weighing about 300 pounds.&lt;ref name=houben/&gt; It showed, in al-Idrisi's words, "the seven climatic regions, with their respective countries and districts, coasts and lands, gulfs and seas, watercourses and river mouths."&lt;ref name=houben/&gt;  

Al-Idrisi settled in [[Palermo, Sicily]], at the tolerant and enlightened court of the Norman king [[Roger II of Sicily]], where he was charged with the production of a book on [[geography]]. It was to contain all available data on the location and climate of the world’s main centers of population. King Roger himself enthusiastically interviewed travelers passing through his kingdom, and agents and draftsmen were dispatched to gather material—a research process that took some 15 years. In 1154, just a few weeks before the king died, al-Idrisi’s book was finally complete. 

Written in Arabic and Latin and accompanied by maps, it presented the world as a sphere. It calculated the circumference to be 37,000 kilometres (22,900 mi) — an error of less than 10 percent — and it hinted at the concept of gravity. Following the classical Greek tradition, al-Idrisi had divided the world into seven [[climate zones]] and described each in turn, supported by 70 longitudinal section maps which, when put together, made a rectangular map of the known world. This was complemented by a smaller, circular world map in which the south was drawn at the top and [[Arabia]], being the site of [[Mecca]], was depicted centrally. Al-Idrisi’s book came to be known as '''Kitab Rujar''' (Roger’s Book) and the circular world map was engraved onto a silver tablet. Sadly, both the book and the silver map appear to have been destroyed during civil unrest shortly afterward, in 1160. Thus our understanding today of al-Idrisi’s conclusions is based on an abbreviated version of a second book that he wrote for Roger’s son, William II. Manuscripts of this so-called “Little Idrisi” are held today in a handful of European libraries."&lt;ref&gt;Parry, James V. 2004. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200401/mapping.arabia.htm "Mapping Arabia."] Saudi Aramco World. January/February 2004. Pages 20-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the work of al-Idrisi, S. P. Scott commented: 

{{quote|"The compilation of Edrisi marks an era in the [[history of science]]. Not only is its historical information most interesting and valuable, but its descriptions of many parts of the earth are still authoritative. For three centuries geographers copied his maps without alteration. The relative position of the lakes which form the [[Nile]], as delineated in his work, does not differ greatly from that established by [[Samuel Baker|Baker]] and [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley]] more than seven hundred years afterwards, and their number is the same. The mechanical genius of the author was not inferior to his erudition. The celestial and terrestrial [[planisphere]] of silver which he constructed for his royal patron was nearly six feet in diameter, and weighed four hundred and fifty pounds; upon the one side the zodiac and the constellations, upon the other-divided for convenience into segments-the bodies of land and water, with the respective situations of the various countries, were engraved."&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;S. P. Scott (1904), ''History of the Moorish Empire'', pp. 461-2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ten manuscript copies of the ''Book of Roger'' currently survive, five of which have complete text and eight of which have maps.&lt;ref name=harley/&gt; Two are in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], including the oldest, dated to about 1325. (MS Arabe 2221). Another copy, made in Cairo in 1553, is in the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford (Mss. Pococke 375). It was acquired in 1692.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/-es5mO0-QDKczuQypeWReg The Book of Roger], BBC Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The most complete manuscript, which includes the world map and all seventy sectional maps, is kept in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=bacharach/&gt;

'''''The Death Ray''''' is a graphic novel by American cartoonist [[Daniel Clowes]] that first appeared in issue {{No.}}23 of Clowes's comic book ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' in 2004, and then as a standalone book in 2011.{{sfn|Leitko|2011}}

==Plot==
The story, which flashes back and forth from the 1970s and present day, revolves around a man Andy who reflects upon his childhood and the events that led to him living a life alone, with no friends or loved ones. Raised by his grandfather after his parents both died (mother from a blood clot in the brain, his father from cancer) when he was young., Andy is bullied by his classmates and dominated by his obnoxious best friend Louie. When he turns seventeen, the Andy (who is weak and skinny) begins smoking and suddenly experiences short bursts of what appear, to him, as being super strength. Shortly afterwords, Andy's grandfather provides him with a box containing belongings of his father that he had kept secret. These include a journal, that explain that as a kid, Andy was exposed to experimental hormones by his father to ensure that his son would not be frail and weak like he was. This causes Louie to believe that smoking causes Andy to become super strong. Louis then convinces him to become an amateur super-hero with him as his sidekick.

Seeking to find out more about his father, Andy requests that his aunt send him anything that she might have that belonged to his father. His aunt sends him a box that contains a "death ray" that disintegrates anyone shot by its ray.

Much of the story deals with Andy's relationship with his grandfather, who is suffering from the onset of dementia and his black nurse/aid Delia, who Andy secretly has a crush on. Louie becomes more and more obsessed with having Andy use the death ray to kill local bullies and troublemakers, such as the abusive father of a girl Louie has a crush on. As Louie and Andy drift apart, Andy befriends Sonny, the ex-boyfriend of Louie's sister who attempts to help Andy cope with his grandfather's mental decline.

Ultimately, Louie attempts to crush Andy's head in with a rock in order to permanently steal the death ray from him. Andy is forced to kill Andy, disintegrating him as a result. Afterwords, Andy's grandfather is placed into a group home, Andy is given custody of Louie's dog by his family (who do not suspect Andy of foul play), and Andy and the dog are forced to leave school in order to move in with his aunt.

The story then skips to the early 2000s; Andy is now in his late 40s and is bitter and cynical about life; twice divorced, he has since adopted Louie's nihilistic view on life and the death ray and repeatedly moves from town to town, to avoid suspicion for the murders he commits with the gun. Having used the death ray to murder the men that both of his wives cheated on him with, and having failed at a relationship with his high school crush Dusty, Andy sold the death ray to a pawn shop and moved on with his life. However, after his neighbor's pit bull murdered Louis's dog and then laughs about it, Andy seeks to retrieve the gun and murder his neighbor. Andy convinces Sonny to help him track down the death ray (which Sonny believes is just a toy gun) and along the way, Sonny visits Dusty for Andy and relays an apology to him for unstated incident that ended their budding relationship.

Andy murders his neighbor with the death ray, off-panel and ultimately moves back to the town where he grew up. Once he arrives back to the town, Andy meets the main bully who terrorized him growing up and who, in their last meeting, told Andy that he hoped his grandfather would die from his dementia. Andy resists the urge to murder the now grown up bully, but comments that the bully's now mature and less jerkish behavior was a lie.

The story ends with a three part epilogue:

*The first part has the ghosts of four of Andy's victims that Andy murdered for selfish reasons and which he regretted: a drug dealer who sold drugs to Delia's daughter, two of the men who slept with his ex-wives, and Louie.
*Sonny, Dusty, Delia, and Andy's grandfather describing Andy: while Delia and Sonny have favorable views of Andy, Dusty refuses to comment while Andy's grandfather is consumed with sorrow over his grandson being a murderer.
*Three endings for the graphic novel, told in one panel with text that describes the endings:
**Ending One has Andy going insane and using the Ray Gun to murder every living soul on Earth until only he exists
**Ending Two has Andy committing suicide and the world going on as normal, with no one ever knowing about Andy's death ray
***Andy dates a divorced woman in his apartment building, murdering her ex-husband with the death ray among other people who annoy him. Andy's relationship with the divorced woman eventually fails and he buries the death ray in the woods to avoid any further temptation to use it, after he realizes that he no longer has the available funds to relocate at the drop of a hat. Andy adopts multiple dogs over the coming decades, and ultimately dies from cancer in his late 70s, alone and childless. 
 
The final set of panels has Andy and his dog watching fireworks in the distance, while repeating a mantra from earlier in the book (during a fantasy sequence where Andy imagines life as a super-hero, with Louie as his sidekick) saying that he will always be available to help a stranger out if they are in trouble.

==Reception==
In 2012, ''The Death Ray'' won a [[Harvey Award]] for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harveyawards.org/2012/09/09/congratulations-to-the-harvey-award-recipients/ "Congratulations to the Harvey Award Recipients"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906171830/http://www.harveyawards.org/2012/09/09/congratulations-to-the-harvey-award-recipients/ |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
