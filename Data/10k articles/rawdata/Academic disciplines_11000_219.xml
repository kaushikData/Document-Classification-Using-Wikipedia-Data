      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12837">'''Arte Informale''' is a term coined in 1950 by the French critic [[Michel Tapié]] to refer to the art movement that began during the mid-1940s in post-World War II Europe. This movement also paralleled the [[Abstract Expressionism]] movement that was taking place at the same time in the United States, and had ties to the [[Arte Povera]] movement.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Philip|title=Art informel|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T004408?q=art+informel&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Sometimes referred to as [[Tachism]], Art Autre or [[Lyrical Abstraction]], it was a type of abstraction in which form became less important than that of the expressive impulses of the artist, and was opposed to the rationalism of traditional abstraction.&lt;ref name=cooper /&gt;  The qualities of informal art explore the possibilities of gesture, materials (often non traditional), and signage as the basis of communication. Oftentimes art characterized as informal is executed spontaneously and the approach to painting and sculpture are generally gestural, performative, expressionistic and experimental. Certain artists such as [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Alberto Burri]] and [[Emilio Vedova]] were crucial figures of this movement.

Arte Informale is based on the convention of painting while expanding the concept to include time-based themes and viewer dependent trials.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt;  [[Alberto Burri]], [[Emilio Vedova]], and [[Lucio Fontana]] are the three main Italian artists to question the limits of painting and sculpture by reassigning the expressive qualities.&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt; They tried to create new channels of communication to forge new styles that would reach beyond their predecessors.&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt; However, they were unable to break away from the history of Italian art.&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt;

Arte Informale became an internationally accepted movement that reached the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], the Japanese Gutai Group, and the South American Abstractionists.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; However, the primary adherents were French and Italian [[avant-garde]] artists.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; It was a movement wherein artists created a dialogue between material, subject, and the world.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; It was a rejection of the constrained thoughts of previous modern painters.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt;

==Alberto Burri==
[[Alberto Burri]] worked in Rome and was a role model for younger artists.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev"&gt;Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. "Thrust into the Whirlwind: Italian Art Before Arte Povera"&lt;/ref&gt; By observing the connection between culture and nature he saw that material had an existence of its own and that he as the artist was required to use the energy from the organic materials.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; Burri introduced energy, life, death, and destruction into his work through the use of natural and industrial materials.&lt;ref name=Petican&gt;Petican, Laura. "Arte Povera and the Baroque: Building an International Identity"&lt;/ref&gt; Burri was a solitary, quiet and aloof artist.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; His style emphasised the ethical weight and burden of living in a post-world war two era.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; As a [[Modernism|modernist]] Burri tried to give shape and rationality to the disorder of post-atomic contemporary culture by extending and exploring the limits of painting.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt;

In the 1950s in Rome the Gruppo Origine was founded which, brought artist like Ettore Colla and Burri together.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; They shared in common their rejection of abstract painters as too far detached from reality and realist painters as too disengaged from the relationship between life and art.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; However, Burri showed this through his work Sacchi by using thrown away burlap sacks and the method of suture that would reference human aspects and the practice of contemporary living.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; He used the terms 'form' and 'space' to attain synchronization and stability in his work.&lt;ref name=Sacchi&gt;Hamilton, Jaimey. "Making Art Matter: Alberto Burri's Sacchi." October 124 (2008): 31-52. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Burri addressed the issues of energy, life, death, and destruction into his work through the use of natural and industrial materials.&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt;

===''Sacchi''===
The Sacchi was first created in 1950 but hundreds were made.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt;  Burri created these Sacchi by tearing and scoring pieces of burlap, adding stitching, then placing them on a canvas. Sometimes they were singed or accompanied by paint, red plastic or resin.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; On one hand the Sacchi acted as a concept of incorporating aspects of everyday life into art.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt;  On the other hand, it was thought to be associated with the body.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; Burri had been trained as a doctor and worked as a surgeon in the war until he was captured and sent to an American POW camp in Texas, which is where he first started using burlap sacs.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; His past was the basis for a general consensus between critics was that it was a suggestion to the troubled status of Burri after the war.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; Lorenza Trucchi suggested that the burlap acted as a skin that Burri could project his traumatized recollections on.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; Francesco Arcangeli implied that Burri used violence to recognize and remind the viewers of the war.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; However, Maurizio Calvesi brought up the meaning of the material itself.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt;  At the time when Arte Informale was starting up in Italy the war had ended, the economy was fluctuating and the U.S Marshall Plan had been put into place.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; Calves thought that Burri’s use of the burlap sac was due to the commonality of the leftover food bags and that he was commemorating poverty.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt;

==Lucio Fontana==
[[Lucio Fontana]] (1899-1968) was one of the key figures of the post-war contemporary art scene in Europe. He was the founder of the [[Spatialism]] movement in Milan, and is best known for his Concetti spaziali (Spatial Concepts) where he pierced and cut canvases that worked to open up the flat surface of the painting into real space. His ideas were influential in the development of artists’ groups such as Azimuth and the Zero Group, as well as to the development of [[Arte Povera]].&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Anthony|title=Lucio Fontana: Between Utopia and Kitsch|journal=Grey Room|year=2001|jstor=1262573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he wrote Manifesto Blanco (White Manifesto) that was signed by a number of his students in Buenos Aires. At the end of the 1950s Fontana showed his work at the Venice Biennale and other parts of Europe such as Germany and France.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;

The work of Fontana during post-war Milan created a shift in autonomous art object towards an exploration of art as a total environment. Through Fontana’s Spatial Environment of 1949 he worked to tie together architecture, painting, and sculpture, and had proposed an art form which integrated both reality and ambient space.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;  In these environments, the gallery space was transformed with the manipulation of light, shadow and space to create a complete experience. These gestural and experiential qualities of form and making are both characteristics of the informal artist movement.

Fontana’s Spatial Concept of 1951 sought to propose art forms that would complement modern developments in building technology.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;  Light within space became grounds for this development in neon, which eventually was installed in the 1951 Milan Triennial. The Spatial Concept “engaged the viewer with an opulent vision of radiance that extended into real architectural space beyond the limited and private pictorial plane.” &lt;ref name="white"/&gt; This inclusion of the audience in turn also provided Fontana’s environments with performers.

Both Spatial Environment and Spatial Concept was Fontana’s response to the difficult challenge of producing utopian artwork after the distress of World War II.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;

Fontana’s “research into ‘[[Spatialism]]’, together with his charismatic presence in Milan, were determinant in encouraging the rise of [[Arte Povera]] in Italy.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christov-Bakargiev|first=Carolyn|title=Arte Povera|year=2005|publisher=Phaidon|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fontana’s contribution lies in the transition from an art of representation to an art of sheer perception, in which the work is a part of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lista|first=Giovanni|title=Arte Povera|year=2006|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fontana does not identify himself as an informal artist, the language used in his work fits within the qualities of this movement.

==Ennio Morlotti==
Ennio Morlotti was an Italian painter who was part of the Arte Informale movement.[http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] He met up with the Arte Informale group when he visited Paris in 1947. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] This meeting is what started leading him in the direction of [[Fundació Antoni Tàpies|Matter Painting]]. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] He showed his works in the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1948, 1952, and 1956. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] The main theme of his works has been landscapes and his own style focuses on color and material on the work of art. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] He works with the natural pattern of nature in organic and inorganic forms. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] Morlotti along with [[Emilio Vedova]] and other artists signed the ''Manifestio del Realismo'' in 1946 in Milan stating that the style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] is dependent on communication with others as opposed to [[Realism (arts)|Naturalism]] or [[Abstraction]].&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt;

==Emilio Vedova==
[[Emilio Vedova]] (1919-2006) was a self-taught painter from Venice. At the end of World War II he took an active part in the liberation of Venice and in 1946 he joined the Fronte Nuovo delle Arti, a movement that aimed at reconciling social revolution in artistic expression.&lt;ref name=vedova&gt;{{cite web|title=Vedova, Emilio|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/benezit/B00189079?q=vedova&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|publisher=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Vedova was influenced by art movements such as [[Cubism]] and [[Expressionism]] and admired the works of [[Tintoretto]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Goya]] and [[Picasso]].&lt;ref name="vedova"/&gt;  In the 1940s his style became increasingly gestural and began to fit in with the qualities of [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="vedova"/&gt; Vedova’s works were attempting to explore the three-dimensional space through painting and to achieve depth within space.

==Giuseppe Capogrossi==
[[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] (1900-1972) was an Italian painter from Rome. Around 1950 Capogrossi transitioned from figurative painting towards abstraction.&lt;ref name=capogrossi&gt;{{cite web|title=Capogrossi, Giuseppe|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/benezit/B00031691?q=capogrossi&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|publisher=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 he founded the Gruppo Origine along with Ballocco, Colla and Burri. “Their manifesto advocated the refusal of three-dimensional figuration, the use of color to serve a purely expressive purpose, and the use of primitive images, whose significance dates back to the birth of writing systems and symbols”.&lt;ref name="capogrossi"/&gt; After this time, Capogrossi composed his paintings on the basis of a single symbol- a sort of trident- which is repeated on his canvases and collages.&lt;ref name="capogrossi"/&gt; In Capogrossi’s work he discussed the impossibility of communication from artist to viewer, so he stressed that the artist must show the viewer what he wishes to communicate.

'''Augmented assignment''' (or '''compound assignment''') is the name given to certain 
[[Assignment (computer science)|assignment]] [[operator (programming)|operator]]s in certain [[programming languages]] (especially those derived from [[C (programming language)|C]]). An augmented assignment is generally used to replace a statement where an operator takes a [[Variable (programming)|variable]] as one of its arguments and then assigns the result back to the same variable. A simple example is &lt;code&gt;x&amp;nbsp;+= 1&lt;/code&gt; which is expanded to &lt;code&gt;x = x + (1)&lt;/code&gt;. Similar constructions are often available for various binary operators.

In general, in languages offering this feature, most operators that can take a variable as one of their arguments and return a result of the same type have an augmented assignment equivalent that assigns the result back to the variable in place, including arithmetic operators, bitshift operators, and [[bitwise operation|bitwise operators]].

==Discussion==
For example, the following statement or some variation of it can be found in many programs:

 x = x + 1

This means "find the number stored in the variable ''x'', add 1 to it, and store the result of the addition in the variable ''x''."  As simple as this seems, it may have an inefficiency, in that the location of variable ''x'' has to be looked up twice if the [[compiler]] does not recognize that two parts of the expression are identical: ''x'' might be a reference to some array element or other complexity. In comparison, here is the augmented assignment version:

 x += 1

With this version, there is no excuse for a compiler failing to generate code that looks up the location of variable ''x'' just once, and modifies it in place, if of course the machine code supports such a sequence. For instance, if x is a simple variable, the [[machine code]] sequence might be something like
  Load  x
  Add   1
  Store x
and the same code would be generated for both forms. But if there is a special op code, it might be
  MDM   x,1
meaning "Modify Memory" by adding 1 to x, and a decent compiler would generate the same code for both forms. Some machine codes offer INC and DEC operations (to add or subtract one), others might allow constants other than one.

More generally, the form is
 x '''?'''= expression
where the '''?''' stands for some operator (not always '''+'''), and there may be no special op codes to help. There is still the possibility that if ''x'' is a complicated entity the compiler will be encouraged to avoid duplication in accessing ''x'', and of course, if ''x'' is a lengthy name, there will be less typing required. This last was the basis of the similar feature in the [[ALGOL]] compilers offered via the Burroughs B6700 systems, using the tilde symbol to stand for the variable being assigned to, so that
 LongName:=x + sqrt(LongName)*7;
would become
 LongName:=x + sqrt(~)*7;
and so forth. This is more general than just ''x:=~ + 1;'' Producing optimum code would remain the province of the compiler.

==Semantics==
In [[expression-oriented programming language]]s such as C, assignment and augmented assignment are expressions, which have a value. This allows their use in complex expressions. However, this can produce sequences of symbols that are difficult to read or understand, and worse, a mistype can easily produce a different sequence of gibberish that although accepted by the compiler does not produce desired results. In other languages, such as Python, assignment and augmented assignment are statements, not expressions, and thus cannot be used in complex expressions. For example, the following is valid C, but not valid Python:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
a += b += c
&lt;/source&gt;
As with assignment, in these languages augmented assignment is a form of [[Operator associativity#Right-associativity of assignment operators|right-associative assignment]].

==By language==
===C descendants===
In [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[C_Sharp_(programming_language)|C#]], the assignment operator is '''=''', which is augmented as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Operator
! Description
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Addition
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;-=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Subtraction
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;*=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Multiplication
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Division
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;%=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Modulus
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Left bit shift
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Right bit shift
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;&amp;=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Bitwise AND
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;^=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Bitwise exclusive OR
|-
! &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#124;=&lt;/tt&gt;
| Bitwise inclusive OR
|}

Each of these is called a ''compound assignment'' operator in said languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/IEC 9899:201x Committee Draft April 12, 2011 N1570|url=http://www.iso-9899.info/n1570.html#6.5.16.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assignment and compound assignment operators|url=http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.ass}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C# Language Specification|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228593.aspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13248">'''Loss of biodiversity''' or '''biodiversity loss''' is the [[extinction]] of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain [[habitat]].

The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the [[environmental degradation]] that leads to the loss is reversible through [[ecological restoration]] / [[ecological resilience]] or effectively permanent (e.g. through [[land loss]]). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.

Even though permanent [[global biodiversity|global]] [[species loss]] is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in [[species composition]], even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the [[food web]] and the [[food chain]] insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain ([[coextinction]]), leading to an overall reduction in [[biodiversity]], possible [[alternative stable states]] of an ecosystem notwithstanding. [[Ecological effects of biodiversity]] are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced [[ecosystem services]] and eventually poses an immediate danger for [[food security]], also for humankind.&lt;ref name=cardinale2012/&gt;

{{See also|Diversity–function debate}}
[[File:Extinction Rebellion-2.jpg|thumb|Demonstrator against biodiversity loss, at [[:en:Extinction Rebellion|Extinction Rebellion]] (2018).]]

The current [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of ''global'' diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally occurring) [[background extinction rate]] and expected to still grow in the upcoming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/sciadv.1400253 | title=Accelerated modern human–induced species losses: Entering the sixth mass extinction | year=2015 | last1=Ceballos | first1=Gerardo | journal=Science Advances | volume=1 | issue=5| display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/cobi.12380 | title=Estimating the normal background rate of species extinction | year=2015 | last1=De Vos | first1= Jurriaan | journal=Conservation Biology | volume=29 | pages=452–462|issue=2| display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locally bounded loss rates can be [[measurement|measured]] using [[species richness]] and its variation [[time series|over time]]. Raw [[Count data|count]]s may not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute [[Abundance (ecology)|abundances]]. Taking into account the [[relative frequencies]], a considerable number of [[biodiversity index]]es has been developed. Besides richness, evenness and heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.&lt;ref name=cardinale2012&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature11148 | title=Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity | year=2012 | last1=Cardinale | first1=Bradley | journal=Nature | volume=486 | pages=59–67|bibcode = 2012Natur.486...59C | pmid=22678280 | issue=7401|display-authors=etal|quote=...at the first [[Earth Summit]], the vast majority of the world’s nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth’s ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate.

As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity
of the subject increases and the associated spatial and temporal scales widen.&lt;ref name=tagliapietra&gt;{{cite web|title=Biological diversity and habitat diversity: a matter of Science and perception|url=http://www.unige.ch/sciences/near/pdf/Tagliapietra%20and%20Sigovini%202010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split up into various scales (e.g. [[ecosystem diversity]] vs. [[habitat]] diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat diversity&lt;ref name=tagliapietra/&gt;) or different subcategories (e.g. [[phylogenetic diversity]], [[species diversity]], [[genetic diversity]], [[nucleotide diversity]]). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ecology|year=2016 |volume=97|issue=8|pages=1949–1960|doi=10.1890/15-1759.1|title=Estimating local biodiversity change: a critique of papers claiming no net loss of local diversity.|quote=two recent data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others.

To compare rates between different geographic regions [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]] should also be considered.

A '''buffalo wallow''' or '''bison wallow''' is a natural topographical depression in the flat [[prairie]] land that holds rain water and [[surface runoff|runoff]].

Originally this would have served as a temporary watering hole for wildlife, including the [[American bison]]. [[Wallowing in animals|Wallowing]] buffalo that drank from and bathed in these naturally occurring shallow water holes gradually changed the pristine watering hole into a buffalo wallow. Each time they went away, they carried mud with them from the hole, thus enlarging the wallow.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Sr., Emmett A. [http://www.oldeforester.com/pancake.htm "Buffalo Wallow on Pancake Trail"]. Retrieved May 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, wallowing action caused abrasion of hair, natural body oils and cellular debris from their hides and left the debris in the water and especially in the soil after the water evaporated. Every year the debris accumulated in the soil in increasing concentration and formed a water-impenetrable layer that prevented the rain water and runoff from percolating into the lower layers of the soil. Ultimately the water remained for long periods which attracted more wildlife. Even when stagnant, the water would be eagerly drunk by thirsty animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kirk Munroe|Munroe, Kirk]] (1891). ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33343/33343-h/33343-h.htm Campmates: A Story of the Plains]'', Chapter XXVI. Retrieved September 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Though thriving buffalo herds roamed and grazed the great prairies of North America for thousands of years, they have left few permanent markings on the landscape to recall their past presence. Exceptions are the somewhat rare yet still visible ancient buffalo wallows found occasionally on the North American prairie flatlands.

Buffalo wallows are also made by the Asian [[water buffalo]] and the [[African buffalo]].

In 1953, the writer Charles Tenney Jackson (1874–1955) published ''The Buffalo Wallow: A Prairie Childhood'',&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Charles Tenney (1953). ''The Buffalo Wallow: A Prairie Childhood''. New York: [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]].  Republished by [[University of Nebraska Press]], 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; an autobiographical novel about two boys (cousins) growing up during pioneer days in an almost empty stretch of [[Nebraska]], where their favorite hideaway is a buffalo wallow.

== Expression ==

This gene was first identified in the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu RM, Han ZG, Song HD, Peng YD, Huang QH, Ren SX, Gu YJ, Huang CH, Li YB, Jiang CL, Fu G, Zhang QH, Gu BW, Dai M, Mao YF, Gao GF, Rong R, Ye M, Zhou J, Xu SH, Gu J, Shi JX, Jin WR, Zhang CK, Wu TM, Huang GY, Chen Z, Chen MD, Chen JL | title = Gene expression profiling in the human hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and full-length cDNA cloning | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 17 | pages = 9543–8 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10931946 | pmc = 16901 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.160270997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GEO and EST profiles in NCBI, indicate that its expression level varies from tissue to tissue; however its reported expression is 1.2 times that of the average gene.&lt;ref name="AceView"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrett T, Suzek TO, Troup DB, Wilhite SE, Ngau WC, Ledoux P, Rudnev D, Lash AE, Fujibuchi W, Edgar R | title = NCBI GEO: mining millions of expression profiles--database and tools | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = Database issue | pages = D562-6 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15608262 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gki022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has highest expression in the pancreas and nervous tissue (in humans). It is underexpressed in many cancer cell lines, however this may be due to its close proximity to the [[tumor suppressor gene]] [[FHIT]], and the [[chromosomal fragile site]] FRBA3. Breakage at this site inactivates FHIT and can lead to the loss of C3orf14.

== Function ==
Because C3orf14 is not ubiquitously expressed, it most likely is not a [[housekeeping gene]]. Instead, it more likely plays a role in the function of specific tissues. It seems likely then, that this gene is a [[transcription factor]], which regulates the expression of other genes important for the function of tissues where this gene is expressed highest.

Pearson, Ph.D. {{!}} Author {{!}} The Hero Within|website=www.carolspearson.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''Carol S. Pearson''' is an author and educator. She develops new theories and models with an applied practical bent, building on the work of psychiatrist [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]], psychoanalyst [[James Hillman]], mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], and other [[Depth psychology|depth psychologists]].

Pearson is best known as the author of ''The Hero Within: Six Archetypes We Live By'' (1986, 1989, 1998), which was a [[HarperCollins|HarperSanFrancisco]] best-seller, followed by the more expansive ''Awakening the Heroes Within: Twelve Archetypes to Help Us Find Ourselves and Transform Our World'' (1991)''.'' With the assistance of Hugh Marr, she co-created the Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator (PMAI), published by the Center for Applications of Psychological Type (CAPT), to help people better understand their motivations, their unconscious assumptions, and the narratives they think, tell, and live.

Her most recent book,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolspearson.com/publications/persephone-rising-awakening-the-heroine-within/|title=Persephone Rising: Awakening the Heroine Within {{!}} Carol S. Pearson, Ph.D. {{!}} Author {{!}} The Hero Within|website=www.carolspearson.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Persephone Rising: Awakening The Heroine Within'', published in October 2015, bridges the genres of [[depth psychology]], myth scholarship, and [[memoir]]. It draws on archetypal stories from an ancient [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greek mystery religion]] as a guide to thriving today in a world in flux. It concludes with an analysis of narrative intelligence as an important aspect of emotional intelligence that also builds cognitive complexity. In April 2016, ''Persephone Rising'' received a gold medal from the [[Nautilus Book Awards]] in the category of books for women.

In addition to such books written for the general public, Pearson has made major contributions to the fields of education, marketing and branding, organizational development, and leadership through publications such as ''Educating the Majority: Women Challenge Tradition in Higher Education'', co-editors, Donna L. Shavlik and Judith G. Touchton (1989); ''The Hero and the Outlaw: Building Extraordinary Brands Through the Power of Archetypes'', co-author, Margaret Mark (2001); ''Mapping the Organizational Psyche: A Jungian Theory of Organizational Dynamics and Change'', co-author, John G. Corlett (2004); and ''The Transforming Leader: New Approaches to Leadership for the Twenty-First Century'' (2012).

She designed the Organizational and Team Culture Indicator, also published by CAPT, to help organizational development and human resource professionals and marketers understand organizational cultures. [[Kenexa]], a global human resources company, bought the OTCI instrument from CAPT. [[IBM]] later acquired Kenexa and translated the instrument for global use. It is now known as the IBM Kenexa Organizational Cultural Insight Survey.

==Early life and education==

Pearson was born in [[Chicago]] in 1944, the eldest child of Thelma (Widman) and John A. Pearson. At the age of two, she moved with her family to [[Houston|Houston, TX]], where she attended Houston public schools and later [http://www.rice.edu Rice University], from which she received a BA (1966), MA, (1968), and PhD (1970). She has one younger sibling, John Douglas Pearson. She is married to David R. Merkowitz, a political and public affairs consultant, and has two step-children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdfifund.gov/about/Pages/Staff-and-Board.aspx|title=Staff &amp; Board|website=www.cdfifund.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Merkowitz, who works at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]], and &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/stephen.m.merkowitz|title=Bio - Dr. Stephen M Merkowitz|website=science.gsfc.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Merkowitz, a gravitational physicist at [[Goddard Space Flight Center|NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center]], and a daughter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://web.uri.edu/politicalscience/meet/shanna-pearson-merkowitz/|title=Shanna Pearson-Merkowitz - department of political science|work=department of political science|access-date=2017-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanna Pearson-Merkowitz, a political science professor at the [[University of Rhode Island]], as well as six grandchildren.

Pearson began her study of archetypal theory and narrative intelligence in the [http://english.rice.edu/home/ English Department at Rice University], which emphasized the myth/symbol school of [[Literary criticism|literary studies]]. Later in her career, she earned a [[Doctor of Ministry]] degree from [http://www.wisdomuniversity.org Wisdom University (2012)], a graduate school originally called the University of Creation Spirituality, and now a part of Ubiquity University, that explores the progressive mystic traditions in religions throughout the world. She also holds an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degree from [http://www.norwich.edu Norwich University.]

== Academic career ==
Pearson’s academic career began with a series of faculty positions in the 1970s. First hired as an assistant professor in the [http://www.colorado.edu/academics/programs/english English Department at the University of Colorado], she was selected as the founding director of the CU Women Studies Program and was instrumental in developing ''[https://frontiers.osu.edu Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies]'', one of the earliest academic journals in the field. She subsequently was recruited to be the first director of the [http://wmst.umd.edu Women’s Studies Program at the University of Maryland, College Park], where she negotiated to bring the offices of the [http://www.nwsa.org National Women's Studies Association] and the journal ''[[Feminist Studies]]'' to the campus.

During her tenure at UMD, Pearson was selected to be a fellow in the American Council on Education Fellows Program, the nation’s premier higher education leadership development program. She spent her fellowship year at the [http://www.uncc.edu University of North Carolina at Charlotte], working with the chancellor of the university and other senior administrators. Upon returning to UMD, she accepted an invitation to spend part of her time as a visiting scholar at the [http://www.acenet.edu/leadership/programs/Pages/ACE-Fellows-Program.aspx American Council on Education’s] Center for Leadership Development. She also worked with ACE’s Office of Women in Higher Education to develop “The New Agenda of Women for Higher Education.”

As Pearson moved into leadership positions, she began to explore leadership studies scholarship. She worked at two women’s colleges, serving first as Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of [http://www.goucher.edu Goucher College] in Towson, MD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/06/science/education-women-s-college-faces-the-inevitable-men.html|title=WOMEN'S COLLEGE FACES THE INEVITABLE: MEN|date=6 May 1986|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later as Dean of the Mount Vernon Institute at [http://www.mvnu.edu Mount Vernon College] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]. From 1998 to 2005, Pearson was Senior Editor of ''The Inner Edge: A Resource for Enlightened Business Practice'', published bi-monthly by InnoVision Communications''',''' and then the Director of the Transformational Leadership Certificate Program at the Center for Professional Development at Georgetown University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scs.georgetown.edu/programs_nc/CE0127/transformational-leadership?gclid=CPeFj4mD3NICFcSKswodnNYHEQ|title=Executive Certificate in Transformational Leadership|publisher=Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies|website=scs.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, she also was President of [https://greatnonprofits.org/org/meristem Meristem], a nonprofit education and training organization.

From 2005 to 2009, Pearson served as Director of the [[James MacGregor Burns|James MacGregor Burns Academy of Leadership]] in the School of Public Policy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. The academy incubated the International Leadership Association, of which she was a member of the board of directors. She also co-led a Leadership for Transformation project, out of which grew her edited volume ''The Transforming Leader'', which was honored by the International Leadership Association at its 2014 global conference for making a significant contribution to the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ila-net.org/conferences/2014/2014-ILA-program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Pearson left UMD to take a position as Executive Vice President and Provost at [http://www.pacifica.edu Pacifica Graduate Institute] in [[Carpinteria, California]], later becoming the school’s President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/10/prweb8859261.htm|title=Pacifica Graduate Institute Welcomes New President, Establishes Chancellor Position|work=prweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacifica offers graduate degrees in Jungian and archetypal studies, psychology, mythology, and several other fields. Since leaving Pacifica in 2013, Pearson has continued to write, teach, consult, and lead workshops, but has retired from academic leadership.

Pearson’s current interests have expanded from exploring archetypes in organizations and individuals to their role in social systems. In 2009, she wrote a monograph for the [[Fetzer Institute]], called &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/resources/attachment/2012-07-12/dad_pearson_essay.pdf|title=Maturing the American Dream|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maturing the American Dream, which identified archetypes in U.S. culture and their likely implications for the future. Most recently, [http://www.carolspearson.com/blog/ Pearson’s blogs] and other social media communications have explored the interface between archetypal patterns in individuals and larger social groups as well as more general philosophical and psycho-spiritual issues.

The '''Center for Biofilm Engineering''' ('''CBE''') is an interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transfer institution located on the central campus of [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]]. The center was founded in April 1990 as the '''Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering''' with a grant from the [[Engineering Research Centers]] (ERC) program of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF).&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.biofilm.montana.edu/files/CBE/NSF-awd-lttr_CIMPEwb.pdf |title=Original Charter |publisher=National Science Foundation |date=April 15, 1990 |format=pdf |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBE integrates faculty from multiple university departments to lead multidisciplinary research teams—including graduate and undergraduate students—to advance fundamental [[biofilm]] knowledge, develop beneficial uses for microbial biofilms, and find solutions to industrially relevant biofilm problems. The center tackles biofilm issues including [[chronic wounds]], [[bioremediation]], and [[microbial corrosion]] through cross-disciplinary research and education among [[engineers]], [[microbiologists]] and industry.&lt;ref name=Invade/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBEResearch/&gt;

==History==
The center originated as the Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) in 1983.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt; In 1990, the center became a national ERC as the Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering based on a $7.2 million grant from the NSF.&lt;ref name="Environment/Ecology Grants"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/11538/title/Science-Grants/ |title=Environment/Ecology Grants |journal=The Scientist |volume=4 |number=24 |page=25 |date=December 10, 1990 |accessdate=2015-02-27|quote=To establish new Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering; work will focus on biofouling and biocorrosion, bioremediation, and biohydrometallurgy. $7.2 million from NSF to Montana State University, Bozeman. |publisher=LabX Media Group |location=Midland, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the center assumed its current name-Center for Biofilm Engineering. The original grants expired in 2001 and the center became self-sufficient. The center celebrated its 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary as an NSF ERC in 2015.

===Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (1979–1990)===
In 1979 W.G. (Bill) Characklis came to Montana State University from [[Rice University]] as a professor in civil (environmental) and chemical engineering. He assembled a multidisciplinary team of [[engineer]]s, [[microbiologist]]s and [[chemist]]s to study the processes and effects of microbial growth at interfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=InProcess |title=Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering Newsletter |date=Fall 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established a cross-disciplinary environmental biotechnology institute to address the needs of industry in the areas of [[biofouling]], [[microbial corrosion]] and biofilm technology.&lt;ref name=CBE1990&gt;{{cite report |title=Report on Research 1990, Montana State University |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) was chartered by the [[Montana University System|Montana Board of Regents]] in 1983 within the Montana State University College of Engineering. Bill Characklis was its first director. The IPA provided the foundation for eventual Engineering Research Center status in several ways. The IPA conducted fundamental research, development, and testing for industry and government agencies and it pursued biofilm projects that crossed traditional scientific discipline boundaries.&lt;ref name=news1983&gt;Brochure: "Montana State University introduces The Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis." 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The IPA established an Industrial Associates membership program and by 1989 the program had 12 participating members, each contributing $10,000 annually to the center. Membership benefits provided them the opportunity to assist in critiquing and defining the IPA research programs. Members included oil/gas/power companies, a chemical manufacturer, a pulp and paper company and partnership with the [[Idaho National Engineering Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Report: "Strategic Plan of the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis." February 1989, p 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering (1990–1993)===
[[File:Confocal Microscopes Center for Biofilm Research MSU.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photograph of microscope|Leica [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|confocal microscope systems]]]]
In 1989, the IPA applied to the NSF for Engineering Research Center status, which was granted in April 1990.&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; The Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering was established as one of three national Engineering Research Centers out of 48 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Strategic Plan of the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis |date=February 1989 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an ERC, the new organization was charged with building a cross-disciplinary research and education program at Montana State University, as well as increasing U.S. industrial competitiveness in biofilm related technologies. The center's charter mandated that research, education, and technology transfer programs would be fully integrated within the center's program planning. The Industrial Associates program continued to be used as a mechanism for the center to get information from industry about significant biofilm-related problems and collaborate on center research initiatives designed to address biofilm issues. The center’s education program recruited students to participate on interdisciplinary research teams and to interact with industry representatives.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt;

The provision of $7.2 million in grants from the NSF during the first five years enabled the expansion of center research into new areas, notably [[bioremediation]] and [[biohydrometallurgy]]. The center's industrial focus expanded from biofilm control and mitigation to include positive use of biofilm processes to break up soil and water contaminants as well as extracting minerals from low-grade ores.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt; Center projects were designed to span scales of inquiry from fundamental bench-scale to applied field-scale experiments. These projects enabled the continued development of microsensors to measure gradients of gases and pH within biofilm communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lewandowski Z, Lee W, Characklis WG, Little BJ | year = 1989 | title = Dissolved oxygen and pH microelectrode measurements at water-immersed metal surfaces | url = | journal = Corrosion Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 92–98 | doi=10.5006/1.3577838}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microscopy]] to elucidate physiological activity of community organisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wentland, Eric J.; Stewart, Philip S.; Huang, Ching-Tsan; McFeters, Gordon A. |title=Spatial variations in growth rate within Klebsiella pneumoniae colonies and biofilm |journal=Biotechnology Progress |date=1996 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=316–321 |accessdate=2015-03-06 |publisher=American Institute of Chemical Engineers |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1021/bp9600243/abstract |doi=10.1021/bp9600243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modeling to predict biofilm behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.260411005/abstract |authors=Jones, Warren L.; Dockery, Jack D.; Vogel, Curtis R.; Sturman, Paul J. |title=Diffusion and reaction within porous packing media: A phenomenological model |journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering |date= April 25, 1993 |volume=41 |issue=10 |pages=947–956 |accessdate=2015-03-06 |publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc. |doi=10.1002/bit.260411005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Biofilm Engineering (1993–present)===
In 1992, two years after its establishment, the center's first director, Bill Characklis, died. Montana State University signaled its commitment to the center by hiring J.W. (Bill) Costerton, a professor of microbiology from the [[University of Calgary]], as Executive Director and James Bryers, a professor of biochemical engineering from [[Duke University]], as Director of Research for the center. In 1993 the center’s name was changed to Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE).&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biofilm Engineering News, 1993 April;1(1):1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-sufficiency (2001–)===
The NSF ERC program was designed to create institutional centers that would be self-sufficient within ten years. The Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University started planning for self-sufficiency in 1998 through the establishment of a Self-sufficiency Task Force at the university. The center achieved self-sufficiency in 2001 and continues to be funded in part through federal and private grants with continued emphasis on providing value to the Industrial Associates, and support from Montana State University and the [[Montana|State of Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biofilm Engineering Final Report.

The center's standing in the international research community and its encouragement of collaboration regularly attracts visiting students and faculty from numerous institutions in the U.S. and foreign countries. From 1990 to 2017, more than 287 visiting researchers from more than 30 countries and 38 U.S. states spent from several weeks to a year or more studying biofilms in CBE laboratories. In 2017, 8 visiting scientists and engineers conducted research at CBE.&lt;ref name=2014AR/&gt;

===Industry programs===
The center's Industrial Associates program provides access to center information, expertise, training and other benefits for a yearly subscription fee. The program was started in 1983 with the creation of the Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis.&lt;ref name=news1983/&gt; CBE’s Standardized Biofilm Methods research group (SBM) focuses on issues of interest to companies developing new products addressing biofilm formation. Researchers develop, refine, and publish quantitative methods for growing, treating, sampling, and analyzing biofilm bacteria. SBM laboratory members work with international standard setting organizations to secure approval of biofilm methods by the standard setting community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Griffin K |publisher=Montana State University |title=CBE faculty member honored by ASTM International |date=Nov 22, 2013 |url=http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/news/faculty-honored-astm.html |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a contract with the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], the SBM conducts laboratory research to support the development and standardization of test methods for measuring the performance of antimicrobial products—including those for biofilm bacteria—and provide statistical services related to EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs Antimicrobial Testing Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Becker, Michael|publisher=MSU News Service |title=MSU biofilms research helps set standards for everyday products |date=August 22, 2008 |url=http://www.montana.edu/news/6139/msu-biofilms-research-helps-set-standards-for-everyday-products |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Methods include the design of reactor systems to simulate industrial/medical systems, growing biofilm and quantifying cell numbers and activity, testing the efficacy of chemical constituents against biofilms and microscopy and image analysis of biofilms.

====Undergraduate studies====
The Center for Biofilm Engineering's Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) was founded by Director J.W. (Bill) Costerton and Ryan Jordan in the late 1990s. PhD candidate (and subsequent Senior Research Engineer at the CBE)  Jordan directed the CBE's first URE students as part of a backcountry water quality program in Yellowstone National Park and the Bridger-Teton Wilderness where URE students under Jordan's direction became the first researchers to identify the role of biofilm in the failure of portable water treatment filters used in disaster relief, military, and outdoor recreation applications.

Undergraduate students are hired as undergraduate research assistants and work in CBE laboratories as members of research teams on interdisciplinary biofilm projects. CBE undergraduates are encouraged to acquire competence in laboratory skills, experimental design and group communication. By 2017, over 785 undergraduates from 11 disciplines had worked on laboratory biofilm projects under the direction of CBE-affiliated faculty members. Twenty-nine of 62 undergraduates (46%) in the 2016-17 academic year were female.&lt;ref name="2014AR"&gt;{{cite report |title=MSU Center for Biofilm Engineering 25 years and growing |date=2014 |pages=1–24 |url=http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/files/CBE/documents/2014_and_25-YrReport_CBE.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2014ARappx" /&gt;

====Graduate studies====
Graduate students pursue their degree in a discipline offered through one of the science, agriculture, or engineering departments at Montana State University while they conduct their research in CBE laboratories. Student graduate committees are typically interdisciplinary. The student and graduate committee members select coursework appropriate for the student’s interests and degree program. Engineering students are encouraged to take microbiology courses; science students are encouraged to take relevant engineering coursework. Graduate students acquire experience by designing and performing research that crosses traditional academic discipline boundaries and has direct impact on current environmental, industrial, and medical issues. Students work on projects that range from fundamental to applied topics. In addition, the CBE’s Industrial Associates program brings students into working relationships with potential employers. Graduate students are encouraged to develop their communication and leadership skills by presenting at research conferences, mentoring undergraduate students, organizing the CBE’s seminar series, and assisting with outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CBE Graduate Education |url=http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/node/2184 |publisher=Montana State University |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2017, 256 graduate students had received advanced degrees, including 30 with doctorate degrees and 22 with masters degrees . During the 2016-17 academic year 53% graduate students were female.&lt;ref name=2014AR/&gt;&lt;ref name=2014ARappx/&gt;

&lt;!--==Proposed DYK==
… that the '''[[Center for Biofilm Engineering]]''' at [[Montana State University|MSU]] uses interdisciplinary research &amp; education to tackle biofilm issues including [[chronic wounds]], [[bioremediation]], and [[microbial corrosion]]?--&gt;

&lt;!--Text of source for DYK Hook:

Biofiims were once considered chiefly a practical problem, the province of industrial engineers concerned about corroded pipes and fouled equipment. So in the 1980s, when William Characklis spoke about biofilms at microbiology conferences, the biologists he addressed were not a receptive audience: He was considered a "microbiologist who had fallen amongst engineers," recalls biofilm expert William Costerton. In reality, Characklis, who died an untimely death in 1992 at age 50, was a chemical engineering professor at Montana State University in Bozeman. But he had become convinced that a more biological perspective was needed to understand the puzzling nature of biofilms. Costerton and other biofilm leaders credit Characklis for almost single-handedly bridging biology and engineering, tirelessly crisscrossing the boundary between the two camps by training himself in microbiology, attending meetings, and teaching diverse graduate students. In 1990 Characklis won National Science Foundation (NSF) support to start an Engineering Research Center on biofilms at Montana State. Under his leadership, the center, then called the Center for Microbial Interfacial Process Engineering, drew students and faculty from engineering, science, mathematics, and agricultural departments. After Characklis's death, the center's name changed to the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE), but his interdisciplinary vision is thriving under the leadership of microbiologist Costerton. The center's original 5-year NSF grant was renewed in June, for $7.6 million for the next 5 years. One of the center's crucial jobs is to develop tools to study biofilms. For example, early researchers thought that the bacteria grew uniformly in a polysaccharide envelope, a view that stemmed from drying or treating biofilms before studying them. Then in 1991, researchers at the CBE and the University of Saskatchewan in Canada used confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) to examine successive planes in living biofilms in real time. CSLM 
clearly showed that biofilm bacteria grow as remarkably complex microcolonies, crisscrossed by water channels that comprise up to 60% of the biofilm's volume. CBE scientists, led by Zbigniew Lewandow- ski, are now further refining this method with new probes and software for mapping interactions among bacteria. Today the CBE is a haven of interdisciplinary work, with graduate students from 10 departments working in interdisciplinary teams. Engineering students clone genes, microbiologists construct mathematical models, and mathematicians letnm biochemistrv. all to solve real-world problems. "The center has evolved a system that works," says Costerton, who thinks the key to success is the interdisciplinary research teams. A microbiologist may help an engineer do taxonomic mapping of a mixed-species biofilm, then the engineer might help the microbiologist scan the surface of a medical device with a scanning vibrating electrode to measure the extent of biofilm- induced corrosion. Another part of the CBE's mission is to advance industrial competitiveness, by transferring technology to industrial associates such as oil companies or municipal water districts. Microbiologist Rod Donlan of Calgon Corp. in Pittsburgh, for example, has used the center's expertise to find chemical disinfectants that can kill biofilms in industrial water systems. He adopted a CBE- developed staining technique to identify the kinds of bacteria and their metabolic activity inside a biofilm, and this helps him deter- mine which bacteria are harmed by disinfectants. "That's why we're part of the center-because they do basic research that helps us develop new applications," he says. And it's clear that Characklis's cross-disciplinary spirit lives on. During a recent NSF site review, an eminent microbiologist was convinced that two students presenting a project about biofilms degrading trichloroethylene were microbiologists. "They were, in fact, both engineers," says Costerton. -CP--&gt;

'''Climate commitment''' describes the fact that [[climate]] reacts with a delay to influencing factors ("[[climate forcing]]s") such as the presence of [[greenhouse gas]]es. Climate commitment studies attempt to assess the amount of future [[global warming]] that is "committed" under the assumption of some constant level of forcings. The constant level often used for illustrative purposes is [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] doubling or quadrupling; or the present level of forcing.

== Basic idea ==
If a [[wiktionary:perturbation|perturbation]] — such as an increase in greenhouse gases or [[solar variation|solar activity]] — is applied to the [[climate system]] the response will not be immediate, principally because of the large [[heat capacity]] (i.e., [[Volumetric heat capacity#Thermal inertia|thermal inertia]]) of the [[ocean]]s. 
:''As an analogue, consider the heating of a thin metal plate (by the sun or by a flame): the plate will warm relatively quickly. If a  thick metal block is heated instead, it will take much longer for the entire block to reach [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] with the imposed heating because of its higher heat capacity.''
Land only stores [[heat]] in the top few meters. 
Ocean water, by contrast, can move vertically and store heat within the ocean's depth ([[convection]]). 
This is why the land surface is observed to warm more than the oceans. It also explains the very large difference in response between 
* "equilibrium" climate prediction [[Execution (computers)|runs]] in which only a shallow ocean is used and it is assumed that the climate has come to equilibrium and 
* "[[Transient state|transient]]" climate prediction runs in which a full ocean is used and the climate is out of balance.

The "commitment" can apply to variables other than temperature: because of the long mixing time for heat into the deep ocean, a given surface warming commits to centuries of [[sea level rise]] from thermal expansion of the ocean. Also once a certain threshold is crossed, it is likely that a slow melting of the Greenland ice sheet will commit us to a sea level rise of 5m over millennia.

== Models ==
{{main|global climate model}}
Recent [[model (abstract)|model]]s forecast that even in the unlikely event of greenhouse gases stabilizing at present levels, the earth would warm by an additional 0.5°C by 2100, a similar rise in temperature to that seen during the 20th century.  In 2050, as much as 64% of that commitment would be due to ''past'' natural forcings.  Over time, their contribution compared to the human influence will diminish.  Overall, the warming commitment at 2005 greenhouse gas levels could exceed 1°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigley |first=T. M. L. |title=The Climate Change Commitment |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5716 |pages=1766–9 |date=17 March 2005 |doi=10.1126/science.1103934 |pmid=15774756 |url=ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/coastal/Climate%20Articles/Wigley_2005%20Sea%20level%20commitment.pdf |format=PDF|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1766W }}&lt;/ref&gt; As ocean waters expand in response to this warming, global [[sea level]]s would mount by about 10 centimeters during that time. These models do not take into account [[ice cap]] and [[glacier]] melting; including those [[climate feedback]] effects would give a 1–1.5°C estimated temperature increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050314/full/050314-13.html |title= Oceans extend effects of climate change |first=Deirdre |last=Lockwood  |date= 2005-05-17 |work=Nature News |publisher= [[Nature Publishing Group]] |doi=10.1038/news050314-13}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This is by no means a new idea, the concept is discussed in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|TAR]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20071231162245/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm] and in the [[IPCC_Second_Assessment_Report|SAR]] in 1995.

'''The College of Wooster''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Wooster, Ohio]]. It is primarily known for its emphasis on mentored undergraduate research and enrolls approximately 2,000 students. Founded in 1866 by the [[Presbyterian]] Church as the University of Wooster, it officially has been non-sectarian since 1969, when ownership ties with the Presbyterian Church ended. From its creation, the college has been a [[coeducation|co-educational]] institution. The school is a member of The [[Five Colleges of Ohio]], [[Great Lakes Colleges Association]], and the [[Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities]]. As of December 31, 2017, Wooster's endowment stood at $311 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wooster.edu/about/facts&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooster is one of forty colleges named in [[Loren Pope]]'s book ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]'', in which he called it his "original best-kept secret in higher education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Loren |last=Pope |title=Colleges that Change Lives |url=http://www.ctcl.com/colleges/wooster/index.htm |publisher=ctcl.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128203814/http://www.ctcl.com/colleges/wooster/index.htm |archivedate=2006-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is consistently ranked among the nation's top liberal arts colleges, according to [[U.S. News and World Report]].  In US News' "Best Colleges 2018", for the sixteenth year in a row, Wooster is recognized for its “outstanding” undergraduate research opportunities and its senior capstone program, the  {{small|I.S.}} (Independent Study). 

==History==
[[File:University of Wooster, Ohio, c1867.jpg|thumb|200px|left|University of Wooster, lithograph, c1867]]
Founded as '''The University of Wooster''' in 1866 by [[Presbyterians]], the institution opened its doors in 1870 with a faculty of five and a student body of thirty men and four women. Wealthy Wooster citizen Ephraim Quinby donated the first {{convert|22|acre}}, a large oak grove situated on a hilltop overlooking the town.  After being founded with the intent to make Wooster open to everyone, the university's first Ph.D. was granted to a woman, Annie B. Irish, in 1882.  The first black student, Clarence Allen, began his studies later in the same decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wooster.edu/About-Wooster/History-Traditions|title=Official website: Our history &amp; traditions|accessdate=2011-08-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826055604/http://www.wooster.edu/About-Wooster/History-Traditions|archivedate=2011-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rumored that when the college was founded, it was gifted a mummy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-daily-record.com/living/2005/09/18/egyptian-mummy-is-the-centerpiece-of-college-of-wooster-art-exhibit| title=Egyptian Mummy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the head of [[Nat Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/longform/skullduggery-nat-turner-skull/| title=Mystery of Nat Turner's missing head}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the mummy is still located on campus, at the basement of the art center, the head of Nat Turner was lost in Old Main after a fire broke out.

In the pre-dawn hours of December 11, 1901, a fire destroyed the five-story Old Main building, the centerpiece of the campus.  Within two years, it was replaced by several new buildings which (after substantial renovations within the last 30 years) remain the primary structures for the classes, labs, and faculty offices.  These include Kauke Hall (the center of campus), Scovel Hall, Severance Hall (which together form a large courtyard in front of Kauke Hall), and Taylor Hall.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

About ten years after the fire and rebuilding, there were eight divisions, including a medical school whose faculty outnumbered those in the college of arts and sciences. However, the university had gradually begun to define itself as a liberal arts institution and, in 1915, after a bitter dispute between the faculty and the Trustees, chose to become The College of Wooster in order to devote itself entirely to the education of undergraduate students in the liberal arts. The enrollment of the college is kept intentionally small, around 2000 students, to allow for close interaction between faculty and students.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

In the 1920s, during the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy|clashes between liberal and fundamentalists]], [[William Jennings Bryan]], a prominent Presbyterian layman, and former [[United States Secretary of State]], attacked the college for its teaching of evolution. The subject had been taught at the college for several decades and defended by then president [[Charles F. Wishart]]. Bryan called for the General Assembly of the church to cut off funding to the college. But in 1923 Wishart defeated Bryan for the position of [[Moderator of the General Assembly]] largely on the evolution issue, and the college continued to teach evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Tait |first = L. Gordon |authorlink = |title =Evolution: Wishart, Wooster, and William Jennings Bryan |journal =Journal of Presbyterian History|volume =62 |issue = 4 |pages =310–314 |publisher = |location = |date =1984 |language = |jstor = 23328648 |issn = |doi = |ref= none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|240|acre|ha|adj=on}} college has a tree endowment, established in 1987, which supports tree conservation, maintenance, and a tree replacement program.   The Oak Grove, a pleasant green space near the center of campus, plays host to commencement ceremonies each May.  Several of the Grove's trees are older than the college itself, including an eastern black oak near Galpin Hall that dates to 1681, as well as a 1766 white oak.  Each senior class plants a class tree in the Oak Grove on the day before graduation.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

On November 10, 2015, the College named [[Sarah Bolton (physicist)|Sarah Bolton]] as its 12th president, and first female president. Her term began July 1, 2016. Bolton was a dean and physics professor at [[Williams College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sarah Bolton named 12th president of The College of Wooster {{!}} The College of Wooster |url=http://wooster.edu/news/releases/2015/november/president-bolton/ |website=wooster.edu |accessdate=2015-12-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202181205/http://wooster.edu/news/releases/2015/november/president-bolton/ |dead-url=no |archivedate=2015-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
[[Image:COWkaukehall.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Kauke Hall is the main academic building on campus]]
Upon completion of at least 32 courses, students may earn a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Music Education degree.

In addition to the programs listed below, students may design their own major with approval from the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and the Provost. Some of the pre-professional programs are cooperative ones in which students spend a certain period of time at the College of Wooster before transferring to accelerated courses at other colleges and universities.

===Independent Study program===
The College of Wooster also has an Independent Study program, in which all students work one-on-one with a faculty advisor to complete a written [[thesis]] or other significant project during the course of the senior year, usually about 50 to 100 pages in length.&lt;ref name=twsAprWab&gt;{{cite news
 |author=

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student also presents an oral defense of the thesis before a faculty committee.  The program, begun in 1947 by Howard Lowry (the college's 7th President), has received attention from other colleges and universities, and a number of other institutions have modeled programs after it. In 2003, the independent study program at Wooster was recognized by ''[[US News and World Report]]'' as the second best 'senior capstone experience' in the US, behind only [[Princeton University]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.  Wooster ranks 14th in the United States among independent colleges whose graduates earned Ph.D.s between 1920 and 1995 (according to the Baccalaureate Origins of Doctorate Recipients, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://server1.fandm.edu/departments/CollegeRelations/BacOrigins/bacorigins.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215122033/http://server1.fandm.edu/departments/CollegeRelations/BacOrigins/bacorigins.html |archivedate=December 15, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation and completion of the thesis can be time consuming, and led to one view in which a student, writing in the weekly ''The Wooster Voice'', suggested that the independent study program be interwoven with career planning as well as applications to graduate schools.&lt;ref name=twsAprWtr&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special traditions have been developed surrounding Independent Study. Upon completion, a student receives a yellow button saying 'I did it!' as well as the highly coveted [[Tootsie Roll]].&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; The tradition began in 1974&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; when the registrar at the time, Lee Culp (also a graduate of the College of Wooster), gave out candy along with the buttons one year; the Tootsie Roll itself was chosen simply because it was cheap to buy in bulk. Beginning in 1989, buttons were given out to indicate the order in which theses had been handed in.&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; The 'due date,' or the last day that students can turn in their completed Independent Study project, is the first Monday after spring break. On I.S. Monday, the [[pipe band]] strikes up including drums and trumpets,&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; and with the Provost leading the way, the seniors march through the Kauke Arch in a jubilant parade, described by one professor as a "celebration of both scholarship and survival", ending at Kittredge dining hall, where a celebratory dinner with advisors and college administrators follows.

===Libraries===
The College of Wooster Libraries consists of three branches (Andrews Library, The Flo K. Gault Library and The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall) and a music library located at the Scheide Music Center. Andrews Library, the largest library in the system, houses more than 850,000 volumes and can accommodate over 500 readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrews Library - College of Wooster Campus Tour |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/admissions/campustour/library.php |publisher=Wooster.edu |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909181328/http://www.wooster.edu/admissions/campustour/library.php |archivedate=2006-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews Library houses the college's Special Collections, media library and the student writing center. The Flo K. Gault Library, built as an addition to Andrews Library in 1995, primarily serves as a place for class seniors to work on their Independent Study projects. The Gault Library contains carrels devoted to Independent Study for every senior student of the humanities and social sciences. The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall (1900, 1998), which is the oldest branch in the system, served as the original academic library for the college from 1900 to 1962. After three decades as an art museum, the building reopened as the science library in 1998, with substantial funding from the Timken Foundation of Canton, Ohio, and now primarily serves students in the math and sciences departments. The library provides Independent Study carrels for math and science seniors.

* '''CONSORT:''' The College of Wooster became a founding member of the Five Colleges of Ohio Consortium in 1996. The College of Wooster merged its library catalogue with [[Denison University]], [[Kenyon College]] and [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] to form the [[CONSORT Colleges|CONSORT]] library system. The CONSORT library system provides its patrons access to the combined holdings of all four colleges.
* '''OhioLINK:''' CONSORT is a member of [[OhioLINK]], a statewide consortium of academic libraries as well as the State Library of Ohio, which agreed to make their collections available to library patrons within this network. CONSORT's membership into OhioLink gives its patrons immediate access to a collection of books, online journals and databases that rivals the largest academic libraries in the country. The OhioLINK catalogue represents 89 libraries in the state and lists nearly 11.5 million unique titles from total holdings of 48 million items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is OhioLINK |url=http://www.ohiolink.edu/about/what-is-ol.html |publisher=Ohiolink.edu |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206205827/http://www.ohiolink.edu/about/what-is-ol.html |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art Museum===
The College of Wooster Art Museum was established in the 1930s as a small gallery to facilitate the teaching of art and art research at the college. The current museum was established at the Ebert Art Center in 1997. The museum houses two small galleries, the Charlene Derge Sussel Art Gallery and the Burton D. Morgan Gallery, as well as storage for the college's permanent art collection. The museum's encyclopedic collection spans from ancient to contemporary art. Permanent collections include the John Taylor Arms Print Collection - which represents works by [[Edward Hopper]], [[Winslow Homer]], [[Isabel Bishop]], [[Martin Lewis (artist)|Martin Lewis]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Käthe Kollwitz]] and [[Félix Bracquemond]] - the William C. Mithoefer Collection of African Art, Middle Eastern pottery and Chinese decorative art.

===Residence life===

The College of Wooster is a residential campus and has 16 residence halls, which house 16 to 270 students each, and 30 program houses that 99% of the student body live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residences|url=http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences/|website=www.wooster.edu|publisher=The College of Wooster|accessdate=22 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104105228/http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residence halls include Andrews Hall, Armington Hall, Babcock Hall, Bissman Hall, Bornhuetter Hall, Brush Hall, Compton Hall, Douglass Hall, Gault Manor, Gault Schoolhouse, Holden Hall, Kenarden Lodge, Luce Hall, Stevenson Hall, and Wagner Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halls|url=http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences/halls/|website=www.wooster.edu|publisher=The College of Wooster|accessdate=21 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020124652/http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences/halls/|archivedate=20 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International presence===
Elias Compton, former dean of the College, founded the Wooster in India program during the 1930s, which established a sister school relationship with [[Ewing Christian College]] in [[Allahabad, India]]. Over a forty-year time span, Wooster sent several former students to serve as Head Resident at Ewing while Ewing faculty were brought to Wooster as Ewing Fellows; a plaque with the names of Ewing Fellows hangs in Babcock Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Education Week {{pipe}} Cosmos |date=October 2008 |volume=22 Issue 3 |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/oisa/COSMOS/2008-09/november.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Wooster.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209072013/http://www.wooster.edu/oisa/COSMOS/2008-09/november.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wooster in India program helped build this unique bond between Wooster and India that enhanced the exchange of students, ideas and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Thewoostervoice.com |title=International Insight |url=http://thewoostervoice.com/2009/08/international-insight-3/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208232922/http://thewoostervoice.com/2009/08/international-insight-3/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-12-08 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This international presence affected the entire campus, establishing a tradition which continues to influence the College. Today, approximately six percent of the student body is international in origin, representing more than 30 different countries.&lt;ref name='wooster.edu'/&gt; The College offers majors in Cultural Area Studies and International Relations, instruction in seven foreign languages and opportunities to study abroad in 60 countries. Fifty-nine percent of Wooster students are from outside of Ohio.&lt;ref name='wooster.edu'/&gt;
* '''Scot Center:''' In early 2012, the Scot Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wooster.edu/About-Wooster/rec_center |title=The Scot Center - College of Wooster |publisher=Wooster.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620190658/http://www.wooster.edu/About-Wooster/rec_center |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a {{convert|123000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}  $30 million recreation facility, opened its doors.  It includes four multipurpose sport courts (for intramural basketball, volleyball and tennis), a 200-meter indoor track, a new fitness center, batting cages for baseball and softball, expanded locker rooms, coaches' offices and meeting facilities. The building also boasts a {{convert|20,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} solar roof, the largest of any college facility in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wooster.edu/News-and-Events/News-Releases/2010/September/Largest-Solar-Roof |title=Scot Center's Solar Roof Will Be Largest at Any College in U.S. - College of Wooster |publisher=Wooster.edu |date=2010-09-20 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324093221/http://www.wooster.edu/News-and-Events/News-Releases/2010/September/Largest-Solar-Roof |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scot Center is the first phase of a master plan to create a Campus Center.

* '''Luce Residence Hall''': Luce Hall houses six language suites (Chinese, Classics, French, German, Spanish &amp; Russian) providing students with a living/learning environment focusing on developing foreign language skills. The building features submarine-inspired architectural details, like a winding floorplan and porthole windows.

===Athletics===
Wooster's athletic history dates back to its first baseball team, in 1880, which played only one game, losing 12-2 to [[Kenyon College]].  The football program was established in 1889; over its first two seasons, the team won all seven games it played, by a total score of 306-4.  Included was a 64-0 victory at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] on November 1, 1890, in the Buckeyes' first-ever home football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=12442 |title=Site of First Ohio State Home Football Game / The Ohio State University First Football Team 1890 Marker |publisher=Hmdb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafter, intercollegiate sports were banned by the College President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/archives/history.php |title=Athletics - College of Wooster |publisher=Athletics.wooster.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602063939/http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/archives/history.php |archivedate=2008-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After varsity athletics returned in 1901, Wooster became an early member of the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]]  (OAC).  In 1983, Wooster (along with the rest of the [[Five Colleges of Ohio|Ohio Five]]) broke away from the OAC to form the [[North Coast Athletic Conference]] (NCAC).  The NCAC, which competes at the non-scholarship [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] level of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], was founded primarily on the principle of offering women equal opportunity to participate in varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northcoast.org/history.html |title=NCAC History |publisher=Northcoast.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607184750/http://www.northcoast.org/history.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its first season of competition, 1984–85, the NCAC sponsored 21 sports, eleven for men and ten for women.  Women's softball was added in 1998, and women's golf in 2010, giving the NCAC its current 23 sports.  Wooster fields varsity athletic teams in all 23 of these sports.

====Scottish heritage====
Wooster's school colors are black and old gold, and its mascot is the 'Fighting [[Scottish ethnicity|Scot]]'.  Early Wooster teams were known as the Presbyterians, or unofficially as the 'Presbyterian Steamroller', due to the football team's success.&lt;ref&gt;The Presbyterian church in America is descended from the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1939, a large donation from alumnus Birt Babcock funded the purchase of kilts for the marching band, in the yellow-and-black [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeod]] tartan (MacLeod of Lewis), which had no particular significance, except that it matched the school colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.wooster.edu/traditions/kilts.php |title=Admissions &amp; Financial Aid - College of Wooster |publisher=Admissions.wooster.edu |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509172602/http://admissions.wooster.edu/traditions/kilts.php |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scotland|Scottish]] culture eventually became an important part of the school's heritage; today, the [[American football|football]] games feature a Scottish [[pipe band]] with Highland dancers in addition to a traditional marching band, with all three groups clad in the MacLeod tartan.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} The college offers the "Scottish Arts Scholarship" for students who perform as pipers, drummers, or Scottish dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Arts Scholarship|url=http://www.wooster.edu/admissions/scholarships/scottish/|website=www.wooster.edu|publisher=The College of Wooster|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baseball====
The baseball team has made five appearances in the [[NCAA Division III Baseball Championship|NCAA Division III World Series]], including second-place finishes in 2009 and 1997.  Wooster has made 23 appearances in the NCAA baseball tournament under head coach Tim Pettorini, who has led the Scots since 1982. Pettorini has guided the Scots to over 1,100 victories, placing him in the all-time top ten among D-III baseball coaches, and the winningest active coach as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/baseball_RB/2016/coach.pdf|title=NCAA Baseball Coaching Records|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scots have also won a conference-record seventeen NCAC championships, most recently in 2017, under Pettorini.  Prior to Pettorini's tenure, Bob Morgan led the Scots to the NCAA tournament in each of his final five seasons, giving Wooster a total of 25 appearances since the event began in 1976.  During the first decade of the 21st century, the Scots had a record of 372-98, winning more games than any other team in Division III, and were second in winning percentage over that span, trailing only  [[The College of St. Scholastica]].  Following his graduation in 2010, All-American second baseman Matthew Johnson signed with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] organization, and played for four seasons in their minor-league system.

====Basketball====
Long-time head men's basketball coach Steve Moore has won over 700 games at Wooster, and in 2017 became the second-winningest coach all-time in NCAA Division III.  His teams have won 17 NCAC championships and have made 24 appearances in the [[NCAA Men's Division III Basketball Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northcoast.org/mb/mballtime.pdf |title=North Coast Athletic Conference : Men's Basketball All-Time Standings |publisher=Northcoast.org |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326150528/http://www.northcoast.org/mb/mballtime.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a record 14 in a row from 2003 through 2016. The team reached the national semifinals ("Final Four") of the NCAA D-III Tournament in 2003, 2007, and 2011.  The 2011 team set a school record for victories, with a record of 31-3, and reached the national championship game before falling to [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|St. Thomas (Minnesota)]].  The 2003 team was close behind at 30-3, with center Bryan Nelson named D-III Men's Basketball Player of the Year.  Home games are contested in the 3,400-seat Timken Gym,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woosterathletics.com/facilities/files/timken.html |title=College of Wooster Athletics : Timken Gymnasium |publisher=Woosterathletics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is often filled to capacity for big games, including the rivalry contest with [[Wittenberg University]] and post-season tournaments.  Since 2000, the Scots have been in the top ten in D-III basketball attendance every year, ranking 2nd in some seasons, with over 2,000 fans per home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/Reports/attend/2011.pdf|title=2011 NCAA MEN’S BASKETBALL ATTENDANCE|publisher=[[NCAA]]|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Football====
The University of Wooster scored the first touchdown in the state of Ohio against Denison University in 1888 and was a football powerhouse in Ohio. [[Charles Follis]], the first black professional football player, attended the University of Wooster and starred on the baseball team before signing with the Shelby Athletic Club to play professional football in 1902. Wooster was the last State of Ohio team not to be beaten by Ohio State, when it tied the Buckeyes at home on November 1, 1924. (as of 2018)
The football team's greatest success occurred between 1916 and 1934; during this era, Wooster had a record of 118-31-12,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/results/1900.php |title=Athletics - College of Wooster |publisher=Athletics.wooster.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008042459/http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/results/1900.php |archivedate=2008-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and won four outright OAC championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.org/documents/2008FBGuidecb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611072809/http://www.oac.org/documents/2008FBGuidecb.pdf |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1934 title would be the Scots' last outright conference championship for 70 years, with only a trio of shared conference titles (1959/1970 OAC and 1997 NCAC) during that time.  In 2004, the team recorded a perfect 10-0 regular season and won its first outright NCAC conference championship, as well as its first  [[NCAA Division III National Football Championship|NCAA D-III football tournament]] game.  The 2004 team was led by senior All-American running back Tony Sutton, who set multiple NCAA Division III career rushing records and was a 2014 finalist for the Gagliardi Trophy, the D-III equivalent of the [[Heisman Trophy]].   From 1995 through 2008, Wooster's record was 99-43, making this the most successful era since [[World War II]].  In 2009, lights and artificial turf were added to the Scots' 4,500-seat John Papp stadium.  The first-ever nighttime football game at Wooster was played on October 10, 2009, against [[Case Western Reserve University]], with Case retaining the [[Baird Brothers Trophy]] by virtue of a 53-32 victory over the Scots.

====Other sports====
In the early 21st century, the women's field hockey and women's lacrosse teams each won their multiple NCAC championships, earning automatic bids to their national NCAA D-III tournaments.  The only national championship won by a Wooster athletic team came in 1975, when the men's golf team won the NCAA D-III title.

====Academic All-Americans====
Since 2000, Scots have been named Academic All-Americans 32 times by [[College Sports Information Directors of America]], in the College division, which includes NCAA Division II and Division III institutions, as well as NAIA schools, a total of over 1000 colleges.

===Performing arts===
Wooster is the home of the [[Ohio Light Opera]], an enterprise founded within the college in 1979, but not part of the college curriculum. It is the only professional company in the United States entirely devoted to [[operetta]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. OLO performs the entire [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] repertoire, but also regularly revives rarely performed continental works of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Over the years, the Company has produced eighty different operettas.

Wooster's performing ensembles include the Wooster Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1915 by Daniel Parmelee, then Professor of Violin at the college. The orchestra currently is the second-oldest orchestra in continuous performance in the state of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wooster.edu/Academics/Areas-of-Study/Music/Ensembles/Orchestra |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525193416/http://www.wooster.edu/Academics/Areas-of-Study/Music/Ensembles/Orchestra |archivedate=May 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional ensembles include the Scot Symphonic and Marching Bands, the Wooster Chorus, and the Wooster Jazz Ensemble.

Wooster has an active on-campus pipe band. Officially called the College of Wooster Pipe Band, members perform at many official on-campus events such as commencement, sports games (football, basketball, swim meets, and sometimes lacrosse games) and many spontaneous student-run events. During the spring season they perform and compete at a grade 3 level, having won prizes at the Scots wi' Shotts event in Cleveland hosted by the local Lochaber Pipe Band.  The Pipe Band also placed first in the grade 3 contest at the 2009 Toronto Indoor Highland Games, as the only American band competing.

The College's department of Theatre and Dance produces two dance concerts per year, a fall concert in the round, and a spring concert in a more formal proscenium setting.  Additionally, the college produces at least two plays each academic year.  Further plays are produced by student groups and seniors pursuing their Independent Study projects.  In 2007, Wooster's theatre production of 'Nocturne' was invited to perform at the Kennedy Center's American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C. Wooster's production was one of four shows chosen from a field of approximately 400 entries.

===Student activities and clubs===
The College of Wooster has over one hundred student organizations, from the Jenny Investment Club, which allows students to invest real money for the college as they learn about the stock market, to Common Grounds, a student-run coffee shop and house program offering 'an alternative atmosphere to the partying scene' for the college community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wooster.edu/commongrounds/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030910134443/http://www.wooster.edu/commongrounds/index.html |archivedate=September 10, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently ten active Greek groups at the College of Wooster, six sororities and four fraternities.  Called ''clubs'' and ''sections'', these groups are not affiliated with national Greek organizations, and approximately fifteen percent of the student body participates.

The college has a wide variety of student-run media. ''The Wooster Voice'' is the weekly student newspaper with a newly launched website, and has been published continuously since 1886 (see [[list of college newspapers]]), while [[WCWS]] (WOO 91) is the college radio station. ''The Goliard'' is the annual literary magazine. Each year, English professor Daniel Bourne also publishes an international literary magazine called ''Artful Dodge''. Additionally, the English Department has classes every two years on journalism and magazine writing; these students create and publish a newspaper and a magazine respectively.
 
The college also has a successful [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate Frisbee]] program. The Women's team, Betty Gone Wild, won USAUltimate's D-III College Championship Sectionals in 2014 and 2015. Also in 2014 and 2015 they came in 2nd at USAUltimate's D-III College Championship Regionals. They attended the National College Championship in 2014 and came in 15th place with a 1st place award in spirit.

The college is well known for its Moot Court team as part of the American Moot Court Association, and is currently ranked second in the nation by the ACMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmamootcourt.org/top-programs-in-intercollegiate-moot-court|title=Top Programs in Intercollegiate Moot Court|website=www.acmamootcourt.org|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the teams regional championships, the College routinely qualifies teams to the Moot Court Nationals tournament and was the 2008 National Champion. In 2017, Wooster qualified five teams to the nationals tournament and had teams finish 12th, 16th, and 18th in oral argument, 13th and 14th in oration, and third in appellate brief writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmamootcourt.org/results|title=Results|website=www.acmamootcourt.org|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is led by professor of political theory Desiree Weber and professor emeritus and President of the ACMA Mark Weaver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wooster.edu/academics/areas/pre-law/moot-court/tournament/|title=Regional Tournament Information {{!}} The College of Wooster|website=www.wooster.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5262">The '''daily urban system (DUS)''' refers to the area around a city, in which daily commuting occurs. It is a means for defining an [[urban area|urban]] region by including the areas from which individuals commute. Daily Urban System is a concept first introduced by American geographer, Berry, and British geographer, Hall. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halás, Marián|first=and Zuskáčová, Veronika|date=April 23, 2017|title="Travelling to Services in the Daily Urban System of Olomouc."|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/BGSS/article/viewFile/bog-2013-0009/818|journal=Bulletin of Geography. Socio–economic Series.|volume=20|pages=23–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Orphan|date=June 2016}}

Daily urban system (DUS) mainly focusses on urban cities, where majority of the commuting flow take place. However, some case studies do look at the outskirts and suburban areas around specific urban cities that are being studied. The daily commuting includes both work and leisure, contributing to high density in the daily urban system. That results in slower the speed of transportation. The speed of transportation is about 16km/h at the central parts of urban cities, but speed may vary from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denise Pumain|Pumain, Denise]]. "Scaling Laws and Urban Systems" (PDF). Santa Fe Institute. Retrieved April 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Urban sprawl]] is the possible outcome of an expansion of the daily urban system. Therefore, it includes multiple local governments, economies, and demographics. The researchers that study daily urban system (DUS) are basically focusing on the [[transportation planning]]. Some are interested in micro analysis of an urban area per se, some carry out macro analysis of a region that is made up of several urban cities. 

The difference between an agglomeration of an urban area and the daily urban system is that an agglomeration is a multivariate means of combining townships, counties, and other defined areas. It looks at shared economic relationships and other factors. Daily urban system, on the other hand, only attempts to show how far away people who commute into a city are living. It shows how much sprawl has occurred. That is, it shows how people are living unnecessarily far away from where they commute to everyday due to differences in conditions between the regions. 

== Literature Review ==

=== Olomouc ===
A study in Olomouc research on the traveling distance among locations such as schools, hospitals, retail stores, and culture and sports centers of the region, and the towns in the hinterland of Olomouc too. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The findings were different for the region and towns. The towns had shown improvement in traveling distance for commercial services, such as pharmacies and banking services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were groceries and retail shops moving to large commercial centers too, cutting down traveling distance, which people were able to shop at the malls without having to travel much.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the study found little changes region wise, especially in health care and education sectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Commute for schools and health care institutions had remained stable.  

===Randstad===
In this article, the researchers were looking at the daily urban systems within Randstad to determine if the megalopolis is considered a network city. Commute within Randstad remained loose despite the rising proportions of population commuting to work over a decade (1992 to 2002).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritsema Van Eck, Snellen|first=Jan, Daniëlle|date=2006|title=Is the Randstad a City Network? Evidence From Commuting Patterns|url=https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/11/11.951/oldstuff/albacete/Other_Documents/Europe%20Transport%20Conference/planning_for_sustainab/is_the_randstad_a_1428.pdf|journal=Association for European Transport|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many residents from the suburban areas were still commuting to work at the urban areas - large daily urban system - every day after ten years due to low job growth. Randstad was not considered as a network city because of its negative commuting balance, where large proportion of residents had to commute to large daily urban system for work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Paris ===
Paris's central urban population is 2,125,246.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It's agglomerated population is 9,644,507.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That's a big difference. Roughly 7 million people live outside of Paris proper, but are easily within the greater Parisian area. Paris's daily urban system has a population of 11,174,743.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That's 1.5 million people living outside of what can (at the most generous) be called Paris, and yet are commuting there every day. 10% of the city lives far enough away that they cannot really say they 'live outside of Paris,' but commute there daily.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pumain|first=Denise|title=Scaling Laws and Urban Systems|url=http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/04-02-002.pdf|publisher=[[Santa Fe Institute]]|accessdate=February 28, 2014|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Archaeology''' at the [[University of York]], England, is a [[academic department|department]] which provides undergraduate and postgraduate courses in [[archaeology]] and its sub-disciplines and conducts associated research. It was founded in 1978 and has grown from a small department based at Micklegate House to more than a hundred undergraduate students based at [[King's Manor]] and with scientific facilities at the '''BioArCh''' centre on the main campus.

==Hosted organisations, research specialities and fieldwork==
The archaeology department hosts several specialist organisations:
*[[Archaeology Data Service]] - an open access digital archive for archaeological research outputs
*[[Internet Archaeology]] - a fully peer-reviewed electronic journal for archaeology
*BioArCh - a specialist centre using scientific and molecular techniques for archaeology
*Centre for Digital Heritage - an interdisciplinary centre studying computer-based approaches to heritage. Working with the universities of [[Aarhus University|Aarhus]] (Denmark), [[Leiden University|Leiden]] (Netherlands), [[Lund University|Lund]] (Sweden), [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] (Sweden).
*The ''Post Hole'' -  is an archaeology journal run by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theposthole.org/about |title=The Post Hole |accessdate=11 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department's faculty has led significant archaeological investigations across [[Great Britain]] and occasionally further afield

The department opened in 1978, 15 years after the [[University of York#History|university]] itself. The first head of department, [[Philip Rahtz]] built a thematic undergraduate programme specialising in the [[Britain in the Middle Ages|British Middle Ages]]. The programme included a 12-week field course in [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt; The department expanded under [[Martin Carver]] after his appointment in 1986. A [[postgraduate]] programme was added and the department moved to [[King's Manor]]. Subsequently, the department has grown in numbers of students, staff and the diversity of its specialisms: adding [[environmental archaeology]], [[prehistory]], [[computational archaeology]], [[archaeological science]] and [[cultural heritage management]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14959">'''Deployment cost–benefit selection in physiology''' concerns the costs and benefits of  [[Physiology|physiological process]] that can be deployed and selected in regard to whether they will increase or not an animal’s survival and [[biological fitness]]. Variably deployable physiological processes relate mostly to processes that defend or clear infections as these are optional while also having high costs and circumstance linked benefits. They include [[immune system]] responses, [[fever]], [[antioxidants]] and the plasma level of [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron]]. Notable determining factors are [[Biological life cycle|life history]] stage, and resource availability.

==Antioxidants==
[[Antioxidants]] such as [[carotenoids]], [[vitamin C]], [[Vitamin E]], and enzymes such as [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD) and [[glutathione peroxidase]] (GPx) can protect against [[reactive oxygen species]] that [[DNA damage theory of aging|damage DNA]], proteins and lipids, and result in [[Senescence|cell senescence]] and death. A cost exists in creating or obtaining these antioxidants. This creates a conflict between the biological fitness benefits of future survival compared with the use of these antioxidants to advantage present reproductive success. In some birds, antioxidants are diverted from maintaining the body to reproduction for this reason with the result that they have accelerated senescence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Iron metabolism|Iron]] is vital to biological processes, not only of a [[Host (biology)|host]], but also to [[bacteria]] infecting the host.

The '''Dublin Core Schema''' is a small set of [[Controlled vocabulary|vocabulary terms]] that can be used to describe digital resources (video, images, web pages, etc.), as well as physical resources such as books or CDs, and objects like artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/ |title=DCMI Type Vocabulary |website=dublincore.org |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full set of Dublin Core [[metadata]] terms can be found on the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/ |title=DCMI Metadata Terms |website=dublincore.org |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original set of 15 classic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dublincore.org/specifications/ |title=DCMI Specifications |website=dublincore.org |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; metadata terms, known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES),&lt;ref name="DCMES"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ |title=Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 |website=dublincore.org |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is endorsed in the following standards documents:

Dublin Core metadata may be used for multiple purposes, from simple resource description to combining metadata vocabularies of different [[Metadata#Standards|metadata standards]], to providing interoperability for metadata vocabularies in the [[linked data]] cloud and [[Semantic Web]] implementations.

==Background==
"Dublin" refers to [[Dublin, Ohio]], USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincore.org/news/1995/1995-03-01_the-oclcncsa-metadata-workshop-the-essential-elements-of-network-object-description/|title=DCMI: The OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop: The Essential Elements of Network Object Description|author=|date=|website=www.dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by the [[OCLC]] (Online Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA). "Core" refers to the metadata terms as "broad and generic being usable for describing a wide range of resources".&lt;ref name="DCMES"/&gt; The semantics of Dublin Core were established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from [[librarianship]], [[computer science]], [[text encoding]], [[museum]]s, and other related fields of scholarship and practice.

Starting in 2000, the Dublin Core community focused on "[[application profile]]s" &amp;ndash; the idea that metadata records would use Dublin Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements. During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium's work on a generic [[data model]] for metadata, the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF, more recently in the context of the [[linked data]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCMI Metadata Basics|publisher=dublincore.org/metadata-basics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dublin Core Metadata Initiative''' (DCMI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/ |title=DCMI Home: Dublin Core® Metadata Initiative (DCMI) |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an open forum for the development of interoperable online [[metadata standards]] for a broad range of purposes and of business models. DCMI's activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops, standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an independent entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=OCLC Research and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative | url=http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/past/orprojects/dublincore/default.htm | accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ |title=Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of the standard==
The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. '''Simple Dublin Core''' comprised 15 elements; '''Qualified Dublin Core''' included three additional elements (Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers) that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.

Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the '''DCMI Metadata Terms''' as a single set of terms using the [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] data model.&lt;ref name="dublincore1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/ |title=DCMI Metadata Terms |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full set of elements is found under the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms/. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges, which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/|title=DCMI: Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1: Reference Description|author=|date=|website=dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dublin Core Metadata Element Set===
The original '''DCMES''' Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements:&lt;ref name="DCMES"/&gt;
# Title
# Creator
# Subject
# Description
# Publisher
# Contributor
# Date
# Type
# Format
# Identifier
# Source
# Language
# Relation
# Coverage
# Rights

Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a NISO standards, Z39.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007.  ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the [[ISO/IEC 19788]]-2 Metadata for learning resources (MLR) &amp;ndash; Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC36|ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36]].

Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in the Dublin Core Metadata Registry.&lt;ref name="registry"&gt;[http://dcmi.kc.tsukuba.ac.jp/dcregistry/ Dublin Core Metadata Registry]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Encoding examples====
: {{code|2=html5|1=&lt;meta name="DC.Format" content="video/mpeg; 10 minutes" /&gt;}}
: {{code|2=html5|1=&lt;meta name="DC.Language" content="en" /&gt;}}
: {{code|2=html5|1=&lt;meta name="DC.Publisher" content="publisher-name" /&gt;}}
: {{code|2=html5|1=&lt;meta name="DC.Title" content="HYP" /&gt;}}

====Example of use [and mention] by WebCite====
On the "archive form" web page for [[WebCite]] it says,&lt;ref name="WebCite form"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcitation.org/archive |title= WebCite archive form |website=[[WebCite]] |quote=These are Dublin Core elements. Entering these will help you to correctly cite the URL. [...]}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part: "Metadata (optional): These are Dublin Core elements. [...]".

===Qualified Dublin Core===
(Superseded in 2008 by the DCMI Metadata Terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/07/11/dcmes-qualifiers/ |title=Dublin Core Qualifiers |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Subsequent to the specification of the original 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the DCMES was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.

Element refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the ''Dumb-Down Principle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/|title=DCMI: DCMI Grammatical Principles|author=|date=|website=www.dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that an application that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery.

In addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes include [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]] and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation, for example, "2000-12-31" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may still be useful to a '''human reader'''.

'''Audience, Provenance''' and '''RightsHolder''' are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15 elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core. DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type. This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.&lt;ref name="registry"/&gt;

===DCMI Metadata Terms===
The DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary.&lt;ref name="dublincore1"/&gt; This set includes the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in ''italic''), as well as the qualified terms. Each term has a unique URI in the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms, and all are defined as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] properties.

==Syntax==
Syntax choices for Dublin Core metadata depends on a number of variables, and "one size fits all" prescriptions rarely apply. When considering an appropriate syntax, it is important to note that Dublin Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent and are equally applicable in a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation both by machines and by human beings.

The '''Dublin Core Abstract Model'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/|title=DCMI: DCMI Abstract Model|author=|date=|website=dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a reference model against which particular Dublin Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such a reference model allows implementers to gain a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between different syntax.

==Notable applications==
One [[Document Type Definition]] based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework (OMF) specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/osrt/omf/|title=m e t a l a b open source metadata framework|author=|date=|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMF is in turn used by [[Rarian]] (superseding [[ScrollKeeper]]), which is used by the [[GNOME]] desktop and [[KDE]] help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server. [[PBCore]] is also based on Dublin Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pbcore.org/schema/|title=PBCore Schema – PBCore|last=|first=|date=|website=pbcore.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-19|quote=PBCore is built on the foundation of the Dublin Core (ISO 15836), an international standard for resource discovery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zope]] [[Zope Content Management Framework|CMF's]] Metadata products, used by the [[Plone (software)|Plone]], [[ERP5]], the Nuxeo CPS [[Content management system]]s, [[SimpleDL]], and [[Fedora Commons]] also implement Dublin Core. The [[EPUB]] [[e-book]] format uses Dublin Core metadata in the [[OPF (file format)|OPF file]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0_latest.htm#Section2.2 |title=Open Packaging Format (OPF) § Publication Metadata |website=[[International Digital Publishing Forum]] |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EDGE of Existence logo.png|right|200px]]
The '''''EDGE of Existence programme''''' is a research and conservation initiative that focuses on species deemed to be the world’s most ''Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered'' (EDGE). Developed by the [[Zoological Society of London]] (ZSL), the programme aims to raise awareness of the world’s [[EDGE Species|EDGE species]], implement targeted research and conservation actions to halt their decline, and to train in-country scientists (called EDGE Fellows) to protect them now and in the future.

== Goals ==
&lt;div style="float:right; border:1px solid #ccc; font-size:90%; text-align:center; padding:2px;"&gt;
{{IUCN_3.1_navmap/full}}
Summary of 2006 IUCN Red List categories.
&lt;/div&gt;
The EDGE programme seeks to:
* Identify the current status of poorly known, endangered, vulnerable and possibly extinct EDGE species.
* Develop and implement conservation measures for all EDGE species not currently protected.
* Support local scientists to research and conserve EDGE species worldwide.

== Conserving EDGE species ==
The EDGE of Existence programme is centred on an interactive website that features information on the top 100 EDGE [[mammals]] and [[amphibians]], detailing their specific [[Conservation biology|conservation]] requirements.  Ten focal species from each class are highlighted each year. Each of the top 100 species is given an EDGE-ometer rating according to the degree of conservation attention they are currently receiving, as well as its perceived rarity in its natural environment.  Recent research suggests that 70% of the world’s top 100 EDGE mammals are currently receiving little or no conservation attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Isaac NJB)), Turvey ST, Collen B, Waterman C, ((Baillie JEM)) | editor1-last = Reid | year = 2007 | editor1-first = Walt | title = Mammals on the EDGE: Conservation Priorities Based on Threat and Phylogeny | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = e296 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000296 | pmid = 17375184 | pmc = 1808424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of the EDGE of Existence programme is to ensure that appropriate research and/or conservation actions are implemented for each of these species by 2012.

== EDGE Fellows ==
EDGE research and conservation is carried out by ZSL researchers, a large network of partner organizations and in-country scientists. An integral part of the EDGE programme is the EDGE Fellows Scheme, which provides funding and support to in-country scientists for field research on the conservation status and threats facing a particular EDGE species.  EDGE Fellows participate in all phases of a research project, from study design to data collection, analysis and interpretation and receive guidance and training in monitoring techniques, community outreach and education.  Each project is focused on delivering a conservation action plan.

== Conservation catalyst ==
Once the action plan is completed, a meeting with local stakeholders is held to make additions and corrections to the document and to agree on a timeline and institutional responsibilities.

== Accomplishments ==

===2007===
*2007 - EDGE Fellows hired to do field research on the [[Bactrian camel]], [[long-eared jerboa]], and the [[pygmy hippopotamus]].
*May 2007 - Expedition to [[Haiti]] to research the [[Hispaniolan solenodon]].
*May 2007 - Expedition to [[Papua (province)|Papua]] uncovered evidence that [[Attenborough's long-beaked echidna]] still lives in the Cyclops Mountains.  Conservation plans are underway.
*August 2007 - Shortly after the [[baiji]] is declared extinct, a video appears that may show a living specimen, one of EDGE's selected mammals for this year.
*December 2007 - EDGE releases first footage of the long-eared jerboa ever captured in the wild from expedition to [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edgeofexistence.org/edgeblog/?p=213 |title=First known footage of wild long-eared jerboas |publisher=ZSL EDGE website |date=2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
*2008 - Three new EDGE Fellows hired to research the [[bumblebee bat]], the [[slender loris]] and the [[golden-rumped elephant shrew]].
*January 2008 - EDGE begins its amphibians program by releasing the top 100 EDGE amphibians and naming ten focal species.
*March 2008 - An EDGE expedition to [[Liberia]] captures rare images of the wild pygmy hippopotamus within three days of installing a network of camera traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7286860.stm |title=Rare pygmy hippos caught on film |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2008-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
*January 2009 - Rediscovery of Hispaniolan solenodon in Haiti, followed by the establishment of a new UK [[Darwin Initiative]] funded Hispaniolan Endemic Land Mammals Project. This project seeks to enable the long-term conservation of the Hispaniolan solenodon and hutia through participatory species action planning, field research and monitoring, and improved public awareness.  It is a collaborative project between Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Zoological Society of London, Sociedad Ornitologíca de la Hispaniola, Parque Zoológico Nacional, and the Oficina de Parques Nacionales de la Republica Dominicana.

===2010===
*July 2010 - EDGE conservationists in Sri Lanka rediscover the [[Horton Plains slender loris]] (Loris tardigradus nycticeboides). Originally documented in 1937, there have only been four known encounters in the past 72 years. The rediscovery and capture by the team has resulted in the first detailed physical examination of this sub-species.

== Future directions ==
The programme is initially focusing on mammals and has recently incorporated amphibians but will expand to cover other groups, including [[birds]], [[reptiles]], [[fish]] and [[plants]] as the infrastructure and methods develop.

'''Electric power distribution''' is the final stage in the [[Power delivery|delivery]] of [[electric power]]; it carries electricity from the [[Electric power transmission|transmission system]] to individual consumers. Distribution substations connect to the transmission system and lower the transmission voltage to medium [[voltage]] ranging between 2&amp;nbsp;[[kilovolt|kV]] and 35&amp;nbsp;kV with the use of [[transformer]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; ''Primary'' distribution lines carry this medium voltage power to [[distribution transformer]]s located near the customer's premises. Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the [[utilization voltage]] used by lighting, industrial equipment or household appliances. Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through ''secondary'' distribution lines. Commercial and residential customers are connected to the secondary distribution lines through [[service drop]]s. Customers demanding a much larger amount of power may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the [[subtransmission]] level.&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;

==History==
{{further|History of electric power transmission}}
[[File:Brush Company arc light madison square new york 1882.png|thumb|upright|The late 1870s and early 1880s saw the introduction of [[arc lamp]] lighting used outdoors or in large indoor spaces such as this [[Brush Electric Company]] system installed in 1880 in [[New York City]].]]

Electric power distribution only became necessary in the 1880s when electricity started being generated at [[power stations]]. Before that electricity was usually generated where it was used. The first power distribution systems installed in European and US cities were used to supply lighting: [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] running on very high voltage (around 3000 volts) [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), and [[incandescent lamp|incandescent lighting]] running on low voltage (100 volt) direct current.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin R. Skrabec, The 100 Most Significant Events in American Business: An Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO – 2012, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; Both were supplanting [[gas lighting]] systems, with arc lighting taking over large area and street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential lighting.

Due to the high voltages used in arc lighting, a single generating station could supply a long string of lights, up to {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} long circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers|last=Berly|first=J.|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers|volume=IX|date=1880-03-24|title=Notes on the Jablochkoff System of Electric Lighting|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lww4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA143|issue=32|page=143|accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each doubling of the voltage would allow the same size cable to transmit the same amount of power four times the distance for a given power loss. Direct current indoor incandescent lighting systems, for example the first Edison [[Pearl Street Station]] installed in 1882, had difficulty supplying customers more than a mile away. This was due to the low 110 volt system being used throughout the system, from the generators to the final use. The Edison DC system needed thick copper conductor cables, and the generating plants needed to be within about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} of the farthest customer to avoid excessively large and expensive conductors.

=== Introduction of the transformer ===
Transmitting electricity a long distance at high voltage and then reducing it to a lower voltage for lighting became a recognized engineering roadblock to electric power distribution with many, not very satisfactory, solutions tested by lighting companies. The mid-1880s saw a breakthrough with the development of functional [[transformer]]s that allowed the AC voltage to be "stepped up" to much higher transmission voltages and then dropped down to a lower end user voltage. With much cheaper transmission costs and the greater [[economies of scale]] of having large generating plants supply whole cities and regions, the use of AC spread rapidly.

In the US the competition between direct current and alternating current took a personal turn in the late 1880s in the form of a "[[War of Currents]]" when [[Thomas Edison]] started attacking [[George Westinghouse]] and his development of the first US AC transformer systems, pointing out all the deaths caused by high voltage AC systems over the years and claiming any AC system was inherently dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Webb B.|last=Garrison|title=Behind the headlines: American history's schemes, scandals, and escapades|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=1983|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison's propaganda campaign was short lived with his company switching over to AC in 1892.

AC became the dominant form of transmission of power with innovations in  Europe and the US in [[electric motor]] designs and the development of engineered ''universal systems'' allowing the large number of legacy systems to be connected to large AC grids.&lt;ref name="Thomas Parke Hughes 1930, pages 120-121"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Parke Hughes|title=Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880–1930|publisher=JHU Press|year=1993|pages= 120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raghu Garud 2009, page 249"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Raghu|last1=Garud|first2=Arun|last2=Kumaraswamy|first3= Richard|last3= Langlois|title= Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks, and Organizations|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2009| page= 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, in many places the [[electric power industry]] was [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]], meaning that one company did generation, transmission, distribution, metering and billing. Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, nations began the process of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], leading to [[electricity market]]s. The distribution system would remain regulated, but generation, retail, and sometimes transmission systems were transformed into competitive markets.

==Generation and transmission==
&lt;imagemap&gt;

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Electric power begins at a generating station, where the potential difference can be as high as 33,000 volts. AC is usually used. Users of large amounts of DC power such as some [[railway electrification system]]s, [[telephone exchange]]s and industrial processes such as [[aluminium]] smelting  use [[rectifier]]s to derive DC from the public AC supply, or may have their own generation systems.  [[HVDC|High-voltage DC]] can be advantageous for isolating alternating-current systems or controlling the quantity of electricity transmitted. For example, [[Hydro-Québec]] has a direct-current line which goes from the [[James Bay]] region to [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydroquebec.com/learning/transport/grandes-distances.html|title=Extra-High-Voltage Transmission {{!}} 735 kV {{!}} Hydro-Québec|website=hydroquebec.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the generating station it goes to the generating station’s switchyard where a step-up [[transformer]]&amp;nbsp;increases the voltage to a level suitable for transmission, from 44kV to 765kV. Once in the transmission system, electricity from each generating station is combined with electricity produced elsewhere. Electricity is consumed as soon as it is produced. It is transmitted at a very high speed, close to the [[speed of light]].

== Distribution overview ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
[[File:Electricity Grid Schematic English.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|General layout of [[Grid (electricity)|electricity networks]]. The voltages and loadings are typical of a European network.]]The transition from transmission to distribution happens in a power [[Electrical substation|substation]], which has the following functions:&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/power5.htm|title=How Power Grids Work|website=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Circuit breaker]]s and switches enable the substation to be disconnected from the transmission grid or for distribution lines to be disconnected.
* Transformers step down transmission voltages, 35kV or more, down to primary distribution voltages. These are medium voltage circuits, usually 600-35,000 V.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electric Power Distribution Handbook|last=Short|first=T.A.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4665-9865-2|location=Boca Raton, Florida, USA|pages=1–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the transformer, power goes to the [[busbar]] that can split the distribution power off in multiple directions. The bus distributes power to distribution lines, which fan out to customers.
Urban distribution is mainly underground, sometimes in [[common utility duct]]s. Rural distribution is mostly above ground with [[utility pole]]s, and suburban distribution is a mix.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Closer to the customer, a distribution transformer steps the primary distribution power down to a low-voltage secondary circuit, usually 120/240 volts in the US for residential customers. The power comes to the customer via a [[service drop]] and an [[electricity meter]]. The final circuit in an urban system may be less than 50 feet, but may be over 300 feet for a rural customer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Primary distribution ==
Primary distribution voltages range from 4&amp;nbsp;kV to 35&amp;nbsp;kV phase-to-phase (2.4&amp;nbsp;kV to 20&amp;nbsp;kV phase-to-neutral)&lt;ref name="eep-pdvl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/primary-distribution-voltage-levels|title=Primary Distribution Voltage Levels|last=Csanyi|first=Edvard|date=10 August 2012|website=http://electrical-engineering-portal.com|publisher=EEP – Electrical Engineering Portal|accessdate=9 March 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only large consumers are fed directly from distribution voltages; most utility customers are connected to a transformer, which reduces the distribution voltage to the low voltage "utilization voltage", "supply voltage" or "mains voltage" used by lighting and interior wiring systems.

=== Network configurations ===
[[File:NCPC Power Plant Yellowknife Northwest Territories Canada 08.jpg|thumb|Substation near [[Yellowknife]], in the Northwest Territories of Canada]]

Distribution networks are divided into two types, radial or network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdelhay A. Sallam and Om P. Malik|title=Electric Distribution Systems|year=May 2011|publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press|isbn=9780470276822|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A radial system is arranged like a tree where each customer has one source of supply. A network system has multiple sources of supply operating in parallel. Spot networks are used for concentrated loads. Radial systems are commonly used in rural or suburban areas.

Radial systems usually include emergency connections where the system can be reconfigured in case of problems, such as a fault or planned maintenance. This can be done by opening and closing switches to isolate a certain section from the grid.

Long feeders experience [[voltage drop]] ([[power factor]] distortion) requiring [[capacitor]]s or [[Voltage regulator (distribution)|voltage regulator]]s to be installed.

Reconfiguration, by exchanging the functional links between the elements of the system, represents one of the most important measures which can improve the operational performance of a distribution system. The problem of optimization through the reconfiguration of a power distribution system, in terms of its definition, is a historical single objective problem with constraints. Since 1975, when Merlin and Back&lt;ref&gt;Merlin, A.; Back, H. Search for a Minimal-Loss Operating Spanning Tree Configuration in an Urban Power Distribution System. In Proceedings of the 1975 Fifth Power Systems Computer Conference (PSCC), Cambridge, UK, 1–5 September 1975; pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  introduced the idea of distribution system reconfiguration for active power loss reduction, until nowadays, a lot of researchers have proposed diverse methods and algorithms to solve the reconfiguration problem as a single objective problem. Some authors have proposed Pareto optimality based approaches (including active power losses and reliability indices as objectives). For this purpose, different artificial intelligence based methods have been used: microgenetic,&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, J.E.; Lopez, M.E.; Coello, C.A.; Lopez, E.A. Microgenetic multiobjective reconfiguration algorithm considering power losses and reliability indices for medium voltage distribution network. IET Gener. Transm. Distrib. 2009, 3, 825–840.&lt;/ref&gt; branch exchange,&lt;ref&gt;Bernardon, D.P.; Garcia, V.J.; Ferreira, A.S.Q.; Canha, L.N. Multicriteria distribution network reconfiguration considering subtransmission analysis. IEEE Trans.

Reconfiguration of power distribution systems considering reliability and power loss. IEEE Trans. Power Deliv. 2012, 27, 918–926.&lt;/ref&gt;  and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/6/3/1439/pdf Tomoiagă, B.; Chindriş, M.; Sumper, A.; Sudria-Andreu, A.; Villafafila-Robles, R. Pareto Optimal Reconfiguration of Power Distribution Systems Using a Genetic Algorithm Based on NSGA-II. Energies 2013, 6, 1439–1455.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rural services ===
[[Rural electrification]] systems tend to use higher distribution voltages because of the longer distances covered by distribution lines (see [[Rural Electrification Administration]]). 7.2, 12.47, 25, and 34.5&amp;nbsp;kV distribution is common in the United States; 11&amp;nbsp;kV and 33&amp;nbsp;kV are common in the UK, Australia and New Zealand; 11&amp;nbsp;kV and 22&amp;nbsp;kV are common in South Africa and China.&lt;ref name="eolss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chan|first1=F|title=Electrical Engineering|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c05/e6-39a-06-01.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2016|chapter=Electric Power Distribution Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other voltages are occasionally used.

Rural services normally try to minimize the number of poles and wires. It uses higher voltages (than urban distribution), which in turn permits use of galvanized steel wire. The strong steel wire allows for less expensive wide pole spacing. In rural areas a pole-mount transformer may serve only one customer. In [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan, Canada]], and [[South Africa]], [[Single-wire earth return]] systems (SWER) are used to electrify remote rural areas.

Three phase service provides power for large agricultural facilities, petroleum pumping facilities, water plants, or other customers that have large loads (Three phase equipment).

Usually in the United States, a "4-wire wye system" is used, which includes 3 primary wires and 1 neutral wire.&lt;ref name=TPPS&gt;{{cite web | url = http://power.apitech.com/engineering-tools.aspx | title = engineering tools | date = 2010 | website = apitech.com | publisher = apitech.com | access-date = 24 November 2017 | quote = data}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other countries or in extreme rural areas the neutral wire is connected to the ground to use that as a return ([[Single-wire earth return]]). This is called an unground [[Three-phase electric power#Three-wire and four-wire circuits|wye]] system.

== Secondary distribution ==
[[File:World Map of Mains Voltages and Frequencies, Detailed.svg|thumb|upright=3|World map of mains voltage and frequencies]]
{{main|Low-voltage network}}
Electricity is delivered at a frequency of either 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, depending on the region. It is delivered to domestic customers as [[single-phase electric power]]. In some countries as in Europe a [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]] supply may be made available for larger properties. Seen with an [[oscilloscope]], the domestic power supply in North America would look like a [[sine wave]], oscillating between −170 volts and 170 volts, giving an effective voltage of 120 volts RMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/power2.htm|title=How Power Grids Work|website=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] power is more efficient in terms of power delivered per cable used, and is more suited to running large electric motors. Some large European appliances may be powered by  [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] power, such as electric stoves and clothes dryers.

A [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] connection is normally provided for the customer's system as well as for the equipment owned by the utility. The purpose of connecting the customer's system to ground is to limit the voltage that may develop if high voltage conductors fall down onto lower-voltage conductors which are usually mounted lower to the ground, or if a failure occurs within a distribution transformer. [[Earthing system]]s can be TT, TN-S, TN-C-S or TN-C.

=== Regional variations ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}

====220–240 volt systems====
Most of the world uses 50&amp;nbsp;Hz 220 or 230 V single phase, or  400V 3 phase for residential and light industrial services. In this system, the primary distribution network supplies a few substations per area, and the 230V / 400V  power from each substation is directly distributed to end users over a region of normally less than 1&amp;nbsp;km radius. Three live (hot) wires and the neutral are connected to the building for a three phase service. Single-phase distribution, with one live wire and the neutral is used domestically where total loads are light. In Europe, electricity is normally distributed for industry and domestic use by the three-phase, four wire system. This gives a phase-to-phase voltage of {{nowrap|400 volts}} [[Three-phase electric power#Three-wire and four-wire circuits|wye]] service and a single-phase voltage of {{nowrap|230 volts}} between any one phase and neutral.  In the UK a typical urban or suburban low-voltage substation would normally be rated between 150&amp;nbsp;kVA and 1&amp;nbsp;MVA and supply a whole neighbourhood of a few hundred houses. Transformers are typically sized on an average load of 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;kW per household, and the service fuses and cable is sized to allow any one property to draw a peak load of perhaps ten times this.
For industrial customers, 3-phase {{nowrap|690 / 400 volt}} is also available, or may be generated locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://www.en-powered.com/blog/the-bumpy-road-to-energy-deregulation | title = The Bumpy Road to Energy Deregulation  | publisher = EnPowered  | date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Large industrial customers have their own transformer(s) with an input from 11 kV to 220 kV.

==== 100–120 volt systems ====
Most of the Americas use 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC, the 120/240 volt [[split phase]] system domestically and three phase for larger installations. North American transformers usually power homes at 240 volts, similar to Europe's 230 volts. It is the split-phase that allows use of 120 volts in the home.

[[File:Power Grid of Japan.svg|thumb|Japan's utility frequencies are {{nowrap|50 Hz}} and {{nowrap|60 Hz}}.]]

In the [[electricity sector in Japan]], the standard voltage is 100V, with both 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC frequencies being used. Parts of the country use 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, while other parts use 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/07/19/reference/japans-incompatible-power-grids/|title=Japan’s incompatible power grids|last=Gordenker|first=Alice|date=2011-07-19|newspaper=The Japan Times Online|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a relic of the 1800s. Some local providers in [[Tokyo]] imported 50&amp;nbsp;Hz German equipment, while the local power providers in [[Osaka]] brought in 60&amp;nbsp;Hz generators from the United States. The grids grew until eventually the entire country was wired. Today the frequency is 50&amp;nbsp;Hz in Eastern Japan (including&amp;nbsp;Tokyo,&amp;nbsp;[[Yokohama]],&amp;nbsp;[[Tōhoku region|Tohoku]], and [[Hokkaido]]) and 60 Hertz in Western Japan (including&amp;nbsp;[[Nagoya]],&amp;nbsp;[[Osaka]],&amp;nbsp;[[Kyoto]],&amp;nbsp;[[Hiroshima]],&amp;nbsp;[[Shikokuchūō|Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2225.html|title=Electricity in Japan|website=Japan-Guide.com|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most household appliances are made to work on either frequency. The problem of incompatibility came into the public eye when the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] knocked out about a third of the east’s capacity, and power in the west couldn’t be fully shared with the east, since the country does not have a common frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are four [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) converter stations that move power across Japan’s AC frequency border. [[Shin Shinano]] is a [[Back-to-back connection#Power transmission|back-to-back]] HVDC facility in [[Japan]] which forms one of four [[frequency changer]] stations that link Japan's western and eastern power grids. The other three are at [[Higashi-Shimizu Frequency Converter|Higashi-Shimizu]], [[Minami-Fukumitsu]] and [[Sakuma Dam#HVDC frequency converter|Sakuma Dam]]. Together they can move up to 1.2 GW of power east or west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/why-japans-fragmented-grid-cant-cope|title=Why Japan's Fragmented Grid Can't Cope|website=Spectrum.IEEE.org|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 240 volt systems and 120 volt outlets ====
Most modern North American homes are wired to receive 240 volts from the transformer, and through the use of [[Split-phase electric power|split-phase electrical power]], can have both 120 volt receptacles and 240 volt receptacles. The 120 volts is typically used for lighting and most [[AC power plugs and sockets|wall outlets]]. The 240 volt outlets are usually located to service the oven and stovetop, water heater, and clothes dryer (if they are electric, rather than using natural gas). Sometimes a 240 volt outlet is mounted in the garage for machinery or for charging an [[electric car]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Empirical legal studies''' ('''ELS''') is an approach to the study of [[law]], [[legal procedure]], and [[legal theory]] through the use of [[empirical]] research. Empirical legal researchers use research techniques that are typical of [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]; however, ELS research tends to be more focused on purely legal questions than the related fields of [[law and economics]], [[legal psychology]], and [[sociology of law]].  ELS also tends to be more narrowly quantitative than fields such as [[Law and Society Association|law-and-society]] or [[new legal realism]] (NLR), which embrace [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] [[Social science|social science methods]], as well as [[Multimethodology|mixed method]] approaches.

The '''Faber–Jackson relation''' provided the first [[empirical]] [[power-law]] relation between the [[luminosity]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and the central [[star|stellar]] [[velocity dispersion]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of [[elliptical galaxy|early-type galaxies]], and was presented by the astronomers [[Sandra M. Faber]] and [[Robert Jackson (scientist)|Robert Earl Jackson]] in 1976.    Their relation can be expressed mathematically as:
:&lt;math&gt;
L \propto \sigma^ \gamma
&lt;/math&gt;
with the index &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; approximately equal to 4.  

In 1962, [[Rudolph Minkowski]] had discovered and wrote that a ``correlation between velocity dispersion and [luminosity] exists, but it is poor'' and that ``it seems important to extend the observations to more objects, especially at low and medium absolute magnitudes''.&lt;ref&gt;Minkowski, R. (1962), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962IAUS...15..112M Internal Dispersion of Velocities in Other Galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was important because the value of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; depends on the range of galaxy luminosities that is fitted, with a value of 2 for low-luminosity elliptical galaxies discovered by a team&lt;ref&gt;Davies, R. L.; Efstathiou, G.; Fall, S. M.; Illingworth, G.; Schechter, P. L. (1983), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...266...41D The kinematic properties of faint elliptical galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Roger Davies (astrophysicist)|Roger Davies]], and a value of 5 reported by [[Paul L. Schechter]] for luminous elliptical galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Schechter (1980), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980AJ.....85..801S Mass-to-light ratios for elliptical galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;   

The Faber–Jackson relation is understood as a projection of the [[fundamental plane (elliptical galaxies)|Fundamental Plane]] of elliptical galaxies.  One of its main uses is as a tool for determining distances to external galaxies.

== Theory ==

The [[Gravitational binding energy|gravitational potential]] of a mass distribution of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
U=-\alpha \frac{GM^2}{R}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where α is a constant depending e.g. on the density profile of the system and G is the [[gravitational constant]]. For a constant density, &lt;math&gt;\alpha\ = \frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

The kinetic energy is (recall &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the 1-dimensional velocity dispersion. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;3\sigma^2 = V^2&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;
K = \frac{1}{2}MV^2
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
K = \frac{3}{2}M \sigma^2
&lt;/math&gt;

From the [[virial theorem]] (&lt;math&gt;2 K + U = 0&lt;/math&gt; ) it follows

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma^2 =\frac{1}{5}\frac{GM}{R}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If we assume that the mass to light ratio, &lt;math&gt;M/L&lt;/math&gt;, is constant, e.g. &lt;math&gt;M \propto L&lt;/math&gt; we can use this and the above expression to obtain a relation between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
R \propto\frac{LG}{\sigma^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Let us introduce the  surface brightness, &lt;math&gt;B = L/(4 \pi R^2)&lt;/math&gt; and assume this is a constant 
(which from a fundamental theoretical point of view, is a totally unjustified assumption) to get

:&lt;math&gt;
L=4\pi R^2 B.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using this and combining it with the relation between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, this results in

:&lt;math&gt;
L \propto 4\pi\left(\frac{LG}{\sigma^2}\right)^2B
&lt;/math&gt;

and by rewriting the above expression, we finally obtain the relation between luminosity and velocity dispersion:

:&lt;math&gt;
L \propto\frac{\sigma^4}{4\pi G^2 B},
&lt;/math&gt;

that is

:&lt;math&gt;
L \propto \sigma^4.
&lt;/math&gt;

When account is taken of the fact that massive galaxies originate from homologous merging, and the fainter ones from dissipation, the assumption of constant surface brightness can no longer be supported.  Empirically, surface brightness exhibits a peak at about  &lt;math&gt;M_V=-23&lt;/math&gt;.  The revised relation then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
L \propto \sigma^{3.1}
&lt;/math&gt;

for the less massive galaxies, and

:&lt;math&gt;
L \propto \sigma^{15.0} 
&lt;/math&gt;

for the more massive ones.  With these revised formulae, the fundamental plane splits into two planes inclined by about 11 degrees to each other.

Even first-ranked cluster galaxies do not have constant surface brightness.  A claim supporting constant surface brightness was presented by astronomer [[Allan R. Sandage]] in 1972 based on three logical arguments and his own empirical data.  In 1975, [[Donald Gudehus]] showed that each of the logical arguments was incorrect and that first-ranked cluster galaxies exhibited a standard deviation of about half a magnitude.

==Estimating distances to galaxies==
Like the Tully–Fisher relation, the Faber–Jackson relation provides a means of estimating the distance to a galaxy, which is otherwise hard to obtain, by relating it to more easily observable properties of the galaxy.  In the case of elliptical galaxies, if one can measure the central stellar velocity dispersion, which can be done relatively easily by using [[spectroscopy]] to measure the [[Doppler shift]] of light emitted by the stars, then one can obtain an estimate of the true luminosity of the galaxy via the Faber–Jackson relation.  This can be compared to the [[apparent magnitude]] of the galaxy, which provides an estimate of the [[distance modulus]] and, hence, the distance to the galaxy.

By combining a galaxy's central velocity dispersion with measurements of its central surface brightness and radius parameter, it is possible to improve the estimate of the galaxy's distance even more. This standard yardstick, or "reduced galaxian radius-parameter", &lt;math&gt;r_g&lt;/math&gt;, devised by Gudehus in 1991, can yield distances, free of systematic bias, accurate to about 31%.

The '''first-order reliability method''', ('''FORM'''), is a semi-[[probabilistic]] [[reliability engineering|reliability analysis]] method devised to evaluate the reliability of a system.

The accuracy of the method can be improved by averaging over many samples, which is known as [[Line Sampling]].

'''Gender-biased diagnosing''' is a controversial&lt;ref&gt;Authors V. Mark Durand, M.V. &amp; Barlow, D.H. (2009) ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7BZTtO5rh8C&amp;lpg=PA436&amp;dq=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;pg=PA436#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;f=false p.436.] Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-495-59982-4}}. Retrieved November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology|sociological]] observation which asserts that [[medical diagnosis|medical]] and psychological diagnosis may be influenced by the [[gender]] of the patient. Several studies have found evidence of [[differential diagnosis]] for patients with similar ailments but of different sexes.

== Medical diagnosis ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
The phenomenon may affect physical diagnosis. Women are more likely to be given a diagnosis of [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] nature for a [[physical ailment]] than men, despite presenting with similar symptoms. Women sometimes have trouble being taken seriously by physicians when suffering from medically unexplained [[illness]], and report difficulty receiving appropriate medical care for their illnesses because doctors repeatedly diagnose their physical complaints as related to [[Mental illness|psychiatric problems]].
Clinical offices that rely on healthcare routines become less distinct due to biased medical knowledge of gender.  There is a distinct differentiation between gender and sex in the medical sense. Gender is the societal construction of what femininity and masculinity is, whereas, sex is the biological aspect that defines the dichotomy of female and male. The way of lifestyle and the place in society are often considered when diagnosing patients.&lt;ref&gt;Hamberg, K. (2008). Gender bias in medicine. Women's Health (London, England), 4(3), 237-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional medical studies, most of these medical studies were done on men thus overlooking many issues that were related to women's health. This topic alone sparked controversy and brought about question to the medical standard of our time. Research that was done on diseases that affected women more were less funded than those diseases that affected men and women equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Trechak A | year = 1999 | title = On cultural and gender bias in medical diagnosis | url = | journal = Multicultural Education | volume = 7 | issue = 2| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an example of gender bias in the psychiatric field as well, Hamburg notes that, "psychiatrists would diagnose women with depression and then, eventually psychiatrists would begin to assume that women were more depressed than men due to the fact that the patients that were examined by the psychiatrists were women and they had similar symptoms. As for the men, they were diagnosed with drug or alcohol problems and they were thrown out of the study."&lt;ref&gt;Hamberg, Katarina. "Gender Bias in Medicine." Women's Health (London, England), 4.3 (2008): 237-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the Women's Health Equity Act that was passed in 1993, this Act gave women the chance to participate in medical studies and examine the gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1993. Congressional Record Daily Edition. n.p.: 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Women's Health Equity Act was introduced there was no research done on infertility, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer which were essential to women's health.&lt;ref&gt;THE WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1991. Congressional Record Daily Edition. n.p.: 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological diagnosis ==
There is a suggestion that assumptions regarding gender specific behavioural characteristics can lead to a diagnostic system which is biased.&lt;ref&gt;Maddux, J.E. &amp; Winstead, B.A. (2005) ''Psychopathology: foundations for a contemporary understanding'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2SJpF8ucrKgC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;f=false p.77.] Routledge. {{ISBN|0-8058-4077-X}} Retrieved November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of gender bias with regard to ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) [[personality disorder]] criteria has been controversial and widely debated. The fourth DSM (4th ed., text revision; DSM–IV–TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) makes no explicit statement regarding gender bias among the ten personality disorders (PDs), but it does state that six PDs (antisocial, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid) are more frequently found in men. Three others (borderline, histrionic, dependent) are more frequent in women. Avoidant is equally common in men and women.

There are many ways to interpret differential prevalence rates as a function of gender. Some critics have argued that they are an artifact of gender bias. In other words, the PD criteria assume unfairly that stereotypical female characteristics are pathological. The results of this study conclude with no indication of gender-biased criteria in the [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], and [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]] PDs. This is in contrast with what is predicted by critics of these disorders, who suggest they are biased against women. It is possible, however, that other sources of bias, including assessment and clinical bias,  are still at work in relation to these disorders. The results do show that the group means are higher in women than in men, an expected result considering the higher prevalence rate of these disorders for women.&lt;ref&gt;Jane, J. S., Oltmanns, T. F., South, S. C., &amp; Turkheimer, E. (2007) "Gender bias in diagnostic criteria for personality disorders: An item response theory analysis" Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 116(1), 166-175&lt;/ref&gt;

The original purpose of the DSM–IV was to provide an accurate classification of [[psychopathology]], not to develop a diagnostic system that will, democratically, diagnose as many men with a personality disorder as women". However, if the criteria are to serve equally as indicators of disorder for both men and women, it will be important to establish that the implications of these criteria for functional impairment are comparable for both sexes. Whereas it is plausible that there are gender-specific expressions of these disorders, DSM–IV criteria that function differentially for men and women can systematically over-pathologize or under-represent mental illness in a particular gender. The present study is limited by the investigation of only four personality disorders and the lack of inclusion of additional diagnoses that have also been controversial in the gender bias debate (such as dependent and histrionic personality disorders), although it offers a clearly articulated methodology for studying this possibility. In addition, it provides an examination of a clinical sample of substantial size and uses functional assessments that cut across multiple functional domains and multiple assessment methods. Our results indicate that BPD criteria showed some evidence of differential functioning between genders on global functioning, although there is little evidence of sex bias within the diagnostic criteria for [[avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]], or [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]]s. Further investigation and validation across sexes for those disorders would be an important direction of future research.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, C. D., Morey, L. C., Skodol, A. E., Shea, M. T., Sanislow, C. A., Grilo, C. M., et al. (2009) "Differential impairment as an indicator of sex bias in DSM-IV criteria for four personality disorders" Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment, S(1), 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable evidence indicates a prominent role for [[psychological trauma|trauma]]-related cognitions in the development and maintenance of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) symptoms. The present study utilized [[regression analysis]] to examine the unique relationships between various trauma-related cognitions and PTSD symptoms after controlling for gender and measures of general affective distress in a large sample of trauma-exposed college students. In terms of trauma-related cognitions, only negative cognitions about the self were related to PTSD symptom severity. Gender and anxiety symptoms were also related to PTSD symptom severity. Theoretical implications of the results are consistent with previous studies on the relationship between PTSD and negative cognitions, the self, world, and blame subscales of the PTCI were significantly related to PTSD symptoms. The study correlations indicated that increased negative trauma-related cognitions were related to more severe PTSD symptoms. Also consistent with previous reports, correlations also indicated that gender was related to PTSD symptom severity, such that women had more severe PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptom severity was also positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moser J. S. |author2=Hajcak G. |author3=Simons R. F. |author4=Foa E. B. | year = 2007 | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in trauma-exposed college students: The role of trauma-related cognitions, gender, and negative affect | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618507000072 | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 1039–1049 | doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2006.10.009|pmc=2169512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often challenging, especially when the client has experienced a trauma such as [[childhood sexual abuse]] (CSA), which is strongly linked to both disorders. Although the individual diagnostic criteria for these two disorders do not overlap substantially, patients with either of these disorders can display similar clinical pictures. Both patients with BPD and PTSD may present as aggressive toward self or others, irritable, unable to tolerate emotional extremes, dysphoric, feeling empty or dead, and highly reactive to mild stressors. Despite having similar clinical pictures, PTSD and BPD are regarded differently by many clinicians. Results from a 2009 study concluded that patient gender does not affect diagnosis. This finding is consistent with research suggesting that women are not more likely to be given the BPD diagnosis, all else being equal, though it contradicts other findings from studies that have used similar case vignettes. Nor did the data support an effect of clinician gender or age on diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, H. E., Taft, C. T., Gordon, R. A., &amp; Meis, L. A. (2009) "Clinician bias in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder"  Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 1(4), 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study examined gender-specific associations between trauma cognitions, alcohol cravings and alcohol-related consequences in individuals with dually diagnosed PTSD and [[alcohol dependence]] (AD). Participants had entered a treatment study for concurrent PTSD and AD; baseline information was collected from participants about PTSD-related cognitions in three areas: (a) Negative Cognitions About Self, (b) Negative Cognitions About the World, and (c) Self-Blame. Information was also collected on two aspects of AD: alcohol cravings and consequences of AD. Gender differences were examined while controlling for PTSD severity. The results indicate that Negative Cognitions About Self are significantly related to alcohol cravings in men but not women, and that interpersonal consequences of AD are significantly related to Self-Blame in women but not in men. These findings suggest that for individuals with comorbid PTSD and AD, psychotherapeutic interventions that focus on reducing trauma-related cognitions are likely to reduce alcohol cravings in men and relational problems in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jayawickreme N. |author2=Yasinski C. |author3=Williams M. |author4=Foa E.

'''Ghost nets''' are [[fishing net]]s that have been [[marine debris|left or lost in the ocean]] by fishermen. These nets, often nearly invisible in the dim light, can be left tangled on a rocky reef or drifting in the open sea. They can [[Plastic_pollution#Entanglement|entangle]] [[fish]], [[dolphin]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[shark]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[seabird]]s, [[crab]]s, and other creatures, including the occasional human diver.&lt;ref&gt;Esteban, Michelle (2002) [http://www.eurocbc.org/page54.html ''Tracking Down Ghost Nets'']&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as designed, the nets restrict movement, causing starvation, laceration and infection, and suffocation in those that need to return to the surface to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6248366.stm |title='Ghost fishing' killing seabirds |accessdate=2008-04-01 |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Marine organisms entangled in a ghost net within the Maldives (Olive Ridley Project).jpg|thumb|300px|Many marine species including [[turtles]], [[sharks]], [[whales]], [[dolphins]], [[dugong]]s become entangled in ghost nets. Most go unnoticed and unrecorded.]]
[[File:Starbuck AKK FishnetFloat.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[glass float]] on the beach. Many of these floats for fish nets wash up on island beaches around the Pacific. The loss of the floats can leave fish nets drifting in the open ocean where they continue to entangle fish, birds, and marine mammals.]]

Some commercial fisherman use [[gillnet]]s. These are suspended in the sea by flotation [[buoy]]s, such as [[glass float]]s, along one edge. In this way they can form a vertical wall hundreds of metres long, where any fish within a certain size range can be caught. Normally these nets are collected by fishermen and the catch removed. 

If this is not done, the net can continue to catch fish until the weight of the catch exceeds the buoyancy of the floats. The net then sinks, and the fish are devoured by bottom-dwelling crustaceans and other fish. Then the floats pull the net up again and the cycle continues. Given the high-quality synthetics that are used today, the destruction can continue for a long time.

The problem is not just nets but '''ghost gear''' in general;&lt;ref name=guard1&gt;Hannah Gould, [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/sep/10/fishing-industry-vows-to-tackle-wildlife-deaths-from-ghost-gear Hidden problem of 'ghost gear': the abandoned fishing nets clogging up oceans], ''Theguardian.com'', 10 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; old-fashioned [[crab trap]]s, without the required "rot-out panel", also sit on the bottom, where they become self-baiting traps that go on catching crabs year after year. Even balled-up [[fishing line]] can be deadly for a variety of creatures, including birds and marine mammals. Over time the nets become more and more tangled. In general, fish are less likely to be trapped in gear that has been down a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Dunagan, Christopher (2000)[[The Sun (Lowell)|''The Sun'']]. [http://web.kitsapsun.com/news/2000/may/0504pugetsoundwa.html The net effect: trouble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404001020/http://web.kitsapsun.com/news/2000/may/0504pugetsoundwa.html |date=2009-04-04 }}, 5 April&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishermen sometimes abandon worn-out nets because it is often the easiest way to get rid of them.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

The French government offered a reward for ghost nets handed in to local coastguards along sections of the Normandy coast between 1980 and 1981. The project was abandoned when people vandalized nets to claim rewards, without retrieving anything at all from the shoreline or ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Von Brandt (1984) ''Fish catching methods of the world'' {{ISBN|978-0-685-63409-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI) was created by the [[World Animal Protection]] to give a unique and stronger voice to the cause.

The term ALDFG means "abandoned or lost or discarded fishing gear".

==Environmental impact==
From 2000 to 2012, the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] reported an average of 11 large [[whales]] entangled in ghost nets every year along the US west coast. From 2002 to 2010, 870 nets were recovered in [[Washington (state)]] with over 32,000 marine animals trapped inside. Ghost gear is estimated to account for 10% of all [[marine litter]].&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

According to the SeaDoc Society, each ghost net kills $20,000 worth of [[Dungeness crab]] over 10 years. The [[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]] calculated that ghost crab pots capture 1.25 million [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]]s each year in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] alone.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

In May 2016, the [[Australian Fisheries Management Authority]] (AFMA) recovered 10 tonnes of abandoned nets within the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone and [[Torres Strait]] protected zone perimeters. One protected turtle was rescued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afma.gov.au/ghost-net-busters/ Ghost net busters], ''Afma.gov.au'', 3 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Unlike synthetic fishing nets, [[biodegradable]] fishing nets decompose naturally under water after a certain period of time. Coconut fibre ([[coir]]) fishing nets are commercially made and are hence a practical solution that can be taken by fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2016-02-biodegradable-fishing-nets-marine-animals.html Biodegradable fishing nets: advantages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/economic/futurefibres/fibres/coir/en/ Coir fishing nets]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company Net-works worked out a solution to turn discarded fishing nets into carpet tiles.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Beavis,[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/30/net-works-is-net-gain-for-poor-coastal-community Net-Works is net gain for poor coastal community], ''Theguardian.com'', 30 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the US Fishing for Energy initiative collected 2.8 million pounds of fishing gear, and in partnership with [[Covanta Energy]] turned this into enough electricity to power 182 homes for one year by incineration.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NOAA, [https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/prevention/fishing-energy Fishing for Energy]. Accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan to protect UK seas from ghost fishing was backed by the [http://conservativeeurope.com/news/meps-back-plan-to-end-ghost-fishing European Parliament] Fisheries Committee in 2018. Mr Flack, who led the committee, said: "Abandoned fishing nets are polluting our seas, wasting fishing stocks and indiscriminately killing whales, sea lions or even dolphins. The tragedy of ghost fishing must end.&lt;ref&gt;MEPs back plan to end ‘ghost fishing', [http://conservativeeurope.com/news/meps-back-plan-to-end-ghost-fishing]. 20 June, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human nutrition''' deals with the provision of [[essential nutrient]]s in food that are necessary to support human [[life]] and [[health]]. Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty, [[food security]] or a poor understanding of nutrition and dietary practices.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children"&gt;Progress for Children: A Report Card on Nutrition (No. 4), UNICEF, May 2006, {{ISBN|978-92-806-3988-9}}. http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_33685.html&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition and its consequences are large contributors to deaths and [[Disability|disabilities]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions"&gt;World Health Organization.

== Overview ==
The human body contains chemical compounds, such as water, carbohydrates, [[amino acids]] (in [[proteins]]), [[fatty acids]] (in [[lipids]]), and [[nucleic acids]] ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]). These compounds are composed of [[chemical element|elements]] such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus. Any study done to determine nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments, as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all the materials [[excreted]] and eliminated from the body (including [[urine]] and feces). Comparing food to waste material can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized by the body.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period of time, during which all food and waste must be analyzed. The number of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] involved in such [[experiment]]s is high, making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive, which explains why the science of human nutrition is still slowly evolving.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Nutrients==
{{Main article|Nutrient}}

The seven major classes of nutrients are [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, [[dietary fiber|fiber]], [[dietary minerals|minerals]], [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]]. These nutrient classes are categorized as either [[macronutrients]] or [[micronutrients]] (needed in small quantities). The macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, proteins, and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.medicinejournal.co.uk/|title = Principles of Human Nutrition|last = Lean|first = Michael E.J.|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |access-date = March 31, 2015|issue = 2|pages = 61–65|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins.&lt;ref name=WHO2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=World Health Organization, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|title=Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition|date=2004|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva [u.a.]|isbn=978-9241546126|edition=2.|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/9241546123/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built), and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can also be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in [[Joule]]s or [[calorie|kilocalories]] (often called "Calories" and written with a capital 'C' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17&amp;nbsp;kJ approximately (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal) per gram,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7167-4684-3 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance.

Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class of dietary material, fiber (i.e., nondigestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear. For all age groups, males need to consume higher amounts of macronutrients than females. In general, intakes increase with age until the second or third decade of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/95E87FE64B144FA3CA2568A9001393C0|title = National Nutrition Survey: Nutrient Intakes and Physical Measurements|date = 1995|accessdate = |website = Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharides]] (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex [[polysaccharides]] (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomers]] bound to a [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Nelson2005&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nelson DL, Cox MM |year=2005 |title=Lehninger's Principles of Biochemistry |edition=4th |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental  components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acids]], some of which are [[essential amino acids|essential]] in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs naturally when [[atrophy]] takes place, or during periods of starvation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Carbohydrates===
{{Main article|Carbohydrate}}

[[Image:Wheat products.jpg|thumb|upright|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of complex and simple carbohydrates]]

Carbohydrates may be classified as [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They are a diverse group of substances, with a range of chemical, physical and physiological properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/ejcn/journal/v61/n1s/pdf/1602936a.pdf|title = Carbohydrate terminology and classification|date = 2007|journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|doi = 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602936|pmid = 17992187|access-date = |volume=61 |pages=S5–S18|last1 = Cummings|first1 = J H|last2 = Stephen|first2 = A M}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make up a large part of foods such as [[rice]], [[noodles]], [[bread]], and other [[grain]]-based products,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carb-counter.net/breads/2320|title=Grams of Carbohydrates in White Bread - Carb Counter|website=www.carb-counter.net|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amrice.com/6-4.cfm|title=American Rice, Inc.|website=www.amrice.com|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not an essential nutrient, meaning a human does not need to eat carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westman|first=EC|date=May 2002|title=Is dietary carbohydrate essential for human nutrition?|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=75|issue=5|pages=951–3|pmid=11976176|doi=10.1093/ajcn/75.5.951a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. Monosaccharides  include [[glucose]], [[fructose]] and [[galactose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/carbohydrates-contain-monosaccharides-1181.html|title = Carbohydrates That Contain Monosaccharides|date = |accessdate = |website = Healthy eating|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disaccharides include [[sucrose]], [[lactose]], and [[maltose]]; purified [[sucrose]], for instance, is used as table sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303914003338#|title = Principles of human nutrition|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |access-date =|volume=43|issue = 2|pages=61–65|last1 = Lean|first1 = Michael E.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polysaccharides, which include [[starch]] and [[glycogen]], are often referred to as 'complex' carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple-branched chains of sugar units. The difference is that complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and absorb since their sugar units must be separated from the chain before absorption. The spike in [[blood glucose]] levels after ingestion of simple sugars is thought to be related to some of the heart and vascular diseases, which have become more common in recent times. Simple sugars form a greater part of modern diets than in the past, perhaps leading to more cardiovascular disease. The degree of causation is still not clear.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Simple carbohydrates are absorbed quickly, and therefore raise blood-sugar levels more rapidly than other nutrients. However, the most important plant carbohydrate nutrient, starch, varies in its absorption. Gelatinized starch (starch heated for a few minutes in the presence of water) is far more digestible than plain starch, and starch which has been divided into fine particles is also more absorbable during digestion. The increased effort and decreased availability reduces the available energy from starchy foods substantially and can be seen experimentally in rats and anecdotally in humans. Additionally, up to a third of dietary starch may be unavailable due to mechanical or chemical difficulty.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Fat===
{{Main article|Fat|Nutrition#Fat}}

A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several [[fatty acid]]s (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a [[glycerol]]. They are typically found as [[triglyceride]]s (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as [[saturated fat|saturated]] or [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] depending on the chemical structure of the fatty acids involved.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}  Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms [[Double bond|double-bonded]], so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as [[omega-3]] or [[omega-6]] fatty acids. [[Trans fats]] are a type of unsaturated fat with ''trans''-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) [[hydrogenation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Many studies have shown that consumption of unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated fats, is associated with better health in humans. Saturated fats, typically from animal sources, are next in order of preference, while trans fats are associated with a variety of disease and should be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as [[butter]] or [[lard]]), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as [[olive oil]] or [[flaxseed oil]]). Trans fats are very rare in nature, but have properties useful in the [[food processing]] industry, such as rancidity resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Most fatty acids are not essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids – [[omega-3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids – seems also important for health, though definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain [[unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for a class of [[eicosanoids]] known as [[prostaglandins]], which have roles throughout the human body. They are [[hormone]]s, in some respects. The omega-3 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (LNA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g. weakly [[inflammation|inflammatory]] PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g., pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]] (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins: one reason a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Fiber===
{{Main article|Dietary fiber}}

Dietary fiber is a [[carbohydrate]], specifically a polysaccharide, which is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized, it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram, but in most circumstances, it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. The two subcategories are insoluble and soluble fiber. Insoluble dietary fiber consists mainly of [[cellulose]], a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans, because humans do not have the required enzymes to break it down, and the human digestive system does not harbor enough of the types of microbes that can do so.  Soluble dietary fiber comprises a variety of [[oligosaccharides]], [[waxes]], [[esters]], resistant starches, and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water. Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are absorbed and therefore introduce some caloric content.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Whole grains, beans and other [[legumes]], fruits (especially [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, and [[ficus|figs]]), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. Fiber is important to digestive health and is thought to reduce the risk of colon cancer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} For mechanical  reasons, fiber can help in alleviating both [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]]. Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents, and insoluble fiber especially stimulates [[peristalsis]] – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract. Some soluble fibers produce a solution of high [[viscosity]]; this is essentially a gel, which slows the movement of food through the intestines. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, may help lessen insulin spikes and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Protein===
{{Main article|Protein (nutrient)}}

Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair) and form the [[enzyme]]s which catalyse chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of [[amino acids]] which contain nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance).  Amino acids are soluble in the digestive juices within the small intestine, where they are absorbed into the blood. Once absorbed, they cannot be stored in the body, so they are either metabolized as required or excreted in the urine.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Proteins consist of amino acids in different proportions. The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its [[amino acid]] composition.&lt;ref name="DRI"&gt;Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements, published by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board, currently available online at {{cite web|url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705140516/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |archivedate=2014-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amino acids which an animal cannot synthesize on its own from smaller molecules are deemed essential.

===Minerals===
{{Main article|Mineral (nutrient)}}

Dietary minerals are the [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned – including several [[metals]], which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as [[calcium carbonate]] from ground [[oyster]] shells). Some are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most well-known is likely iodine in [[iodized salt]] which prevents [[goiter]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Essential dietary minerals====
include the following:{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Chlorine]] as [[chloride]] ions; very common electrolyte; see sodium, below.
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity). Approximately 50% is in bone, the remaining 50% is almost all inside body cells, with only about 1% located in extracellular fluid. Food sources include oats, buckwheat, tofu, nuts, caviar, green leafy vegetables, legumes, and chocolate.&lt;ref name="mahan"&gt;{{cite book | title= Krausw's Food and the Nutrition Care Process |edition=13th  |publisher=Elsevier |location=St. Louis | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4377-2233-8 |author1=L. Kathleen Mahan |author2=Janice L. Raymond |author3=Sylvia Escott-Stump }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USDA DB"&gt;[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, SR26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=D. E. C. Corbridge | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-444-89307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 80% is found in inorganic portion of bones and teeth. Phosphorus is a component of every cell, as well as important metabolites, including DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids. Also important in pH regulation. Food sources include cheese, egg yolk, milk, meat, fish, poultry, whole-grain cereals, and many others.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;
* [[Potassium]], a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health). With sodium, potassium is involved in maintaining normal water balance, osmotic equilibrium, and acid-base balance. In addition to calcium, it is important in the regulation of neuromuscular activity. Food sources include bananas, avocados, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, fish, and mushrooms.&lt;ref name="USDA DB" /&gt;
* [[Sodium]], a very common electrolyte; not generally found in dietary supplements, despite being needed in large quantities, because the ion is very common in food: typically as [[sodium chloride]], or common salt.

====Trace minerals====
Many elements are required in smaller amounts (microgram quantities), usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-935702-73-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trace mineral elements (RDA &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Cobalt]] as a component of the [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] family of [[coenzyme]]s
* [[Copper]] required component of many redox enzymes, including [[cytochrome c oxidase]]
* [[Chromium]] required for sugar metabolism
* [[Iodine]] required not only for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxin]], but probably, for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus etc. (see [[Iodine deficiency]]); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kapil|first=Umesh|date=2016-11-22|title=Health Consequences of Iodine Deficiency|journal=Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal|volume=7|issue=3|pages=267–272|issn=2075-051X|pmc=3074887|pmid=21748117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in iodized salt
* [[Iron]] required for many enzymes,  and for [[hemoglobin]] and some other proteins
* [[Manganese]] (processing of oxygen)
* [[Molybdenum]] required for [[xanthine oxidase]] and related oxidases
* [[Selenium]] required for [[peroxidase]] (antioxidant proteins)
* [[Zinc]] required for several enzymes such as [[carboxypeptidase]], [[Alcohol dehydrogenase#In humans|liver alcohol dehydrogenase]], [[carbonic anhydrase]]

===Vitamins===
{{Main article|Vitamin}}

As with the minerals discussed above, some vitamins are recognized as essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. ([[Vitamin D]] is the exception: it can alternatively be synthesized in the skin, in the presence of [[UVB radiation]].) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet, such as [[carnitine]], are thought useful for survival and health, but these are not "essential" dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds. Moreover, thousands of different [[phytochemicals]] have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including [[antioxidant]] activity (see below); experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive. Other essential nutrients not classed as vitamins include [[essential amino acid]]s (see [[#Protein|above]]), [[essential fatty acid]]s (see [[#Essential fatty acids|above]]), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions: [[goiter]], [[scurvy]], [[osteoporosis]], impaired [[immune system]], disorders of cell [[metabolism]], certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature [[aging]], and poor [[psychology|psychological health]] (including [[eating disorders]]), among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2005 | title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | isbn=978-0-7817-4133-0| author=Shils | displayauthors=etal   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malnutrition==
{{Main article|Malnutrition}}

Malnutrition refers to insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced consumption of nutrients. In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption.
Although there are more people in the world who are malnourished due to excessive consumption, according to the United Nations [[World Health Organization]], the greatest challenge in developing nations today is not starvation, but insufficient nutrition – the lack of nutrients necessary for the growth and maintenance of vital functions. The causes of malnutrition are directly linked to inadequate macronutrient consumption and disease, and are indirectly linked to factors like “household food security, maternal and child care, health services, and the environment.” &lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt;

===Mental disorders===

Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], the four most common mental disorders in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lakhan SE, Vieira KF |title= Nutritional therapies for mental disorders |journal= Nutr J |volume=7 |page=2 |year=2008 |pmid=18208598 |pmc= 2248201 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-7-2 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/7/1/2 |issue=1|last2= Vieira }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because Lakhan and Vieira mentioned that the supplements possess amino acids that may change into neurotransmitters and improve mental disorders. Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (each of which are an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] contained in [[fish oil]], but not in [[flaxseed oil]]), [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[folic acid]], and [[inositol]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Cancer===

Cancer has become common in developing countries. According to a study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], "In the developing world, cancers of the liver, stomach and esophagus were more common, often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods, such as smoked or salted food, and parasitic infections that attack organs." Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco. Developed countries "tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle' – cancers of the colon, rectum, breast and prostate – that can be caused by obesity, lack of exercise, diet and age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Coren| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/03/09/cancer.study/index.html | title=Study: Cancer no longer rare in poorer countries | publisher= CNN | date=2005-03-10 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive worldwide report, "[[Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective]]", compiled by the [[World Cancer Research Fund]] and the [[American Institute for Cancer Research]], reports that there is a significant relation between lifestyle (including food consumption) and [[cancer prevention]]. The same report recommends eating mostly foods of plant origin and aiming to meet [[nutritional needs]] through diet alone, while limiting consumption of [[energy]]-dense foods, [[red meat]], [[alcoholic drink]]s and [[salt]] and avoiding [[sugary drink]]s, [[processed meat]] and moldy [[cereals]] (grains) or [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] (legumes). Protein consumption leads to an increase in [[IGF-1]], which plays a role in cancer development.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Metabolic syndrome and obesity===

Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyle-induced [[hyperinsulinemia]] and reduced insulin function (i.e. [[insulin resistance]]) as decisive factors in many disease states. For example, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation, which in turn is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microinjuries and [[clot]] formation (i.e. heart disease) and exaggerated cell division (i.e. cancer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fernández-García JC |title=Inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome: dietary modulation |url= |journal=Curr Vasc Pharmacol |year=2013 |volume= 11|issue=October |pages=1570–1611 |doi= |pmc= |pmid=24168441  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (the so-called [[metabolic syndrome]]) are characterized by a combination of abdominal [[obesity]], elevated [[blood sugar]], elevated [[blood pressure]], elevated blood [[triglycerides]], and reduced HDL [[cholesterol]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone [[leptin]], and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/[[leptin]] resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, as a result of high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the [[hypothalamus]] in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors – such as intake of processed carbohydrates, total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, and low intake of vitamins/minerals – contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance. Evidence indicates that diets possibly protective against metabolic syndrome include low saturated and [[trans fat]] intake and foods rich in [[dietary fiber]], such as high consumption of fruits and vegetables and moderate intake of low-fat dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Feldeisen SE, Tucker KL |year= 2007|title=Nutritional strategies in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome |url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/h06-101?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&amp;#.UnaZ2FPDIwA |journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism|volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=46–60 |doi=10.1139/h06-101 |pmc= |pmid=17332784 |accessdate=November 3, 2013|last2= Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global nutrition challenges==
The challenges facing global nutrition are disease, child malnutrition, obesity, and vitamin deficiency.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Disease===
The most common non-infectious diseases worldwide, that contribute most to the global mortality rate, are cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory problems, all of which are linked to poor nutrition. Nutrition and diet are closely associated with the leading causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Obesity and high sodium intake can contribute to ischemic heart disease, while consumption of fruits and vegetables can decrease the risk of developing cancer.&lt;ref name=" GNP " /&gt;

Foodborne and infectious diseases can result in malnutrition, and malnutrition exacerbates infectious disease. Poor nutrition leaves children and adults more susceptible to contracting life-threatening diseases such as diarrheal infections and respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to the WHO, in 2011, 6.9 million children died of infectious diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and neonatal conditions, of which at least one third were associated with undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNICEF 2012 Progress Report: Rapid progress in child survival|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/20120913_unicef_childsurvivalreport/en/|accessdate=28 May 2016|publisher=World Health Organization|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENA4"&gt;WHO.

Childhood [[malnutrition]] is common and contributes to the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murray C, Lopez A | title = Global mortality, disability, and the contribution of risk factors: Global Burden of Disease Study | journal = Lancet | volume = 349 | issue = 9063 | pages = 1436–42 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9164317 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)07495-8| last2 = Lopez }}&lt;/ref&gt; Childhood is a particularly important time to achieve good nutrition status, because poor nutrition has the capability to lock a child in a vicious cycle of disease susceptibility and recurring sickness, which threatens cognitive and social development.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Undernutrition and bias in access to food and health services leaves children less likely to attend or perform well in school.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Undernutrition===
{{Main article|Undernutrition}}
UNICEF defines undernutrition “as the outcome of insufficient food intake (hunger) and repeated infectious diseases. Under nutrition includes being underweight for one’s age, too short for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin (wasted), and deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrient).&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Under nutrition causes 53% of deaths of children under five across the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; It has been estimated that undernutrition is the underlying cause for 35% of child deaths.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black RE | year = 2008 | title = Maternal and child undernutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9608| pages = 243–260 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61690-0| pmid = 18207566 | author2 = and others | displayauthors = 1 | last3 = Bhutta | last4 = Caulfield | last5 = De Onis | last6 = Ezzati | last7 = Mathers | last8 = Rivera }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maternal and Child Nutrition Study Group estimate that under nutrition, “including fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting, deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding- is a cause of 3.1 million child deaths and infant mortality, or 45% of all child deaths in 2011”.&lt;ref name="Maternal undernutrition" /&gt;

When humans are undernourished, they no longer maintain normal bodily functions, such as growth, resistance to infection, or have satisfactory performance in school or work.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Major causes of under nutrition in young children include lack of proper breast feeding for infants and illnesses such as diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to UNICEF 146 million children across the globe, that one out of four under the age of five, are underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The amount of underweight children has decreased since 1990, from 33 percent to 28 percent between 1990 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Underweight and stunted children are more susceptible to infection, more likely to fall behind in school, more likely to become overweight and develop non-infectious diseases, and ultimately earn less than their non-stunted coworkers.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION"&gt;IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION &gt; UNICEF. (April 2013). IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION: The achievable imperative for global progress. http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_68661.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, undernutrition can accumulate deficiencies in health which results in less productive individuals and societies &lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Many children are born with the inherent disadvantage of low birth weight, often caused by intrauterine growth restriction and poor maternal nutrition, which results in worse growth, development, and health throughout the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref name="GNP" /&gt; Children born at low birthweight (less than 5.5 pounds or 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg), are less likely to be healthy and are more susceptible to disease and early death.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Those born at low birthweight also are likely to have a depressed immune system, which can increase their chances of heart disease and diabetes later on in life.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Because 96% of low birthweight occurs in the developing world, low birthweight is associated with being born to a mother in poverty with poor nutritional status that has had to perform demanding labor.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Stunting and other forms of undernutrition reduces a child’s chance of survival and hinders their optimal growth and health.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Stunting has demonstrated association with poor brain development, which reduces cognitive ability, academic performance, and eventually earning potential.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt;  Important determinants of stunting include the quality and frequency of infant and child feeding, infectious disease susceptibility, and the mother’s nutrition and health status.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Undernourished mothers are more likely to birth stunted children, perpetuating a cycle of undernutrition and poverty.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Stunted children are more likely to develop obesity and chronic diseases upon reaching adulthood.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Therefore, malnutrition resulting in stunting can further worsen the obesity epidemic, especially in low and middle income countries.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; This creates even new economic and social challenges for vulnerable impoverished groups.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt;

Data on global and regional food supply shows that consumption rose from 2011-2012 in all regions. Diets became more diverse, with a decrease in consumption of cereals and roots and an increase in fruits, vegetables, and meat products.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;FAO (2012). The state of food insecurity in the world 2012: Economic growth is necessary but not sufficient to accelerate reduction of hunger and malnutrition. Rome, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/ (Accessed 7 December 2012.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this increase masks the discrepancies between nations, where Africa, in particular, saw a decrease in food consumption over the same years.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; This information is derived from food balance sheets that reflect national food supplies, however, this does not necessarily reflect the distribution of micro and macronutrients.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; Often inequality in food access leaves distribution which uneven, resulting in undernourishment for some and obesity for others.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;

Undernourishment, or hunger, according to the FAO, is dietary intake below the minimum daily energy requirement.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; The amount of undernourishment is calculated utilizing the average amount of food available for consumption, the size of the population, the relative disparities in access to the food, and the minimum calories required for each individual.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; According to FAO, 868 million people (12% of the global population) were undernourished in 2012.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; This has decreased across the world since 1990, in all regions except for Africa, where undernourishment has steadily increased.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;  However, the rates of decrease are not sufficient to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger between 1990 and 2015.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; The global financial, economic, and food price crisis in 2008 drove many people to hunger, especially women and children. The spike in food prices prevented many people from escaping poverty, because the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food and farmers are net consumers of food.&lt;ref name="UNSCN09"&gt;UNSCN (2009).

United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition. http://www.unscn.org/en/publications/nutrition_briefs/#Nutrition_impacts_of_global_food_and_financial_crises.&lt;/ref&gt; High food prices cause consumers to have less purchasing power and to substitute more-nutritious foods with low-cost alternatives.&lt;ref name="IBRD"&gt;IBRD, World Bank (2012).

===Adult overweight and obesity===
{{main|Overnutrition|Obesity|Overweight}}
Malnutrition in industrialized nations is primarily due to excess calories and non-nutritious carbohydrates, which has contributed to the obesity epidemic affecting both developed and some developing nations.&lt;ref name=P4C48&gt;Darnton-Hill, Ian, C.

[[Vitamin A]] plays an essential role in developing the immune system in children, therefore, it is considered an essential micronutrient that can greatly affect health.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, because of the expense of testing for deficiencies, many developing nations have not been able to fully detect and address vitamin A deficiency, leaving vitamin A deficiency considered a silent hunger.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to estimates, subclinical vitamin A deficiency, characterized by low retinol levels, affects 190 million pre-school children and 19 million mothers worldwide.&lt;ref name="VitAWHO"&gt;WHO (2009).

===Infant and young child feeding===
Improvement of breast feeding practices, like early initiation and exclusive breast feeding for the first two years of life, could save the lives of 1.5 million children annually.&lt;ref name=ENA7&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13811-1 |title=How many child deaths can we prevent this year? |year=2003 |last1=Jones |first1=Gareth |last2=Steketee |first2=Richard W |last3=Black |first3=Robert E |last4=Bhutta |first4=Zulfiqar A |last5=Morris |first5=Saul S |journal=The Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9377 |pages=65–71 |pmid=12853204 |author6=Bellagio Child Survival Study Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition interventions targeted at infants aged 0–5 months first encourages early initiation of breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Though the relationship between early initiation of breast feeding and improved health outcomes has not been formally established, a recent study in [[Ghana]] suggests a causal relationship between early initiation and reduced infection-caused neo-natal deaths.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Also, experts promote exclusive breastfeeding, rather than using formula, which has shown to promote optimal growth, development, and health of infants.&lt;ref name=ENA2P7&gt;WHO.

==International food insecurity and malnutrition==
{{further information|Underweight|Food security|Epidemiology of malnutrition}}
According to UNICEF, South Asia has the highest levels of underweight children under five, followed by sub-Saharan Africans nations, with Industrialized countries and Latin nations having the lowest rates.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

=== United States===
In the United States, 2% of children are underweight, with under 1% [[stunted growth|stunted]] and 6% are [[wasting]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

In the US, [[dietitian]]s are registered (RD) or licensed (LD) with the Commission for Dietetic Registration and the American Dietetic Association, and are only able to use the title "dietitian," as described by the business and professions codes of each respective state, when they have met specific educational and experiential prerequisites and passed a national registration or licensure examination, respectively. In California, registered dietitians must abide by the {{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2585-2586.8|title=Business and Professions Code of Section 2585-2586.8|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111115758/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2585-2586.8|archivedate=2010-01-11|df=}}Anyone may call themselves a nutritionist, including unqualified dietitians, as this term is unregulated. Some states, such as the State of Florida, have begun to include the title "nutritionist" in state licensure requirements. Most governments provide guidance on nutrition, and some also impose [[mandatory labeling|mandatory disclosure/labeling]] requirements for processed food manufacturers and restaurants to assist consumers in complying with such guidance..{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the [[USDA|US Department of Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]]. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of a [[MyPlate|plate of food]] which in 2011 superseded the [[MyPyramid|MyPyramid food pyramid]] that had replaced the [[Four Food Groups]]. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the ''Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee''. Committee hearings are often televised on [[C-SPAN]]. The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] provides a sample week-long menu which fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308032337/http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Canada's Food Guide]] is another governmental recommendation..{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[South Asia]] has the highest percentage and number of underweight children under five in the world, at approximately 78 million children.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Patterns of stunting and wasting are similar, where 44% have not reached optimal height and 15% are wasted, rates much higher than any other regions.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region of the world has extremely high rates of child underweight- 46% of its child population under five is underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan alone account for half the globe’s underweight child population.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; South Asian nations have made progress towards the [[MDGs]], considering the rate has decreased from 53% since 1990, however, a 1.7% decrease of underweight prevalence per year will not be sufficient to meet the 2015 goal.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Some nations, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sri Lanka]], on the other hand, have made significant improvements, all decreasing their prevalence by half in ten years.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; While [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have made modest improvements, [[Nepal]] has made no significant improvement in underweight child prevalence.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Other forms of undernutrition have continued to persist with high resistance to improvement, such as the prevalence of stunting and wasting, which has not changed significantly in the past 10 years.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Causes of this poor nutrition include energy-insufficient diets, poor sanitation conditions, and the gender disparities in educational and social status.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Girls and women face discrimination especially in nutrition status, where South Asia is the only region in the world where girls are more likely to be underweight than boys.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In South Asia, 60% of children in the lowest quintile are underweight, compared to only 26% in the highest quintile, and the rate of reduction of underweight is slower amongst the poorest.&lt;ref name="UNMDG2011"&gt;UN (2011b). The Millennium Development Goals report 2011. New York, United Nations. http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/statistics/mdg-report-2011.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern/South Africa===

The Eastern and Southern African nations have shown no improvement since 1990 in the rate of underweight children under five.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; They have also made no progress in halving hunger by 2015, the most prevalent [[Millennium Development Goal]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This is due primarily to the prevalence of famine, declined agricultural productivity, food emergencies, drought, conflict, and increased poverty.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This, along with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], has inhibited the nutrition development of nations such as [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Swaziland]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Botswana]] has made remarkable achievements in reducing underweight prevalence, dropping 4% in 4 years, despite its place as the second leader in HIV prevalence amongst adults in the globe.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[South Africa]], the wealthiest nation in this region, has the second lowest proportion of underweight children at 12%, but has been steadily increasing in underweight prevalence since 1995.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Almost half of [[Ethiopian]] children are underweight, and along with [[Nigeria]], they account for almost one-third of the underweight under five in all of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===West/Central Africa===
West/[[Central Africa]] has the highest rate of children under five underweight in the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Of the countries in this region, the Congo has the lowest rate at 14%, while the nations of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]] are improving slowly.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In [[Gambia]], rates decreased from 26% to 17% in four years, and their coverage of vitamin A supplementation reaches 91% of vulnerable populations.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region has the next highest proportion of wasted children, with 10% of the population under five not at optimal weight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Little improvement has been made between the years of 1990 and 2004 in reducing the rates of underweight children under five, whose rate stayed approximately the same.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest child under five mortality rate in the world, due predominantly to its extreme infant mortality rate, at 238 deaths per 1000 live births.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Other contributing factors include the high rate of low birthweight children  (23%) and low levels of exclusive breast feeding  (4%).&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Anemia is prevalent in these nations, with unacceptable rates of iron deficient anemia.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The nutritional status of children is further indicated by its high rate of child wasting - 10%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  Wasting is a significant problem in Sahelian countries – [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chad]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Niger]] – where rates fall between 11% and 19% of under fives, affecting more than 1 million children.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Middle East/North Africa===

Six countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] region are on target to meet goals for reducing underweight children by 2015, and 12 countries have prevalence rates below 10%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, the nutrition of children in the region as a whole has degraded for the past ten years due to the increasing portion of underweight children in three populous nations – [[Iraq]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Forty six percent of all children in [[Yemen]] are underweight, a percentage that has worsened by 4% since 1990.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In Yemen, 53% of children under five are stunted and 32% are born at low birth weight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Sudan has an underweight prevalence of 41%, and the highest proportion of wasted children in the region at 16%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; One percent of households in Sudan consume iodized salt.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Iraq has also seen an increase in child underweight since 1990.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Djibouti]], [[Jordan]], the [[Occupied Palestinian Territory]] (OPT), [[Oman]], the [[Syrian Arab Republic]] and [[Tunisia]] are all projected to meet minimum nutrition goals, with OPT, Syrian AR, and Tunisia the fastest improving regions.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region demonstrates that undernutrition does not always improve with economic prosperity, where the [[United Arab Emirates]], for example, despite being a wealthy nation, has similar child death rates due to malnutrition to those seen in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

=== East Asia/Pacific===

The [[East Asia]]/Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by [[China]], the region’s most populous country.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]] are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Singapore]] has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation, besides [[Iceland]], in the world, at 3%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Cambodia]] has the highest rate of child mortality in the region (141 per 1,000 live births), while still its proportion of underweight children increased by 5 percent to 45% in 2000. Further nutrient indicators show that only 12 per cent of Cambodian babies are exclusively breastfed and only 14 per cent of households consume [[iodized salt]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Latin America/Caribbean===

This region has undergone the fastest progress in decreasing poor nutrition status of children in the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  The [[Latin American]] region has reduced underweight children prevalence by 3.8% every year between 1990 and 2004, with a current rate of 7% underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; They also have the lowest rate of child mortality in the developing world, with only 31 per 1000 deaths, and the highest [[iodine]] consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Cuba]] has seen improvement from 9 to 4 percent underweight under 5 between 1996 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The prevalence has also decreased in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Chile has a rate of underweight under 5, at merely 1%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The most populous nations, [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]], mostly have relatively low rates of underweight under 5, with only 6% and 8%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Guatemala]] has the highest percentage of underweight and stunted children in the region, with rates above 45%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; There are disparities amongst different populations in this region. For example, children in rural areas have twice the prevalence of underweight at 13%, compared to urban areas at 5%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

==Nutrition access disparities==

Occurring throughout the world, lack of proper nutrition is both a consequence and cause of poverty.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Impoverished individuals are less likely to have access to nutritious food and to escape from poverty than those who have healthy diets.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Disparities in [[socioeconomic]] status, both between and within nations, provide the largest threat to child nutrition in industrialized nations, where social inequality is on the rise.&lt;ref name=P4C43&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Organization, European Health Report 2005: Public health action for healthier children and populations|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen|date=2005|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82435/E87325.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNICEF, children living in the poorest households are twice as likely to be [[underweight]] as those in the richest.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Those in the lowest wealth [[Household income in the United States#Quintiles|quintile]] and whose mothers have the least education demonstrate the highest rates of child mortality and [[stunted growth|stunting]].&lt;ref name="WHOstats"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO (2013b)|publisher=World health statistics. Geneva, World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/81965/1/9789241564588_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the developing world, socioeconomic inequality in childhood malnutrition is more severe than in upper income brackets, regardless of the general rate of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="VanP"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van de Poel E|year=2008|title=Socioeconomic inequality in malnutrition in developing countries|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=86|issue=4|pages=241–320|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the greatest increase in [[childhood obesity]] has been seen in the lower middle income bracket.&lt;ref name="WHOglobe"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO (2011a). Global status report on noncommunicable diseases 2010|publisher=Geneva, World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/nmh/publications/ncd_report2010/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, children in rural locations are more than twice as likely to be underweight as compared to children under five in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In Latin American/Caribbean nations, “Children living in rural areas in Bolivia, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua are more than twice as likely to be underweight as children living in urban areas. That likelihood doubles to four times in Peru.” &lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

In the United States, the incidence of low birthweight is on the rise among all populations, but particularly among [[minorities]].&lt;ref name=P4C45&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Polhamus B, etal |title=Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance 2003 Report, Table 18D|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta|date=2004|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pednss/pednss_tables/pdf/national_table18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, boys and girls have almost identical rates as underweight children under age 5 across the world, except in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

==Nutrition policy==

===Nutrition interventions===
Nutrition directly influences progress towards meeting the Millennium Goals of eradicating hunger and poverty through health and education.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, nutrition interventions take a multi-faceted approach to improve the nutrition status of various populations. Policy and programming must target both individual behavioral changes and policy approaches to public health. While most nutrition interventions focus on delivery through the health-sector, non-health sector interventions targeting agriculture, water and sanitation, and education are important as well.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Global nutrition micro-nutrient deficiencies often receive large-scale solution approaches by deploying large governmental and non-governmental organizations. For example, in 1990, iodine deficiency was particularly prevalent, with one in five households, or 1.7 billion people, not consuming adequate iodine, leaving them at risk to develop associated diseases.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, a global campaign to iodize salt to eliminate iodine deficiency successfully boosted the rate to 69% of households in the world consuming adequate amounts of iodine.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Emergencies and crises often exacerbate undernutrition, due to the aftermath of crises that include food insecurity, poor health resources, unhealthy environments, and poor healthcare practices.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, the repercussions of natural disasters and other emergencies can exponentially increase the rates of macro and micronutrient deficiencies in populations.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Disaster relief interventions often take a multi-faceted public health approach. UNICEF’s programming targeting nutrition services amongst disaster settings include nutrition assessments, measles immunization, vitamin A supplementation, provision of fortified foods and micronutrient supplements, support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding for infants and young children, and therapeutic and supplementary feeding.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; For example, during Nigeria’s food crisis of 2005, 300,000 children received therapeutic nutrition feeding programs through the collaboration of UNICEF, the Niger government, the World Food Programme, and 24 NGOs utilizing community and facility based feeding schemes.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Interventions aimed at pregnant women, infants, and children take a behavioral and program-based approach. Behavioral intervention objectives include promoting proper breast-feeding, the immediate initiation of breastfeeding, and its continuation through 2 years and beyond.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; UNICEF recognizes that to promote these behaviors, healthful environments must be established conducive to promoting these behaviors, like healthy hospital environments, skilled health workers, support in the public and workplace, and removing negative influences.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Finally, other interventions include provisions of adequate micro and macro nutrients such as iron, anemia, and vitamin A supplements and vitamin-fortified foods and ready-to-use products.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Programs addressing micro-nutrient deficiencies, such as those aimed at anemia, have attempted to provide iron supplementation to pregnant and lactating women. However, because supplementation often occurs too late, these programs have had little effect.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Interventions such as women’s nutrition, early and exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate complementary food and micronutrient supplementation have proven to reduce stunting and other manifestations of undernutrition.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; A Cochrane review of community-based maternal health packages showed that this community-based approach improved the initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lassi|first=Zohra S.|last2=Bhutta|first2=Zulfiqar A.|date=2015-03-23|title=Community-based intervention packages for reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and improving neonatal outcomes|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=3|pages=CD007754|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007754.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25803792|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs have had adverse effects. One example is the “Formula for Oil” relief program in Iraq, which resulted in the replacement of breastfeeding for formula, which has negatively affected infant nutrition.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Implementation and delivery platforms===
In April 2010, the World Bank and the IMF released a policy briefing entitled “Scaling up Nutrition (SUN): A Framework for action” that represented a partnered effort to address the Lancet’s Series on under nutrition, and the goals it set out for improving under nutrition.&lt;ref name="SUN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61086-7 |title=Global child and maternal nutrition—the SUN rises |year=2013 |last1=Nabarro |first1=David |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9893 |pages=666–7 |pmid=23746773}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasized the 1000 days after birth as the prime window for effective nutrition intervention, encouraging programming that was cost-effective and showed significant cognitive improvement in populations, as well as enhanced productivity and economic growth.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; This document was labeled the SUN framework, and was launched by the [[UN General Assembly]] in 2010 as a road map encouraging the coherence of stakeholders like governments, [[academia]], UN system organizations and foundations in working towards reducing under nutrition.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; The SUN framework has initiated a transformation in global nutrition- calling for country-based nutrition programs, increasing evidence based and cost–effective interventions, and “integrating nutrition within national strategies for [[gender equality]], agriculture, [[food security]], [[social protection]], education, water supply, sanitation, and health care”.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; Government often plays a role in implementing nutrition programs through policy. For instance, several East Asian nations have enacted legislation to increase iodization of salt to increase household consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Political commitment in the form of evidence-based effective national policies and programs, trained skilled community nutrition workers, and effective communication and advocacy can all work to decrease malnutrition.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Market and industrial production can play a role as well. For example, in the [[Philippines]], improved production and market availability of iodized salt increased household consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; While most nutrition interventions are delivered directly through governments and health services, other sectors, such as agriculture, water and sanitation, and education, are vital for nutrition promotion as well.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt;

====Nutrition Education====
{{Main article|Nutrition Education}}
{{Main article|Food_studies#Food_and_Education}}

Nutrition is [[Teaching|taught]] in schools in many countries. In [[England and Wales]] the [[Personal and Social Education]] and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging.  In many schools a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments.  In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes.  Nutrition is offered at many schools, and if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc.  In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthy food choices and how to live a healthy life.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A 1985 US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report entitled ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'' concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Life Sciences. (1985). ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'', [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=597&amp;page=4  p. 4]. National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adams KM, Lindell KC, Kohlmeier M, Zeisel SH |title=Status of nutrition education in medical schools, |journal=Am.

====Protein====
The protein requirement for each individual differs, as do opinions about whether and to what extent physically active people require more protein. The 2005 [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDA), aimed at the general healthy adult population, provide for an intake of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt; A review panel stating that "no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Pasquale|first=Mauro G.|title=Sports Nutrition: Energy metabolism and exercise|editor=Ira Wolinsky, Judy A.

====Carbohydrates====
The main fuel used by the body during exercise is carbohydrates, which is stored in muscle as glycogen – a form of sugar. During exercise, muscle glycogen reserves can be used up, especially when activities last longer than 90&amp;nbsp;min.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.extension.iastate.edu/humansciences/content/carbohydrate|title = Iowa State University: Extension and outreach|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the amount of glycogen stored in the body is limited, it is important for athletes participating in endurance sports such as marathons to consume carbohydrates during their events.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==History==
Humans have evolved as [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s over the past 250,000 years. The diet of early modern humans varied significantly depending on location and climate. The diet in the tropics tended to depend more heavily on plant foods, while the diet at higher latitudes tended more towards animal products. Analyses of postcranial and cranial remains of humans and animals from the Neolithic, along with detailed bone-modification studies, have shown that [[cannibalism]] also occurred among prehistoric humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.233.4762.431 |title=Cannibalism in the Neolithic |year=1986 |last1=Villa |first1=P. |last2=Bouville |first2=C. |last3=Courtin |first3=J. |last4=Helmer |first4=D. |last5=Mahieu |first5=E. |last6=Shipman |first6=P. |last7=Belluomini |first7=G. |last8= Branca |first8= M. |journal= Science |volume=233 |issue=4762 |pages=431–7 |pmid= 17794567|bibcode=1986Sci...233..431V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From antiquity to 1900===
[[Image:Anaxagoras.png|thumb|right|Anaxagoras]]
Around 3000 BC the [[Vedic texts]] made mention of scientific research on nutrition. The Bible's [[Book of Daniel]] recounts first recorded nutritional experiment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} During an invasion of Judah, King [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] of [[Babylon]] captured Daniel and his friends. Selected as court servants, they were to share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring vegetables ([[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]) and water in accordance with their [[Jewish]] dietary restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Daniel and his friends received their diet for 10 days. On comparison with the king's men, they appeared healthier, and were allowed to continue with their diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=dan#en-NIV-21743 Daniel 1:5-16] ([http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Daniel_1#5 alternative translation])&lt;/ref&gt; Around 475 BC, [[Anaxagoras]] stated that food is absorbed by the human body and therefore contained "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;  Around 400 BC, [[Hippocrates]] said: "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.0-g |title='Let food be thy medicine…' |year=2004 |last1=Smith |first1=R. |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7433 |pages=0–g |pmc=318470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century scientist and artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) compared [[metabolism]] to a burning candle.  In 1747 Dr. [[James Lind]], a physician in the British navy, performed the first attested [[science|scientific]] nutrition experiment, discovering that [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice saved sailors who had been at sea for years from [[scurvy]], a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. The discovery was ignored{{by whom|date=November 2014}} for forty years, but after about 1850 British sailors became known as "[[limey]]s". (Scientists would not identify the essential [[vitamin C]] within lime juice until the 1930s.){{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Around 1770 [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the "Father of Nutrition and Chemistry", discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the [[oxidation]] of food is the source of body heat.  In 1790 [[George Fordyce]] recognized [[calcium]] as necessary for fowl survival.  In the early 19th century, the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] were recognized{{by whom|date=November 2014}} as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1816 [[François Magendie]] discovered that dogs fed only [[carbohydrates]] and [[fat]] lost their body [[protein]] and died in a few weeks, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In 1840, [[Justus Liebig]] discovered the chemical makeup of carbohydrates ([[sugar]]s), fats ([[fatty acid]]s) and proteins ([[amino acid]]s).  In the 1860s [[Claude Bernard]] discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood [[glucose]] can be stored as fat or as [[glycogen]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the early 1880s [[Kanehiro Takaki]] observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed [[beriberi]] (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1896 [[Eugen Baumann]] observed [[iodine]] in thyroid glands.  In 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]] worked with natives of [[Java (island)|Java]], who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi, but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, demonstrating that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===From 1900 to the present===
In the early 20th century [[Carl von Voit]] and [[Max Rubner]] independently measured [[calorie|caloric]] energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition. In 1906, Wilcock and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Hopkins]] showed that the amino acid [[tryptophan]] was necessary for the survival of rats. He{{who|date=November 2014}} fed them a special mixture of food containing all the nutrients he believed were essential for survival, but the rats died. A second group of rats to which he also fed an amount of milk containing [[vitamins]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinemann 2e Biology Activity Manual by Judith Brotherton and Kate Mundie{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gowland Hopkins]] recognized "accessory food factors" other than calories, protein and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], as [[Organic compound|organic]] materials essential to health but which the body cannot synthesize. In 1907 [[Stephen M. Babcock]] and [[Edwin B. Hart]] conducted the [[single-grain experiment]]. This experiment ran through 1911.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1912 [[Casimir Funk]] coined the term [[vitamin]] to label a vital factor in the diet: from the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and [[pellagra]], were thought then to derive from ammonia. The vitamins were studied{{by whom|date=November 2014}} in the first half of the 20th century. In 1913 [[Elmer McCollum]] discovered the first vitamins, fat-soluble [[vitamin A]] and water-soluble [[vitamin B]] (in 1915; later identified as a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named [[vitamin C]] as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. [[Lafayette Mendel]] (1872-1935) and [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Osborne]] (1859–1929) also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919 Sir [[Edward Mellanby]] incorrectly identified [[rickets]] as a vitamin A deficiency, because he could cure it in dogs with [[cod-liver oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 |title=Unraveling the Enigma of Vitamin D |publisher=United States National Academy of Sciences |date=April 29, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204111737/http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 |archivedate=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil but found it still cured rickets, thus identifying [[vitamin D]]. Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discovered [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]] as essential for rat pregnancy, and originally called it "food factor X" until 1925.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1925 Hart discovered that [[iron]] absorption requires trace amounts of [[copper]]. In 1927 [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] synthesized vitamin D, for which he won the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928 [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] isolated [[ascorbic acid]], and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935 he synthesized it, and in 1937 won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the [[citric acid cycle]]. In the 1930s [[William Cumming Rose]] identified [[essential amino acid]]s, necessary protein components which the body cannot synthesize. In 1935 [[Eric Underwood]] and [[Hedley Marston]] independently discovered the necessity of [[cobalt]]. In 1936 [[Eugene Floyd Dubois]] showed that work and school performance relate to caloric intake. In 1938 [[Erhard Fernholz]] discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E. It was synthesised by [[Paul Karrer]] (1889–1971).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

From 1940 [[rationing in the United Kingdom]] – during and after World War II – took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and others. In 1941 the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] established the first [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDAs). In 1992 the U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the [[Food Guide Pyramid]]. In 2002 a [[Natural Justice]] study showed a relation between nutrition and violent behavior. In 2005 a study found that in addition to bad nutrition, [[adenovirus]] may cause obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00479.2005 |laysummary=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-01/aps-coi012506.php |laysource= The American Physiological Society |laydate= January 30, 2006 |title= Adipogenic potential of multiple human adenoviruses in vivo and in vitro in animals |year= 2006 |last1=Whigham |first1=Leah D. |last2 = Israel |first2= Barbara A. |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard L. |journal= American Journal of Physiology |volume=290 |pages=R190–4 |pmid=16166204 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 28 '''Industrial Assessment Centers''' in the [[United States]] as of September 2018. These centers are located at universities across the US, and are funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) to spread ideas relating to industrial [[energy conservation]].

The centers conduct research into energy conservation techniques for industrial applications. This is accomplished by performing energy audits or assessments at manufacturers near the particular center. The IAC program has achieved over $4.5 billion of implemented energy cost savings since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;Nimbalkar, Presentation to the Industrial Energy Technology Conference, May 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Industrial Assessment Centers (formerly called the Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center (EADC) program) were created by the [[Department of Commerce]] in 1976 and later moved to the DOE.  The IAC program is administered through the Advanced Manufacturing Office&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/eere/amo/advanced-manufacturing-office Advanced Manufacturing Office]&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]]. The Centers were created to help small and medium-sized manufacturing facilities cut back on unnecessary costs from inefficient energy use, ineffective production procedures, excess waste production, and other production-related problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/eere/amo/industrial-assessment-centers-iacs Energy.gov IAC Site]&lt;/ref&gt; According to instructions from DOE, currently the centers are only required to focus on reducing wasted energy and increasing energy efficiency. While this remains the primary focus of the assessments, waste reduction and productivity improvements are still commonly recommended.

==Other Benefits==
In addition to providing technical support to small to mid-sized manufacturers through energy assessments, the IAC program offers several other important benefits. Apart from the routine energy audits which cover a broad scope of industrial settings and subsystems, the IACs provide technical material and workshops promoting energy efficiency. 

'''IAC Database'''&lt;br /&gt;
Rutgers University maintains a large databases of energy efficiency projects in the industrial sector.  The database contains recommendations from every audit completed by an IAC dating back to 1980.  As of June 2016, the IAC program had finished 17,400 assessments and made over 132,000 recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iac.university/ DOE EERE Industrial Assessment Centers Database]&lt;/ref&gt;  This database is free and open to the public.

'''IAC Alumni'''&lt;br /&gt;
The IAC program helps train the next generation of energy efficiency engineers.  Hundreds of students participate in the program each year,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iacforum.org/iac/metrics.jsp IAC Program Metrics]&lt;/ref&gt; and  over 56% of those students pursue careers in energy or energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iacforum.org/iac/pdf/New%20IAC%20Alumni%20Fact%20Sheet%20DRAFT%2010-4-2007.pdf IAC Alumni Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta)''' is a teaching and research institute at the [[ETH Zurich Faculty of Architecture|Department of Architecture]] of [[ETH Zurich]], situated on the ETH Zurich’s Hönggerberg Campus site.

== History ==
The Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) was founded on 1 January 1967 as a research body at the Architecture Department of ETH Zurich. &lt;ref&gt;  For the history of the institute see Martin Fröhlich, “Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur an der ETH-Zürich”, in Unsere Kunstdenkmaler, 24, no. 1 (1973), pp. 16–20; Katharina Medici-Mall, “Sammeln, forschen, ausstellen, publizieren: Das Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur an der ETH Zürich”, Aktuelles Bauen, 18 (April 1983), pp. 23–6; Ruth Hanisch and Steven Spier, “ ‘History is not the Past but Another Mightier Presence’: The Founding of the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich and its Effects on Swiss Architecture”, The Journal of Architecture, 14, no. 6 (2009), pp. 655–86.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The opening symposium was held on 23 June 1967. &lt;ref&gt;Institut für Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur (ed.), Reden und Vortrag zur Eröffnung (Birkhäuser: Basle, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since its beginnings in 1967, the past and the present, theory and practice, have been the cornerstones and reference framework for the work undertaken at the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta). Besides teaching activities in the fields of the history of art and architecture, [[architectural theory]] and [[urban design]], the institute’s core focus since its launch has lain in mediating and exploring architecture in its historical depth and thematic breadth. The results of the institute’s in-house research, which is primarily influenced by the areas of interest of the teaching staff and the holdings of the simultaneously established archive, have been presented since 1968 in a publication series. These first appeared in cooperation with the Birkhäuser publishing house (in the “rainbow series”), later with the Ammann publishing house and since the mid-1980s in the [[gta Verlag]], which today enjoys the reputation of being one of the leading architecture publishers.

The absorption of the so-called [[Gottfried Semper|Semper]] Archive from the ETH Bibliothek on the occasion of the creation of the institute forms the foundation of the [[gta Archives]], which over time has advanced to become an internationally renowned research facility. Since then, the main acquisition emphasis has been on the architecture of the nineteenth century and the pre-modern, modern (Swiss) architecture in the form of collections ([[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM)), as well as advance legacies and bequests of individual architects of international stature  (including [[Karl Moser]], [[Hans Bernoulli]], [[Lux Guyer]], [[Haefeli Moser Steiger]], [[Ernst Gisel]], [[Fritz Haller]] and [[Trix Haussmann|Trix]] and [[Robert Haussmann]]).

The organisational office for exhibitions by the ETH Zurich’s Department of Architecture became incorporated in the institute in 1974, and – since 1986 as gta Exhibitions – affords a wide public insight into contemporary architectural discourse and current research at the department.

=== Institute directors ===

* [[Adolf Max Vogt]] (1920–2013), director from 1967 to 1974 and 1981 to 1982
* [[Bernhard Hoesli]] (1923–1984), director from 1975 to 1980
* [[Heinz Ronner]] (1924–1992), director from 1983 to 1987
* [[Werner Oechslin]] (born 1944), director from 1987 to 1998 and 1999 to 2006

* [[Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani]] (born 1951), director from 2010 to 2016
* [[Laurent Stalder]] (born 1970), director since 2016

===Professorial chairs and divisions ===
Today the institute encompasses the following professorial chairs:
*  Chair of the History and Theory of Architecture, Maarten Delbeke 
*  Adjunct Professor of the History of Architecture of Modernity, Ita Heinze-Greenberg  
*  Chair of Theory of Architecture, Laurent Stalder 
*  Chair of the History of Art and Architecture, Philip Ursprung 
*  Chair of the History of Urban Design (vacant) 

The following divisions assist the research projects and convey their findings:
*  gta Archives 
*  gta Verlag
*  gta Exhibitions 

The gta Institute assists in the promotion of academic newcomers with its own doctoral programme (since 2012). The institute’s educational provisions are supplemented by the programme Master of Studies in the History and Theory of Architecture, which mediates between practice and scholarship (since 1992).
There is a close academic exchange with the Werner Oechslin Library Foundation, associated with the ETH Zurich via a cooperation agreement.

== Teaching and research areas ==

The institute’s task is to empirically appraise and theoretically reflect upon architecture in its historical depth and ideological breadth. Along with the establishing and verification of facts, the gta Institute has always been at pains to review applied methods in terms of their validity as models and to make them beneficial to contemporary architecture. As an institute, the gta researches and teaches the history of knowledge of architecture, building forms and techniques, the function of architecture and its relations to society and politics, the evolution of design and architectural thinking from the beginnings to today, as well as the methodologies of architectural history work ranging from building analysis through to the digital humanities.

'''Insulating glass''' ('''IG'''), more commonly known as '''double glazing''' (or '''double-pane''', and increasingly triple glazing/pane), consists of two or three [[glass]] [[Paned window|window panes]] separated by a vacuum or gas filled space to reduce [[heat transfer]] across a part of the [[building envelope]].

Insulating glass units (IGUs) are manufactured with glass in range of thickness from 3 to 10&amp;nbsp;mm (1/8" to 3/8") or more in special applications. Laminated or tempered glass may also be used as part of the construction. Most units are produced with the same thickness of glass used on both panes{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} but special applications such as [[acoustic attenuation]] or&amp;nbsp;security may require wide ranges of thicknesses to be incorporated in the same unit.

Surface #1 is facing outside, Surface #2 is the inside surface of the exterior pane, Surface #3 is the outside surface of the interior pane, and Surface #4  is the inside surface of interior pane. The window [[Window#Frame and sash construction|frame]] is labelled #5, a [[Insulated glazing#Spacer|spacer]] is indicated as #6, seals are shown in red (#7), the internal [[molding (decorative)|reveal]] is on the right hand side (#8) and the exterior [[Window#Technical terms|windowsill]] on the left (#9)]]

==Double-hung and storm windows==
[[File:Bleekman zimmer.jpg|thumb|A typical installation of insulated glass windows with uPVC frames]]
Insulating glass is an evolution from older technologies known as [[double-hung window]]s and [[storm window]]s. Traditional double-hung windows used a single pane of glass to separate the interior and exterior spaces.
* In the summer, a [[window screen]] would be installed on the exterior over the double-hung window to keep out animals and insects.
* In the winter, the screen was removed and replaced with a [[storm window]], which created a two-layer separation between the interior and exterior spaces, increasing window insulation in cold winter months. To permit ventilation the storm window may be hung from removable hinge loops and swung open using folding metal arms. No screening was usually possible with open storm windows, though in the winter, insects typically are not active.
Traditional storm windows and screens are relatively time consuming and labor-intensive, requiring removal and storage of the storm windows in the spring, and reinstallation in the fall and storage of the screens. The weight of the large storm window frame and glass makes replacement on upper-stories of tall buildings a difficult task requiring repeatedly climbing a ladder with each window and trying to hold the window in place while securing retaining clips around the edges.
However, current reproductions of these old-style storm windows can be made with detachable glass in the bottom pane that can be replaced with a detachable screen when desired. This eliminates the need for changing the entire storm window according to the seasons.

Insulated glazing forms a very compact multi-layer sandwich of air and glass, which eliminates the need for storm windows. Screens may also be left installed year-round with insulated glazing, and can be installed in a manner that permits installation and removal from inside the building, eliminating the requirement to climb up the exterior of the house hto service the windows. It is possible to retrofit insulated glazing into traditional double-hung frames, though this would require significant modification to the wood framed due to the increased thickness of the IG assembly.

Modern window units with IG typically completely replace the older double-hung unit, and include other improvements such as better sealing between the upper and lower windows, and spring-operated weight balancing that removes the need for large hanging weights inside the wall next to the windows, allowing for more insulation around the window and reducing air leakage, provides robust protection against the sun and will keep the house cool in the hot summer and warm in winter. These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building.

==Spacer==
[[File:Spacers 1.jpg|thumb|Spacer: 9.5/13.5/19.5 mm]]
The glass panes are separated by a "spacer". A spacer, also known as a [[warm edge]],  is the piece that separates the two panes of glass in an insulating glass system, and seals the gas space between them. Historically, spacers were made primarily of metal and fiber, which manufacturers thought provided more durability.

However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless the metal is thermally improved), undermining the ability of the '''insulated glass unit (IGU)''' to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming at the bottom of the sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces [[condensation]] on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall [[Thermal transmittance|U-value]].
* A spacer that reduces heat flow in glazing configurations may also have characteristics for sound dampening where external noise is an issue.
* Typically, spacers are filled with or contain [[desiccant]] to remove moisture trapped in the gas space during manufacturing, thereby lowering the dew point of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the outside glass pane temperature falls.
* New technology has emerged to combat the heat loss from traditional spacer bars, including improvements to the structural performance and long-term-durability of improved metal (aluminum with a thermal barrier) and foam spacers.

== Construction ==
IGUs are often manufactured on a made to order basis on factory production lines, but standard units are also available. The width and height dimensions, the thickness of the glass panes and the type of glass for each pane as well as the overall thickness of the unit must be supplied to the manufacturer. On the assembly line, spacers of specific thicknesses are cut and assembled into the required overall width and height dimensions and filled with desiccant. On a parallel line, glass panes are cut to size and washed to be optically clear.

[[File:Passivhaus Fenster Beispiele (blank).svg|thumb|265px|Examples of modern plastic and wooden window profiles with insulated glazing]]

An adhesive sealant ([[polyisobutylene]]) is applied to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either [[polysulfide]] or [[silicone sealant]] or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.

The insulating glazing unit, consisting of two glass panes bound together into a single unit with a seal between the edges of the panes, was patented in the United States by Thomas Stetson in 1865.&lt;ref name=Stetson&gt;{{ cite patent |country=US |number= 49167 |status = patent |title = Improvement in Window Glass |gdate = 1865-08-12 |invent1 = Stetson, Thomas D. | class = ECLA classification}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed into a commercial product in the 1930s, when several patents were filed, and a product was announced by the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials: History and Conservation |editor1-first=Thomas C. |editor1-last=Jester |publisher=Getty Publications |date=2014 |isbn=9781606063255 |page=273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kn9DBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273}} See note 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Their product was sold under the Thermopane brand name, which had been registered as a trademark in 1941. The Thermopane technology differs significantly from contemporary IGUs. The two panes of glass were welded together by a glass seal, and the two panes were separated by less than the {{convert|0.5|in|cm}} typical of modern units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Wilson |title=The Revolution in Window Performance — Part 1 |work=Green Building Advisor |date=March 22, 2012  |url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/revolution-window-performance-part-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The brand name Thermopane has entered the vocabulary of the glazing industry as the [[genericized trademark]] for any IGU.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Thermal performance ==
The maximum insulating efficiency of a standard IGU is determined by the thickness of the space. Typically, most sealed units achieve maximum insulating values using a space of {{convert|16|-|19|mm|in|abbr=on}} when measured at the centre of the IGU.

IGU thickness is a compromise between maximizing insulating value and the ability of the framing system used to carry the unit. Some residential and most commercial glazing systems can accommodate the ideal thickness of a double-paned unit. Issues arise with the use of triple glazing to further reduce heat loss in an IGU. The combination of thickness and weight results in units that are too unwieldy for most residential or commercial glazing systems, particularly if these panes are contained in moving frames or sashes.

This trade-off does not apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as heat loss due to [[convection]] is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and [[Heat conduction|conduction]] through the edge seal and required supporting pillars over the face area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassfiles.com/library/article.php?id=1174&amp;search=evacuated&amp;page=1 |title=Development and quality control of vacuum glazing by N. Ng and L. So; University of Sydney |publisher=Glassfiles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="VIGLBL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Insulated Glazing (VIG)|url=https://windows.lbl.gov/vacuum-insulated-glazing-vig|website=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete [[vacuum]]. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit (powdered glass) having a reduced melting point is heated to join the components. This creates a glass seal that experiences increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may limit the maximum allowable temperature differential. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35&amp;nbsp;°C. Closely spaced pillars are required to reinforce the glazing to resist the pressure of the atmosphere. Pillar spacing and diameter limited the insulation achieved by designs available beginning in the 1990s to R = 4.7 h·°F·ft2/BTU (0.83 m2·K/W) no better than high quality double glazed insulated glass units. Recent products claim performance of  R = 14 h·°F·ft2/BTU (2.5 m2·K/W) which exceeds triple glazed insulated glass units.&lt;ref name="VIGLBL" /&gt; The required internal pillars exclude applications where an unobstructed view through the glazing unit is desired, i.e. most residential and commercial windows, and refrigerated food display cases.

Vacuum technology is also used in some non-transparent [[thermal insulation|insulation]] products called [[vacuum insulated panel]]s.

An older-established way to improve insulation performance is to replace air in the space with a lower [[thermal conductivity]] gas. Gas convective heat transfer is a function of viscosity and specific heat. [[noble gas|Monatomic gases]] such as [[argon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] are often used since (at normal temperatures) they do not carry heat in rotational [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|modes]], resulting in a lower [[heat capacity]] than poly-atomic gases. Argon has a thermal conductivity 67% that of air, krypton has about half the conductivity of argon.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/general_physics/2_3/2_3_7.html |title=Kaye and Laby. Thermal conductivities of gases |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Argon is almost 1% of the atmosphere and isolated at a moderate cost. Krypton and xenon are only trace components of the atmosphere and very expensive. All of  these "noble" gases are non-toxic, clear, odorless, chemically inert, and commercially available because of their widespread application in industry.  Some manufacturers also offer [[sulfur hexafluoride]] as an insulating gas, especially to insulate sound. It has only 2/3 the conductivity of argon, but it is stable, inexpensive and dense. However, sulfur hexafluoride is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. In Europe, {{chem|SF|6}} falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its usage for several applications. Since 1 January 2006, {{chem|SF|6}} is banned as a [[tracer gas]] and in all applications except [[high-voltage switchgear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/sustainability/climate-meps-give-gas-bill-green-boost/article-145749|title=F-gas and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; restrictions|author=|date=|website=euractiv.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the more effective a fill gas is at its optimum thickness, the thinner the optimum thickness is. For example, the optimum thickness for krypton is lower than for argon, and lower for argon than for air.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE Handbook, Volume 1, Fundamentals, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; However, since it is difficult to determine whether the gas in an IGU has become mixed with air at time of manufacture (or becomes mixed with air once installed), many designers prefer to use thicker gaps than would be optimum for the fill gas if it were pure. Argon is commonly used in insulated glazing as it is the most affordable. Krypton, which is considerably more expensive, is not generally used except to produce very thin double glazing units or extremely high performance triple-glazed units. Xenon has found very little application in IGUs because of cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ktu.lt/ultra/journal/pdf_51_2/51-2004-Vol.2_01-J.Butkus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat insulating properties==
The effectiveness of insulated glass can be expressed as an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]]. The higher the R-value, the greater is its resistance to heat transfer.  A standard IGU consisting of clear uncoated panes of glass (or lights) with air in the cavity between the lights typically has an R-value of 0.35 K·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W.

Using US [[customary units]], a rule of thumb in standard IGU construction is that each change in the component of the IGU results in an increase of 1 R-value to the efficiency of the unit. Adding argon gas increases the efficiency to about R-3. Using low emissivity glass on surface #2 will add another R-value. Properly designed triple-glazed IGUs with low emissivity coatings on surfaces #2 and #4 and filled with argon gas in the cavities result in IG units with R-values as high as R-5. Certain vacuum insulated glass units (VIGU) or multi-chambered IG units using coated plastic films result in R-values as high as R-12.5

Additional layers of glazing provide the opportunity for improved insulation. While the standard double glazing is most widely used, triple glazing is not uncommon, and quadruple glazing is produced for very cold environments such as Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96m36VQHlE8C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=Quadruple+glazing+Alaska&amp;source=bl&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q=Quadruple+glazing+Alaska&amp;f=false|title=Popular Science|first=Bonnier|last=Corporation|date=1 February 1980|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=23 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/quadruple-glazed-house-uses-geothermal-pump-to-maintain-a-constant-temperature/|title=Quadruple-Glazed House Uses Geothermal Pump to Maintain a Constant Temperature|author=|date=|website=inhabitat.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even quintuple glazing (four cavities, five panes) is available - with mid-pane insulation factors equivalent to walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenspec.buildinggreen.com/blogs/top-products-greenbuild-expo-floor-windows|title=Green Products|author=|date=|website=buildinggreen.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/superwindows-rescue|title=‘Superwindows’ To the Rescue?|author=|date=|website=GreenBuildingAdvisor.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustic insulating properties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
In some situations the insulation is in reference to [[noise mitigation]]. In these circumstances a large air space improves the noise insulation quality or [[sound transmission class]]. Asymmetric double glazing, using different thicknesses of glass rather than the conventional symmetrical systems (equal glass thicknesses used for both lights) will improve the acoustic attenuation properties of the IGU. If standard air spaces are used, [[sulfur hexafluoride]] can be used to replace or augment an inert gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bqUxCGJd0owC&amp;pg=PA504&amp;lpg=PA504&amp;dq=hexafluoride+insulating+glass&amp;source=web&amp;ots=niJxrJZMBa&amp;sig=DQwDhsPWasPns4IgA4tJtyR_YXs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result |title=Sound insulation - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improve acoustical attenuation performance.

Other glazing material variations affect acoustics. The most widely used glazing configurations for sound dampening include laminated glass with varied thickness of the interlayer and thickness of the glass. Including a structural, thermally improved aluminum thermal barrier air spacer in the insulating glass can improve acoustical performance by reducing the transmission of exterior noise sources in the fenestration system.

Reviewing the glazing system components, including the air space material used in the insulating glass, can ensure overall sound transmission improvement.

== Longevity ==
The life of an IGU varies depending on the quality of materials used, size of gap between inner and outer pane, temperature differences, workmanship and location of installation both in terms of facing direction and geographic location, as well as the treatment the unit receives.  IG units typically last from 10 to 25 years, with windows facing the equator often lasting less than 12 years. IGUs typically carry a [[warranty]] for 10 to 20 years depending upon the manufacturer.  If IGUs are altered (such as installation of a solar control film) the warranty may be voided by the manufacturer.

The Insulating Glass Manufacturers Alliance (IGMA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igmaonline.org |title=IGMA |publisher=Igmaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertook an extensive study to characterize the failures of commercial insulating glass units over a 25-year period.

For a standard construction IG unit, condensation collects between the layers of glass when the perimeter seal has failed and when the desiccant has become saturated, and can generally only be eliminated by replacing the IGU. Seal failure and subsequent replacement results in a significant factor in the overall cost of owning IGUs.

Large temperature differences between the inner and outer panes stress the spacer adhesives, which can eventually fail. Units with a small gap between the panes are more prone to failure because of the increased stress.

Atmospheric pressure changes combined with wet weather can, in rare cases, eventually lead to the gap filling with water.

The flexible sealing surfaces preventing infiltration around the window unit can also degrade or be torn or damaged. Replacement of these seals can be difficult to impossible, due to IG windows commonly using extruded channel frames without seal retention screws or plates. Instead, the edge seals are installed by pushing an arrow-shaped indented one-way flexible lip into a slot on the extruded channel, and often cannot be easily extracted from the extruded slot to be replaced.

In Canada, since the beginning of 1990, there are some companies offering servicing of failed IG units. They provide open ventilation to the atmosphere by drilling hole(s) in the glass and/or spacer. This solution often reverses the visible condensation, but cannot clean the interior surface of the glass and staining that may have occurred after long-term exposure to moisture. They may offer a warranty from 5 to 20 years. This solution lowers the insulating value of the window, but it can be a "green" solution when the window is still in good condition. If the IG unit had a gas fill (e.g. argon or krypton or a mixture) the gas is naturally dissipated and the R-value suffers.

Since 2004, there are also some companies offering the same restoration process for failed double-glazed units in the UK, and there is one company offering restoration of failed IG units in Ireland since 2010.

=== Thermal stress cracking ===
Thermal stress cracking isn't different for insulated glazing and uninsulated glazing. Temperature differences across the surface of glass panes can lead to cracking of the glass. This typically occurs where the glass is partially shaded and one section is heated in sunlight. Tinted glass increases heating and thermal stress, while annealing reduces internal stress built into the glass during manufacturing leaving more strength available to resist thermal cracking. &lt;ref&gt;Viracon Corporation, Owatonna, MN, "Tech Talk: Thermal stress cracking", 2001, http://www.viracon.com/images/pdf/TTThermalStress.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal expansion creates internal pressure, or stress, where expanding warm material is retrained by cooler material. A crack may form if the stress exceeds the material strength and the crack will propagate until the stress at the tip of the crack is below the material's strength. Typically cracks initiate and propagate from the narrow shaded cut edge where the material is weak and the stress is spread over a small glass volume compared to the open area. Glass thickness has no direct effect on thermal cracking in windows because both thermal stress and material strength are proportional to thickness. While thicker glass will have more strength remaining after supporting wind loads, that's usually only a significant factor for large glazing units on tall buildings and wind improves heat dissipation. Increased resistance to cracking with thicker glazing in common residential and commercial applications is more reliably result of using tempered glass to satisfy building safety codes requiring its use to reduce the severity of injuries when broken. Cut edge stresses have to be reduced by annealing prior to tempering and that removes stress concentrations created during glass cutting and that significantly increases the stress required to initiate a crack from the edge. The cost to process tempered glass is much greater than the cost difference between 1/8" (3 mm) glass and 3/16" (5 mm) or 1/4" (6.5 mm) material, prompting glaziers to suggest replacing cracked glazing with thicker glass. It may also avoid revealing to the customer that tempered glass should have been used initially.

== Estimating heat loss from double-glazed windows ==
Given the thermal properties of the sash, frame, and sill, and the dimensions of the glazing and thermal properties of the glass, the heat transfer rate for a given window and set of conditions can be calculated.
This can be calculated in kW (kilowatts), but more usefully for cost benefit calculations can be stated as kWh pa (kilowatt hours per annum), based on the typical conditions over a year for a given location.

The glass panels in double-glazed windows transmit heat in both directions by radiation, through the glazing by conduction and across the gap between the panes by convection, by conduction through the frame, and by infiltration around the perimeter seals and the frame's seal to the building. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. Unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains at night in the winter and using sun shades during the day in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a "Window Energy Rating" WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]]), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pierce|first1=Connie C.|title=energy and acoustic solutions|url=http://thermotekwindows.com.au/products/double-glazed-doors-windows/|website=THERMOTEK|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Interacting galaxies''' ('''''colliding galaxies''''') are [[galaxy|galaxies]] whose [[gravity|gravitational fields]] result in a disturbance of one another. An example of a minor interaction is a [[satellite galaxy]]'s disturbing the primary galaxy's [[spiral arm]]s. An example of a major interaction is a galactic collision, which may lead to a [[galaxy merger]].

==Satellite interaction==
A giant galaxy interacting with its [[satellite galaxy|satellites]] is common. A satellite's gravity could attract one of the primary's [[spiral arm]]s, or the secondary satellite's path could coincide with the position of the primary satellite's and so would dive into the primary galaxy (the [[Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy|Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy]] into the [[Milky Way]] being an example of the latter). That can possibly trigger a small amount of [[star formation]]. Such orphaned clusters of stars were sometimes referred to as "blue blobs" before they were recognized as stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/news_release/news/2008-02|title=HubbleSite: News - Hubble Finds that "Blue Blobs" in Space Are Orphaned Clusters of Stars|website=hubblesite.org|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colliding galaxies are common during [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/29157-hubble-space-telescope-science-legacy.html space.com 2015-04-21 How the Hubble Space Telescope Changed Our View of the Cosmos-Galactic Collisions Photographs]&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely tenuous distribution of matter in galaxies means these are not collisions in the traditional sense of the word, but rather gravitational interactions.

Colliding may lead to [[galaxy merger|merging]] if two galaxies collide and do not have enough momentum to continue traveling after the collision. In that case, they fall back into each other and eventually merge into one galaxy after many passes through each other. If one of the colliding galaxies is much larger than the other, it will remain largely intact after the merger. The larger galaxy will look much the same, while the smaller galaxy will be stripped apart and become part of the larger galaxy. When galaxies pass through each other, unlike during mergers, they largely retain their material and shape after the pass.

Galactic collisions are now frequently simulated on computers, which use realistic physics principles, including the simulation of gravitational forces, gas dissipation phenomena, star formation, and feedback. Dynamical friction slows the relative motion galaxy pairs, which may possibly merge at some point, according to the initial relative energy of the orbits.

==Galactic cannibalism==
[[File:The last waltz.jpg|thumb|2MASX J16270254+4328340 galaxy has merged with another galaxy leaving a fine mist, made of millions of stars, spewing from it in long trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The last waltz|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1547a/|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[galaxy]] --&gt;'''Galactic cannibalism''' refers to the process in which a large [[galaxy]], through [[galactic tide|tidal]] gravitational interactions with a companion, merges with that companion; that results in a larger, often [[irregular galaxy]].

The most common result of the gravitational merger between two or more galaxies is an irregular galaxy, but [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] may also result.

It has been suggested that galactic cannibalism is currently occurring between the [[Milky Way]] and the [[Magellanic clouds|Large and Small Magellanic Clouds]]. Streams of gravitationally-attracted [[hydrogen]] arcing from these dwarf galaxies to the Milky Way is taken as evidence for the theory.

==Galaxy harassment==
Galaxy harassment is a type of interaction between a low-luminosity galaxy and a brighter one that takes place within rich [[galaxy cluster]]s, such as [[Virgo Cluster|Virgo]] and [[Coma Cluster|Coma]], where galaxies are moving at high [[relative speed]]s and suffering frequent encounters with other systems of the cluster by the high galactic density of the latter. 
According to [[computer simulation]]s, the interactions convert the affected galaxy disks into disturbed [[barred spiral galaxy|barred spiral galaxies]] and produces [[starburst galaxy|starbursts]] followed by, if more encounters occur, loss of [[angular momentum]] and heating of their gas.

The result would be the conversion of (late type) low-luminosity spiral galaxies into [[dwarf spheroidal galaxy|dwarf spheroidals]] and [[dwarf elliptical galaxy|dwarf ellipticals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://supernova.lbl.gov/~evlinder/umass/sumold/nk/harass.html Galaxy Harassment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the hypothesis had been claimed by studying early-type dwarf galaxies in the Virgo Cluster and finding structures, such as disks and spiral arms, which suggest they are former [[disk galaxy|disk systems]] transformed by the above-mentioned interactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A&amp;A...391..823B More evidence for hidden spiral and bar features in bright early-type dwarf galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the existence of similar structures in isolated early-type dwarf galaxies, such as [[LEDA 2108986]], has undermined this hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;Graham, A.W. et al.

'''Julia Clifford Lathrop''' (June 29, 1858 – April 15, 1932) was an [[Americans|American]] [[social reformer]] in the area of education, social policy, and children's welfare. As director of the [[United States Children's Bureau]] from 1912 to 1922, she was the first woman ever to head a United States federal bureau.&lt;ref name=Ladd-Taylor&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ladd-Taylor | first1 = Molly | title = Mother-Work: Women, Child Welfare, and the State, 1890-1930 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | year = 1995 | location = Urbana and Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-06482-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Julia Clifford Lathrop was born in [[Rockford, Illinois]].  Julia's father, a lawyer and personal friend of Abraham Lincoln, helped establish the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and served in the state legislature (1856–57) and Congress (1877–79).  Her mother was a suffragist active in women's rights activities in Rockford and a graduate of the first class of [[Rockford University|Rockford Female Seminary]].

Lathrop attended [[Rockford Female Seminary]] where she met [[Jane Addams]] and [[Ellen Gates Starr]]. After one year, she transferred to [[Vassar College]], developing her own multidisciplinary studies in statistics, institutional history, sociology, and community organization and graduated in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/alumni/julia-lathrop.html | title = Julia Lathrop | accessdate = April 10, 2011 | website = Vassar Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, she worked in her father's law office first as a secretary and then studying the law for herself.

===Work in Chicago===
In 1890, Lathrop moved to [[Chicago]] where she joined [[Jane Addams]], [[Ellen Gates Starr]], [[Alzina Stevens]], [[Edith Abbott]], [[Grace Abbott]], [[Florence Kelley]], [[Mary McDowell]], [[Alice Hamilton]], [[Sophonisba Breckinridge]] and other social reformers at [[Hull House]].&lt;ref name="Altenbaugh1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J. Altenbaugh|title=Historical Dictionary of American Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_HSk9YheBYC&amp;pg=PA209|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-28590-5|pages=209–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lathrop ran a discussion group called the Plato Club in the early days of the House. The women at Hull House actively campaigned to persuade Congress to pass legislation to protect children. During the depression years of the early '90s Lathrop served as a volunteer investigator of relief applicants, visiting homes to document the needs of the families.

In 1893, Lathrop was appointed as the first ever woman member of the [[Illinois State Board of Charities]], beginning her lifelong work in civil service reform: advocating for the training of professional social workers and standardizing employment procedures. This would lead to opening the labor market for educated women as well as improving social services in Progressive Era cities and towns. Over the next few years she helped introduce reforms such as the appointment of female doctors in state hospitals and the removal of the insane from the state workhouses.

===Director of United States Children's Bureau===
[[Image:Portrait of Julia Lathrop.jpg|right|thumb|200px|"Miss Julia C. Lathrop," ''The World's Work'', 1912.]]
Reacting to pressure from Progressive women reformers for the appointment of a woman for the newly created [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]], in 1912, President [[William Taft]] appointed Lathrop as the first bureau chief.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Two 7-Year Old Newsies, Profane and Smart, Selling Sunday, Nashville, Tennessee|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2730|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next nine years Lathrop directed research into child labor, infant mortality, maternal mortality, juvenile delinquency, mothers' pensions and illegitimacy.&lt;ref name = Lindenmeyer&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lindenmeyer | first1 = Kriste | title = A right to childhood: the U.S. Children's Bureau and child welfare, 1912-46890-1930 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | year = 1997 | location = Urbana and Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-02275-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Children's Bureau under Lathrop (1912–21) (known as "America's First Official Mother") and her successors became an administrative unit that not only created child welfare policy but also led its implementation. For many conservative women, the Bureau's focus on maternal and child welfare gave them a role in politics for the first time—something that the [[suffrage]] or [[women's rights]] movements had not offered them. The Bureau expanded its budget and personnel to focus on a scientific approach to motherhood in order to reduce infant and maternal mortality, improve child health and advocate for trained care for children with disabilities. Lathrop modeled the Children's Bureau investigations from the work she did while at Hull-House. The Bureau also lobbied to abolish child labor. Scientific language became critical to the reform efforts such as the baby-saving campaigns in towns with large working class and immigrant populations where the middle class [[Maternalist reform|maternalists]] battled contemporary beliefs in the inevitability of high infant mortality rates. "Mother-work in the community"&lt;ref name = Ladd-Taylor/&gt;{{rp|34}} meant that women educated in the latest scientific theories about children's health and safety would lead the movement for child welfare reform.

In her first annual report for the agency, Lathrop described the plans for expansion: promotion of birth registration, infant mortality field studies, production of instructional pamphlets and reports, expand the study of child labor laws, explore issues regarding mothers' pensions, and study the status of "dependent, defective, and delinquent children."&lt;ref name = Lindenmeyer/&gt;{{rp|52}} Lathrop wrote in 1914: "Work for infant welfare is coming to be regarded as more than a philanthropy or an expression of good will.  It is a profoundly important public concern which tests the public spirit and the democracy of a community."&lt;ref name = Ladd-Taylor/&gt;{{rp|74}}

Unlike the [[Parent-Teacher Association|National Congress of Mothers]], Lathrop's leadership of the Children's Bureau relied on her belief in the New Woman's right to freedom for individual development and opportunities, including a college degree of equal merit to men's and a decent job. However, Lathrop was careful to insist that motherhood was "the most important calling in the world"&lt;ref name = Ladd-Taylor/&gt;{{rp|81}} and to deny that women should have career ambitions. This way Lathrop could avoid controversy even while she built public support for the new agency.

[[Image:Miss Julia Lathrop LCCN2016825127 (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|260px|Julia Lathrop, Commissioner of the United States Children's Bureau]]
In 1917, the [[American Association for Labor Legislation]] proposed a national health insurance act that included a provision for weekly cash allocations for pregnant women. Lathrop went against the private insurance industry and the [[American Medical Association]] to support this proposal, believing that the maternity benefit systems already in place in Germany, England and France left too many women and their babies uninsured. Lathrop argued in an address before the [[American Public Health Association]]'s 1918 meeting in Chicago that U.S. leaders needed to address the reasons for poverty in order to address children's health needs—that high infant mortality among the poor and working class in American cities was not just due to ignorance or laziness. Lathrop asked: "Which is the more safe and sane conclusion! That 88 per cent of all these fathers were incorrigibly indolent or below normal mentally, or that sound public economy demands an irreducible minimum living standard to be sustained by a minimum wage and other such expedients as may be developed in a determined effort to give every child a fair chance?"&lt;ref name = Lindenmeyer/&gt;{{rp|63}}

The attitude of most of the staff in the Children's Bureau and other government agencies however, was that women—especially with children—should not work outside of the home even if impoverished. Any connections between children's health and such issues as expansion of workers' insurance, minimum wage or sanitation systems lost credence.  The popular strategy remained focused on "Americanizing" immigrant workers and teaching white mothers how to take care of babies.  It is important to note that the Bureau chose not to address the horrifyingly high mortality rates among babies in families of color.  In the South, much of the public health campaigns were undertaken by African-American, Hispanic or black clubwomen working in their own segregated communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cash | first1 = Floris Loretta Barnett | title = African American women and social action: the clubwomen and volunteerism from Jim Crow to the New Deal, 1896-1936 | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 1997 | location = Westport, Conn. | isbn = 978-0-313-31563-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Neverdon-Morton | first1 = Cynthia | title = Afro-American Women of the South and the Advancement of the Race, 1895-1925 | publisher = Univ. of Tennessee Press | year = 1991 | location = Knoxville | isbn = 978-0-87049-684-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Salem | first1 = Dorothy C. | title = To better our world: Black women in organized reform, 1890-1920 | volume = 14 | work = Black women in United States History | publisher = Carlson Pub. | year = 1990 | location = Brooklyn, N.Y. | isbn = 978-0-926019-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 the [[Sheppard–Towner Act|Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Act]] became the first federally funded social welfare measure in the United States.&lt;ref name="Altenbaugh1999"/&gt; The law provided federal matching grants to the states for prenatal and child health clinics, visiting nurses for expectant and new mothers, distribution of information on nutrition and hygiene as well as midwife training. Contrary to Lathrop's original ideas, the final version of the law did not provide any financial aid or medical care.

The first 30 years of the twentieth century marked a transition between traditional social medicine that included the use of relatives or local midwives and the rise of a modern medical management of childbirth and childrearing by experts outside the family and home.&lt;ref name = Ladd-Taylor/&gt;{{rp|33}}  However, as the federal bureaucracy blossomed in the years after [[World War II]], the only agency focused solely on children lost its power and influence.

===Juvenile Justice===
As early as 1898, at the third Annual Illinois Conference on Charities, organized by the philanthropist [[Lucy Flower]] and Julia Lathrop, reformers called for a separate system of courts for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tanenhaus | first = David Spinoza | title = Juvenile Justice in the Making | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-516045-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lathrop's experience at the Hull House and as a Charities Board member had given her firsthand knowledge of the conditions for children in county poorhouses and jails.  Prior to the reform era, children over the age of seven were imprisoned with adults. Lathrop helped found the country's first juvenile court in 1899, and the Chicago Woman's Club established the Juvenile Court Committee (electing Lathrop as its first president in 1903) to pay the salaries of fifteen probation officers and run a detention home located at 625 West Adams Street.

By 1904, Julia Lathrop helped organize and then became the president of the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute. The director was psychologist William A. Healy who led scientific studies of the physical and mental health of the children, shifting away from the belief that environment alone was responsible for a child's delinquent behavior.  Together with members of the National Congress of Mothers Lathrop worked to organize a juvenile court movement nationally with justice law reformers such as Judge Ben Lindsey (who later chaired the National Conference of Charities and Correction's juvenile court subcommittee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clapp | first = Elizabeth Jane | title = Mothers of All Children: Women Reformers and the Rise of Juvenile Courts in Progressive Era America | publisher = Penn State Press | location = University Park, Penn. | date = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-271-01778-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
In 1918, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent Lathrop and [[Grace Abbott]] to represent the U.S. at an international conference on child welfare. There Lathrop consulted on the formation of a childcare bureau in the newly formed country of Czechoslovakia. After her retirement from the Children's Bureau in 1922, Lathrop became president of the Illinois [[League of Women Voters]]. She also helped form the National Committee of Mental Illness. In 1925 Lathrop represented the U.S. in Switzerland at the Child Welfare Committee established by the [[League of Nations]].

==Honors==
There is a residence hall at Rockford University and an elementary school in Rockford named after Lathrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.com/schoolfinder/us/illinois/rockford/julia-lathrop-elem-school/|title=School Information &amp; Ratings on SchoolFinder|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An intermediate school in Santa Ana, California also bears her name. Although a residence hall at Vassar College is named for  Dr. Edward Lathrop, a charter trustee, he was not  Julia's father. Julia's father was William Lathrop, a lawyer  and (briefly) a congressman, from Rockford, IL.   In 1938, the [[Chicago Housing Authority]] opened the  [[Julia C. Lathrop Homes]], a public housing project in the [[North Center, Chicago|North Center]] neighborhood on Chicago's north side.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">A '''kettle''' is a term that [[Birdwatching|birders]] use to describe a group of birds wheeling and circling in the air. The kettle may be composed of several different species at the same time. Nature photographer M. Timothy O'Keefe theorizes that the word derives from the appearance of birds circling tightly in a [[thermal|thermal updraft]] "like something boiling in a cauldron."&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, M. Timothy (1996). ''Seasonal Guide to the Natural Year'' Fulcrum Publishing. p.215.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ornithologist Donald Heintzelman has done more than anyone to popularize the term kettle, using the term at least as early as 1970 in his book ''Hawks of New Jersey'' to describe raptor flight, followed by uses in print over four decades.&lt;ref name="hawkreh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://veneryterms.blogspot.com/2014/05/cast-and-let-fly-kettle-of-hawks.html |author=Hurst, Richard E.|year=2014|title=Cast and Let Fly: A Kettle of Hawks |accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related terms "caldron" and "boil" are also heard to describe the same sorts of raptor behavior.&lt;ref name="hawkreh"/&gt; Osprey-watcher David Gessner, however, claims a Pennsylvania lowland called the Kettle ("der Kessel" in [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania Dutch]]), near [[Hawk Mountain]], is the source of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Gessner, [[David Gessner|David]] (2007). ''Soaring with Fidel: An Osprey Odyssey from Cape Cod to Cuba and Beyond'' Beacon Press. p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some species—e.g., the [[terns]] of [[Nantucket]]—kettling behavior is evidently a way of "staging" a flock in readiness for migration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mms.gov/offshore/PDFs/CWFiles/TernReport12-8-06.pdf Site Investigation Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtpc.org/offshore/audubonfinal.pdf Microsoft Word - audubonfinal.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-migrational [[turkey vultures]] kettle by the hundreds in the thermals that rise over [[Vancouver Island]] before they venture across the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] toward Washington State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourismvictoria.com/Content/EN/314.asp Migration Patterns&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  At Hawk Mountain, [[broad-winged hawk]]s form kettles in September before flying south.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Gerald M. and Daniel W. Brauning (2000). ''The Birds of Pennsylvania'' Cornell University Press. pp.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Kettling apparently serves as a form of avian communication—an announcement of imminent departure—as well as a way of gaining altitude and conserving strength.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23921">'''Landscape archaeology''' is the study of the ways in which people in the past constructed and used the environment around them. Landscape archaeology is inherently multidisciplinary in its approach to the study of culture, and is used by pre-historical, classic, and historic archaeologists. The key feature that distinguishes landscape archaeology from other archaeological approaches to sites is that there is an explicit emphasis on the sites' relationships between material culture, human alteration of land/cultural modifications to landscape, and the natural environment. The study of landscape archaeology (also sometimes referred to as the [[archaeology]] of the [[cultural landscape]]) has evolved to include how landscapes were used to create and reinforce [[social inequality]] and to announce one's [[social status]] to the community at large.

==Introduction==
[[Landscape]] generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings.&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;Branton, Nicole (2009) Landscape Approaches in Historical Archaeology: The Archaeology of Places. In International Handbook of Historic Archaeology, Majewski, Teresita and David Gaimster, eds. Springer:&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Natural landscape]]s are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;Hood, Edward J. (1996)  "Social Relations and the Cultural Landscape". In Landscape Archaeology:Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville:The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural landscapes, on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings).&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Spencer-Wood, Suzanne M. and Sherene Baugher. (2010) "Introduction to the Historical Archaeology of Powered Cultural Landscapes." International Journal of Historical Archaeology 14, pp. 463-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garden" /&gt;  As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;Gleason, Kathryn L. (1994). "To Bound and to Cultivate: An Introduction to the Archaeology of Gardens and Fields. In The Archaeology of Garden and Field. Miller, Naomi F. and Kathryn L. Gleason, eds. Philadelphia:University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Martin Seibert. [http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/guidance/NR_workshop_3-11-09/Archeol_and_landscapes_Erika.doc "Archaeology and Landscape"], Accessed December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton's statement: 
:"the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire", and "although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to [[settlement archaeology]] and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and spaces as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)".&lt;ref name="Nicole" /&gt;

The term space has commonly been used in place of cultural landscape to describe landscapes that are "produced or mediated by human behavior to elicit certain behaviors".&lt;ref name="James"&gt;Delle, James A.  (1998) An Archaeology of Social Space: Analyzing Coffee Plantations in Jamaica's Blue Mountains. Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Defined in this manner, archaeologists, such as Delle, have theorized space as composed of three components: the material, social, and cognitive.&lt;ref name="James" /&gt; Material space is any space that is created by people either through physical means or through the establishment of definitions, descriptions and rules of what a space is reserved for and how it should be used (Delle 1998:38). Social space is what dictates a person’s relationship with both others and the material space (Delle 1998:39).   Social space is how one uses their material space to interact with others and navigate throughout their world. Cognitive space is how people comprehend their social and material spaces—it is how people understand the world around them and identify appropriate ways of conducting themselves in the many different environments they may occupy (Delle 1998:38-9). Alternatively, the terms constructed, conceptualized, and ideational have been used to describe: the constructed ways in which people engage with their environments, meanings and interactions people place onto specific landscapes, and imagined and emotional perspectives individuals place with their landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, Bernard A. and Wendy Ashmore (1999). "Archaeological Landscapes: Constructed, Conceptualized, Ideational". In Archaeologies of Landscape. Ashmore, Wendy and A. Bernard Knapp, eds. Malden:Blackwell Publishers Inc: pp. 1-30.; 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of landscapes==
Many methods used to analyze archaeological sites are relevant to the analysis of landscapes. The archaeology of landscapes incorporates multiple research methods into its analysis in order to ensure that multiple sources of information are gathered; allowing for a sound interpretation of the site in question. These methods include [[pollen analysis]], [[Geographic Information Systems]], soil sampling, faunal analysis, ground penetrating radar, archival data (including maps and census data), and of course archaeological excavation methods.&lt;ref name="Baugher"&gt;Baugher, Sherene and Lu Ann De Cunzo. (2002) “Archaeological Perspectives on and Contributions to the Study of Colonial American Gardens.”  Landscape Journal 21.2-02&lt;/ref&gt;  Pollen, soil, faunal, and floral analysis allows the archaeologist to understand the natural vegetation of an area, vegetation that was actively grown by area settlers, and the animal life that also lived in the area. An understanding of the plant and animal life specific to an area can lead to, for example, an analysis of the types of food available to members of the community, an understanding of the actual diet typical for a subset of a population,&lt;ref&gt;McKee, Larry. (1999). "Food Supply and Plantation Social Order: An Archaeological Perspective." In I, Too, Am America: Archaeological Studies of African-American Life. Theresa A. Singleton, ed. Charlottesville:University Press of Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; and site and skeletal dating.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;  If landscape reconstruction and preservation, in particular, is a goal of an archaeological research project, pollen and soil analysis can aide in landscape archaeology to accurately interpret and reconstruct landscapes of the past (Schoenwetter pg 278).

Advances in survey technology have permitted the rapid and accurate analysis of wide areas, making the process an efficient way of learning more about the historic environment. Global Positioning System, remote sensing, archaeological geophysics, Total stations and digital photography, as well as [[Geographic information system|GIS]], have helped reduce the time and cost involved in such work.

* [[Geographic Information Systems]]
:Geographic Information Systems, commonly referred to as GIS, provides a way in which archaeologists can visually represent archaeological data, and can be done in two ways: data visualization and representative visualization.&lt;ref name="McCoy"&gt;McCoy, Mark D. and Thegn N. Ladefoged (2009). New Developments in the Use of Spatial Technology in Archaeology. Journal of Archaeological Research 17:pp.263-295.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Viewshed Analysis]] has aided in the archaeologists ability to study behavioral relationships between humans, their landscape, and material culture, in order to study migration, settlement patterns, and agency. Viewshed analysis also provides means with which archaeologists can recreate through an ability to recreate the line of sights possible from one point on a landscape and to situate a person within a defined landscape.&lt;ref name="McCoy" /&gt;
 
*[[Ground Penetrating Radar]]
*[[Global Positioning System]]
*[[remote sensing|Remote Sensing]]
*[[archaeological geophysics|Archaeological Geophysics]]
*[[Total station|Total Station]]
*Excavation
:[[Excavation (archaeology)|Site excavation]] has the potential to uncover building methods, such as the findings of [[posthole]]s (which can mark the previous existence of fence lines or other site boundaries), timber, stones, and/or brick that marks the existence of man-made structures.

:Archaeological [[Feature (archaeology)|feature]]s often leave [[Earthworks (Archaeology)|earthworks]] - signs of some type of modification to the natural environment that often appear as [[cropmark]]s, soil marks, or even as [[plough]] marks in fields that, if historical, can indicate cultivation methods of the past, or, particularly if more recent, can lift archaeological material to the surface and, therefore, ruin the [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphic layering]] of materials from youngest to oldest). Features can be discovered by archaeologists both through excavation and through [[Archaeological field survey|field survey]].
  
*[[Archive|Archival Data]] is used by any archaeologists that have any written texts available to them, and is used in a multiple number of ways, depending on the research project and objective of the research and the data available in the archives. Archives are often employed to confirm archaeological findings, to understand the construction of a site, settlement patterns,.
* Pollen Analysis
:[[Pollen analysis]] has allowed archaeologists to analyze vegetation selectively cultivated by area residents, the “native vegetation” of a particular area, and allow archaeologists to map out land use over time (which can be ascertained from weeds&lt;ref name="Kelso"&gt;Kelso, Gerald K. and Mary C. Beaudry (1990). Pollen Analysis and Urban Land Use: The Environs of Scottow's Dock in the 17th, 18th, and Early 19th Century Boston. Historical Archaeology 24(1):pp. 61;62;65;75&lt;/ref&gt;). But collecting a suitable sample is not all that easy. Failure to collect a suitable sample can be due in part to not sampling from areas where suitable pollen samples can be gathered (e.g. lakes and bogs, sites that were sufficiently exposed to air-borne pollen, sites that had both a long exposure to air and are deeply buried into the ground), or because pollen is vulnerable to destruction by the oxidation process or soil microbes such as bacteria and fungi, it negatively impacts an archaeologist’s ability to collect a suitable pollen sample.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, James E., Walter E. Klippel, and Rose Duffield (1975). Pollen Preservation and Archaeology in Eastern North America. American Antiquity 40(2):pp. 180-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Gerald K. Kelso and Mary C. Beaudry demonstrate how “…changes in the complex mosaic of microenvironments in metropolitan situations are sensitively recorded in the pollen contributions of weedy taxa”.&lt;ref name="Kelso" /&gt;  Arboreal pollen indicates regional vegetation, while non-arboreal indicates local vegetation. Both arboreal and non-arboreal pollen can be gathered and used in archaeological studies to support documentary and archaeological evidence of changes in land use—initial settlement, resettlement of area by other groups, and decline and abandonment of area—for example non-arboreal pollen can indicate the replacement of vegetation native to a region within the United States by vegetation native to places in Europe, or to the clearance of large areas that would be expected to make way for cities and towns.&lt;ref name="Kelso" /&gt;

==Inequality, archaeology, landscape==

Within the discipline of historical archaeology, specifically within the [[United States]], landscape archaeology initially gained prominence with efforts to preserve the homes and gardens of prominent North American figures (see George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] and Thomas Jefferson's [[Monticello]]), the reconstruction of early colonial settlements (see [[Colonial Williamsburg]]) and the analysis of [[gardens]] (see [[Annapolis]]). Archaeologists studying the aforementioned, and other colonial sites throughout the United States, have excavated the gardens of wealthy men and women in order to reconstruct and ascertain the function of these gardens in colonial life. Scholars analyzing the colonial gardens have noticed that gardens were designed in a neat and orderly fashion, displaying symmetry and inspired by Baroque and Renaissance styles (this style is often described as indicative of a "Georgian Worldview" that became popular during the 17th and 18th centuries).&lt;ref name="Baugher" /&gt; Many interpretations have been advanced to explain the function of these gardens. Beginning in the mid-1700s, wealthy elites began to construct large, stately homes and neat, ordered gardens with the guise of mapping superiority and exclusive knowledge onto the landscape.&lt;ref name="Baugher" /&gt;  Although the Baroque and Renaissance styles were out of date by the time elites in the United States employed them, this was intentionally done to communicate a knowledge and appreciation of British history that few within the community would have access to.&lt;ref name="Baugher"/&gt;  Archaeologists have concluded that the symmetrical, geometric, designs of garden-scapes adopted by colonists in the mid eighteenth to nineteenth centuries made use of "...converging and diverging lines of sight to manipulate the relationship between distance and focal point", making objects appear larger or further away than they really were.&lt;ref name="wye"&gt;Leone, Mark P, James M. Harmon, Jessica L. Neuwirth. (2005).  "Perspective and Surveillance in Eighteenth-Century Maryland Gardens, including William Paca's Garden on Wye Island. In Historical Archaeology, Vol. 39, No.4, pp.140.&lt;/ref&gt;  These optical illusions functioned to transform the home into a readily identifiable status symbol, and to mark the owners and occupants of these homes as socially distinct from others within the colonial community.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;Yentsch, Anne Elizabeth. (1996) "Introduction: Close Attention to Place--Landscape Studies by Historical Archaeologists". In ''Landscape Archaeology''. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stately homes and gardens constructed by the colonial elite also served to assert authority and to naturalize a social hierarchy onto the colonial landscape.&lt;ref name="Anne" /&gt;  Such analysis and interpretations are neo-marxist in its approach to the understanding and interpreting landscapes of the past.

Stephen A. Mrozwoski has extended the conclusions drawn from the archaeological analysis of elite homes and pleasure gardens into the analysis of the developing middle and working class landscapes and ideologies among industrial communities, noting “in the urban context economies of scale realized through spatial practice also contributed to a social landscape that between the eighteenth and early twentieth centuries was increasingly constructed along class lines”&lt;ref name= "Stephen"&gt;Mrozowski, Stephen A. (2006). The Archaeology of Class in Urban America. Cambridge:Cambridge University Press., pg 16;113&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrate the ways in which the elite constructed their industrial landscapes that worked to restrict perceived amoral behaviors (e.g. drinking, smoking) and to maintain an orderly landscape 97. The landscape also provided an area where "values like orderliness, gentility, and abstinence were important elements of a middle-class culture that, while subject to variability, was nevertheless part of daily existence."&lt;ref name="Stephen" /&gt;

Historical archaeologists have incorporated [[Foucauldian]] theories into the understanding of plantation landscapes. On plantation sites throughout the [[Americas]], plantation owners utilized surveillance methods to restrict the behaviors of the enslaved populations. James A. Delle notes that surveillance was often incorporated into the plantation landscape, noting “the planter class who designed the estate landscapes actively constructed plantation spaces…as an active part of their strategy of social control” and power.&lt;ref name="Delle"&gt;Delle, James A. (1999) The Landscapes of Class Negotiation on Coffee Plantations in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica: 1790-1850. Historical Archaeology 33(1): 136-158. Pp. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  This was largely done through architectural techniques such as incorporating positions where [[panoptic]] views can be achieved into the construction of planters and/or overseers homes&lt;ref name="wye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Delle" /&gt; or by constructing slave villages that were in the plain view or line of sight of the homes of the overseer and/or plantation owner.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Douglas V, and Kenneth G. Kelly (2000). Settlement Patterns and the Origins of African Jamaican Society: Seville Plantation, St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica. Ethnohistory 47(2): 369-394.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists have pointed out that, although home spaces are generally considered to have become increasingly gendered; it is erroneous to assume that only women occupied the private (home) sphere and men the public.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, Deborah L. and Michael S. Nassaney (1997). Class, Gender, and the Built Environment: Deriving Social Relations from Cultural Landscapes in Southwest Michigan. Historical Archaeology 31(2), pp. 42-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  For more extensive information on this topic, see [[Household Archaeology]].

Barbara Voss has done extensive archaeological work to reveal how ideas about [[gender]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[marriage]], and [[ethnic]]/[[racial]] intermarriage were mapped onto the landscape of Spanish Colonial mission sites in California (El Presidio de San Francisco). Voss’ interpretations reveal the lived trauma that is often concealed by popular, romanticized, narratives of relationships established through colonial contact between indigenous peoples and Spanish colonizers&lt;ref name="Voss"&gt;Voss, Barbara L. (2008). Domesticating Imperialism: Sexual Politics and the Archaeology of Empire. American Anthropologist 110(2), pp. 191-203.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission landscape became physical and conceptualized space where two genders (male/female) and heterosexuality were to be explicitly expressed and reinforced.&lt;ref name="Voss" /&gt;

Landscape Archaeology has been useful in the analysis of cultural identities that developed among social and racial groups. It has been argued that the existence and continued use of yard spaces among Black Americans (along with other African-derived practices observed in the Americas) is proof of a distinct, new world, cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppel, Timothy, Jessica Neuwirth, Mark P. Leone, and Gladys-Marie Fry (2003). Hidden in view: African spiritual spaces in North American landscapes. Antiquity 77 (296): pp. 321-335.&lt;/ref&gt; One feature that appears to be widespread throughout the [[African diaspora]] is the significant importance of [[Yard (land)|yard spaces]] in the everyday lives of African-Americans. Sidney W. Mintz, in describing the “house-and-yard pattern” among African-American [[peasants]] residing in the [[Caribbean]], explains “…the house, particularly among poorer peasants, is not important in itself as a material representation (i.e. material culture/artifacts) of the domestic group or family”.&lt;ref name="mintz"&gt;Mintz, Sidney W. (1974). Caribbean Transformations. Chicago: Aldine Publishing Company, Pp.249, 244&lt;/ref&gt; Mintz further states that while the house “…is usually used mainly for sleeping and for storing clothing and other articles of personal value” the yard is where “…children play, the washing is done, the family relaxes, and friends are entertained”.&lt;ref name="mintz" /&gt;

Richard Westmacott, [[Barbara J. Heath]] and Amber Bennett have echoed Mintz’s statements about the use of yards among African-Americans in their accounts of present day and past African-American communities. Richard Westmacott provides an extensive ethnographic account of the role gardens and yards play in the lives of African Americans in the southern region of the United States in his book African-American Gardens and Yards in the Rural South. Westmacott provides a clear definition of the yard, defining it as a place where leisure activities and artistic expression often take place&lt;ref name="West"&gt;Westmacott, Richard (1992) African-American Gardens and Yards in the Rural South. Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Heath and Bennett describe the yard as a space in which “…food production and preparation, care and maintenance of animals, domestic chores, storage, recreation, and aesthetic enjoyment” often occur at.&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;Heath, Barbara J. and Amber Bennett (2000). "The little Spots allow'd them": The Archaeological Study of African-American Yards. Historical Archaeology 34(2):38-55.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the yard as an important and integral aspect of a home appears to be an element that many west African cultures hold, which indicates that the function of the yard within African-American households may be a facet of west African cultures that was maintained in the New World, as well as a cultural aspect that aided in the development of African American identities in the Americas.&lt;ref name="West" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heath" /&gt;

Similarly, Mrozowski’s study of rear yards associated with the Boott Mill boardinghouses and tenements that housed workers revealed that these yards mainly served practical functions and were not primarily used to grow foodstuffs, and may not have served an integral part in the daily lives of the low-wage workers hired (99-100). Mrozowski also argues that yards also represented social distance and distinctiveness between socio-economic classes of people, due to the particular placement, use, and overall function.  "The result was a landscape that created social distance between the agents and the workers who lived only a few feet away. It also represents a significant transformation in the urban space. The ornamental yards of the agent's house and overseers' block signal an important shift in the type of urban space being produced and the manner in which it was utilized."

The '''Manú Learning Centre''' ('''MLC''') is located within the [[Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]], a 643 hectare private [[nature reserve]], encompassed within the cultural zone of the [[Manú National Park|Manú Biosphere Reserve]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]] and one of the largest protected areas in [[Peru]]. It is home to a variety of [[tropical rainforest|rainforest types]] including lowland Andean, pre-montane, bamboo and high terrace forests. This geographical complexity creates habitats for a diversity of [[Rainforest#Flora and fauna|flora and fauna]].  The MLC is operated by the [[#CREES|CREES]] group, a non-profit and business collaboration working towards sustainability for the Manú Region.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/pdf/Manu.pdf | title = Manu National Park | accessdate = 2009-03-19 | last = UNEP | first = | date = 2008-09-20 | format = PDF | publisher = http://www.unep-wcmc.org | pages = 1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLC serves local schools and communities as well as international researchers and [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.  It has hosted workshops for the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]], and on behalf of the Manú National Park Guards, as well as research projects from the [[University of Oxford]], [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]], and [[Glasgow University]] in addition to the [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]].  The MLC has also worked alongside schools from the UK including [[Southbank International School]] and [[Tonbridge School]].

==History==
The MLC was built in 2004 on an abandoned [[hacienda]], the first to be developed in the region.  The initial concept was to demonstrate that it was possible to use novel land use techniques to rehabilitate large areas of degraded land and to empower and educate local communities throughout this process.  There is a large body of work that had been completed at the MLC incorporating aspects of [[biology]], [[geography]], [[zoology]], [[anthropology]], [[tropical agriculture]], [[politics]], and [[art]]. Specific projects have focused on [[reforestation]], mammal behaviour patterns, [[ecological footprint|human impact studies]], environmental management, monitoring of the [[blue headed macaw]] ([[CITES|CITES Red listed]]), [[Agricultural soil science#Soil Preservation|soil &amp; agricultural sustainability]], [[forest dynamics]], carbon offsetting, and the legitimacy of local power structures to name a handful.

==CREES==
CREES (Conservation, Research &amp; Education towards Environmental Sustainability) was established in 2003 prior to the construction of the MLC and the creation of Fundo Mascoitania. It is the only organisation to be in operation within the Manú region of Peru who regularly consults with local populations about their development priorities and leads the consequential local development projects.

==Access==
[[Image:Alto Madre from MLC.jpg|thumb|300px|The Alto Madre de Dios River from the Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]The MLC is accessible from [[Cusco]] by road until Atalaya and then by [[Launch(boat)|lancha]] until the port at the MLC.  During the [[dry season]] boats may not be able to navigate the river from Atalaya in which case transport is needed up until the Aguanos settlement on the opposite side of the [[Madre de Dios River|Alto Madre de Dios River]].  Crossing is then possible by raft or by lancha.

==Biodiversity and wildlife==
[[Image:Tropical Tree frog MLC.JPG|thumb|300px|Frog found in Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]

'''[[Clay lick#Clay licks|Macaw Collpa]]'''

The MLC reserve attracts an array of parrots and macaws thanks to the spectacular clay mineral lick, or [[Clay lick#Clay licks|Collpa]] carved out by the Alto Madre de Dios river. This collpa is the only one of its type in the zone, and is visited daily by hundreds of colourful and noisy parrots and macaws, the most notable of these being the Blue Headed Macaw. These in turn draw raptors such as the ornate hawk eagle and crested eagle.

'''Mammal Collpa'''

The MLC boasts two large mammal collpas which attracts smaller mammals as well as large groups of white-lipped peccary and their natural Jaguar predators.

'''Wildlife Monitoring Array'''

The MLC's wildlife monitoring array was established in 2005. The array comprises a 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; monitoring grid mapped using GPS.  It provides a quantified area in which researchers can complete research on plants, animals and birds.

MIMS is formed by inner-shell electrons that are normally resistant to molecular formation.  However, in stellar conditions, the inner-shell electrons become reactive to form molecular structures (MIMS) from combinations of all elements in the periodic table.  
 
MIMS upon dissociation can emit x-ray photons with energies up to 100 keV at extremely high conversion efficiencies from compression energy to photon energy.  MIMS is predicted to exist and dominate radiation processes in extreme astrophysical environments, such as large planet cores, star interiors, and [[black hole]] and [[neutron star]] surroundings. There, MIMS is predicted to enable highly energy-efficient transformation of the stellar compression energy into the radiation energy.

The right schematic illustration shows the proposed four stages of the K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) formation and x-ray generation process.  Stage I: Individual atoms are subjected to the stellar compression and ready for absorbing the compression energy.  Stage II: The outer electron shells fuse together under increasing "stellar" pressure.    Stage III: At the peak pressure, via pressure ionization K-shell orbits form the K-MIMS, which is vibrationally hot and encapsulated by a Rydberg-like pseudo-L-Shell structure.  Stage IV: The K-MIMS cools down by ionizing ("boiling-off") a number of pseudo-L-shell electrons and subsequent optical decay by emitting an x-ray photon.  The dissociated atoms return their original atoms states and are ready for absorbing the compression energy.

MIMS also can be readily produced in laboratory and industrial environments, such as hypervelocity particle impact, [[laser fusion]] and [[z-machine]]. MIMS can be exploited for highly energy-efficient production of high intensity x-ray beams for a wide range of innovative applications, such as [[photolithography]], [[x-ray lasers]], and [[inertial fusion]].

==History==

The inner-shell-bound metastable quasimolecules were proposed to exist in the x-ray generating scattering process since the work by Mott in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  The existence of high energy quasimolecules in highly compressed matter (or strongly coupled plasma) was theoretically predicted in the ab initio quantum calculation by Younger et al. in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  In 2008, from the

To search for many-body effects in the highly compressed stellar materials, Bae and his colleagues at BNL generated and studied such materials by impacting various bio and water [[nanoparticle]] at hypervelocities (v~100&amp;nbsp;km/s) on various targets.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In their study, anomalous signals were discovered, when the nanoparticles were directly impacted on and detected by Si particle detectors that had windows sufficiently thick enough to block the penetration of the nanoparticles completely. By exploiting the discovered anomalous signals, the feasibility of generating highly compressed "stellar" matter at shock pressures on the order of 10 TPa (100 Mbar) with the nanoparticle impact in a non-destructive laboratory setup was proven.  However, the nature of the signals and the underlying physics of their generation mechanism had not been understood for 15 years.

It was not until 2008 that Bae was able to unlock the mystery of the anomalous BNL signals owing to emerging sciences of the stellar materials.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal

Further, Bae discovered that the observed energy conversion efficiency via MIMS from the nanoparticle kinetic energy to the radiation energy was as high as 40%, thus proposed that MIMS can enable a new generation of ultra-high efficiency compact x-ray generators.

The result also demonstrated the potential of scaling up of x-ray generation with nanoparticle impact by exploiting C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, of which currents can be readily scaled up to an industrial quantity in a tabletop apparatus.

After extensive analyses and theoretical modeling of these data, which involve a wide range of elements in the periodic table, a successful integration of the data into the frame of the unified MIMS model was demonstrated. Thereby, the MIMS model was firmly established and confirmed for any combinations of all elements in the periodic table.

Specifically, the extensive analyses&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; of the data that relate to hard x-ray generating collisions have resulted in a universal law (Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–dependency) of the binding energy of the homonucleus MIMS bound by K-shell electrons (K-MIMS).  Here Z is the atomic number of the constituent atoms of the K-MIMS.  Bae further developed a unified theory to elucidate the Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent behavior of the homonucleus K-MIMS, which behaves much like the helium excimer molecule: He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The MIMS theory also predicted a 1/Z dependency law for the bond length of the homonucleus K-MIMS.  Based on the MIMS theory the uranium K-MIMS, for example, is predicted to have a 100 times smaller bond length, a 2,000 times larger binding energy, and a 5,000 times larger characteristic x-ray energy than the He excimer molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huber|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The predicted bond lengths of the bismuth and uranium K-MIMS are in excellent agreement with that estimated from the experimental results by researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal

In typical environment, the ground state of rare gas atom dimers is electronically non-binding, but if their closed outershell electrons are excited, dimers can readily form transient bound molecules, excimers.  For example, the ground [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] state (1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1sσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is electronically repulsive, but excitation of an electron can lead to Rydberg states (for example, the metastable, 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1sσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;2sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;: a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) with the He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title =Excimers |last = Birks|first = J.B.|journal = [[Reports on Progress in Physics]]|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |date = 1975|issue = 38|page = 903}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The low-lying metastable excited states of the dimer (the He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excimer) are strongly covalently bound.   The metastable excimer can radiate to the free repulsive ground state.

The excimer formation is a critical step in energy-efficient conversion of the atomic electron excitation/ionization energy into the radiation energy in rare gas plasma for the excimer lasers. Without forming the excimers, the energy of the excited atoms would be rapidly lost by non-radiative collisional decay processes in the high pressure environment.  In other words, the excimer formation is a crucial step needed for efficient transformation of the atomic excitation energy to the radiation energy in an ultra-high pressure environment.  Analogously, the MIMS formation is a crucial step required for efficiently transforming the atomic core-excitation energy into the radiation energy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

[[File:K-MIMS binding energy - Z2 Fitting-New.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|K-MIMS binding energy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;]]

Based on the MIMS model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; a schematic potential curve was proposed for the K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) and illustrated in the right figure. In the "electronically-cold" highly compressed plasma, a K-shell core ion with a hole, [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;], collides with another core ion without a hole, [K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;], to form a near-dissociative K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) and its excess energy transforms into the vibration energy.  Such a vibrationally hot K-MIMS in the plasma is denoted here by &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Subsequently, a Rydberg-like pseudo-L-shell forms around the K-MIMS core ions that are proposed to go through a rapid relaxation into the lowest vibrational state by ionizing a number of electrons in the pseudo-L-shell.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The vibrationally cold K-MIMS without an L-shell hole is denoted by [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;].   The vibrational energy is quenched by ionizing the bound [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;] MIMS into a higher ionic state [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;] with n holes in the pseudo-L-shell, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 8.  Because the n holes can be distributed among 2s and 2p orbits, thus the maximum value of n is 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1235049|title = Vibrational autoionization in polyatomic molecules|last = Pratt|first = S.T.|journal = [[Annual Review of Physical Chemistry]] |date = 2005|pages = 281–308|volume = 56 |doi=10.1146/annurev.physchem.56.092503.141204 |pmid=15796702|bibcode = 2005ARPC...56..281P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statistically distributed K-MIMS decays into the lower L-shell MIMS (L-MIMS), [K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;],
by emitting an x-ray photon, and subsequently the L-MIMS dissociates into two atomic ions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Based on the previously proposed MIMS model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; a wide range of the K-MIMS  binding energies were extracted from the extensive ranges of experimental data from He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* excimer to UAu* MIMS (for 2 ≤ Z ≤ 92). The right shows these data plotted against the constituent atom atomic number Z.  The lowest bound state (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* excimer has a binding energy of 1.96 eV, which is plotted in the right figure. These data are plotted against Z in the figure.

The overall data trend shows a Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dependency. Overall fitting is excellent, thus indicates that the K-MIMS can be modeled with a He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*-like excimer with core K-shell ions with an atomic number Z to the first order. Note that the binding energies are about one order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding K-shell satellite x-ray energies, which follow the (Z-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dependency of the [[Moseley's law]].

[[File:K-MIMS Bond Length-New.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|K-MIMS bond length.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;]]

An intuitive analytical theory has been developed and is presented here to illuminate the universal Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent behavior of K-MIMS by Bae. In this theory, the homologous molecular characteristics of K-MIMS is proposed to be primarily determined by the 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonding molecular orbit of the homologous core molecular ion under the assumption that other effects of surrounding electrons and atoms can be considered as a minor perturbation.  The quantum characteristics of excimer can be described by a stable core molecular ion surrounded by Rydberg-like electron orbits.  The lowest metastable electronic state of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1sσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;2sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, thus the proposed K-MIMS model should have a similar molecular orbital.  In this case the bonding of K-MIMS is expected to be primarily dominated by the 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital.  Intuitively, the 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital can be approximated in the frame of the [[LCAO]] model by a linear combination of the two 1s atomic orbitals, of which size is proportional to 1/Z.  Therefore, the K-MIMS size, thus the bond length, is predicted to be proportional to 1/Z.  Therefore, to the first order the K-MIMS bond length is predicted to be proportional to 1/Z.   The right figure shows the predicted K-MIMS bond length as a function of the constituent atom atomic number, Z.  The bond length of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is ~1.05 A, and the solid line represents a 1/Z curve that is extrapolated from the bond length of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

Currently, there is no other direct experimental data or theoretical results on the bond length of the K-MIMS.  However, in the recent work by Mokler's group,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; the sizes of quasimolecules were estimated from the x-ray cross-section enhancement of both projectile x-rays and target x-rays in H-like ion impact.   The enhancement was interpreted to result from an extensive K-K electron sharing (transition of a hole) between the projectile and target ions due to the quasimolecule effect during the collision.  Based on the K-MIMS theory as illustrated in the right figure, the K-K sharing distance can approximate the K-MIMS bond length.  The two data points are the K-K sharing distances of U&lt;sup&gt;91+&lt;/sup&gt; ion impact on Au and Bi&lt;sup&gt;82+&lt;/sup&gt; ion impact on Au, which were estimated from the cross sections.  The Z values were approximated by the (Z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; +Z&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)/2, where Z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the atomic number of the projectile ion and Z&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is that of the target atom.  The predicted 1/Z curve is in excellent agreement with these data points as shown in the right figure.

MIMS can be also formed with two different elements.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal

Based on [[Equation of state|Equation of State]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (EOS) of materials,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; it can be predicted that pressures required to form homonucleus L-shell MIMS are on the order of 100 Mbar (10 TPa), while homonucleus K-shell MIMS on the order of 10 – 100 Gbar (1,000 – 10,000 TPa).  Pressures required to form heteronucleus MIMS are predicted to be considerably smaller than that for homonucleus MIMS.

===Quasimolecules in heavy ion collisions===

In the field of x-ray generation by heavy ion impact on solids, the search for the x-ray signatures of the inner-shell-bound quasimolecule in the x-ray generating scattering process can be traced down to the work by Mott in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On the Theory of Excitation by Collision with Heavy Particles|last = Mott|first = N.F.|journal = [[Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1017/s0305004100009816|pmid = |pages = 553|date = 1931|volume = 27|issue = 4|bibcode = 1931PCPS...27..553M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The quasimolecule can be considered as a collisional complex that is a manifestation of MIMS during collision processes.  However, the actual experimental searches for such x-ray signatures of the quasimolecule in x-ray generation in heavy ion impact started much later, in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One of the primary motivations of these researches was to explore a super-heavy quasimolecule/quasiatom with a combined atomic number exceeding 100, which was predicted to behave like a transuranium atom in the united atom frame.

In the early heavy ion collision researches, the cross-sections for carbon K x-ray production were measured for a wide range of ions incident on a carbon target, at energies from 20 to 80 keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =  |last = Der|display-authors = etal|first = R.C.|title =Production of carbon characteristic x-rays by heavy-ion bombardment |journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.21.1731|pmid = |date = 1968|pages = 1731–1732|volume = 21|issue = 26|bibcode = 1968PhRvL..21.1731D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon Kα x-ray generation cross sections for the heavy ions, such as Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Xe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, were discovered to be several orders of magnitude larger than those by light ions, such as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which were consistent with the values predicted by the direct Coulomb scattering theory.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  The anomalous cross sections for heavy ions were qualitatively interpreted in terms of the electron-promotion mechanism of the molecular orbital theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Interpretation of Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - Ar collisions |last = Fano|first = U.|journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.14.627|pmid = |last2 = Lichten|first2 = W.|date = 1965|volume = 14|issue = 16 |pages = 627–629|bibcode = 1965PhRvL..14..627F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his papers, Bae proposed that the production of the shocked regions that are able to bear abundant MIMS by the heavy ion impacts as in the nanoparticle impact&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; can be another major factor for the observed x-ray yield enhancement.

More importantly, there had been extensive theoretical and experimental researches on intense K-shell satellites above the Kα line of various solids that were bombarded by heavy ions with kinetic energies on the order of 10 MeV.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In the researches, the K-shell satellites were interpreted to result from radiative decays of atoms with multiple holes, one of which is in the K-shell and others in the L-shell.  Striking differences between the satellite spectra obtained with light ions, such as electrons and protons, and the spectra with heavy ions were discovered.  In addition to the intensity difference, the x-ray spectra obtained with heavy ions showed many more peaks with multiple L-shell holes than those with light ions.  The x-ray energies of the satellites were consistent with those obtained by the ab initio calculations based on the atomic model x-ray emissions that involve varying number of L-shell holes.  However, the satellite data for larger number of L-shell holes significantly deviated from the calculation results.  Based on the MIMS model, the x-ray satellite structures are now understood to result from the interaction between the vibrational state of K-MIMS and the L-shell electron ionization channels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Younger's quasimolecules===
Overall, Younger et al.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1233866|title = Quantum calculations of the electronic structures of a many-atom plasma |last = Younger|display-authors = etal|first = S.M.|journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.61.962|pmid = 10039479|date = 1988|volume = 61|issue = 8 |pages = 962–965|bibcode = 1988PhRvL..61..962Y |format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the possibility of forming transient molecular states with closed-shell electrons in ab initio calculations for the first time for frozen or slow moving ion systems that can be approximated with the [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4604">In [[ethology]], the '''nasty neighbour effect''' describes the phenomenon whereby territory-holding animals behave more strongly toward familiar [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] neighbours than to unfamiliar conspecifics.  This phenomenon may be generally advantageous to an animal because the heightened response reduces the likelihood of a nearby intruder entering the territory and taking the resources it contains whereas an unfamiliar or distant territory-holder poses less of a threat.  This reduced response minimises the time, energy and risk of injury incurred during territorial encounters with animals which are less of a threat to the territory holder.  The nasty neighbour effect is the converse of the '''[[dear enemy effect]]''' in which some species are less aggressive towards their neighbours than towards unfamiliar strangers. 

The striped mouse (''[[Rhabdomys]] pumilio'') is group living with one single breeding male and up to four communally breeding females per group. Groups typically contain several [[philopatric]] adult sons (and daughters) that are believed not to breed in their natal group and all group members participate in territorial defence.  When aggression in wild group-living male breeders was tested in a neutral test arena, they were nearly five times more aggressive towards their neighbours than towards strangers, leading to the prediction that neighbours are the most important competitors for paternity. Using a molecular parentage analysis it was shown that 28% of offspring are sired by neighbouring males and only 7% by strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Schradin, C., Schneider, C. and Lindholm, A.K., (2010).  The nasty neighbour in the striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) steals paternity and elicits aggression. Frontiers in Zoology, 7: 19. DOI:10.1186/1742-9994-7-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonies of the [[weaver ant]] (''Oecophylla smaragdina'') are able to recognize a greater proportion of workers from neighbouring colonies as non-colony members.  When recognized as non-colony members, more aggression is exhibited toward neighbours than non-neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Newey, P.S., Robson, S.K. and Crozier, R.H., (2010).  Weaver ants Oecophylla smaragdina encounter nasty neighbors rather than dear enemies.  Ecology, 91(8):2366-72&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Banded mongoose]] (''Mungos mungo'') groups vocalize more and inspect more scent samples in response to olfactory cues of neighbours than strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, C.A. and Manser, M.B., (2007). ‘Nasty neighbours’ rather than ‘dear enemies’ in a social carnivore. Proc. R. Soc. B., 274: 959-965&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that increased aggression towards neighbours is more common in social species with intense competition between neighbours, as opposed to reduced aggression towards neighbours typical for most solitary species.  Furthermore, animals may respond in this way when encounters with intruders from non-neighboring colonies are rare and of little consequence.

Female [[New Zealand bellbird]]s (''Anthornis melanura'') are more aggressive toward the songs of neighbouring females, indicating that neighbouring females pose a greater threat than strangers in this species.&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, D.H., Evans, B., Cope, T. and Ji, W., (2008).  A test of the dear enemy hypothesis in female New Zealand bellbirds (Anthornis melanura): female neighbors as threats. Behavioral Ecology, 19 (4): 791-798. DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arn027 [http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/arn027v1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Female [[hen harriers]] (''Circus cyaneus'') responses towards neighbours are more intense, mostly flights rather than calls, than responses towards female floaters (individuals without territories), which in turn were more intense than responses towards male floaters.&lt;ref&gt;Temeles, E.J., (1990). Northern harriers on feeding territories respond more aggressively to neighbours than to floaters. Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 26:57–63. DOI: 10.1007/BF00174025&lt;/ref&gt;

==No effect==
Guinea baboon (''Papio papio'') males which live in social groups called "gangs" do not differ in their response behaviour toward neighbouring and stranger males, and largely ignore any non-gang member, irrespective of familiarity; that is, they neither show a “dear enemy” nor “nasty neighbour” effect.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej, P., Patzelt, A., Ndao, I., Hammerschmidt, K. and Julia Fischer, J., (2013).  Social monitoring in a multilevel society: a playback study with male Guinea baboons. Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 67(1): 61–68. DOI: 10.1007/s00265-012-1425-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Engineering Laboratory''' ('''NEL''') was originally one of several large government-funded public research laboratories in the UK, staffed by scientists and engineers of the [[British Civil Service|Scientific Civil Service]].  Other such laboratories include the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL), the [[Laboratory of the Government Chemist]] (LGC), the [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) and the [[Transport Research Laboratory|Transport Research Establishment]] (TRL).

NEL was established in 1948 at [[Thorntonhall]] under the name Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory (MERL), in the village of the same name near [[East Kilbride]], Glasgow, Scotland.   The location was partly dictated by politics, since it was realised that Scotland did not have a UK public research establishment (in contrast to its [[Military of Scotland#Sensitive establishments|defence establishments]]).  There was also debate on whether the new laboratory would be an outpost of the prestigious NPL (which now has its main base in Teddington, just west of London), or have a separate identity.  Eventually the latter course was taken with the new laboratory focussing on mechanical engineering research, complementing the work of the then [[CEGB]] laboratories in [[electrical engineering]] when the name was changed to NEL.

As NEL expanded, it moved to a large, purpose-built site in East Kilbride itself.  Under the control of the Director, it was then part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]]. The 'lab' was organised into a number of subject-based divisions, including Creep Division, an important part of the UK effort to catalogue wear characteristics of materials, a Control Systems Division, Manufacturing Services Division, Fluid Power Division and Design Analysis Division.   The last of these was in the forefront in the use of the emerging technology of [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA).   Indeed, the growing need for quality-assurance in FEA led to the foundation of the ''National Agency for Finite Element Methods and Standards'', now operating simply as [[NAFEMS]].

Each building at NEL was named after a prominent engineer whose field was related to the focus of that division, so there was Maudsley Building, named after [[Henry Maudslay]], famous for his invention of the [[slide-rest lathe]] amongst many other achievements, Bramah Building so called after [[Joseph Bramah]] owing to his contribution to hydraulic engineering, Rankine Building named after [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] which specialised in [[thermodynamics]], Whitworth Building named after [[Joseph Whitworth]] immortalised after his work to unify standards for screw threads, one of the key stepping stones that paved the way for mass production.

The policy of the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] Government was originally for the full [[privatisation]] of all of the government laboratories and the dismantling of NEL was undertaken by [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|Lord Young]]. In practice, re-organisation has in some cases stopped short of a straight sale of these internationally important facilities, but NEL became part of the German-owned [[TÜV SÜD]] group in 1995. Along with the other national laboratories, some of which are still owned or controlled by the UK government, NEL now has a mixed portfolio of work from both government and private sectors. NEL holds the national standard for flow measurement, one of the most important roles it undertakes as part of the overall UK government science strategy.  This is now in the remit of the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]], working in part through the new [[National Measurement Office]], which is itself an Executive Agency created in April 2009.

==Engineering apprenticeships==

NEL operated an [[indentured]] apprentice training scheme and offered a wide range of skills for young engineers before being privatised ranging between light machining, heavy machining, fitting, electro-discharge-machining, jig and horizontal boring and in later years CNC machining, programming and introductions to FMS ([[flexible manufacturing system]]) and [[CAD/CAM]] facilities running KCurve on DEC/VAX mini computers. This work commenced around 1982-6 using raster scan, (green) monitors to visualise the programming, each known as workstations, (since the 'intelligence' was built into the desk, not the monitor) and the CAD CAM programs were still printed out on punched paper to be transferred in some cases into onboard RAM and in others read and implemented sequentially. Machines in use in the CAD / CAM department were Matchmaker 7000M vertical mill, Norton Variant with Fanuc control, Cincinnati horizontal mill that had (then) been recently retrofitted with Gould drives.

==Notable Directors==

'''Phyletic dwarfism''' is the decrease in average size of animals of a species.
There are a few circumstances that often lead to species doing this.
Lack of [[Predation|predators]] of smaller creatures can allow smaller members of a species to survive.
The lack of resources to sustain a large population of larger animals can pick off the largest specimens.
Available resources being more beneficial for smaller creatures can also do so.

These circumstances are common on islands, making [[insular dwarfism]] the most common form of phyletic dwarfism. Examples of this are the [[Island fox|Channel Island fox]], extinct [[dwarf elephant]]s of Crete, and ''[[Brookesia micra]]'', a minuscule chameleon from Madagascar. An noninsular example is the evolution of dwarfed [[Callitrichidae|marmosets and tamarins]] among New World monkeys.&lt;ref name="Perelman"&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Plant perception''' is the ability of [[plant]]s to sense and respond to the environment to adjust their [[plant morphology|morphology]], [[plant physiology|physiology]], and [[phenotypic plasticity|phenotype]] accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trewavas A | title = Green plants as intelligent organisms | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 413–9 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16054860 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2005.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other disciplines such as [[plant physiology]], [[plant ecology|ecology]] and [[molecular biology]] are used to assess this ability.

==Processes==

===Detection===
Displacement can be detected by plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaffe MJ, Forbes S | title = Thigmomorphogenesis: the effect of mechanical perturbation on plants | journal = Plant Growth Regulation | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–24 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 11541741 | doi = 10.1007/BF00027213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Populus|Poplar]] stems can detect reorientation and inclination ([[equilibrioception]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Azri W, Chambon C, Herbette S, Brunel N, Coutand C, Leplé JC, Ben Rejeb I, Ammar S, Julien JL, Roeckel-Drevet P | title = Proteome analysis of apical and basal regions of poplar stems under gravitropic stimulation | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 136 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–208 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19453506 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3054.2009.01230.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathway signals===
Wounded tomatoes are known to produce the volatile odour [[methyl jasmonate]] as an alarm signal.&lt;ref name="farmer1990"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farmer EE, Ryan CA | title = Interplant communication: airborne methyl jasmonate induces synthesis of proteinase inhibitors in plant leaves | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 19 | pages = 7713–6 | date = October 1990 | pmid = 11607107 | pmc = 54818 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbouring plants can then
detect the chemical and prepare for the attack by producing chemicals that defend against insects or attract predators.&lt;ref name="farmer1990"/&gt;

Plants systematically use [[Plant hormone|hormonal]] [[signalling pathway]]s to coordinate their own [[Plant development|development]] and morphology.

====Neurochemicals====
Plants produce several proteins found in the animal neuron systems such as [[acetylcholine esterase]], [[glutamate receptor]]s, [[GABA receptor]]s, and [[endocannabinoid]] signaling components. They also use [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Nitric oxide|NO]], and [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] like animals for signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Baluška F, Volkmann D, Mancuso S | year = 2006 | title = Communication in Plants: Neuronal Aspects of Plant Life. | publisher = Springer Verlag | isbn = 978-3-540-28475-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrophysiology====
Although plant cells are not [[neuron]]s, they can be electrically excitable and can display rapid electrical responses ([[action potential]]s) to environmental stimuli. These action potentials can influence processes such as [[actin]]-based cytoplasmic streaming, [[rapid plant movement|plant organ movements]], wound responses, respiration, [[photosynthesis]], and flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wagner E, Lehner L, Normann J, Veit J, Albrechtova J | year = 2006 | chapter = Hydroelectrochemical integration of the higher plant—basis for electrogenic flower induction | pages = 369–389 | veditors =  Baluska F, Mancuso S, Volkmann D | title = Communication in plants: neuronal aspects of plant life | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fromm J, Lautner S | title = Electrical signals and their physiological significance in plants | journal = Plant, Cell &amp; Environment | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–257 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17263772 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01614.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmermann MR, Maischak H, Mithöfer A, Boland W, Felle HH | title = System potentials, a novel electrical long-distance apoplastic signal in plants, induced by wounding | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 1593–600 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19129416 | pmc = 2649404 | doi = 10.1104/pp.108.133884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Pickard BG | title = Action Potentials in Higher Plants| jstor = 4353850| journal = Botanical Review| volume = 39| issue = 2| pages = 172–201| year = 1973| doi = 10.1007/BF02859299}}&lt;/ref&gt; These electrical responses can cause the synthesis of numerous [[Organic compound|organic molecules]], including ones that act as neuroactive substances in other organisms.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Thus, plants accomplish [[Behavior|behavioural responses]] in environmental, [[Plant communication|communicative]], and [[Plant ecology|ecological]] contexts.

===Signal response===
{{Further information|Plant hormone|Thigmotropism|Thigmomorphogenesis}}
A plant's concomitant reactive behavior is mediated by [[phytochrome]]s, [[kinin]]s, [[Plant hormone|hormones]], [[antibiotic]] or other chemical release, changes of water and chemical transport, and other means. These responses are generally slow, taking at minimum a number of hours to accomplish, and can best be observed with [[time-lapse]] cinematography, but [[Rapid plant movement|rapid movements]] can occur as well.
Plants respond to volatile signals produced by other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farmer EE, Ryan CA | title = Interplant communication: airborne methyl jasmonate induces synthesis of proteinase inhibitors in plant leaves | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 19 | pages = 7713–6 | date = October 1990 | pmid = 11607107 | pmc = 54818 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.19.7713 | bibcode = 1990PNAS...87.7713F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Karban R, Baxter KJ | journal = Journal of Insect Behavior| volume = 14| issue = 2| pages = 147–156|title=Induced Resistance in Wild Tobacco with Clipped Sagebrush Neighbors: The Role of Herbivore Behavior| year = 2001| doi = 10.1023/A:1007893626166}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jasmonate]] levels also increase rapidly in response to mechanical perturbations such as [[tendril]] coiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falkenstein E, Groth B, Mithöfer A, Weiler EW | title = Methyljasmonate and α-linolenic acid are potent inducers of tendril coiling | journal = Planta | volume = 185 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–22 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 24186412 | doi = 10.1007/BF00201050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants have many [[inducible plant defenses against herbivory|strategies to fight off pests]]. For example, they can produce different toxins ([[phytoalexin]]s) against invaders or they can induce rapid [[cell death]] in invading cells to hinder the pests from spreading out.

Some plants are capable of [[Rapid plant movement|rapid movement]]: the mimosa plant (''[[Mimosa pudica]]'') makes its thin leaves point down at the slightest touch {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} and [[carnivorous plant]]s such as the [[Venus flytrap]] snap shut by the touch of insects. In the Venus flytrap, touch is detected by [[Cilium|cilia]] that generate an [[action potential]] that stimulates motor cells, by which movement occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Volkov AG, Adesina T, Jovanov E |date=May 1, 2007|title=Closing of Venus Flytrap by Electrical Stimulation of Motor Cells | doi = 10.4161/psb.2.3.4217 | journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|volume=2|pages=139-145|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, the mechanism responsible for adaptation is [[signal transduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Scheel D, Wasternack C |title=Plant signal transduction |year=2002 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-963879-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiong L, Zhu JK | title = Abiotic stress signal transduction in plants: Molecular and genetic perspectives | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–166 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11454221 | doi = 10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120202.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark GB, Thompson G, Roux SJ | title = Signal transduction mechanisms in plants: an overview | journal = Current Science | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 170–7 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 12194182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trewavas A | title = How plants learn | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 4216–8 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10200239 | pmc = 33554 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.8.4216 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.4216T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of perception==

===Light===
[[File:Sonnenblume-hjf.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The sunflower'', a common heliotropic plant which perceives and reacts to sunlight by slow turning movement]]
{{Main article|Photomorphogenesis|photoperiodism}}
Many plant organs contain photo-sensitive compounds ([[phototropin]]s, [[cryptochrome]]s and [[phytochrome]]s), each reacting very specifically to certain wavelengths of light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} These light sensors tell the plant if it is day or night, how long the day is, how much light is available and from where the light comes. Shoots grow towards light and roots usually grow away from light. These responses are called [[phototropism]] and skototropism respectively. They are brought about by light sensitive pigments like [[phototropin]]s and [[phytochrome]]s and the plant hormone [[auxin]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Many plants exhibit certain phenomena at specific times of the day; for example, certain flowers open only in the mornings. Plants keep track of the time of day with a [[circadian clock]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} This internal clock is set to solar time every day using sunlight, temperature and other cues, similar to the biological clocks of other organisms. The internal clock coupled with the ability to perceive light also allows plants to measure the time of the day and so find the season of the year. This is how many plants know when to flower.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} (see [[photoperiodism]]) The seeds of many plants sprout only after they are exposed to light. This response is carried out by phytochrome signalling. Plants are also able to sense the quality of light and respond appropriately. For example, in low light conditions, plants produce more photosynthetic pigments. If the light is very bright or if the levels of harmful UV increase, plants produce more of their protective pigments that act as sunscreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strid | first1 = Åke | last2 = Porra | first2 = Robert J. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1992 | title = Alterations in Pigment Content in Leaves of Pisum sativum After Exposure to Supplementary UV-B | url = http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/33/7/1015 | journal = Plant and Cell Physiology | volume = 33 | issue = 7| pages = 1015–1023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gravity ===
{{Main article|Gravitropism}}
To orient themselves correctly, plants must have an adequate sense of the direction of gravity’s unidirectional pull. The subsequent response plant movement is known as [[gravitropism]]. Typically, in the root this works as gravity is sensed and translated in the [[Root cap|root tip]], and subsequently roots grow towards gravity via elongation of the cells. In the shoot, similar effects are happening, but gravity is perceived and then growth occurs in the opposite direction, as the above ground part of the plant experiences negative gravitropism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biological science | last = Freeman | first = Scott | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Pearson | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-321-74367-1 | location = Illinois | pages = 803 | oclc = 821271420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the root tip, there are [[amyloplast]]s containing starch granules that fall in the direction of gravity. This weight activates secondary receptors, which signal to the plant the direction of gravitational pull. After this occurs, [[auxin]] is redistributed through [[polar auxin transport]] and differential growth towards gravity begins. In the shoots, auxin redistribution occurs in a way to produce differential growth away from gravity.

For perception to happen, the plant must sense, perceive and translate the direction of gravity. Without gravity, proper orientation will not occur and the plant will not effectively grow. The root will not be able to uptake nutrients or water, and the shoot will not grow towards the sky to maximize [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perrin RM, Young LS, Murthy UM, Harrison BR, Wang Y, Will JL, Masson PH | title = Gravity signal transduction in primary roots | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 737–43 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16033778 | pmc = 4247041 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mci227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant intelligence==
{{Further information|Hormonal sentience|Plant cognition}}
Plants do not have a brain or [[neuronal network]], but reactions within signalling pathways may provide a biochemical basis for learning and memory in addition to computation and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhalla US, Iyengar R | title = Emergent properties of networks of biological signaling pathways | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = 5400 | pages = 381–7 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9888852 | doi = 10.1126/science.283.5400.381 | bibcode = 1999Sci...283..381B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, the brain is used as a metaphor in plant intelligence to provide an integrated view of signalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner ED, Stahlberg R, Mancuso S, Vivanco J, Baluska F, Van Volkenburgh E | title = Plant neurobiology: an integrated view of plant signaling | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 413–9 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16843034 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants respond  to [[Stimulus (physiology)|environmental stimuli]] by [[Tropism|movement]] and changes in [[Plant morphology|morphology]]. They  communicate while actively competing for resources. In addition, plants accurately compute their circumstances, use sophisticated [[cost–benefit analysis]] and take tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control diverse environmental stressors. Plants are also capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of learning by registering memories from their past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goh CH, Nam HG, Park YS | title = Stress memory in plants: a negative regulation of stomatal response and transient induction of rd22 gene to light in abscisic acid-entrained Arabidopsis plants | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 240–55 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14535888 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01872.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkov AG, Carrell H, Baldwin A, Markin VS | title = Electrical memory in Venus flytrap | journal = Bioelectrochemistry | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 142–7 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19356999 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.bioelechem.2009.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rensing L, Koch M, Becker A | title = A comparative approach to the principal mechanisms of different memory systems | journal = Die Naturwissenschaften | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 1373–84 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19680619 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00114-009-0591-0 | bibcode = 2009NW.....96.1373R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gagliano M, Renton M, Depczynski M, Mancuso S | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–72 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24390479 | doi = 10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gagliano M, Vyazovskiy VV, Borbély AA, Grimonprez M, Depczynski M | title = Learning by Association in Plants | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 38427 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27910933 | doi = 10.1038/srep38427 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants use this information to update their behaviour in order to survive present and future challenges of their environment.

Plant physiology studies the role of [[Signal transduction|signalling]] to integrate data obtained at the [[Plant genetics|genetic]], [[Phytochemistry|biochemical]], [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[Plant physiology|physiological]] levels to understand plant development and behaviour. The neurobiological view sees plants as information-processing organisms with rather complex processes of communication occurring throughout the individual plant organism. It studies how environmental information is gathered, processed, integrated and shared (sensory plant biology) to enable these adaptive and coordinated responses (plant behaviour); and how  sensory perceptions and behavioural events are 'remembered' in order to allow predictions of future activities upon the basis of past experiences. Plants, it is claimed by some plant physiologists, are as sophisticated in behaviour as animals but this sophistication has been masked by the time scales of plants' response to stimuli, many [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] slower than animals'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

It has been argued that although plants are capable of adaptation, it should not be called intelligence, as plant neurobiologists are relying primarily on metaphors and analogies to argue that complex responses in plants can only be produced by intelligence.&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt; ''"A bacterium can monitor its environment and instigate developmental processes appropriate to the prevailing circumstances, but is that intelligence? Such simple adaptation behaviour might be bacterial intelligence but is clearly not animal intelligence."''&lt;ref name="firn2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Firn R | title = Plant intelligence: an alternative point of view | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–51 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15023701 | pmc = 4242337 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mch058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, plant intelligence fits a definition of intelligence proposed by [[David Stenhouse]] in a book about evolution and animal intelligence where he described it as "adaptively variable behaviour during the lifetime of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Helen | last = Phillips | name-list-format = vanc | title = Not just a pretty face | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17523535.700-not-just-a-pretty-face.html | date = 27 July 2002 | work =  New Scientist }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the concept have also argued that a plant cannot have goals once it is past the development stage of seedling because, as a modular organism, each module seeks its own survival goals and the resulting organism level behavior is not centrally controlled.&lt;ref name="firn2004"/&gt; This view, however, necessarily accommodates the possibility that a tree is a collection of individually intelligent modules cooperating, competing and influencing each other to determine behavior in a bottom-up fashion. The development into a larger organism whose modules must deal with different environmental conditions and challenges is not universal across plant species however, as smaller organisms might be subject to the same conditions across their bodies, at least, when the below and above ground parts are considered separately. Moreover, the claim that central control of development is completely absent from plants is readily falsified by apical dominance.

The Italian botanist [[Federico Delpino]] wrote on the idea of plant intelligence in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mancuso S | title = Federico Delpino and the foundation of plant biology | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 1067–71 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 21490417 | pmc = 3115070 | doi = 10.4161/psb.5.9.12102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] studied the movement of plants and in 1880 published a book ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''.  In the book he concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the [[radicle]] thus endowed [..] acts like the brain of one of the lower animals; the brain being situated within the anterior end of the body, receiving impressions from the sense-organs, and directing the several movements.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In philosophy, there are few studies of the implications of plant perception. [[Michael Marder]] put forth a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of plant life based on the physiology of plant perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marder M | title = Plant intentionality and the phenomenological framework of plant intelligence | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 1365–72 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22951403 | pmc = 3548850 | doi = 10.4161/psb.21954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paco Calvo Garzon offers a philosophical take on plant perception based on the cognitive sciences and the computational modeling of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garzón FC | title = The quest for cognition in plant neurobiology | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 208–11 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 19516990 | pmc = 2634130 | doi = 10.4161/psb.2.4.4470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to neurobiology===
A plant's sensory and response system has been compared to the [[neurobiological]] processes of animals. [[Plant neurobiology]], an unfamiliar misnomer, concerns mostly the sensory [[adaptive behaviour (ecology)|adaptive behaviour]] of plants and plant [[electrophysiology]]. [[India]]n  scientist [[J. C. Bose]] is credited as the first person to research and talk about neurobiology of plants. Many plant scientists and neuroscientists, however, view this as inaccurate, because plants do not have neurons.&lt;ref name="NoBrain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alpi A, Amrhein N, Bertl A, Blatt MR, Blumwald E, Cervone F, Dainty J, De Michelis MI, Epstein E, Galston AW, Goldsmith MH, Hawes C, Hell R, Hetherington A, Hofte H, Juergens G, Leaver CJ, Moroni A, Murphy A, Oparka K, Perata P, Quader H, Rausch T, Ritzenthaler C, Rivetta A, Robinson DG, Sanders D, Scheres B, Schumacher K, Sentenac H, Slayman CL, Soave C, Somerville C, Taiz L, Thiel G, Wagner R | title = Plant neurobiology: no brain, no gain? | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 135–6 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17368081 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas behind plant neurobiology were criticised in a 2007 article&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt; published in ''[[Trends in Plant Science]]'' by Amedeo Alpi and 35 other scientists, including such eminent plant biologists as [[Gerd Jürgens]], Ben Scheres, and Chris Sommerville. The breadth of fields of plant science represented by these researchers reflects the fact that the vast majority of the plant science research community reject plant neurobiology.  Their main arguments are that:&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt;
* "Plant neurobiology does not add to our understanding of plant physiology, plant cell biology or signaling".
* "There is no evidence for structures such as neurons, synapses or a brain in plants".
* The common occurrence of [[plasmodesmata]] in plants which "poses a problem for signaling from an electrophysiological point of view" since  extensive electrical coupling would preclude the need for any cell-to-cell transport of a ‘neurotransmitter-like’ compounds.
The authors call for an end to "superficial analogies and questionable extrapolations" if the concept of "plant neurobiology" is to benefit the research community.&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt;

There were several responses to the criticism clarifying that the term "plant neurobiology" is a metaphor and metaphors have proved useful on several previous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trewavas A | title = Response to Alpi et al.: Plant neurobiology--all metaphors have value | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 231–3 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17499006 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner ED, Stahlberg R, Mancuso S, Baluska F, Van Volkenburgh E | title = Response to Alpi et al.: plant neurobiology: the gain is more than the name | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 285–6 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17591455 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecophysiology#Plants|Plant ecophysiology]] describes this phenomenon.&lt;!--{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} unnecessary--&gt;

===Parallels in other taxa===

As described above in the case of a plant, similar mechanisms exist in a bacterial cell, a choanoflagellate, a fungal hypha, or a sponge, among the many other examples. All of these individual organisms of the respective taxa, despite being devoid of a brain or nervous system, are capable of sensing their immediate and momentary environment and responding accordingly. In the case of single-celled life, the sensory pathways are even more primitive in the sense that they take place on the surface of a single cell, as opposed to a network of many cells.

RaptorX is among the most popular methods for protein structure prediction. Like other remote homology recognition/protein threading techniques, RaptorX is able to regularly generate reliable protein models when the widely used [[BLAST|PSI-BLAST]] cannot. However, RaptorX is also significantly different from those profile-based methods (e.g., [[HHpred / HHsearch]] and [[Phyre / Phyre2]]) in that RaptorX excels at modeling of protein sequences without a large number of sequence homologs by exploiting structure information. RaptorX Server has been designed to ensure a user-friendly interface for users inexpert in protein structure prediction methods.

== Description ==

The RaptorX project was started in 2008 and RaptorX Server&lt;ref name=RaptorXServer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Källberg|first=Morten |author2=Haipeng Wang |author3=Sheng Wang |author4=Jian Peng |author5=Zhiyong Wang |author6=Hui Lu |author7=Jinbo Xu|title=Template-based protein structure modeling using the RaptorX web server|journal=Nature Protocols|date=July 2012|volume=7|pages=1511–1522|doi=10.1038/nprot.2012.085|pmid=22814390|url=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n8/full/nprot.2012.085.html|issue=8 |pmc=4730388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was released to the public in 2011.

== Standard usage ==

After pasting a protein sequence into the RaptorX submission form, a user will typically wait a couple of hours (depending on sequence length) for a prediction to complete. An email is sent to the user together with a link to a web page of results. RaptorX Server currently generates the following results: 3-state and 8-state secondary structure prediction, sequence-template alignment, 3D structure prediction, solvent accessibility prediction, disorder prediction and binding site prediction. The predicted results are displayed to support visual examination. The result files are also available for download.

RaptorX Server also produces some confidence scores indicating the quality of the predicted 3D models (in the absence of their corresponding native structures). For example, it produces P-value for relative global quality of a 3D model, [[Global distance test|GDT (Global Distance Test)]] and uGDT (unnormalized-GDT) for absolute global quality of a 3D model and per-position [[RMSD]] for absolute local quality at each residue of a 3D model.

Below are some screenshots of RaptorX Server.

== Applications and performance ==
Applications of RaptorX include protein structure prediction, function prediction, protein sequence-structure alignment, evolutionary classification of proteins, guiding [[site-directed mutagenesis]] and solving protein crystal structures by [[molecular replacement]]. In the [[CASP]]9 blind protein structure prediction experiment, RaptorX was ranked 2nd out of about 80 automatic structure prediction servers. RaptorX also generated the best alignments for the 50 hardest [[CASP]]9 TBM(template-based modeling) targets. in [[CASP]]10, RaptorX is the only server group among the top 10 human/server groups for the 15 most difficult [[CASP]]10 TBM targets.

== History ==
RaptorX is the successor to the [[RAPTOR]] protein structure prediction system. RAPTOR was designed and developed by Dr. Jinbo Xu and Dr. Ming Li at the University of Waterloo. RaptorX was designed and developed by a research group led by Prof. Jinbo Xu at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.

[[File:ENTERAIR6-SPENB.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737]] [[Enter Air]], climbing with normal [[angle of attack]] for civil airplanes, to give optimal rate of climb]]
In [[aeronautics]], the '''rate of climb''' ('''RoC''') is an aircraft's vertical speed – the rate of positive [[altitude]] change with respect to time or distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/technique/tip-week/vx-vs-vy|title=Vx vs. Vy|author=|date=|website=flyingmag.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most [[ICAO]] member countries, even in otherwise metric countries, this is usually expressed in feet per [[minute]] (ft/min). Elsewhere, it is commonly expressed in metre per [[second]] (m/s). The rate of climb in an aircraft is indicated with a [[vertical speed indicator]] (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI).

The rate of decrease in altitude is referred to as the '''rate of descent''' ('''RoD''') or '''sink rate'''. A decrease in altitude corresponds with a negative rate of climb.

== Speed and rate of climb ==

There are a number of [[V speeds|designated airspeeds]] relating to optimum rates of ascent, the two most important of these are ''V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''.

''V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the indicated forward airspeed for best [[angle of climb]]. This is the speed at which an aircraft gains the most altitude in a given horizontal {{em|distance}}, typically used to avoid a collision with an object a short distance away. By contrast, ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the indicated airspeed for best rate of climb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=4521512ee412f38bd81b10e0436a0a95;rgn=div5;view=text;node=14%3A1.0.1.1.1;idno=14;cc=ecfr#14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.2|title=FAR §1.2|author=|date=|website=gpoaccess.gov|accessdate=16 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319210119/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=4521512ee412f38bd81b10e0436a0a95;rgn=div5;view=text;node=14:1.0.1.1.1;idno=14;cc=ecfr#14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.2|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a rate which allows the aircraft to climb to a specified altitude in the minimum amount of {{em|time}} regardless of the horizontal distance required. Except at the aircraft’s ceiling, where they are equal, ''V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is always lower than ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Climbing at ''V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' allows pilots to maximize altitude gain per horizontal distance. This occurs at the speed for which the difference between thrust and [[aerodynamic drag|drag]] is the greatest (maximum [[excess thrust]]). In a jet airplane, this is approximately minimum drag speed, occurring at the bottom of the drag vs. speed curve.

Climbing at ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' allows pilots to maximize altitude gain per time. This occurs at the speed where the difference between engine power and the power required to overcome the aircraft's drag is greatest (maximum excess power).&lt;ref&gt;http://people.clarkson.edu/~pmarzocc/AE429/AE-429-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' increases with altitude and ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' decreases with altitude until they converge at the airplane's [[absolute ceiling]], the altitude above which the airplane cannot climb in steady flight.

The [[Cessna 172]] is a four-seat aircraft. At maximum weight it has a ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 75&amp;nbsp;knots [[indicated airspeed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flashcardmachine.com/cessna-172-ataglance.html|title=Cessna 172 at a Glance Flashcards|author=|date=|website=www.flashcardmachine.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
providing a rate of climb of 721&amp;nbsp;ft/min.

Rate of climb at maximum power for a small aircraft is typically specified in its normal operating procedures but for large jet airliners it is usually mentioned in emergency operating procedures.

The SCALE-UP name originally stood for “Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Physics” but since its conception many different institutions have begun teaching a variety of courses of various sizes. The acronym was changed to “Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs.” Now, because of the increasing number of pre-college installations, plus to draw attention to the instruction as well as the space, the name has become "Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies." The basic idea is that students are given something interesting to investigate. While they work in teams on these "tangibles" (hands-on measurements or observations) and "ponderables" (interesting, complex problems), the instructor is free to roam around the classroom–--asking questions, sending one team to help another, or asking why someone else got a different answer. There is no separate lab class and most of the "lectures" are actually class-wide discussions. The groups are carefully structured and give students many opportunities to interact. Three teams (labelled a, b, and c) sit at each round table and have white boards nearby. Each team has a laptop in case they need web access. The [http://scaleup.ncsu.edu/groups/adopters/wiki/056a1/North_Carolina_State_Physics.html  original design] called for 11 round tables of nine students, but many schools have smaller classes while a few have even larger ones. Smaller classes, particularly those in high schools, have also been using D-shaped tables that seat six students.

A '''stellar-wind bubble''' is a cavity light years across filled with hot gas blown into the [[interstellar medium]] by the high-velocity (several thousand km/s) [[stellar wind]] from a single massive [[star]] of [[stellar classification|type]] [[O star|O]] or [[B V star|B]]. Weaker [[stellar wind]]s also blow bubble structures, which are also called '''astrospheres'''. The [[heliosphere]] blown by the [[solar wind]], within which all the major [[planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] are embedded, is a small example of a stellar-wind bubble.

Stellar-wind bubbles have a two-shock structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| bibcode=1975ApJ...200L.107C |last= Castor|first=J. |last2=McCray|first2=R. |last3=Weaver|first3=R. | title=Interstellar Bubbles| date=1975| journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters| volume=200| pages=L107–L110| doi=10.1086/181908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The freely-expanding [[stellar wind]] hits an inner termination shock, where its kinetic energy is thermalized, producing 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]], [[X-ray]] emitting [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].  The hot, high-pressure, shocked wind expands, driving a shock into the surrounding interstellar gas.  If the surrounding gas is dense enough (number densities &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0.1 \mbox{ cm}^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; or so), the swept-up gas radiatively cools far faster than the hot interior, forming a thin, relatively dense shell around the hot, shocked wind.

'''The Edelstein Center for Social Research''' is a Brazilian [[think tank]] based in [[Rio de Janeiro]], that: 1) promotes [[research]] and [[publication]]s designed to improve [[public policy|public policies]] and [[institution]]s to enhance [[democracy]] and [[social justice]] in [[Latin America]]; 2) fosters the dialogue between [[social actor]]s and knowledge producers to disseminate internationally Latin American [[social sciences]] production and research institutions; 3) develops free access [[virtual library|virtual libraries]], [[data bank]]s and the translation of Latin American [[social research]] works into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/English/QuemSomos.asp |title=The Edelstein Center, About us |publisher=Centroedelstein.org.br |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Staff ==

The '''Edelstein Center''' was established in 2004, by Joel Edelstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/English/JoelEdelstein.asp |title=About Joel Edelstein |publisher=Centroedelstein.org.br |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a USA citizen living in [[Brazil]]. From its inception is directed by [[Bernardo Sorj]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernardosorj.com.br/english/index.asp |title=Director Bernardo Sorj’s site |publisher=Bernardosorj.com.br |date=2005-12-30 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Board of Advisors includes [[Adama Samassékou]] (Mali), Angelina Peralva (France), Daniel Pécaut (France), Giorgio Alberti (Italy), [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] (in memoriam, Argentina), [[Jean-Michel Blanquer]] (France) [[:es:Julio Cotler|Julio Cotler]] (Peru), Sérgio Costa (Germany), Shepard Forman (United States) and [[Simon Schwartzman]] (Brazil).

In 2007, in association with the Instituto [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifhc.org.br Instituto Fernando Henrique Cardoso]&lt;/ref&gt; founded the ''Democratic Platform Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plataformademocratica.org/English |title=Democratic Platform Project |publisher=Plataformademocratica.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009-2010, the '''Edelstein Center''' was one of the sponsors of the [[Latin American Initiative on Drugs and Democracy]]. The other organizations were Instituto [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] and the [[Open Society Institute]].&lt;ref name="drogasedemocracia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drogasedemocracia.org/English/Default.asp |title=Latin American Initiative on Drugs and Democracy |publisher=Drogasedemocracia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010-2011, the '''Edelstein Center''' was part of the secretariat of the [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/ |title=The Global Commission on Drug Policy |publisher=Globalcommissionondrugs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

'''The Information Society in Latin America'''

This research program concentrates on the impact of new [[information and communications technology]] on the transformation of [[Latin America]]'s education system, public space and democratic life.&lt;ref&gt;[SORJ, Bernardo. Information Societies and Digital Divides: an Introduction. Milano: Polimetrica. Rio de Janeiro: The Edelstein Center for Social Research, 2008. {{ISBN|9788876991288}}. http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/PDF/Information_Societies_and_Digital_Divides_ebook.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[REMOLD, Julie.

Recently the '''Edelstein Center''' has completed a research on the use of computers and [[Internet]] by public school teachers in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;[SORJ, Bernardo; LISSOVSKY, Mauricio. Internet in Brazilian Public Schools: Policies beyond Politics. Rio de Janeiro: The Edelstein Center for Social Research, Working Paper nº 6, May 2011. http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/PDF/WP_6_English.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicates that even when they have a positive impact, they cannot be separated from the educational and human context. A comprehensive policy needs to properly training teachers, in particular confronting the difficulties of the older generation, use monitored software, and adequate maintaining the physical infrastructural and technical support for school computer labs.

'''Civil Society and Globalization Agendas'''

The ''Civil Society and Globalization Agendas'' research program focuses on the current changes in [[Latin America]]’s [[civil society]]. Civil society played an important role in the promotion of [[democracy]] during the period of [[military dictatorships]]. However, more recently, civil society organizations have expanded and changed profoundly. While continuing to play an important role in the defense of [[human rights]], in many countries civil society has become a vehicle for  political parties, individual politicians, unions and social movements to channel public funds for their own benefit and/or political cooptation.&lt;ref&gt;[SORJ, B.

{{Cleanup|date=December 2008}}
'''Thermal desorption''' is an [[environmental remediation]] technology that utilizes heat to increase the [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] of contaminants such that they can be removed (separated) from the solid matrix (typically soil, sludge or filter cake). The volatilized contaminants are then either collected or thermally destroyed. A thermal desorption system therefore has two major components; the desorber itself and the offgas treatment system.
Thermal desorption is not [[incineration]].

==History== 

Thermal desorption first appeared as an environmental treatment technology in 1985 when it was specified in the [[Record of Decision]] for the McKin Company [[Superfund]] site within the [[Royal River]] watershed in Maine.&lt;ref name="McKin"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Site Information McKin Company Superfund Site Gray Maine
  | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency
  | date = 1985-07-22
  | url = http://www.clu-in.org/products/costperf/THRMDESP/Mckin.htm#SITEINFO
  | accessdate = 2009-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is frequently referred to as "low temp" thermal desorption to differentiate it from high temperature incineration. An early direct fired thermal desorption project was the treatment of 8000 tons of toxaphene (a chlorinated pesticide) contaminated sandy soil at the S&amp;S Flying Services site in Marianna Florida in 1990, with later projects exceeding 170,000 tons at the [[Cape Fear (region)|Cape Fear]] coal tar site in 1999. A status report from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] shows that thermal desorption has been used at 69 [[Superfund]] sites through FY2000. In addition, hundreds of remediation projects have been completed using thermal desorption at non-Superfund sites.

For [[In situ thermal desorption|in-situ on-site treatment]] options, only [[incinerator|incineration]] and stabilization have been used at more Superfund sites. Incineration suffers from poor public acceptance. Stabilization does not provide a permanent remedy, since the contaminants are still on site. Thermal desorption is a widely accepted technology that provides a permanent solution at an economically competitive cost.

The world’s first large-scale thermal desorption for treatment of mercury containing wastes was erected in Wölsau, for the remediation of the Chemical Factory Marktredwitz (founded in 1788) was considered to be the oldest in Germany. Operation commenced in October 1993 including the first optimising phase. 50,000 tons of mercury-contaminated solid wastes were treated successfully between August 1993 and June 1996. 25 metric tons of mercury had been recovered from soil and rubble. Unfortunately the Marktredwitz plant is often misunderstood in the literature as a pilot-scale plant only.

==Desorbers==
Numerous desorber types are available today. Some of the more common types are listed below.

* Indirect gired rotary
* Direct fired rotary
* Heated screw (hot oil, molten salt, electric)
* Infrared
* Microwave

Most indirect fired rotary systems use an inclined rotating metallic cylinder to heat the feed material. The heat transfer mechanism is usually conduction through the cylinder wall. In this type of system neither the flame nor the products of combustion can contact the feed solids or the offgas. Think of it as a rotating pipe inside a furnace with both ends sticking outside of the furnace. The cylinder for full-scale transportable systems is typically five to eight feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. With a carbon steel shell, the maximum solids temperature is around 1,000 °F, while temperatures of 1,800 °F with special alloy cylinders are attainable. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 30 to 120 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 2 to 30 tons per hour for transportable units.

Direct-fired rotary desorbers have been used extensively over the years for petroleum contaminated soils and soils contaminated with [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] [[hazardous wastes]] as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. A 1992 paper on treating petroleum contaminated soils estimated that between 20 and 30 contractors have 40 to 60 rotary dryer systems available. Today, it is probably closer to 6 to 10 contractors with 15 to 20 portable systems commercially available. The majority of these systems utilize a secondary combustion chamber (afterburner) or catalytic oxidizer to thermally destroy the volatilized organics. A few of these systems also have a quench and scrubber after the oxidizer which allows them to treat soils containing chlorinated organics such as [[solvents]] and [[pesticides]]. The desorbing cylinder for full-scale transportable systems is typically four to ten feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. The maximum practical solids temperature for these systems is around 750 to 900 °F depending on the material of construction of the cylinder. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 3 to 15 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 6 to over 100 tons per hour for transportable units.

Heated screw systems are also an indirect heated system. Typically they use a jacketed trough with a double auger that intermeshes. The augers themselves frequently contain passages for the heating medium to increase the heat transfer surface area. Some systems use electric resistance heaters instead of a heat transfer media and may employ a single auger in each housing. The augers can range from 12 to 36&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter for full-scale systems, with lengths up to 20 feet. The auger/trough assemblies can be connected in parallel and/or series to increase throughput. Full scale capabilities up to 4 tons per hour have been demonstrated. This type of system has been most successful treating refinery wastes.

In the early days, there was a continuous infrared system that is no longer in common use. In theory, microwaves would be an excellent technical choice since uniform and accurately controlled heating can be achieved with no heat transfer surface fouling problems. One can only guess that capital and/or energy costs have prevented the development of a microwave thermal desorber at the commercial scale.

==Offgas treatment==
There are only three basic options for offgas treatment available. The volatilized contaminants in the offgas can either be discharged to atmosphere, collected or destroyed. In some cases, both a collection and destruction system are employed. In addition to managing the volatilized components, the particulate solids (dust) that exit the desorber must also be removed from the offgas.

When a collection system is used, the offgas must be cooled to condense the bulk of the volatilized components into a liquid. The offgas will exit most desorbers in the 350–900 °F range. The offgas is then typically cooled to somewhere between 120 and 40 °F to condense the bulk of the volatilized water and organic contaminants. Even at 40 °F, there may be measurable amounts of non-condensed organics. For this reason, after the condensation step, further treatment of the offgas is usually required. The cooled offgas may be treated by carbon adsorption, or thermal oxidation. Thermal oxidation can be accomplished using a catalytic oxidizer, an afterburner or by routing the offgas to the combustion heat source for the desorber. The volume of gas requiring treatment for indirect fired desorbers is a fraction of that required for a direct fired desorber. This requires smaller air pollution control trains for the gaseous process vent emissions. Some thermal desorption systems recycle the carrier gas, thereby further reducing the volume of gaseous emissions.

The condensed liquid from cooling the offgas is separated into organic and aqueous fractions.  The water is either disposed of or used to cool the treated solids and prevent dusting. The condensed liquid organic is removed from the site.  Depending on its composition, the liquid is either recycled as a supplemental fuel or destroyed in a fixed base incinerator.  A thermal desorber removing 500&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of organic contaminants from 20,000 tons of soil will produce less than {{Convert|3000|usgal|L}} of liquid organic.  In essence 20,000 tons of contaminated soil could be reduced to less than one tank truck of extracted liquid residue for off-site disposal.

Desorbers using offgas destruction systems use combustion to thermally destroy the volatilized organics components forming [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[NOx]], SOx and [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]]. The destruction unit may be called an afterburner, secondary combustion chamber, or thermal oxidizer. Catalytic oxidizers may also be used if the organic halide content of the contaminated media is low enough. Regardless of the name, the destruction unit is used to thermally destroy the hazardous organic constituents that were removed (volatilized) from the soil or waste.

The [[chemical compound]] '''trichloroethylene''' is a [[halocarbon]] commonly used as an industrial [[solvent]]. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. It should not be confused with the similar [[1,1,1-trichloroethane]], which is commonly known as ''chlorothene''.

The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] name is '''trichloroethene'''. Industrial abbreviations include '''TCE''', '''trichlor''', '''Trike''', '''Tricky''' and '''tri'''.  It has been sold under a variety of trade names. Under the trade names '''Trimar''' and '''Trilene''', trichloroethylene was used as a volatile [[anesthetic]] and as an inhaled obstetrical [[analgesic]] in millions of patients.

Groundwater and drinking water contamination from industrial discharge is a major concern for human health and has precipitated numerous incidents and lawsuits.

==History==
Pioneered by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in Britain, its development was hailed as an anesthetic revolution. Originally thought to possess less [[hepatotoxicity]] than [[chloroform]], and without the unpleasant pungency and flammability of [[ether]], TCE use was nonetheless soon found to have several pitfalls. These included promotion of [[cardiac arrhythmias]], low volatility and high solubility preventing quick anesthetic induction, reactions with [[soda lime]] used in carbon dioxide absorbing systems, prolonged neurologic dysfunction when used with soda lime, and evidence of hepatotoxicity as had been found with chloroform.

The introduction of [[halothane]] in 1956 greatly diminished the use of TCE as a general anesthetic. TCE was still used as an inhalation analgesic in childbirth given by self-administration. Fetal toxicity and concerns for carcinogenic potential of TCE led to its abandonment in developed countries by the 1980s.

Due to concerns about its toxicity, the use of trichloroethylene in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned in much of the world since the 1970s. Legislation has forced the substitution of trichloroethylene in many processes in Europe as the chemical was classified as a carcinogen carrying an R45 [[List of R-phrases|risk phrase]], ''May cause cancer''. Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on [[n-Propyl bromide|''n''-propyl bromide]] which carries an R60 risk phrase of ''May impair fertility'', and they would not be a legally acceptable substitute.

[[Groundwater]] contamination by TCE has become an important environmental concern for [[#Human exposure|human exposure]].

In 2005 it was announced by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that the agency had completed its Final Health Assessment for Trichloroethylene and released a list of new TCE toxicity values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/IRIS/subst/0199.htm|title=Trichloroethylene (CASRN 79-01-6)|publisher=Epa.gov|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study have formally characterized the chemical as a human carcinogen and a non-carcinogenic health hazard. A 2011 toxicological review performed by the EPA continues to list trichloroethylene as a known carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=United States Environmental Protection Agency|journal=EPA|date=September 2011|volume=635|issue=R–09/011F|url=http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0199tr/0199tr.pdf | title = Toxicological Review of Trichloroethylene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Prior to the early 1970s, most trichloroethylene was produced in a two-step process from [[acetylene]]. First, acetylene was treated with chlorine using a [[iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] [[catalyst]] at 90&amp;nbsp;°C to produce [[1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane]] according to the [[chemical equation]]

:[[acetylene|HC≡CH]] + 2 [[chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane is then dehydrochlorinated to give trichloroethylene. This can either be accomplished with an aqueous solution of [[calcium hydroxide]]

:2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 2 ClCH=CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[calcium chloride|CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

or in the vapor phase by heating it to 300-500&amp;nbsp;°C on a [[barium chloride]] or [[calcium chloride]] catalyst

:Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ClCH=CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]]

Today, however, most trichloroethylene is produced from [[ethylene]]. First, ethylene is chlorinated over a [[iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] catalyst to produce [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]].

:[[ethylene|CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[1,2-Dichloroethane|ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]]

When heated to around 400&amp;nbsp;°C with additional chlorine, 1,2-dichloroethane is converted to trichloroethylene

:[[1,2-Dichloroethane|ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]] + 2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ClCH=CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 HCl

This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of [[potassium chloride]] and [[aluminium chloride|aluminum chloride]]. However, various forms of porous [[carbon]] can also be used. This reaction produces [[tetrachloroethylene]] as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by [[distillation]].

== Uses ==
Trichloroethylene is an effective [[solvent]] for a variety of [[organic chemistry|organic]] materials.

When it was first widely produced in the 1920s, trichloroethylene's major use was to extract [[vegetable oil]]s from plant materials such as [[soy]], [[coconut]], and [[palm tree|palm]]. Other uses in the food industry included [[coffee]] [[decaffeination]] and the preparation of flavoring extracts from [[hops]] and [[spice]]s. It has also been used for drying out the last bit of water for production of 100% ethanol.

From the 1930s through the 1970s, both in Europe and in North America, trichloroethylene was used as a volatile anesthetic almost invariably administered with nitrous oxide. Marketed in the UK by ICI under the trade name Trilene it was coloured blue (with a dye called waxoline blue) to avoid confusion with the similar smelling chloroform.  TCE replaced earlier anesthetics [[chloroform]] and [[diethyl ether|ether]] in the 1940s, but was itself replaced in the 1960s in developed countries with the introduction of [[halothane]], which allowed much faster induction and recovery times.  Trilene was also used as a potent inhaled analgesic, mainly during childbirth.  It was used with halothane in the Tri-service field anaesthetic apparatus used by the UK armed forces under field conditions. As of 2000, however, TCE was still in use as an anesthetic in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used as a [[dry cleaning]] solvent, although replaced in the 1950s by [[tetrachloroethylene]] (also known as perchloroethylene), except for spot cleaning where it was used until the year 2000.

Trichloroethylene was marketed as 'Ecco 1500 Anti-Static Film Cleaner and Conditioner' until 2009, for use in automatic movie film cleaning machines, and for manual cleaning with lint-free wipes.

Perhaps the greatest use of TCE has been as a degreaser for metal parts. The demand for TCE as a degreaser began to decline in the 1950s in favor of the less toxic [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|1,1,1-trichloroethane]].  However, 1,1,1-trichloroethane production has been phased out in most of the world under the terms of the [[Montreal Protocol]], and as a result trichloroethylene has experienced some resurgence in use as a degreaser.

TCE has also been used in the United States to clean kerosene-fueled rocket engines (TCE was not used to clean hydrogen-fueled engines such as the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]).  During static firing, the RP-1 fuel would leave hydrocarbon deposits and vapors in the engine.  These deposits had to be flushed from the engine to avoid the possibility of explosion during engine handling and future firing.  TCE was used to flush the engine's fuel system immediately before and after each test firing.  The flushing procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30–35 minutes, depending upon the engine.  For some engines, the engine's gas generator and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) dome were also flushed with TCE prior to test firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov/public-involvement/docs/SSFL_TCE_Final_Fact_Sheet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Santa Susana Field Laboratory : The Use of Trichloroethylene at NASA's SSFL Sites |publisher=Ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=22 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114001621/http://ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov/public-involvement/docs/SSFL_TCE_Final_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?N=0&amp;Ntk=all&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchall&amp;Ntt=19750070175|title=F-1 Rocket Engine Operating Instructions|publisher=Ntrs.nasa.gov|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[F-1 rocket engine]] had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.&lt;ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"/&gt;

TCE is also used in the manufacture of a range of fluorocarbon refrigerants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~enviro/design/r134a.pdf |format=PDF |title=Production of R-134a |publisher=Nd.edu|accessdate=21 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711235310/http://www.nd.edu/~enviro/design/r134a.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]] more commonly known as HFC 134a. TCE was also used in industrial refrigeration applications due to its high heat transfer capabilities and its low temperature specification. Many industrial refrigeration applications used TCE up to the 1990s in applications such as car testing facilities.

==Chemical instability==
Despite its widespread use as a metal degreaser, trichloroethylene itself is unstable in the presence of metal over prolonged exposure. As early as 1961 this phenomenon was recognized by the manufacturing industry, when stabilizing additives were added to the commercial formulation. Since the reactive instability is accentuated by higher temperatures, the search for stabilizing additives was conducted by heating trichloroethylene to its boiling point in a [[reflux condenser]] and observing decomposition. The first widely used stabilizing additive was [[dioxane]]; however, its use was patented by [[Dow Chemical Company]] and could not be used by other manufacturers. Considerable research took place in the 1960s to develop alternative stabilizers for trichloroethylene. Other chemical stabilizers include [[ketone]]s such as [[methyl ethyl ketone]].

==Physiological effects==
When inhaled, trichloroethylene produces [[central nervous system]] depression resulting in general [[anesthesia]]. These effects may be mediated by trichloroethylene acting as a [[positive allosteric modulator]] of inhibitory GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and glycine receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = M.

Higher concentrations result in [[tachypnea]].  Many types of cardiac [[arrhythmias]] can occur and are exacerbated by [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline).  It was noted in the 1940s that TCE reacted with carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) absorbing systems ([[soda lime]]) to produce dichloroacetylene and [[phosgene]].&lt;ref name=Orkin&gt;Orkin, F.

These nerve deficits could last for months.  Occasionally facial numbness was permanent.  Muscle relaxation with TCE anesthesia sufficient for surgery was poor.  For these reasons as well as problems with [[hepatotoxicity]], TCE lost popularity in North America and Europe to more potent anesthestics such as [[halothane]] by the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;Stevens, W.C. and Kingston H.

The symptoms of acute non-medical exposure are similar to those of [[alcohol intoxication]], beginning with headache, dizziness, and confusion and progressing with increasing exposure to unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/tri-ethy.html |title=Trichloroethylene &amp;#124; Technology Transfer Network Air Toxics Web site &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respiratory and circulatory depression can result in death.

Much of what is known about the human health effects of trichloroethylene is based on occupational exposures. Beyond the effects to the central nervous system, workplace exposure to trichloroethylene has been associated with toxic effects in the liver and kidney.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; Over time, occupational exposure limits on trichloroethylene have tightened, resulting in more stringent ventilation controls and personal protective equipment use by workers.

Research from Cancer bioassays performed by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (later the [[National Toxicology Program]]) showed that exposure to trichloroethylene is carcinogenic in animals, producing liver cancer in mice, and kidney cancer in rats.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/phs19.html |title=ATSDR - Redirect - Public Health Statement: Trichloroethylene |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Toxicology Program’s 11th Report on Carcinogens categorizes trichloroethylene as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen”, based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Trichloroethylene |chapterurl=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/Trichloroethylene.pdf |pages=420–3 |title=Report on Carcinogens |edition=12th |url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/roc12 |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] |year=2011 |author=[[National Toxicology Program]] |isbn=978-1-4379-8736-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625114247/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/roc12 |archivedate=2011-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent review of the epidemiology of [[renal cell carcinoma|kidney cancer]] rated cigarette smoking and obesity as more important risk factors for kidney cancer than exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2006.07.130 |title=The Epidemiology of Renal Cell Carcinoma |year=2006 |last1=Lipworth |first1=Loren |last2=Tarone |first2=Robert E. |last3=McLaughlin |first3=Joseph K. |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=176 |issue=6 |pages=2353–8 |pmid=17085101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the most recent overall assessment of human health risks associated with trichloroethylene states, "[t]here is concordance between animal and human studies, which supports the conclusion that trichloroethylene is a potential kidney carcinogen".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11707.html |title=Assessing the Human Health Risks of Trichloroethylene: Key Scientific Issues &amp;#124; The National Academies Press |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence appears to be less certain at this time regarding the relationship between humans and liver cancer observed in mice, with the US [[National Academy of Science|NAS]] suggesting that low-level exposure might not represent a significant liver cancer risk in the general population.

The health risks of trichloroethylene have been studied extensively. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) sponsored a "state of the science" review of the health effects associated with exposure to trichloroethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.00108s2159 |title=Trichloroethylene Health Risks--State of the Science |year=2000 |last1=Scott |first1=Cheryl Siegel |last2=Cogliano |first2=V.

In Europe, the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] (SCOEL) recommends for trichloroethylene an [[occupational exposure limit]]  (8 hour time-weighted average) of 10 ppm and a short-term exposure limit (15 min) of 30 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/social/keyDocuments.jsp?type=0&amp;policyArea=82&amp;subCategory=153&amp;country=0&amp;year=0&amp;advSearchKey=recommendation&amp;mode=advancedSubmit&amp;langId=en|title=SCOEL recommendations|date=2011-04-22|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human exposure ==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2010}}

Exposure to TCE occurs mainly through contaminated drinking water. With a specific gravity greater than 1, trichloroethylene can be present as a [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] (DNAPL) if sufficient quantities are spilled in the environment. Another significant source of vapor exposure in [[Superfund]] sites that had contaminated groundwater, such as the [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]], was by showering. TCE readily volatilizes out of hot water and into the air. Long, hot showers would then volatilize more TCE into the air. In a home closed tightly to conserve the cost of heating and cooling, these vapors would then recirculate.

The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE.&lt;ref&gt;Lyne FA, McLachlan T (1949).

The 1998 film [[A Civil Action (film)|A Civil Action]] dramatizes the EPA lawsuit ''Anne Anderson, et al., v. Cryovac, Inc.'' concerning trichloroethylene contamination that occurred in [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] in the 1980s.

=== Existing regulation ===
Until recent years, the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) contended that trichloroethylene had little-to-no carcinogenic potential, and was probably a [[co-carcinogen]]—that is, it acted in concert with other substances to promote the formation of tumors.

State, federal, and international agencies classify trichloroethylene as a known or probable carcinogen. In 2014, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] updated its classification of trichloroethylene to Group 1, indicating that sufficient evidence exists that it causes cancer of the kidney in humans as well as some evidence of cancer of the liver and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol106/mono106-001.pdf |title=Trichloroethylene (IARC Summary &amp; Evaluation, Volume 106, 2014) |publisher=iarc.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; California EPA regulators consider it a known carcinogen and issued a risk assessment in 1999 that concluded that it was far more toxic than previous scientific studies had shown.

In the [[European Union]], the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] (SCOEL) recommends an exposure limit for workers exposed to trichloroethylene of 10&amp;nbsp;ppm (54.7&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 8-hour [[Permissible exposure limit|TWA]] and of 30&amp;nbsp;ppm (164.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for [[Permissible exposure limit|STEL]] (15 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=6405&amp;langId=en |format= PDF |title= Recommendation from the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits for Trichloroethylene (SCOEL/SUM/142) |date= April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing EU legislation aimed at protection of workers against risks to their health (including Chemical Agents Directive 98/24/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:131:0011:0023:EN:PDF |format=PDF |title=Council Directive 98/24/EC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carcinogens Directive 2004/37/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:229:0023:0034:EN:PDF |format=PDF |title=Directive 2004/37/EC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) currently do not impose binding minimum requirements for controlling risks to workers health during the use phase or throughout the life cycle of trichloroethylene. However, in case the ongoing discussions under the Carcinogens Directive will result in setting of a binding Occupational Exposure Limit for trichloroethylene for protection of workers; this conclusion may be revisited.

The Solvents Emissions Directive 1999/13/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1999L0013:19990329:EN:PDF|title=LexUriServ.do|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:334:0017:0119:en:PDF |format=PDF |title=Directive 2010/75/EU |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; impose binding minimum requirements for emissions of trichloroethylene to the environment for certain activities, including surface cleaning. However, the activities with solvent consumption below a specified threshold are not covered by these minimum requirements.

According to European regulation, the use of trichloroethylene is prohibited for individuals at a concentration greater than 0.1%. In industry, trichloroethylene should be substituted before April 21, 2016 (unless an exemption is requested before October 21, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013R0348&amp;qid=1396362971420&amp;from=EN|title=L_2013108EN.01000101.xml|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by other products such as [[tetrachloroethylene]] ([[perchloroethylene]]), [[methylene chloride]] ([[dichloromethane]]), or other hydrocarbon derivatives ([[ketone]]s, [[alcohol]]s, ...)

=== Proposed U.S. federal regulation ===
In 2001, a draft report of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) laid the groundwork for tough new standards to limit public exposure to trichloroethylene. The assessment set off a fight between the EPA and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], and [[NASA]], who appealed directly to the White House. They argued that the EPA had produced junk science, its assumptions were badly flawed, and that evidence exonerating the chemical was ignored.

The DoD has about 1,400 military properties nationwide that are contaminated with trichloroethylene. Many of these sites are detailed and updated by www.cpeo.org and include a former ammunition plant in the Twin Cities area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cpeo.org/milit.html |title=Military |publisher=CPEO |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty three sites in the Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex — including [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in the San Francisco Bay area, and NASA centers, including the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[La Cañada Flintridge]] are reported to have TCE contamination.

Political appointees in the EPA sided with the Pentagon and agreed to pull back the risk assessment. In 2004, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] was given a $680,000 contract to study the matter, releasing its report in the summer of 2006. The report has raised more concerns about the health effects of TCE.

In response to the heightened awareness of environmental toxins such as TCE and the role they may be playing in childhood disease, in 2007, Senator Barack Obama proposed S1068, co-sponsored by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d110:19:./temp/~bdMMKn:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;] {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation aimed to inform and protect communities that are threatened with environmental contamination. Senator Clinton's own bill, S1911, is known as the TCE Reduction Act.

=== Reduced production and remediation ===
In recent times, there has been a substantial reduction in the production output of trichloroethylene; alternatives for use in metal degreasing abound, chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons being phased out in a large majority of industries due to the potential for irreversible health effects and the legal liability that ensues as a result.

The U.S. military has virtually eliminated its use of the chemical, purchasing only 11 gallons in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Recent research has focused on the in-place remediation of trichloroethylene in soil and ground water instead of removal for off-site treatment and disposal. Naturally-occurring bacteria have been identified with the ability to degrade TCE. ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' sp. degrade trichloroethylene by reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' can co-metabolize TCE. Soil and ground water contamination by TCE has also been successfully remediated by chemical treatment and extraction. The bacteria ''[[Nitrosomonas europaea]]'' can degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene.&lt;ref name="genome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.jgi-psf.org/finished_microbes/niteu/niteu.home.html |title=Home - Nitrosomonas europaea |publisher=Genome.jgi-psf.org |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toluene dioxygenase]] has been reported to be involved in TCE degradation by ''[[Pseudomonas putida]]''.&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oLNtgk_VKXsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Bioremediation+of+gypsum#v=onepage&amp;q=Bioremediation%20of%20gypsum&amp;f=false|title=Bioremediation Technologies: Principles and Practice|author1=Robert L.
