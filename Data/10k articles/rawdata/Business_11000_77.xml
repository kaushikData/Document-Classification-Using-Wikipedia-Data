      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">'''Alta Rockefeller Prentice''' (April 12, 1871 – June 21, 1962) was an American philanthropist and socialite. She was the third daughter of philanthropists [[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller]] (1839&amp;ndash;1937) and [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller|Laura Celestia "Cettie" Spelman]] (1839&amp;ndash;1915). Alta married attorney Ezra Parmalee Prentice (July 29, 1863 &amp;ndash; 1955), son of Sartell Prentice (1837-1905) and Mary Adeline Isham (1838-1913), in 1901. Alta and Ezra had three children: [[John Rockefeller Prentice]] (1902&amp;ndash;1972), Mary Adeline Prentice (1907&amp;ndash;1981), and Spelman Prentice (1911&amp;ndash;2000).

She founded Alta House (c. 1900), a [[settlement house]] in [[Little Italy, Cleveland|Little Italy]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], which is named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.rockefeller.edu/bio/laura.php?printer=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422054845/http://archive.rockefeller.edu/bio/laura.php?printer=1 |archivedate=2006-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clevelandmemory.org/italians/partiii.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Alta and Ezra bought 1,400 acres (5.7 km²) of land near [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]], [[Massachusetts]]. Elm Tree House, the Prentices' 72-room summer home on Mount Hope Farm, was completed in 1928. In the 1930s and 1940s, several [[geneticists]] were employed by Ezra to develop more profitable farm animals, particularly [[cattle]] and [[poultry]]. At that time, Mount Hope Farm was one of the most outstanding experimental farms in the [[United States]]. 

Alta died in June 1962 at the age of 91. Her property was willed to [[New York, New York|New York]]'s [[Lenox Hill Hospital]]. Shortly thereafter, Elm Tree House was purchased by its current owner, [[Williams College]].

==Biography==
Bambang Sutrisno begin building his fortune by working together with brother Benny Suherman and Suwikatmono, the cousin of then President Suharto, to establish [[21 Cineplex]]. 21 Cineplex hosted 650 movie screens in Indonesia.  In the mid-1980s. Bambang left PT Suptan Film to start up his own supermarket chain business, the well-known Golden Truly chain, in Indonesia. He also set up Bank Surya. These businesses were once again set up with the help and connections of Suwikatmono, the cousin of then President [[Suharto]]. In 1997, during the economic financial crisis, the Indonesian government gave banks such as Bank Surya bailout money and Bambang Sutrisno embezzled 1.5 trillion Indonesian rupiah, the equivalent of around 200 million US dollars. Before he could be arrested, Bambang Sutrisno fled to neighbouring Singapore where he has obtained Permanent Resident status. Bambang Sutrisno was convicted of embezzlement in absentia in 1999 and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=jarkartapost-2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/singapore-none-too-fussy-about-the-source-of-wealth-in-itsfinancial-sector/2006/07/25/1153816182787.html |title=Singapore none too fussy about the source of wealth in its financial sector |date=July 2006 |publisher= The Age Australia |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kyoto&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/coe21/dp/151-160/21COE-DP157.pdf |title=Relationship between Chinese businessmen and local elites in Malaysia and Indonesia |date=January 2008 |publisher=Kyoto University |accessdate=26 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222150317/http://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/coe21/dp/151-160/21COE-DP157.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sinema&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sinema.sg/2011/08/09/omega-film%E2%80%99s-hollywood-import-license-under-fire/ |title=Omega's Film's Hollywood Import License Under Fire |date=August 2011 |publisher= Sinema.sg |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engber clearly explains Franklin's confusing birthdates, which are shared by many notable people, not the least of whom are [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Paine]]|quote=according to documents from Boston's city registrar, he actually came into the world on the old-style Jan. 6, 1705. So, this year's tricentennial is right on time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}} April 17, 1790) was an American [[polymath]] and one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. Franklin was a leading author, printer, [[List of political philosophers|political theorist]], politician, [[freemason]], postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the [[American Enlightenment]] and the [[history of physics]] for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the [[lightning rod]], [[bifocals]], and the [[Franklin stove]], among other inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventor |url=http://fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html |publisher=The Franklin Institute |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305234033/http://fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html |archivedate=March 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded many civic organizations, including the [[Library Company of Philadelphia|Library Company]], [[Philadelphia]]'s first [[Union Fire Company|fire department]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burt | first = Nathaniel | title = The Perennial Philadelphians: The Anatomy of an American Aristocracy | publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-8122-1693-6 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=L9ueb6r1uXgC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22Union+Fire+Company%22 | page = 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|last = Isaacson|first = Walter|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 2003|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin earned the title of "The First American" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial unity]], initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies. As the first [[United States Ambassador to France]], he exemplified the emerging American nation.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Brands, ''The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In the words of historian [[Henry Steele Commager]], "In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of [[Puritanism]] without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Walter Isaacson]], this makes Franklin "the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson, ''Benjamin Franklin'' (2003), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies, publishing the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' at the age of 23.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Brands. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B2bPCEbMAvwC&amp;pg=PA390 The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin]''. (2010). p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; He became wealthy publishing this and ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'', which he authored under the [[pseudonym]] "Richard Saunders". After 1767, he was associated with the ''[[Pennsylvania Chronicle]]'', a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of British policies.

He pioneered and was first president of [[Academy and College of Philadelphia]] which opened in 1751 and later became the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He organized and was the first secretary of the [[American Philosophical Society]] and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] repeal the unpopular [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive [[France–United States relations|Franco-American relations]]. His efforts proved vital for the [[American Revolution]] in securing shipments of crucial munitions from France.

He was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753, having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years, and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network. During the [[American Revolution|revolution]], he became the first [[United States Postmaster General]]. He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|governor of Pennsylvania]]. He initially owned and dealt in slaves but, by the 1750s, he argued against [[slavery]] from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]].

His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on [[Franklin half dollar|coinage]] and the [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill]], [[USS Benjamin Franklin (SSBN-640)|warships]], and [[List of places named for Benjamin Franklin|the names of many towns]], counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as countless [[Benjamin Franklin in popular culture|cultural references]].

==Ancestry==
Benjamin Franklin's father, [[Josiah Franklin]], was a [[tallow]] [[Chandlery|chandler]], a [[soaper]] and [[candle]]maker. Josiah was born at [[Ecton, Northamptonshire]], England on December 23, 1657, the son of blacksmith and farmer Thomas Franklin, and Jane White. Benjamin's father and all four of his grandparents were born in [[England]]. Josiah had seventeen children with his two wives. He married his first wife, Anne Child, in about 1677 in Ecton and immigrated with her to [[Boston]] in 1683; they had three children before immigrating, and four after. Following her death, Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689 in the [[Old South Meeting House]] by [[Samuel Willard]]. Benjamin, their eighth child, was Josiah Franklin's fifteenth child and tenth and last son.

Abiah Folger was born in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], on August 15, 1667, to [[Peter Folger (Nantucket settler)|Peter Folger]], a miller and schoolteacher, and his wife, [[Mary Morrell Folger]], a former [[indentured servant]]. She came from a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to [[Massachusetts]] for [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]], when [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] began persecuting Puritans. They sailed for Boston in 1635. Her father was "the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[court clerk|clerk of the court]], he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners. Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather's footsteps in his battles against the wealthy [[William Penn|Penn]] family that owned the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Colony]].

==Early life in Boston==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Birthplace 2.JPG|thumb|upright|Franklin's birthplace on [[Milk Street, Boston|Milk Street]], Boston, Massachusetts]]
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin's birthplace site directly across from the [[Old South Meeting House]] is commemorated by a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] atop the second floor facade of this building.]]

Benjamin Franklin was born on [[Milk Street, Boston|Milk Street]], in [[Boston]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], on January 17, 1706,&lt;ref name="Engber" /&gt;&lt;ref name="calendar group=Note"&gt;Contemporary records, which used the Julian calendar and the [[New Year#Historical Christian new year dates|Annunciation Style]] of enumerating years, recorded his birth as January 6, 1705. The provisions of the British [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]], implemented in 1752, altered the official British dating method to the Gregorian calendar with the start of the year on January 1 (it had been March 25). These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days, and for those between January 1 and March 25, an advance of one year. For a further explanation, see: [[Old Style and New Style dates]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Infant baptism|baptized]] at Old South Meeting House. He was one of seventeen children born to [[Josiah Franklin]], and one of ten born by Josiah's second wife, Abiah Folger; the daughter of [[Peter Foulger]] and [[Mary Morrill]]. Among Benjamin's siblings were his older brother [[James Franklin (printer)|James]] and his younger sister [[Jane Mecom|Jane]].

Josiah wanted Ben to attend school with the clergy, but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended [[Boston Latin School]] but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although "his parents talked of the church as a career"&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite book |last= Franklin |first= Benjamin |authormask= 2 |title= Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qW4VAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=February 1, 2011 |series= Macmillan's pocket English and American classics |origyear= 1771 |year= 1901 |publisher=Macmillan |location= New York |page= vi |chapter= Introduction}}&lt;!-- Note: the introduction of this edition is the source for this quote; please do not change the edition without verifying the quote remains sourced. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade. When Ben was 15, James founded ''[[The New-England Courant]]'', which was [[History of American newspapers|the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies]].

When denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin adopted the pseudonym of "[[Silence Dogood]]", a middle-aged widow. Mrs. Dogood's letters were published, and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the ''Courant'''s readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin was an advocate of free speech from an early age. When his brother was jailed for three weeks in 1722 for publishing material unflattering to the governor, young Franklin took over the newspaper and had Mrs. Dogood (quoting ''[[Cato's Letters]]'') proclaim: "Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, (2003) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin left his apprenticeship without his brother's permission, and in so doing became a [[fugitive from justice|fugitive]].&lt;ref name="vandoren"&gt;Carl Van Doren, ''Benjamin Franklin''. (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philadelphia==

At age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived, he worked in several printer shops around town, but he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects. After a few months, while working in a printing house, Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor [[Sir William Keith, 4th Baronet|Sir William Keith]] to go to London, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Finding Keith's promises of backing a newspaper empty, Franklin worked as a [[typesetter]] in a printer's shop in what is now the [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] area of London. Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham, a merchant who employed Franklin as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in his business.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

===Junto and library===
[[File:Franklin - ita, 1825 - 766672 R.jpeg|thumb|upright|''La scuola della economia e della morale'' (1825)]]
In 1727, Benjamin Franklin, then 21, created the [[Junto (club)|Junto]], a group of "like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community." The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;On the importance of the Junto see Michael D. Mumford, "Social innovation: ten cases from Benjamin Franklin." ''Creativity research journal'' (2002) 14#2 pp. 253–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Junto was modeled after English coffeehouses that Franklin knew well, and which had become the center of the spread of Enlightenment ideas in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;David Waldstreicher, ed., '' A Companion to Benjamin Franklin'' (2011) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Leo Lemay, ''The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 2: Printer and Publisher, 1730–1747'' (2005) pp. 92–94, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library initially assembled from their own books after Franklin wrote:

{{quote|A proposition was made by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient for us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The library: an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1602397064}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This did not suffice, however. Franklin conceived the idea of a [[subscription library]], which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]]: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, [[Louis Timothee]]. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and [[Library#Research library|research library]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Barton Korty, "Benjamin Franklin and eighteenth-century American libraries." ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1965): 1–83. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006049 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaperman===
Upon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade. In 1728, Franklin had set up a printing house in partnership with [[Hugh Meredith]]; the following year he became the publisher of a newspaper called ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]''. The ''Gazette'' gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect. But even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B. Franklin, Printer.'&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

[[File:Franklin the printer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Benjamin Franklin (center) at work on a [[printing press]]. Reproduction of a Charles Mills painting by the [[Detroit Publishing Company]].]]

In 1732, Ben Franklin published the first [[German language|German-language]] newspaper in America – ''Die Philadelphische Zeitung'' – although it failed after only one year, because four other newly founded German papers quickly dominated the newspaper market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa071299.htm|title=German Newspapers in the US and Canada|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin printed Moravian religious books in German. Franklin often visited [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] staying at the [[Moravian Sun Inn]].&lt;ref&gt;John B. Frantz, "Franklin and the Pennsylvania Germans." ''Pennsylvania History'' (1998): 21–34. [https://journals.psu.edu/index.php/phj/article/viewFile/25467/25236 online]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1751 pamphlet on demographic growth and its implications for the colonies, he called the [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania Germans]] "Palatine Boors" who could never acquire the "Complexion" of the English settlers and referred to "Blacks and Tawneys" as weakening the social structure of the colonies. Although Franklin apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Philip. Gleason, "Trouble in the Colonial Melting Pot." ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (2000) 20#1 pp. 3–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. In ''Benjamin Franklin's Journalism'', Ralph Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 1997 | title = Benjamin Franklin's Journalism | url = | journal = [[Fides et Historia]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 60–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of Benjamin Franklin.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of Arms of Benjamin Franklin]]

When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two "wretched little" news sheets, [[Andrew Bradford]]'s ''The American Weekly Mercury'', and [[Samuel Keimer]]'s ''Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/225/index.html#7 Elizabeth Christine Cook, ''Colonial and Revolutionary Literature; Early National Literature, Part I. Colonial Newspapers and Magazines, 1704–1775'' (1917)]&lt;/ref&gt; This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from ''Chambers's Universal Dictionary''. Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the ''Instructor'' and made it ''The Pennsylvania Gazette''. The ''Gazette'' soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first, he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. {{anchor|The Busy-Body}}{{anchor|The Busybody}}The series of essays called "The Busy-Body", which he wrote for Bradford's ''American Mercury'' in 1729, followed the general [[Joseph Addison|Addisonian]] form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as [[Isaac Bickerstaff]] had been in the ''Tatler''. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the "sowre Philosopher", is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, [[Samuel Keimer]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, ''Colonial and Revolutionary Literature; Early National Literature, Part I. Colonial Newspapers and Magazines, 1704–1775'' (1917)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', like most other newspapers of the period, was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the ''Gazette.'' His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Franklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, ''Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network: Disseminating Virtue in Early America'' (2006) {{ISBN|978-0826216144}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1731. After the second editor died, his widow Elizabeth Timothy took over and made it a success, 1738–46. She was one of the colonial era's first woman printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Ira L. | year = 1977 | title = Elizabeth Timothy: America's First Woman Editor | url = | journal = Journalism Quarterly | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 280–85 | doi=10.1177/107769907705400207}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three decades Franklin maintained a close business relationship with her and her son Peter who took over in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, "'The Partnership at Carolina Having succeeded, was Encourag'd to Engage in Others': The Genesis of Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network", ''Southern Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal of the South'' (2006), Vol. 13 Issue 1/2, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' had a policy of impartiality in political debates, while creating the opportunity for public debate, which encouraged others to challenge authority. Editor Peter Timothy avoided blandness and crude bias, and after 1765 increasingly took a patriotic stand in the growing crisis with Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Jeffery A. | year = 1993 | title = Impartiality and Revolutionary Ideology: Editorial Policies of the 'South-Carolina Gazette,' 1732–1735 | url = | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 511–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Franklin's ''Connecticut Gazette'' (1755–68) proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 2003 | title = 'I am now about to establish a small Printing Office&amp;nbsp;... at Newhaven': Benjamin Franklin and the First Newspaper in Connecticut | url = | journal = Connecticut History | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 77–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freemasonry===
In 1730 or 1731, Franklin was initiated into the local [[Masonic lodge]]. He became a [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Mysteries of the Freemasons: America'', video documentary, August 1, 2006, written by Noah Nicholas and Molly Bedell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freemasonry&gt;{{cite web| url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/franklin_b/franklin_b.html|title=Freemasonry Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon website |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca|accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas, a reprint of [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]]'s ''[[Constitutions of the Free-Masons]]''.

===Common-law marriage to Deborah Read===
{{double image|right|Deborah ReadFranklin.jpg|160|Sarah Franklin Bache1793.jpg|160|[[Deborah Read|Deborah Read Franklin]]&lt;br /&gt;(c. 1759). Common-law wife of Benjamin Franklin|[[Sarah Franklin Bache]] (1743–1808). Daughter of Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read}}

At age 17 in 1723, Franklin proposed to 15-year-old [[Deborah Read]] while a boarder in the Read home. At that time, Read's mother was wary of allowing her young daughter to marry Franklin, who was on his way to London at Governor [[Sir William Keith, 4th Baronet|Sir William Keith's]] request, and also because of his financial instability. Her own husband had recently died, and she declined Franklin's request to marry her daughter.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

While Franklin was in London, his trip was extended, and there were problems with Sir William's promises of support. Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay, Deborah married a man named John Rodgers. This proved to be a regrettable decision. Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to [[Barbados]] with her [[dowry]], leaving her behind. Rodgers's fate was unknown, and because of [[bigamy]] laws, Deborah was not free to remarry.

Franklin established a [[common-law marriage]] with Deborah Read on September 1, 1730. They took in Franklin's recently acknowledged young illegitimate son [[William Franklin|William]] and raised him in their household. They had two children together. Their son, [[Francis Folger Franklin]], was born in October 1732 and died of [[smallpox]] in 1736. Their daughter, [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sarah "Sally" Franklin]], was born in 1743 and grew up to marry [[Richard Bache]], have seven children, and look after her father in his old age.

Deborah's fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe, and another possible reason why they spent so much time apart is that he may have blamed her for preventing their son Francis from being vaccinated against the disease that subsequently killed him.&lt;ref&gt;Coss, Stephen. [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/benjamin-franklin-estranged-wife-nearly-two-decades-180964400/ "What Led Benjamin Franklin to Live Estranged From His Wife for Nearly Two Decades?"], ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' (September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah wrote to him in November 1769 saying she was ill due to "dissatisfied distress" from his prolonged absence, but he did not return until his business was done.&lt;ref&gt;November 1769 [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=16&amp;page=230a Letter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615055537/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=16&amp;page=230a |date=June 15, 2018 }} from Deborah Read to Ben Franklin, ''franklinpapers.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Read Franklin died of a stroke in 1774, while Franklin was on an extended mission to England; he returned in 1775.

===William Franklin===
{{see also|William Franklin}}
[[File:WilliamFranklin.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[William Franklin]]]]

In 1730, 24-year-old Franklin publicly acknowledged the existence of his son William, who was deemed "illegitimate," as he was born out of wedlock, and raised him in his household. His mother's identity is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Skemp SL. ''William Franklin: Son of a Patriot, Servant of a King'', Oxford University Press US, 1990, {{ISBN|0195057457}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in Philadelphia. Beginning at about age 30, William studied law in London in the early 1760s. He fathered an illegitimate son, [[William Temple Franklin]], born February 22, 1762. The boy's mother was never identified, and he was placed in foster care. Later in 1762, William married Elizabeth Downes, daughter of a [[plantation|planter]] from [[Barbados]]. After William passed the bar, his father helped him gain an appointment in 1763 as the last [[List of colonial governors of New Jersey|Royal Governor]] of New Jersey.

A [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], William and his father eventually broke relations over their differences about the American Revolutionary War. The elder Franklin could never accept William's position. Deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey, William was arrested at his home in [[Perth Amboy]] at the [[Proprietary House]] and imprisoned for a time. The younger Franklin went to New York in 1782, which was still occupied by British troops. He became leader of the Board of Associated Loyalists—a quasi-military organization, headquartered in New York City. They initiated guerrilla forays into [[New Jersey]], southern [[Connecticut]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] counties north of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Thomas, ''The Perils of Peace: America's Struggle for Survival'', (Collins, New York, 2007) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; When British troops evacuated from New York, William Franklin left with them and sailed to England. He settled in London, never to return to North America. In the preliminary peace talks in 1782 with Britain, "...&amp;nbsp;Benjamin Franklin insisted that loyalists who had borne arms against the United States would be excluded from this plea (that they be given a general pardon). He was undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success as an author===
[[File:The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle Vol 1, January, 1741.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin's ''The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle'' (Jan. 1741)]]

In 1733, Franklin began to publish the noted ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' (with content both original and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. "Poor Richard's Proverbs", adages from this almanac, such as "A penny saved is twopence dear" (often misquoted as "A penny saved is a penny earned") and "Fish and visitors stink in three days", remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and Franklin's readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year—it became an institution.{{sfn|Van Doren|1938|p=109}} In 1741 Franklin began publishing ''The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle for all the British Plantations in America'', the first such monthly magazine of this type published in America.

In 1758, the year he ceased writing for the Almanack, he printed ''Father Abraham's Sermon'', also known as ''[[The Way to Wealth]]''. Franklin's [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]], begun in 1771 but published after his death, has become one of the classics of the genre.

==Inventions and scientific inquiries==
{{Further|Social contributions and studies by Benjamin Franklin}}
Franklin was a prodigious inventor. Among his many creations were the [[lightning rod]], [[glass harmonica]] (a glass instrument, not to be confused with the [[Harmonica|metal harmonica]]), [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals|bifocal glasses]] and the flexible [[urinary catheterization|urinary catheter]]. Franklin never patented his inventions; in his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] he wrote, "...&amp;nbsp;as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Electricity===

Franklin started exploring the phenomenon of [[electricity]] in 1746 when he saw some of [[Archibald Spencer]]'s lectures using static electricity for illustrations.&lt;ref name=EncyColonial&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/science-and-medicine |title= Science and Medicine |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website= Colonial America Reference Library |publisher= Encyclopedia.com |access-date=February 27, 2017 |quote= Franklin's interest in electricity originated when he saw a traveling scientific lecturer, Archibald Spencer, perform an "electricity show" in Boston, Massachusetts. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin proposed that "vitreous" and "resinous" electricity were not different types of "[[Aether theories|electrical fluid]]" (as electricity was called then), but the same "fluid" under different pressures. (The same proposal was made independently that same year by [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]].) Franklin was the first to label them as [[electric charge|positive and negative]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin|date=May 25, 1747|title=Letter to Peter Collinson|journal=Franklin Papers|url=http://franklinpapers.org/franklin//framedVolumes.jsp?vol=3&amp;page=126b|accessdate=May 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020014725/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin//framedVolumes.jsp?vol=3&amp;page=126b|archive-date=October 20, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/FranklinBenjamin.html "Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790)"], ''Science World'', from Eric Weisstein's ''World of Scientific Biography''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was the first to discover the principle of [[charge conservation|conservation of charge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physchem.co.za/Static%20Electricity/Charge.htm |title=Conservation of Charge |accessdate=2006-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218104547/http://www.physchem.co.za/Static%20Electricity/Charge.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |df=mdy }}.

In recognition of his work with electricity, Franklin received the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]] in 1753, and in 1756 he became one of the few 18th-century Americans elected as a Fellow of the Society. He received honorary degrees from [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]] universities (his first).{{sfn|Va Doren|1938|p=168}} The [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|cgs]] unit of electric charge has been named after him: one ''franklin'' (Fr) is equal to one [[statcoulomb]].

Franklin advised Harvard University in its acquisition of new electrical laboratory apparatus after the complete loss of its original collection, in a fire which destroyed the original [[Harvard Hall]] in 1764. The collection he assembled would later become part of the [[Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments]], now on public display in its [[Harvard Science Center|Science Center]].&lt;ref name="Tomase"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomase|first1=Jennifer|title='A How-To Guide' explores Ben Franklin's 'can-do' legacy|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/06.01/10-franklin.html|accessdate=2016-08-09|work=Harvard University Gazette|date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin briefly investigated [[electrotherapy]], including the use of the [[electric bath (electrotherapy)|electric bath]].  This work led to the field becoming widely known.&lt;ref&gt;* Schiffer, Michael B, ''Draw the Lightning Down: Benjamin Franklin and Electrical Technology in the Age of Enlightenment'', pp. 136-137, 301, University of California Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0520248295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kite experiment and lightning rod====
{{main|Kite experiment}}
[[File:BEP-JONES-Franklin and Electricity.jpg|thumb|left|''Franklin and Electricity'' vignette [[Art and engraving on United States banknotes|engraved]] by the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] (c. 1860)]]

In 1750,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} he published a proposal for an experiment to prove that [[lightning]] is electricity by [[Kite experiment|flying a kite in a storm]] that appeared capable of becoming a lightning storm. On May 10, 1752, [[Thomas-François Dalibard]] of France conducted Franklin's experiment using a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} iron rod instead of a kite, and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. On June 15 Franklin may possibly have conducted his well-known kite experiment [[St. Stephen's Episcopal Church (Philadelphia)|in Philadelphia]], successfully extracting sparks from a cloud. Franklin described the experiment in the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' on October 19, 1752,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin, [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=4&amp;page=360a "The Kite Experiment"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102183234/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=4&amp;page=360a |date=November 2, 2017 }}, printed in ''[[The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', October 19, 1752.

Retrieved February 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Priestley]] published an account with additional details in his 1767 ''History and Present Status of Electricity''. Franklin was careful to stand on an insulator, keeping dry under a roof to avoid the danger of [[electric shock]].{{sfn|Van Doren|1938|p=159}} Others, such as Prof. [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] in [[Russia]], were indeed electrocuted in performing lightning experiments during the months immediately following Franklin's experiment.

In his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of [[ground (electricity)|electrical ground]]. Franklin did not perform this experiment in the way that is often pictured in popular literature, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it would have been dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mos.org/sln/toe/kite.html ''Franklin's Kite''], Museum of Science, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, showing that lightning was electrical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On October 19 in a letter to England with directions for repeating the experiment, Franklin wrote:

{{quote|When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial, or [[Leyden jar]], may be charged: and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all other electric experiments [may be] performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube; and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening completely demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, A., ''History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century''. New York, 1939. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Franklin's electrical experiments led to his invention of the [[lightning rod]]. He said that conductors with a sharp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/14/science/lightning-rods-franklin-had-it-wrong.html |title=''Lightning Rods: Franklin Had It Wrong'' |accessdate=2018-03-16 |work=New York Times |date=1983-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a smooth point could discharge silently, and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this could help protect buildings from lightning by attaching "upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground;&amp;nbsp;... Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!" Following a series of experiments on Franklin's own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=''Benjamin Franklin and Lightning Rods'' |volume=59 |page=42 |author=Krider, Philip |journal=Physics Today |date=January 2006|doi=10.1063/1.2180176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population studies===
Franklin had a major influence on the emerging science of [[demography]], or population studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dr. Alan Houston| title=Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMN9VEhrTxwC&amp;pg=PA106| year=2008| publisher=Yale U.P.| pages=106–41| isbn=978-0300152395}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]] is noted for his rule of population growth and credited Franklin for discovering it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=I.

Norton| page=87| isbn=978-0393057690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kammen (1990) and Drake (2011) say Franklin's "[[Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.|Observations on the Increase of Mankind]]" (1755) stands alongside [[Ezra Stiles]]' "Discourse on Christian Union" (1760) as the leading works of eighteenth-century Anglo-American demography; Drake credits Franklin's "wide readership and prophetic insight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=James David Drake| title=The Nation's Nature: How Continental Presumptions Gave Rise to the United States of America| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWV9T2MT5SoC&amp;pg=PA63| year=2011| publisher=U. of Virginia Press| page=63| isbn=978-0813931227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Michael G.

In the 1730s and 1740s, Franklin began taking notes on population growth, finding that the American population had the fastest growth rate on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=J. A. Leo Lemay| title=The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 3: Soldier, Scientist, and Politician, 1748–1757| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NL5bcRP5aRAC&amp;pg=PA245| year=2008| publisher=U. of Pennsylvania Press| page=245| isbn=978-0812241211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing that population growth depended on food supplies—a line of thought later developed by [[Thomas Malthus]]—Franklin emphasized the abundance of food and available farmland in America. He calculated that America's population was doubling every twenty years and would surpass that of England in a century.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751, he drafted "Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &amp;c." Four years later, it was anonymously printed in Boston, and it was quickly reproduced in Britain, where it influenced the economist [[Adam Smith]] and later the demographer [[Thomas Malthus]]. Franklin's predictions alarmed British leaders who did not want to be surpassed by the colonies, so they became more willing to impose restrictions on the colonial economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Owen Aldridge | first1 = Alfred | year = 1949 | title = Franklin as Demographer | journal = Journal of Economic History | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 25–44 | jstor=2113719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was also a pioneer in the study of slave demography, as shown in his 1755 essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=George William Van Cleve| title=A Slaveholders' Union: Slavery, Politics, and the Constitution in the Early American Republic| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dgp26Y2KzxUC&amp;pg=PA148| year= 2010| publisher=U. of Chicago Press| page=148| isbn=978-0226846699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic Ocean currents===
As deputy postmaster, Franklin became interested in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] circulation patterns. While in England in 1768, he heard a complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packet ships carrying mail several weeks longer to reach New York than it took an average merchant ship to reach [[Newport, Rhode Island]]? The merchantmen had a longer and more complex voyage because they left from London, while the packets left from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in Cornwall.

Franklin put the question to his cousin Timothy Folger, a [[Nantucket]] whaler captain, who told him that merchant ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid-ocean current. The mail packet captains sailed dead into it, thus fighting an adverse current of {{convert|3|mph|km/h|0}}. Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the current and name it the [[Gulf Stream]], by which it is still known today.

Franklin published his Gulf Stream chart in 1770 in England, where it was completely ignored. Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786. The British edition of the chart, which was the original, was so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson, a [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole oceanographer]] and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Philip L. Richardson (February 8, 1980), "Benjamin Franklin and Timothy Folger's first printed chart of the Gulf Stream", ''Science'', vol. 207, no. 4431, pp. 643–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/special_packages/inquirer/How_Franklin_s_chart_resurfaced.html "How Franklin's chart resurfaced"], ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', posted December 18, 2005, accessed November 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This find received front-page coverage in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John N. Wilford, "Prints of Franklin's chart of Gulf Stream found", ''New York Times'' (N.Y., N.Y.), pp. A1, B7 (February 6, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

It took many years for British sea captains to adopt Franklin's advice on navigating the current; once they did, they were able to trim two weeks from their sailing time.&lt;ref&gt;1785: Benjamin Franklin's "Sundry Maritime Observations,"
 The Academy of Natural Sciences, April 1939&amp;nbsp;m&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html ''1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations' ''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002000344/http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html |date=October 2, 2008 }} NOAA Ocean Explorer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, the oceanographer and cartographer [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] noted that while Franklin charted and codified the Gulf Stream, he did not discover it:

{{quote|Though it was Dr. Franklin and Captain Tim Folger, who first turned the Gulf Stream to nautical account, the discovery that there was a Gulf Stream cannot be said to belong to either of them, for its existence was known to [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], and to [[Sir Humphrey Gilbert]], in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Source: ''Explanations and Sailing Directions to Accompany the Wind and Current Charts'', 1853, p. 53, by [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wave theory of light===
Franklin was, along with his contemporary [[Leonhard Euler]], the only major scientist who supported [[Christiaan Huygens]]'s [[wave theory of light]], which was basically ignored by the rest of the [[scientific community]]. In the 18th century [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[corpuscular theory of light|corpuscular theory]] was held to be true; only after [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young's]] well-known [[slit experiment]] in 1803 were most scientists persuaded to believe Huygens's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Jogn Gribbin, "In search of Schrödinger's cat", Black Swan, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meteorology===
On October 21, 1743, according to popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Franklin was said to have noted that the [[prevailing winds]] were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, Franklin learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept that greatly influenced [[meteorology]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidorn, Keith C. Heidorn, PhD. [http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2003/alm03oct.htm ''Eclipsed By Storm''.] The Weather Doctor. October 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Icelandic volcanic eruption of [[Laki]] in 1783, and the subsequent harsh European winter of 1784, Franklin made observations connecting the causal nature of these two separate events. He wrote about them in a lecture series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~volcano/Fr373p77.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traction kiting===
Though Benjamin Franklin has been most noted kite-wise with his lightning experiments, he has also been noted by many for his using kites to pull humans and ships across waterways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34193/34193-h/34193-h.htm| title= The True Benjamin Franklin| first= Sydney George| last= Fisher| year=1903 |publisher=J.

Lippincott Company| location=Philadelphia| edition=5|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Pocock (inventor)|George Pocock]] in the book ''A TREATISE on The Aeropleustic Art, or Navigation in the Air, by means of Kites, or Buoyant Sails''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMo-DVp_ypUC| title= A TREATISE on The Aeropleustic Art, or Navigation in the Air, by means of Kites, or Buoyant Sails| first=George| last=Pocock| page=9| publisher=Longmans, Brown, and Co.| location=London| year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted being inspired by Benjamin Franklin's traction of his body by kite power across a waterway. In his later years he suggested using the technique for pulling ships.

===Concept of cooling===
Franklin noted a principle of [[refrigeration]] by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments. In 1758 on a warm day in [[Cambridge]], England, Franklin and fellow scientist [[John Hadley (chemist)|John Hadley]] experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury [[thermometer]] with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and using [[bellows]] to evaporate the ether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |title=The Writings of Benjamin Franklin: London, 1757–1775 |publisher=Historycarper.com |accessdate=September 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128075748/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |archivedate=January 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With each subsequent [[evaporation]], the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching {{convert|7|F}}. Another thermometer showed that the room temperature was constant at {{convert|65|F}}. In his letter ''[[Cooling by Evaporation]]'', Franklin noted that, "One may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day."

===Temperature's effect on electrical conductivity===
According to [[Michael Faraday]], Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice are worth mentioning, although the law of the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes is not attributed to Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faraday |first=Michael |title=Experimental researches in electricity |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XuITAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=non-conduction+of+ice#v=onepage&amp;q=non-conduction%20of%20ice |page=v |volume=2 |year=1839 |publisher=R. &amp; J.E. Taylor |quote=...&amp;nbsp;Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as reported in 1836 by Prof. A. D. Bache of the University of Pennsylvania, the law of the effect of heat on the conduction of bodies otherwise non-conductors, for example, glass, could be attributed to Franklin. Franklin writes, "...&amp;nbsp;A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies good conductors, that will not otherwise conduct&amp;nbsp;..." and again, "...&amp;nbsp;And water, though naturally a good conductor, will not conduct well when frozen into ice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Thomas P. |title=Journal of the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zV9DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=Thomas+P.+Jones+1836+Journal+of+the+Franklin+Institute+vol.xvii |pages=182–83 |year=1836 |quote=In the fourth series of his electrical researches, Mr. Faraday&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceanography findings===

===Decision-making===
In a 1772 letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], Franklin lays out the earliest known description of the Pro &amp; Con list,&lt;ref name="decisions"&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Franklin |year=1975 |origyear=1772 |chapter=To Joseph Priestley |editor-last=Willcox |editor-first=William Bradford |title=The papers of Benjamin Franklin: January 1 through December 31, 1772 |volume=19 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=299–300 |isbn=978-0300018653 |oclc=310601 |chapterurl=http://franklinpapers.org/yale?vol=19&amp;page=299a |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; a common [[decision-making]] technique, now sometimes called a [[decisional balance sheet]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;my Way is, to divide half a Sheet of Paper by a Line into two Columns, writing over the one ''Pro'', and over the other ''Con''. Then during three or four Days Consideration I put down under the different Heads short Hints of the different Motives that at different Times occur to me for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a Reason ''pro'' equal to some two Reasons ''con'', I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons ''con'' equal to some three Reasons ''pro'', I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.&lt;ref name="decisions" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oil on water===
While traveling on a ship, Franklin had observed that the wake of a ship [[storm oil|was diminished]] when the cooks scuttled their greasy water. He studied the effects on a large pond in [[Clapham Common]], London. "I fetched out a cruet of oil and dropt a little of it on the water&amp;nbsp;... though not more than a teaspoon full, produced an instant calm over a space of several yards square." He later used the trick to "calm the waters" by carrying "a little oil in the hollow joint of my cane".&lt;ref&gt;*W. Gratzer, Eurekas and Euphorias, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical endeavors==
[[File:Glassharmonica.png|thumb|[[Glass harmonica]]]]

Franklin is known to have played the violin, the [[harp]], and the guitar. He also composed music, notably a [[string quartet]] in [[classical period (music)|early classical style]]. While he was in London, he developed a much-improved version of the [[glass harmonica]], in which the glasses rotate on a shaft, with the player's fingers held steady, instead of the other way around. He worked with the London glassblower Charles James to create it, and instruments based on his mechanical version soon found their way to other parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Thomas.

==Chess==
Franklin was an avid [[chess]] player. He was playing chess by around 1733, making him the first chess player known by name in the American colonies.&lt;ref name="McCraryChessandFranklin"&gt;John McCrary, [http://www.benfranklin300.org/_etc_pdf/Chess_John_McCrary.pdf ''Chess and Benjamin Franklin-His Pioneering Contributions''] ([[PDF]]).

Retrieved December 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He and a friend also used chess as a means of learning the [[Italian language]], which both were studying; the winner of each game between them had the right to assign a task, such as parts of the Italian grammar to be learned by heart, to be performed by the loser before their next meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Temple Franklin]], ''Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Benjamin Franklin'', reprinted in Knight, ''Chess Pieces'', pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was able to play chess more frequently against stronger opposition during his many years as a civil servant and diplomat in England, where the game was far better established than in America. He was able to improve his playing standard by facing more experienced players during this period. He regularly attended [[Old Slaughter's Coffee House]] in London for chess and socializing, making many important personal contacts. While in Paris, both as a visitor and later as ambassador, he visited the famous [[Café de la Régence]], which France's strongest players made their regular meeting place. No records of his games have survived, so it is not possible to ascertain his playing strength in modern terms.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Chess in Fifty Moves'', by Bill Price, Firefly Books (U.S.) Inc., Buffalo, New York, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1770855298}}, pp. 90–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was inducted into the [[World Chess Hall of Fame|U.S. Chess Hall of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="McCraryChessandFranklin"/&gt; The Franklin Mercantile Chess Club in Philadelphia, the second oldest chess club in the U.S., is named in his honor.

==Public life==

===Early steps in Pennsylvania===
[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|''[[Join, or Die]]'': This political cartoon by Franklin urged the colonies to join together during the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]).]]

In 1736, Franklin created the [[Union Fire Company]], one of the first [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighting companies]] in America. In the same year, he printed a new currency for [[New Jersey]] based on innovative anti-[[counterfeit]]ing techniques he had devised. Throughout his career, Franklin was an advocate for [[Banknote|paper money]], publishing ''A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency'' in 1729, and his printer printed money. He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped [[deflation]] without causing excessive inflation. In 1766 he made a case for paper money to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. (1975). ''Money: Where It Came, Whence It Went'', pp. 54–54. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he first devised a scheme for [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia|The Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia]]. However, the person he had in mind to run the academy, Rev. [[Richard Peters (priest)|Richard Peters]], refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749, when he printed his own pamphlet, ''Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania.''&lt;ref name="MontgomeryHistory"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of the University of Pennsylvania from Its Foundation to A.D. 1770 | publisher=George W. Jacobs &amp; Co. | author=Montgomery, Thomas Harrison | year=1900 | location=Philadelphia | lccn=00003240}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} He was appointed president of the Academy on November 13, 1749; the Academy and the Charity School opened on August 13, 1751.

In 1743, Franklin founded the [[American Philosophical Society]] to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

In 1747, Franklin (already a very wealthy man) retired from printing and went into other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Green, "English Books and Printing in the Age of Franklin", in ''The Colonial Book in the Atlantic World'' (2002), 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He created a partnership with his foreman, [[David Hall (publisher)|David Hall]], which provided Franklin with half of the shop's profits for 18 years. This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study, and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with educated persons throughout Europe and especially in France.

[[File:PennsylvaniaHospitalWilliamStrickland.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[Pennsylvania Hospital]] by [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]], 1755]]

Franklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman, in June 1749 he became a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Philadelphia, and in 1751 he was elected to the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Pennsylvania Assembly]]. On August 10, 1753, Franklin was appointed deputy postmaster-general of [[British North America]], ([[Benjamin Franklin#Postmaster|see below]]). His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, with mail sent out every week.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

In 1751, Franklin and [[Thomas Bond (physician)|Dr. Thomas Bond]] obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] was the first hospital in what was to become the United States of America.

In 1752, Franklin organized the [[Philadelphia Contributionship]], the first [[homeowner's insurance]] company in what would become the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landers|first1=Jackson|title=In the Early 19th Century, Firefighters Fought Fires ... and Each Other|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/early-19-century-firefighters-fought-fires-each-other-180960391/|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|date=September 27, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGuire|first1=Virginia|title=What Are Those Little Shields Above the Doorways of Philadelphia Homes?|url=http://www.phillymag.com/property/2013/05/03/the-storied-fire-marks-of-philadelphia/|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]|publisher=[[Metrocorp]]|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1757 UPenn Seal.png|thumb|upright|Seal of the College of Philadelphia]]

Between 1750 and 1753, the "educational triumvirate"&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Neil C., ''Pursuing Happiness: The Organizational Culture of the Continental Congress'', Nonagram Publications, {{ISBN|978-1480065505}}, 2013, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the American [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]] of [[Stratford, Connecticut]], and the immigrant Scottish schoolteacher [[William Smith (Episcopal priest)|Dr. William Smith]] built on Franklin's initial scheme and created what [[James Madison (bishop)|Bishop James Madison]], president of the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], called a "new-model"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Horace Wemyss, ''The Life and Correspondence of the Rev. Wm. Smith, D.D.'', Philadelphia, 1880, Volume 1: pp. 566–67.&lt;/ref&gt; plan or style of American college. Franklin solicited, printed in 1752, and promoted an American textbook of [[ethics|moral philosophy]] from the American [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]] titled ''Elementa Philosophica''&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''Elementa philosophica: containing chiefly, Noetica, or things relating to the mind or understanding: and Ethica, or things relating to the moral behaviour. Philadelphia'', Printed by B. Franklin and D. Hall, at the new-printing-office, near the market, 1752&lt;/ref&gt; to be taught in the new colleges to replace courses in denominational divinity.

In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, pp. 163–274&lt;/ref&gt; They decided the new-model college would focus on the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson went on to found King's College (now [[Columbia University]]) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as Provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and one as [[Master of Arts]]. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The College was to become influential in guiding [[:Template:Founding Documents of America|the founding documents of the United States]]: in the [[Continental Congress]], for example, over one third of the college-affiliated men who contributed the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'' between September 4, 1774, and July 4, 1776, were affiliated with the College.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1753, both [[Harvard University|Harvard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu/honorary-degrees Honorary Degrees] Harvard University.

[[File:Sketch of Tun Tavern in the Revolutionary War.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the original [[Tun Tavern]]]]

In 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the [[Albany Congress]]. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the [[Board of Trade]] in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad [[Albany Plan|Plan of Union]] for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

In 1756, Franklin received an honorary [[master of arts]] degree from the [[College of William and Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=College of William and Mary |first=College of William and Mary |date=1874 |title=The History of the College of William and Mary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfaiLj00yFYC&amp;pg=PA48 |location=Richmond, VA |publisher=J. W. Randolph &amp; English |page=148|isbn=9781429043335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1756, Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia (see "Associated Regiment of Philadelphia" under heading of Pennsylvania's 103rd Artillery and [[111th Infantry Regiment (United States)|111th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Continental Army]]). He used [[Tun Tavern]] as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] uprisings that beset the American colonies. Reportedly Franklin was elected "Colonel" of the Associated Regiment but declined the honor.

===Decades in London===
From the mid 1750s to the mid 1770s, Franklin spent much of his time in London. Officially he was there on a political mission, but he used his time to further his scientific explorations as well, meeting many notable people.

In 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the [[Penn family]], the [[proprietary colony|proprietors of the colony]]. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly, and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in [[Whitehall]] led to the failure of this mission.

[[File:US-Colonial (PA-115)-Pennsylvania-18 Jun 1764.jpg|thumb|left|Pennsylvania colonial currency printed by Franklin in 1764]]

At this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with [[List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania#Proprietors|William Penn's heirs]], who controlled the colony as proprietors. After his return to the colony, Franklin led the "anti-proprietary party" in the struggle against the Penn family, and was elected [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Speaker of the Pennsylvania House]] in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched Franklin to England again to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship. During this trip, events drastically changed the nature of his mission.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;J. A. Leo Lematy, "Franklin, Benjamin". ''[[American National Biography]] Online'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, Franklin opposed the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]]. Unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia. Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and he testified during the House of Commons proceedings that led to its repeal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Charles Hoffer, ''Benjamin Franklin Explains the Stamp Act Protests to Parliament, 1766'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin Franklin 1767.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin in London, 1767, wearing a blue suit with elaborate gold braid and buttons, a far cry from the simple dress he affected at the [[Court (royal)|French court]] in later years. Painting by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]], displayed in the [[White House]].]]

With this, Franklin suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in England. He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies. [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Massachusetts]] also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.&lt;ref name="ANB" /&gt;

Franklin lodged in a house in Craven Street, just off [[Strand, London|The Strand]] in [[central London]]. During his stays there, he developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson, and her circle of friends and relations, in particular her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly. Their house, which he used on various lengthy missions from 1757 to 1775, is the only one of his residences to survive. It opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]] museum in 2006.

Whilst in London, Franklin became involved in radical politics. He belonged to a [[gentleman's club]] (which he called "the honest Whigs"), which held stated meetings, and included members such as [[Richard Price]], the minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] who ignited the [[Revolution Controversy]], and [[Andrew Kippis]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Wu, ''William Hazlitt (1737-1820), the Priestley Circle, and "The Theological Repository:" A Brief Survey and Bibliography'', The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 56, No. 227 (Nov., 2005), pp. 758–766, at p. 762. Published by: Oxford University Press {{jstor|3661246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1756, Franklin had become a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce (now the [[Royal Society of Arts]] or RSA), which had been founded in 1754 and whose early meetings took place in [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|Covent Garden coffee shops]]. After his return to the United States in 1775, Franklin became the Society's Corresponding Member, continuing a close connection. The RSA instituted a [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.

The study of [[natural philosophy]] (what we would call science) drew him into overlapping circles of acquaintance. Franklin was, for example, a corresponding member of the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], which included such other scientific and industrial luminaries as [[Matthew Boulton]], [[James Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]]; on occasion he visited them.

In 1759, the [[University of St Andrews]] awarded Franklin an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in recognition of his accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/people-franklin-resume.htm|title=Benjamin Franklin's Resume – Independence National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Oxford University]] in 1762. Because of these honors, Franklin was often addressed as "Dr. Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benjamin-Franklin|title=Benjamin Franklin – American author, scientist, and statesman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin also managed to secure an appointed post for his illegitimate son, [[William Franklin]], by then an attorney, as [[Governor of New Jersey|Colonial Governor of New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;

While living in London in 1768, [[Benjamin Franklin's phonetic alphabet|he developed a phonetic alphabet]] in ''A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling''. This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. This alphabet never caught on, and he eventually lost interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/franklin.htm ''Benjamin Franklin's Phonetic Alphabet''.] Omniglot.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travels around Britain and Ireland===
Franklin used London as a base to travel. In 1771, he made short journeys through different parts of England, staying with [[Joseph Priestley]] at [[Leeds]], [[Thomas Percival]] at [[Manchester]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]] at [[Lichfield]].&lt;ref name="sparks"&gt;Sparks, Jared. [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/biography/chap05.htm ''Life of Benjamin Franklin''.] US History.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, he spent five days with [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Lord Kames]] near [[Stirling]] and stayed for three weeks with [[David Hume]] in Edinburgh. In 1759, he visited [[Edinburgh]] with his son, and recalled his conversations there as "the ''densest'' happiness of my life".&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, James. ''Crowded with Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment: Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind''. HarperCollins Publishers. 2003. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1759, the [[University of St Andrews]] awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. From then he was known as "Doctor Franklin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaustad|first=Edwin S|title=Benjamin Franklin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrnUhKvBumAC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=May 1, 2016|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=40|isbn=978-0199709366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of the same year he was granted [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the Borough]] of [[St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.katekennedyclub.org.uk/news.aspx#19 |title=The Kate Kennedy Club |publisher=The Kate Kennedy Club |accessdate=September 21, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327111941/http://katekennedyclub.org.uk/news.aspx |archivedate= March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had never been to Ireland before, and met and stayed with [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], who he believed was especially attentive. Franklin noted of him that "all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=BL1VXdTbDucC&amp;pg=PR21 |title= Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin  |editor=Nathan Haskell Dole |year=  2003|accessdate=September 21, 2009|isbn=978-0766143753}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dublin]], Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor.&lt;ref name="sparks" /&gt; While touring Ireland, he was moved by the level of poverty he saw. Ireland's economy was affected by the same trade regulations and laws of Britain that governed America. Franklin feared that America could suffer the same effects should Britain's "colonial exploitation" continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/exp_worldly_ireland.html ''Benjamin Franklin''.] PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visits to Europe===
Franklin spent two months in German lands in 1766, but his connections to the country stretched across a lifetime. He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] for his early studies of electricity. Franklin also co-authored the first [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (Prussia–United States)|treaty of friendship]] between Prussia and America in 1785.

In September 1767, Franklin visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, [[John Pringle (physician)|Sir John Pringle]]. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]].&lt;ref name="isaacson"&gt;Isaacson, Walter. ''Benjamin Franklin: An American Life''. Simon &amp; Schuster. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defending the American cause===
One line of argument in Parliament was that Americans should pay a share of the costs of the [[French and Indian War]], and that therefore taxes should be levied on them. Franklin became the American spokesman in highly publicized testimony in Parliament in 1766. He stated that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said local governments had raised, outfitted and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the [[French and Indian War]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James A. Henretta, ed.|first=|title=Documents for America's History, Volume 1: To 1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_rsacFjVCAC&amp;pg=PA110|year=2011|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|page=110|isbn=978-0312648626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|title=Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L64OOJGaCKIC&amp;pg=PA229|year=2004|pages=229–30|isbn=978-0743258074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1773, Franklin published two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: [[s:Rules By Which A Great Empire May Be Reduced To A Small One|"Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One"]], and "An Edict by the King of Prussia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/pa-1773.htm| title=reprinted on The History Carper| last=Franklin| first=Benjamin| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103051246/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/pa-1773.htm| archivedate=January 3, 2006| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hutchinson letters leak===
{{main|Hutchinson Letters Affair}}
In 1772, Franklin obtained private letters of [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and [[Andrew Oliver]], governor and lieutenant governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], proving that they had encouraged the Crown to crack down on Bostonians. Franklin sent them to America, where they escalated the tensions. The letters were finally [[News leak|leaked]] to the public in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' in mid-June 1773,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailyn|first=Bernard|title=The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson|location=Cambridge, MA|year=1974|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674641600|oclc=6825524}}, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England.&lt;ref name=Penegar29&gt;{{cite book|last=Penegar|first=Kenneth|title=The Political Trial of Benjamin Franklin|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-0875868493|location=New York|oclc=696296728}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The British began to regard him as the fomenter of serious trouble. Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Alexander Wedderburn]], before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on January 29, 1774. He returned to Philadelphia in March 1775, and abandoned his accommodationist stance.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila L. Skemp, ''The Making of a Patriot: Benjamin Franklin at the Cockpit'' (Oxford University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coming of revolution===
In 1763, soon after Franklin returned to Pennsylvania from England for the first time, the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The [[Paxton Boys]], a group of settlers convinced that the Pennsylvania government was not doing enough to protect them from [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] raids, murdered a group of peaceful [[Susquehannock]] Indians and marched on Philadelphia. Franklin helped to organize a local [[militia]] to defend the capital against the mob. He met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse. Franklin wrote a scathing attack against the [[racism|racial prejudice]] of the Paxton Boys. "If an ''Indian'' injures me", he asked, "does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all ''Indians''?"&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin. [http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/massacre.htm "A Narrative of the Late Massacres&amp;nbsp;..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427070508/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/massacre.htm |date=April 27, 2006 }} reprinted on The History Carper.&lt;/ref&gt;

He provided an early response to British surveillance through his own network of [[Surveillance art|counter-surveillance and manipulation]]. "He waged a public relations campaign, secured secret aid, played a role in privateering expeditions, and churned out effective and inflammatory propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Crews| first= Ed| title= Spies and Scouts, Secret Writing, and Sympathetic Citizens| journal= Colonial Williamsburg Journal| url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/Summer04/spies.cfm| date= Summer 2004| accessdate=April 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, 1775, after his second mission to Great Britain, the [[American Revolution]] had begun—with fighting between colonials and British at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]. The New England militia had trapped the main British army in Boston. The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. In June 1776, he was appointed a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although he was temporarily disabled by [[gout]] and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several "small but important"&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, pp. 311–12&lt;/ref&gt; changes to the draft sent to him by [[Thomas Jefferson]].

At the signing, he is quoted as having replied to a comment by [[John Hancock]] that they must all hang together: "Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Postmaster===
&lt;!--The 'Franklin on US Postage' section links to this section/image file. --&gt;
[[File:Franklin SC1 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|First issue of Benjamin Franklin on US [[Benjamin Franklin#Franklin on U.S. Postage|postage stamp]], issue of 1847]]

Well known as a printer and publisher, Franklin was appointed postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, holding the office until 1753, when he and publisher [[William Hunter (publisher)|William Hunter]] were named deputy postmasters–general of British North America, the first to hold the office. ([[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom#Two Postmasters General|Joint appointments]] were standard at the time, for political reasons.) Franklin was responsible for the British colonies from Pennsylvania north and east, as far as the [[Newfoundland (island)|island of Newfoundland]]. A post office for local and outgoing mail had been established in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], by local stationer Benjamin Leigh, on April 23, 1754, but service was irregular. Franklin opened the first post office to offer regular, monthly mail in what would later become Canada, at Halifax, on December 9, 1755. Meantime, Hunter became postal administrator in [[Colonial Williamsburg|Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]] and oversaw areas south of [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]]. Franklin reorganized the service's accounting system, then improved speed of delivery between Philadelphia, New York and Boston. By 1761, efficiencies led to the first profits for the colonial post office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cpm/chrono/ch1753ae.shtml "1753 Benjamin Franklin"], Stéphanie Ouellet, in A Chronology of Canadian Postal History, National Museum of History, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lands of [[New France]] were ceded to the British under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, the new British [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|province of Quebec]] was created among them, and Franklin saw mail service expanded between [[Montreal]], [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec City]], and New York. For the greater part of his appointment, Franklin lived in England (from 1757 to 1762, and again from 1764 to 1774)—about three-quarters of his term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cpm/chrono/chs1760e.shtml#yr-1774 "1760–1840 Planting the Imperial Postal System in British North America"], A Chronology of Canadian Postal History, National Museum of History, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, his sympathies for the rebel cause in the American Revolution led to his dismissal on January 31, 1774.

On July 26, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] established the [[United States Postal Service|United States Post Office]] and named Benjamin Franklin as the first [[United States Postmaster General]]. Franklin had been a postmaster for decades and was a natural choice for the position.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson. ''Benjamin Franklin: an American life'', pp. 206–09, 301&lt;/ref&gt; He had just returned from England and was appointed chairman of a Committee of Investigation to establish a postal system. The report of the Committee, providing for the appointment of a postmaster general for the 13 American colonies, was considered by the Continental Congress on July 25 and 26. On July 26, 1775, Franklin was appointed Postmaster General, the first appointed under the Continental Congress. It established a postal system that became the United States Post Office, a system that continues to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blmailus1.htm#CONGRESS |title=History of the United States Postal Systems |publisher=Inventors.about.com |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Friedrich Christoph Schlosser]] remarked at the time, with ample hyperbole, that "Such was the number of portraits, busts and medallions of him in circulation before he left Paris, that he would have been recognized from them by any adult citizen in any part of the civilized world."&amp;nbsp;– {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Franklin, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In December 1776, Franklin was dispatched to France as [[commissioner]] for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/ead/upenn_rbml_MsColl900 Benjamin Franklin papers], [http://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak/ Kislak Center for Special Collections], Rare Books and Manuscripts, University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; He took with him as secretary his 16-year-old grandson, [[William Temple Franklin]]. They lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of [[Passy]], donated by [[Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont]], who supported the United States. Franklin remained in France until 1785. He conducted the affairs of his country toward the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and negotiating the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]].

Among his associates in France was [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]]—a French Revolutionary writer, orator and statesman who in early 1791 would be elected president of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.isthisjefferson.org/DLP_D04.html?zoom_highlight=Franklin The Book in the Painting: De la Caisse d'Escompte]." [http://www.isthisjefferson.org/DLP_D04.html?zoom_highlight=Franklin isthisjefferson.org] Accessed February 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1784, Franklin met with Mirabeau and contributed anonymous materials that the Frenchman used in his first signed work: ''Considerations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_39568#page/n3/mode/2up  ''Considerations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus''], December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was critical of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], established in the United States. Franklin and Mirabeau thought of it as a "noble order", inconsistent with the [[egalitarian]] ideals of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Van Doren, Carl. ''Benjamin Franklin'' (The Viking Press: New York). 1938. pp. 709–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay in France, Benjamin Franklin was active as a [[freemasonry|Freemason]], serving as Venerable Master of the Lodge [[Les Neuf Sœurs]] from 1779 until 1781. He was the 106th member of the Lodge. In 1784, when [[Franz Mesmer]] began to publicize his theory of "[[animal magnetism]]" which was considered offensive by many, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] appointed a commission to investigate it. These included the chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the physician [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], and Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Stephan A.

[[File:Libertas Americana silver medallion 1783.jpg|thumb|While in France Franklin designed and commissioned [[Augustin Dupré]] to engrave the medallion ''"Libertas Americana"'' minted in Paris in 1783.]]

Franklin's advocacy for religious tolerance in France contributed to arguments made by French philosophers and politicians that resulted in [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s signing of the [[Edict of Versailles]] in November 1787. This edict effectively nullified the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], which had denied non-Catholics civil status and the right to openly practice their faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html "Edict of Versailles (1787)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html |date=July 14, 2012 }}, ''Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals'', downloaded January 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin also served as American minister to Sweden, although he never visited that country.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} He negotiated a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Sweden)|treaty]] that was signed in April 1783. On August 27, 1783, in Paris, Franklin witnessed the world's first hydrogen [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] flight.&lt;ref name="EcceF"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5_7IRHZGyzMC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22jacques+charles%22+%22Eccentric+France%22&amp;q=%22jacques%20charles%22%20%22Eccentric%20France%22 |title=Eccentric France: Bradt Guide to mad, magical and marvellous France| author=Piers Letcher&amp;nbsp;– Jacques Charles |year= 2003|accessdate=March 17, 2010| isbn=978-1841620688}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Robert brothers#First hydrogen balloon|Le Globe]]'', created by professor [[Jacques Charles]] and [[Robert brothers|Les Frères Robert]], was watched by a vast crowd as it rose from the [[Champ de Mars]] (now the site of the [[Eiffel Tower]]).&lt;ref name="Sci&amp;Soc"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10447673 |title=Science and Society, Medal commemorating Charles and Robert's balloon ascent, Paris, 1783 |publisher=Scienceandsociety.co.uk |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin became so enthusiastic that he subscribed financially to the next project to build a manned hydrogen balloon.&lt;ref name="Fid Green"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fiddlersgreen.net/models/Aircraft/Balloon-Charles.html |title=Fiddlers Green, History of Ballooning, Jacques Charles |publisher=Fiddlersgreen.net |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1783, Franklin was seated in the special enclosure for honoured guests when ''[[Robert brothers#First manned hydrogen balloon flight|La Charlière]]'' took off from the [[Jardin des Tuileries]], piloted by Jacques Charles and [[Robert brothers|Nicolas-Louis Robert]].&lt;ref name="EcceF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAI"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fai.org/ballooning/newsletter/pr00-02.htm |title=Federation Aeronautique Internationale, Ballooning Commission, Hall of Fame, Robert Brothers |publisher=Fai.org |accessdate=March 17, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516222023/http://www.fai.org/ballooning/newsletter/pr00-02.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional Convention===
[[File:Franklin's return to Philadelphia 1785 cph.3g09906.jpg|thumb|''Franklin's return to Philadelphia, 1785'', by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]]]]

When he returned home in 1785, Franklin occupied a position only second to that of [[George Washington]] as the champion of American independence. Le Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by [[Joseph Duplessis]], which now hangs in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C. After his return, Franklin became an [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and freed his two slaves. He eventually became president of the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/l3_citizen_abolitionist.html ''Citizen Ben, Abolitionist''], PBS&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, Franklin served as a delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention]]. He held an honorary position and seldom engaged in debate. He is the only Founding Father who is a signatory of all four of the major documents of the founding of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] with France, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] and the [[United States Constitution]].

In 1787, a group of prominent ministers in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], proposed the foundation of a new college named in Franklin's honor. Franklin donated £200 towards the development of Franklin College (now called [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]]).

Between 1771 and 1788, he finished his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]]. While it was at first addressed to his son, it was later completed for the benefit of mankind at the request of a friend.

Franklin strongly supported the right to [[freedom of speech]]:

{{quote|In those wretched countries where a man cannot call his tongue his own, he can scarce call anything his own. Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech&amp;nbsp;...

Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom, and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech, which is the right of every man&amp;nbsp;...|[[Silence Dogood]] no. 8, 1722&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Coffman |editor1-first=Steve |title=Words of the Founding Fathers: Selected Quotations of Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton, with Sources |year=2012 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=978-0786458622| page=97| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PsFnB7FA11YC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===President of Pennsylvania===
[[File:FRANKLIN, Benjamin (signed check).jpg|thumb|Franklin autograph check signed during his Presidency of Pennsylvania]]

Special balloting conducted October 18, 1785, unanimously elected Franklin the sixth [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|president]] of the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania]], replacing [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]]. The office was practically that of [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|governor]]. Franklin held that office for slightly over three years, longer than any other, and served the constitutional limit of three full terms. Shortly after his initial election he was reelected to a full term on October 29, 1785, and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31, 1787. In that capacity he served as host to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''The First American'', pp. 654–55, 694&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtue, religion, and personal beliefs==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) MET DT2883.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Franklin by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]]]

Like the other advocates of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], Franklin emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous. All his life he explored the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in ''Poor Richard's'' [[aphorism]]s. Franklin felt that organized religion was necessary to keep men good to their fellow men, but rarely attended religious services himself.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Autobiography'', ed. Lemay, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; When Franklin met [[Voltaire]] in Paris and asked his fellow member of the Enlightenment vanguard to bless his grandson, Voltaire said in English, "God and Liberty", and added, "this is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pedro Américo - Voltaire abençoando o neto de Franklin em nome de Deus e da Liberdade.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Voltaire blessing Franklin's grandson, in the name of God and Liberty'', by [[Pedro Américo]]]]

Franklin's parents were both pious [[Puritan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;5–18&lt;/ref&gt; The family attended the [[Old South Church]], the most liberal Puritan congregation in Boston, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Old South Church |url=http://www.oldsouth.org/history.html |title=Isaacson, 2003, p. 15 |publisher=Oldsouth.org |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531090015/http://www.oldsouth.org/history.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's father, a poor [[chandlery|chandler]], owned a copy of a book, ''Bonifacius: Essays to Do Good'', by the Puritan preacher and family friend [[Cotton Mather]], which Franklin often cited as a key influence on his life.&lt;ref&gt;"If I have been", Franklin wrote to Cotton Mather's son seventy years later, "a useful citizen, the public owes the advantage of it to that book." in Isaacson, 2003, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's first pen name, Silence Dogood, paid homage both to the book and to a widely known sermon by Mather. The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Cotton Mather, but his organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin formulated a presentation of his beliefs and published it in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Franklin| first = Benjamin| title = Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion| work = Benjamin Franklin Papers| publisher = franklinpapers.org| date = November 20, 1728| url = http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/yale;jsessionid=9379F5D050E36AA9D1F95700EE223865?d=-363718316&amp;d=1379669530&amp;vol=1&amp;page=101a| accessdate = December 24, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104638/http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/yale;jsessionid=9379F5D050E36AA9D1F95700EE223865?d=-363718316&amp;d=1379669530&amp;vol=1&amp;page=101a| archive-date = July 26, 2011| dead-url = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not mention many of the Puritan ideas regarding salvation, the [[divinity of Jesus]], or indeed much religious dogma.

[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Hiram Powers.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin by Hiram Powers]]
It was Ben Franklin who, at a critical impasse during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in June 1787, attempted to introduce the practice of daily common prayer with these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;In the beginning of the contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection. Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor.&amp;nbsp;... And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that "except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it." I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel:&amp;nbsp;... I therefore beg leave to move—that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Michael E.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The motion met with resistance and was never brought to a vote.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clinton Rossiter|Rossiter, Clinton]]. 1787. ''The Grand Convention'' (1966), pp. 184–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical minister [[George Whitefield]] during the [[First Great Awakening]]. Franklin did not subscribe to Whitefield's theology, but he admired Whitefield for exhorting people to worship God through good works. Franklin published all of Whitefield's sermons and journals, thereby earning a lot of money and boosting the Great Awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp. 107–13&lt;/ref&gt;

When he stopped attending church, Franklin wrote in his autobiography:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that He made the world, and governed it by His providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Franklin Benjamin [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/singlehtml.htm "Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905094326/http://ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/singlehtml.htm |date=September 5, 2008 }} Section 2 reprinted on UShistory.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111frank2.html |title=Benjamin Franklin |publisher=History.hanover.edu |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin retained a lifelong commitment to the Puritan virtues and political values he had grown up with, and through his civic work and publishing, he succeeded in passing these values into the American culture permanently. He had a "passion for virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt; These Puritan values included his devotion to egalitarianism, education, industry, thrift, honesty, temperance, charity and community spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract [[Republicanism in the United States|ideal of republican government]] based on hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that English liberties relied on their balance of power, but also hierarchal deference to the privileged class.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, 1992, pp. 273–74, 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; "Puritanism&amp;nbsp;... and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification"&lt;ref name="Bailyn303" /&gt; by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all men can be saved.&lt;ref name="Bailyn303"&gt;Bailyn, 1992, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin, steeped in Puritanism and an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical movement, rejected the salvation dogma, but embraced the radical notion of egalitarian democracy.

Franklin's commitment to teach these values was itself something he gained from his Puritan upbringing, with its stress on "inculcating virtue and character in themselves and their communities."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp. 10, 102, 489&lt;/ref&gt; These Puritan values and the desire to pass them on, were one of Franklin's quintessentially American characteristics, and helped shape the character of the nation. Franklin's writings on [[virtue]] were derided by some European authors, such as Jackob Fugger in his critical work ''Portrait of American Culture''. [[Max Weber]] considered Franklin's ethical writings a culmination of the [[Protestant work ethic|Protestant ethic]], which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Protestant Ethic and the "Spirit of Capitalism"'', (Penguin Books, 2002), translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells, pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Franklin's notable characteristics was his respect, tolerance and promotion of all churches. Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, he wrote in [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|his autobiography]], "new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; "He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism."&lt;ref name="Isaacson 2003 p 93ff"&gt;Isaacson,2003 pp. 93ff&lt;/ref&gt; The evangelical revivalists who were active mid-century, such as Franklin's friend and preacher, George Whitefield, were the greatest advocates of religious freedom, "claiming liberty of conscience to be an 'inalienable right of every rational creature.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, 1992, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Whitefield's supporters in Philadelphia, including Franklin, erected "a large, new hall, that&amp;nbsp;... could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and [[civic virtue]] made him the "prophet of tolerance."&lt;ref name="Isaacson 2003 p 93ff"/&gt; Franklin composed "A Parable Against Persecution", an apocryphal 51st chapter of Genesis in which God teaches Abraham the duty of tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOEjB0Pdq8oC&amp;pg=PA109|title=The Political Thought of Benjamin Franklin|isbn=978-0872206830|last1=Franklin|first1=Benjamin|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|British Unitarianism]], attending the inaugural session of the [[Essex Street Chapel]], at which [[Theophilus Lindsey]] drew together the first avowedly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky, and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] was illegal until [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813|the 1813 Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitarian.org.uk/support/doc-EssexHall1.shtml |title=Chapter 2, ''The History of Essex Hall'' by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D.

Although Franklin's parents had intended for him to have a career in the Church,&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; Franklin as a young man adopted the Enlightenment religious belief in [[deism]], that God's truths can be found entirely through nature and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; "I soon became a thorough Deist."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin.

After the disillusioning experience of seeing the decay in his own moral standards, and those of two friends in London whom he had converted to Deism, Franklin turned back to a belief in the importance of organized religion, on the pragmatic grounds that without God and organized churches, man will not be good.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, pp. 46, 486&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because of his proposal that [[Christian prayer|prayers]] be said in the [[Constitutional Convention of 1787]], many have contended that in his later life Franklin became a [[piety|pious]] Christian.&lt;ref name="Pious"&gt;{{cite book| author=Henry Louis Mencken, George Jean Nathan| url=https://books.google.com/?id=LqJUonES6m8C&amp;q=benjamin+franklin+identify+christian+religion&amp;dq=benjamin+franklin+identify+christian+religion| title=The American Mercury, Volume 8| publisher=Garber Communications| quote=It is well known that in his youth Benjamin Franklin was a thorough-going Deist, but because he proposed that prayers be said in the Constitution Convention of 1787 many have contended that in later life he became a pious Christian.| date=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faith"&gt;{{cite book| author=Ralph Frasca| url=https://books.google.com/?id=CY2UVzcU5l0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=benjamin+franklin+christian+or+deist#v=onepage| title=Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network: Disseminating Virtue in Early America| publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]]| quote=Despite being raised a Puritan of the Congregationalist stripe by his parents, who "brought me through my Childhood piously in the Dissenting Way", Franklin recalled, he abandoned that denomination, briefly embraced deism, and finally became a non-denominational Protestant Christian. |year= 2009| isbn=978-0826264923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Morgan,&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, David T. "Benjamin Franklin: Champion of Generic Religion". ''The Historian''. 62#4 2000. pp. 722+&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was a proponent of religion in general. He prayed to "Powerful Goodness" and referred to God as "the infinite". [[John Adams]] noted that Franklin was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: "The [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] thought him almost a Catholic. The [[Church of England]] claimed him as one of them. The [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] thought him half a Presbyterian, and the [[Quakers|Friends]] believed him a wet Quaker." Whatever else Franklin was, concludes Morgan, "he was a true champion of generic religion." In a letter to Richard Price, Franklin stated that he believed that religion should support itself without help from the government, claiming, "When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig'd to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin to Richard Price, October 9, 1780 ''Writings'' 8:153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote a letter to [[Ezra Stiles]], president of [[Yale University]], who had asked him his views on religion:

{{quote|As to [[Jesus of Nazareth]], my Opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have, with most of the present [[English Dissenters|Dissenters in England]], some Doubts as to his divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble. I see no harm, however, in its being believed, if that belief has the good consequence, as it probably has, of making his doctrines more respected and better observed; especially as I do not perceive that the Supreme takes it amiss, by distinguishing the unbelievers in his government of the world with any particular marks of his displeasure.&lt;ref name="vandoren"/&gt;}}

On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed a three-member committee composed of Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams to design the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. Franklin's proposal (which was not adopted) featured the motto: "Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God" and a scene from the [[Book of Exodus]], with [[Moses]], the [[Israelites]], the [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]], and [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] depicted as [[Pharaohs in the Bible#Pharaoh of the Exodus|pharaoh]]. The design that was produced was never acted upon by Congress, and the Great Seal's design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/27807.pdf The Great Seal of the United States]" (July 2003).

[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] ([[Oxford University Press]], 2006), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thirteen Virtues===
[[File:Franklin bust at Columbia University IMG 0924.JPG|thumb|Franklin bust in the [[Archives]] Department of [[Columbia University]] in New York City]]

Franklin sought to cultivate his character by a plan of 13 virtues, which he developed at age 20 (in 1726) and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life. His [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] lists his 13 virtues as:

# "[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation."
# "[[Silence]]. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation."
# "[[Order (virtue)|Order]]. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time."
# "Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve."
# "[[Frugality]]. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing."
# "[[Industry]]. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions."
# "[[Sincerity]]. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly."
# "[[Justice]]. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty."
# "[[Moderation]]. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve."
# "[[Cleanliness]]. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation."
# "[[Tranquility]]. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable."
# "[[Chastity]]. Rarely use [[Human sexuality|venery]] but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation."
# "[[Humility]]. Imitate Jesus and [[Socrates]]."

Franklin did not try to work on them all at once. Instead, he would work on one and only one each week "leaving all others to their ordinary chance." While Franklin did not live completely by his virtues, and by his own admission he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point; in his autobiography Franklin wrote, "I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page38.htm ''Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin page 38 forward''] by Benjamin Franklin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery==
Franklin owned as many as seven slaves, two males who worked in his household and his shop. Franklin posted paid ads for the sale of slaves and for the capture of runaway slaves and allowed the sale of slaves in his general store. Franklin profited from both the international and domestic slave trade, even criticizing slaves who had run off to join the [[British Army]] during the colonial wars of the 1740s and 1750s. Franklin, however, later became a "cautious abolitionist" and became an outspoken critic of landed gentry slavery. In 1758, Franklin advocated the opening of a school for the education of black slaves in Philadelphia. Franklin took two slaves to England with him, Peter and King, and King left his service there in 1756: by 1758 he was working for "a lady in Suffolk".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|last = Isaacson|first = Walter|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 2003|isbn = |location = New York|chapter = Chapter Eight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Franklin could have compelled King's return is open to doubt in the light of earlier English [[Common Law]] decisions and [[Slavery at common law#Shanley v Harvey|the subsequent case of Shanley v Harvey]], but in fact he did not do so.

After returning from England in 1762, Franklin became more anti-slavery. By 1770, Franklin had freed his slaves and attacked the system of slavery and the [[international slave trade]]. Franklin, however, refused to publicly debate the issue of slavery at the [[1787 Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldstreicher, David. "Benjamin Franklin, Slavery, and the Founders: On the dangers of reading backwards." Common-place.org. 04, no. 4 (July 2004). http://common-place.org/book/benjamin-franklin-slavery-and-the-founders-on-the-dangers-of-reading-backwards/&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin tended to take both sides of the issue of slavery, never fully divesting himself from the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer (2011), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldstreicher (2004), pp. xii, xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of slavery, Franklin wrote several essays that stressed the importance of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] and of the integration of blacks into American society. These writings included:

* ''[[s:An Address to the Public|An Address to the Public]]'' (1789)
* ''[[s:A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks|A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks]]'' (1789)
* ''Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim on the Slave Trade'' (1790)&lt;ref&gt;Myra Jehlen, Michael Warner, editors, ''The English Literatures of America, 1500–1800'', Psychology Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAYDAZmrKkgC&amp;pg=PA891 p. 891] 1997, {{ISBN|0415919037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[Quakers]] from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition to Congress. Their argument against slavery was backed by the [[Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society]] and its president, Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin for The Pennsylvania Abolition Society to the United States Congress, ''The memorial of the Pennsylvania Society for promoting the Abolition of Slavery, the relief of free Negroes unlawfully held in bondage, and the Improvement of the Conditions of the African Race'' (February 3, 1790)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Philly 2010 transit 071.JPG|thumb|The grave of Benjamin Franklin, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]

Franklin suffered from obesity throughout his middle-aged and later years, which resulted in multiple health problems, particularly [[gout]], which worsened as he aged. In poor health during the signing of the US Constitution in 1787, he was rarely seen in public from then until his death.

Benjamin Franklin died from [[Pleurisy|pleuritic attack]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Isaacson| first=Walter| title=Benjamin Franklin: an American life| year=2003| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- nothing is mentioned about pleurisy in the Timeline:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benfranklin300.org/etc_timeline_1.htm|title=Franklin &amp; Marshall College – ''Ben Franklin: A Timeline''|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; at his home in Philadelphia on April 17, 1790, at age 84. His death is described in the book ''The Life of Benjamin Franklin'', quoting from the account of Dr. John Jones:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery, when an imposthume, which had formed itself in his lungs, suddenly burst, and discharged a quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had power; but, as that failed, the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed; a calm, lethargic state succeeded; and on the 17th instant (April 1790), about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, closing a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, pp. 529–30.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Approximately 20,000 people attended his funeral. He was interred in [[Christ Church Burial Ground]] in Philadelphia. In 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Body of B. Franklin Printer; Like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering and Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms. But the Work shall not be wholly lost: For it will, as he believ'd, appear once more, In a new &amp; more perfect Edition, Corrected and Amended By the Author.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/franklin-epitaph.html ''Benjamin Franklin: In His Own Words''.] Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin's actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads "Benjamin and Deborah Franklin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/family/lastwill.html ''The Last Will and Testament of Benjamin Franklin''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821230120/http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/family/lastwill.html |date=August 21, 2009 }} The Franklin Institute Science Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin Franklin National Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Marble memorial statue, [[Benjamin Franklin National Memorial]]]]A signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, Franklin is considered one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. His pervasive influence in the early history of the nation has led to his being jocularly called "the only President of the United States who was never President of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[[Everything You Know Is Wrong|Firesign Theater quote, meant humorously but poignantly.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's likeness is ubiquitous. Since 1928, it has adorned American [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bills]], which are sometimes referred to in slang as "Benjamins" or "Franklins." From 1948 to 1963, Franklin's portrait was on the [[Franklin half dollar|half dollar]]. He has appeared on a [[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50 bill]] and on several varieties of the $100 bill from 1914 and 1918. Franklin appears on the $1,000 Series EE [[Treasury security#Savings bond|Savings bond]]. Philadelphia's [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] (a major thoroughfare) and [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] (the first major bridge to connect Philadelphia with New Jersey) are named in his honor.

In 1976, as part of a [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]] celebration, [[United States Congress|Congress]] dedicated a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on|0}} marble statue in Philadelphia's [[Franklin Institute]] as the [[Benjamin Franklin National Memorial]].

In London, his house at 36 Craven Street, which is the only surviving former residence of Benjamin Franklin, was first marked with a [[blue plaque]] and has since been opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/default.htm |title=Benjamin Franklin House |publisher=Benjamin Franklin House. |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217063307/http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/default.htm |archive-date=February 17, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home. ''[[The Times]]'' reported on February 11, 1998:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Initial estimates are that the bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house, which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775. Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut. One skull has been drilled with several holes. Paul Knapman, the Westminster Coroner, said yesterday: "I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime. There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by [[William Hewson (surgeon)|William Hewson]], who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/news/pdf/Issue2.pdf ''The Craven Street Gazette''] ([[PDF]]), Newsletter of the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House, Issue 2, Autumn 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bequest===
Franklin [[bequest|bequeathed]] £1,000 (about $4,400 at the time, or about $112,000 in 2011 dollars&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/relativevalue.php Measuring Worth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523080025/http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/relativevalue.php |date=May 23, 2013 }} Select $4,400 and 1790 and 2011 in online calculator&lt;/ref&gt;) each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, in trust to gather interest for 200 years. The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician [[Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour]], who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly [[parody]] of Franklin's "Poor Richard's Almanack" called "Fortunate Richard". The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will, five lots of 100 ''[[French livre|livres]]'', to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price. ''Observations on the Importance of the American Revolution, and the Means of Making it a Benefit to the World. To which is added, a Letter from M. Turgot, late Comptroller-General of the Finances of France: with an Appendix, containing a Translation of the Will of M. Fortuné Ricard, lately published in France.'' London: T. Cadell, 1785.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000&amp;nbsp;pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia. By 1990, more than $2,000,000 had accumulated in Franklin's Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a [[Vocational school|trade school]] that became the [[Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology|Franklin Institute of Boston]], and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html |title=Excerpt from Philadelphia Inquirer article by Clark De Leon |publisher=Mathsci.appstate.edu |date=February 7, 1993 |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510050913/http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html |archive-date=May 10, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php |title=History of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology |publisher=Bfit.edu |accessdate=September 21, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731130624/http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php| archivedate = July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franklin on U.S. postage===
[[File:Benjamin Franklin 1861 Issue-1c.jpg|thumb|left|upright|&lt;center&gt;Issue of 1861&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Benjamin Franklin2 1895 Issue-1c.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|&lt;center&gt;Issue of 1895&lt;/center&gt;]]
Benjamin Franklin is a prominent figure in American history comparable to Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, and as such he has been honored on U.S. postage stamps many times. The image of Franklin, the first [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] of the United States, occurs on the face of U.S. postage more than any other notable American save that of [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="Scotts"&gt;Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin appeared on the first U.S. postage stamp [[Benjamin Franklin#Postmaster|(displayed above)]] issued in 1847. From 1908 through 1923 the U.S. Post Office issued a series of postage stamps commonly referred to as the [[Washington-Franklin Issues]] where, along with George Washington, Franklin was depicted many times over a 14-year period, the longest run of any one series in U.S. postal history. Along with the regular issue stamps Franklin however only appears on a few [[:File:Ben Franklin 250th 1956 issue-3c.jpg|commemorative stamps]]. Some of the finest portrayals of Franklin on record can be found on the engravings inscribed on the face of U.S. postage.&lt;ref name="Scotts"/&gt;{{clear}}[[File:Benjamin Franklin 2-Big-Bens 1918 Issue.jpg|alt=Benjamin Franklin 2-Big-Bens 1918 Issue|thumb|center|upright=1.6|&lt;center&gt;Issue of 1918&lt;/center&gt;]]

===Bawdy Ben===
"[[Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress]]" is a letter written by Benjamin Franklin, dated June 25, 1745, in which Franklin gives advice to a young man about channeling sexual urges. Due to its licentious nature, the letter was not published in collections of Franklin's papers during the nineteenth century. Federal court decisions from the mid-to-late twentieth century cited the document as a reason for overturning obscenity laws, using it to make a case against censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Japikse, ed.|title=Fart Proudly: Writings of Benjamin Franklin You Never Read in School|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8I3bAlV25kC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2003|publisher=Frog Books|page=8|isbn=978-1583940792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions===
[[File:2012-07 ncc 04.JPG|thumb|Life-size bronze statue of Benjamin Franklin (seated) in the [[National Constitution Center]], Philadelphia]]
"The Princess and the Patriot: [[Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova|Ekaterina Dashkova]], Benjamin Franklin and the Age of Enlightenment" exhibition opened in Philadelphia in February 2006 and ran through December 2006. Benjamin Franklin and Dashkova met only once, in Paris in 1781. Franklin was 75, and Dashkova was 37. Franklin invited Dashkova to become the first woman to join the American Philosophical Society; she was the only woman so honored for another 80 years. Later, Dashkova reciprocated by making him the first American member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

===Places and things named after Benjamin Franklin===
{{Further|List of places named for Benjamin Franklin}}
&lt;!-- This list is not intended to be comprehensive. To prevent this list from becoming too long, please consider adding additional places named for Franklin to the separate article titled "List of places named for Benjamin Franklin" as noted at the top of this section --&gt;

As a founding father of the United States, Franklin's name has been attached to many things. Among these are:
* The [[State of Franklin]], a short-lived independent state formed during the American Revolutionary War
* [[County (United States)|Counties]] in at least 16 U.S. states
* The [[Franklin Institute Awards]] (presented by the [[Franklin Institute]]) for significant contributions in the fields of science and engineering.
* Several major landmarks in and around [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, Franklin's longtime home, including:
** [[Franklin and Marshall College]] in nearby [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]
** [[Franklin Field]], a [[American football|football]] field once home to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]] and the home field of the [[Penn Quakers football|University of Pennsylvania Quakers]] since 1895
** The [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] across the [[Delaware River]] between Philadelphia and [[Camden, New Jersey]]
* Several [[US Navy]] ships have been named the {{USS|Franklin}} or the {{USS|Bonhomme Richard}}, the latter being a French translation of his penname "Poor Richard". Two aircraft carriers, {{USS|Franklin|CV-13}} and {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CV-31}}, were simultaneously in commission and in operation during World War II, and Franklin therefore had the distinction of having two simultaneously operational US Navy warships named in his honor. The [[French ship Franklin (1797)|French ship ''Franklin'' (1797)]] was also named in Franklin's honor.
* [[CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin|CMA CGM ''Benjamin Franklin'']], a Chinese-built French owned [[Explorer-class container ship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/31/news/economy/china-container/index.html|title=This is the biggest container ship ever to dock in the U.S.|first1=Rebecca|last1=Wright|first2=Matt|last2=Rivers|date=January 31, 2016|work=[[CNNMoney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Preston Blair Lee''' (August 9, 1857{{spaced ndash}}December 25, 1944) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[United States Senate]], representing the [[Maryland|State of Maryland]] from 1914 to 1917.  He was also the great-grandson of American patriot [[Richard Henry Lee]], and grandfather of former [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Blair Lee III]].  Lee was named after his maternal grandfather, [[Francis Preston Blair]].

Lee was born in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] and attended the common schools in the area. He was the son of [[Samuel Phillips Lee]] and his wife, the former [[Elizabeth Blair Lee|Elizabeth Blair]].  He graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1880 and from the law department of [[George Washington University|Columbian (now George Washington) University]] in 1882.  He was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] of the [[District of Columbia]] and of [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] in 1883 and commenced practice in Maryland.

Lee was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Fifty-fifth Congress in 1896.  He was, however, elected to the [[Maryland State Senate]], and served from 1905 to 1913.  In 1911, Lee ran for the position of Governor of Maryland, but lost the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination to [[Arthur Pue Gorman, Jr.]] (who lost to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Phillips Lee Goldsborough]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30570586.html |title=Commentary: Right time, right place for Lee |newspaper=The Daily Record |place=Baltimore |publisher=via HighBeam {{Subscription required}} |date=January 19, 2012 |accessdate=August 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, he again ran for Governor and was defeated in the Democratic Primary by eventual winner [[Emerson Harrington]].

Following his defeat in the gubernatorial election, Lee was elected to the United States Senate in a [[United States Senate special election in Maryland, 1913|special election on November 4, 1913]], to fill the vacancy caused by the death of senator [[Isidor Rayner]]. Because the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] had recently gone into effect, Lee became the first U.S. Senator directly elected by the people of a state under the Constitution's provisions (although other states had previously elected senators indirectly through popular elections, which were then ratified by the state legislature).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Direct_Election_Senators.htm Direct Election of Senators]&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his credentials to serve as senator on December 5, 1913, but he did not qualify until January 28, 1914 because the incumbent in his seat, Republican [[William P. Jackson]], claimed that "since he had been appointed under the original constitutional provision, he was entitled to hold his seat until the regularly scheduled adjournment date of the Maryland state assembly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/contested_elections/099Jackson_Lee.htm The Election Case of William P. Jackson v. Blair Lee of Maryland (1914)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate considered Jackson's challenge but eventually rejected it and seated Lee. While senator, Lee was chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department|Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department]], and a member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Coast Defenses|Committee on Coast Defenses]] (Sixty-third and Sixty-fourth Congresses).  He was unsuccessful in his bid for re-election in [[United States Senate elections, 1916|1916]], losing the Democratic nomination to [[David John Lewis]] (who went on to lose to [[Joseph I. France]]).

Lee resumed the practice of law after he left the Senate.  He died in [[Norwood, Maryland]] and is buried in [[Rock Creek Cemetery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

{{Capitalism |Related}}

The '''capitalist state''' is the [[state (polity)|state]], its functions, and the form of organization it takes within [[capitalist]] socioeconomic systems.&lt;ref name="Recent theories of the capitalist State, 1977"&gt;''Recent theories of the capitalist State'', by Jessop, Bob. 1977. Soviet Studies, pp. 353-373, vol. 1, no. 4, Jan. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is often used interchangeably with the concept of the "modern state"; however there are many differences in sociological characteristics among capitalist states, despite their common functions.&lt;ref name = "Morishima 1976, 1"&gt;Morishima, Michio (1976). [https://books.google.com/books?id=aC45AAAAIAAJ ''The Economic Theory of Modern Society''.] New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-21088-7}}. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary functions of the capitalist state are to provide a legal framework and infrastructural framework that is conducive to [[business]] enterprise and the [[accumulation of capital]]. Different normative theories exist on the necessary and appropriate function of the state in a capitalist economy, with proponents of [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire]] favoring a state limited to the provision of public goods and safeguarding private property rights, while proponents of interventionism stress the importance of regulation, intervention and economic stabilization in providing the framework for the accumulation of capital and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comparative Economic Transformations: Mainland China, Hungary, the Soviet Union, and Taiwan|author=Yu-Shan Wu|year=1995|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=8|quote=In laissez-faire capitalism, the state restricts itself to providing public goods and services that the economy cannot generate by itself and to safeguarding private ownership and the smooth operation of the self-regulating market.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Karl Marx]] the capitalist state is understood to be a reflection of the economic base, with its chief function reflecting the needs of the capitalist economy. This involves creating the legal and infrastructural framework - the superstructure - that facilitates capitalism, as well as balancing the needs of the various classes to ensure the perpetuation of capitalism. This often involves attempts to safeguard state policy from being used to benefit specific capitalists or firms at the expense of the bourgeoisie as a whole. [[Karl Marx]] hence described the function of the executive of a capitalist state as "nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie". Specifically, in Marx's view, the capitalist state necessarily exists to serve the interests of capitalists (referred to as "the bourgeoisie"), not as a defect but as a necessary feature of capitalism. Thus thinkers in the Marxist tradition often refer to the capitalist state as the ''Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Graeme Duncan |title= Democracy and the Capitalist state |publisher= Cambridge University Press |date=March 1989 |isbn= 9780521280624|page = 85|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers in the [[Instrumental Marxism|Instrumental Marxist]] tradition stress the role of policymakers and political elites sharing a common business or class background, leading to their decisions reflecting their class interest. This is differentiated from more contemporary notions of state capture by specific business interests for the benefit of those specific businesses and not the ruling class or capitalist system as a whole, which is variously referred to as [[crony capitalism]] or "[[Corporatocracy]]".

Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 1980s, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the [[Greater Chicago Food Depository]], or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/02/illinois-s-governor-race Can Chris Kennedy fix Illinois?]", ''[[The Economist]]'', February 13, 2017.

The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to [[Vornado Realty Trust]], a [[real estate investment trust]]. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest [[commercial property|commercial building]] in the world, serving as both a luxury [[wholesale]] design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres)&lt;!--{{convert|4200000|sqft|m2}} - at August 26, 2009, this editor hasn't mastered blasted "convert" templates yet--&gt;  Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.

===Top Box Foods===
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.

Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including [[Trinity United Church of Christ]] and [[Salem Baptist Church (Chicago)|Salem Baptist Church]].

==Personal life==
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending [[Boston College]].

Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]'s bid for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President]].

[[File:Vice President Joe Biden writing condolence message at Polish Embassy in Washington.jpg|alt=Joe Biden sits at a desk, writing in a book|thumb|Diplomatic message of condolence at an embassy]]
'''Condolences''' (from Latin ''con'' (with) + ''dolere'' (sorrow)) are an expression of sympathy to someone who is experiencing pain arising from death, deep mental anguish, or misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condolence | title=condolence | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word "condolences", in plural, is more common than "condolence". The reason for this habit is unclear,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;searchmode=none&amp;search=condolence etymonline.com search for "condolence"] accessed 2016-06-16&lt;/ref&gt; but it resembles our habit to send someone our 'regards', 'best wishes', greetings'  (all plural), etc.

When individuals condole, or offer their condolences to a particular situation or person, they are offering active, conscious [[Moral support|support]] of that person or activity. This is often expressed by saying, "Sorry". Often, the [[English language]] expression "My condolences" will be in a context, such as [[death]] of a friend's loved one, in which the one offering condolences is communicating a feeling of [[pity]] towards the unfortunate party. Expressions of condolence may also be used as [[sarcasm]] if one considers the complaining person to be exaggerating their suffering, especially when they appear to consider as tragic something that is relatively insignificant.

Condolence is not always expressed in sorrow or grievance, as it can also be used to acknowledge a fellow feeling or even a common opinion.

There are various ways of expressing condolences to the victims. Examples include donating money to the charity nominated by the person who has just died, writing in a condolences book or supporting the friends and family of the loved one by making meals and looking after them in various ways in times of need.

'''Mary Courtney Kennedy-Hill''' (known as '''Courtney''', born September 9, 1956 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]) is the fifth of the eleven children of [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Francis Kennedy]] and [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel Skakel]].

==Marriages==
Through her job at the [[Children's Television Workshop]], she met [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sports producer Jeffrey Robert Ruhe (born 1952), son of Robert Ruhe and Elva Buckingham. The couple married on June 14, 1980, in [[Washington, D.C.]] and were divorced in 1990.

She married Paul Michael Hill (born August 13, 1954)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kennedys/sfeature/sf_tree_text.html&lt;/ref&gt; on June 26, 1993, on a boat in the [[Aegean Sea]]. Hill is an [[Irish people|Irishman]] who was wrongly imprisoned for 15 years after being convicted of several bombings carried out by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. However, he was later found to have been convicted unjustly; no evidence linked him to either the bombings or to involvement with the IRA. Further investigation revealed that the confessions of himself and three others (collectively called "The [[Guildford Four]]") were coerced after many days in detention without charge, and the purported notes from the interrogations were fabricated by the police some time later, so that the notes would reflect the case the police had decided to build. (The film ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]'' (1993) was based on this case.)

Kennedy and Hill were reportedly introduced by her mother. The couple have one daughter, Saoirse Roisin Hill (born May 22, 1997 in [[Washington D.C.]]). The couple lived in Ireland from 2002 to 2006. In February 2006, they legally separated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Europe Intelligence Wire]], February 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Courtney Hill was formerly a representative for the [[United Nations]] [[AIDS]] Foundation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Personal life==
Hill lives in Bethesda, Maryland.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''Crony capitalism''' is an [[economy]] in which [[business]]es thrive not as a result of risk, but rather as a return on money amassed through a nexus between a business class and the [[political class]]. This is done using state power to crush genuine competition in handing out permits, government grants, special [[tax break]]s, or other forms of [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org.au/publications/policy-magazine/article/2877-feature-crony-capitalism-and-the-east-asian-currency-and-financial-crises|author=Helen Hughes|volume=15 |issue=3 |date=Spring 1999|title=Crony Capitalism and the East Asian Currency and Financial 'Crises'|magazine=Policy|quote=Japan’s dismal performance in the 1990s and the East Asian collapses of 1997 indicate that [[dirigisme]] can only boost economies in the short run and at high cost.  It breaks down in the long run (Lindsey and Lukas 1998).|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kristof |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Kristof |title=A Nation of Takers? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/opinion/kristof-a-nation-of-takers.html |date=March 27, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; over resources where the state exercises monopolist control over public goods, for example, mining concessions for primary commodities or contracts for public works. Money is then made not merely by making a profit  in the market, but through profiteering by "rent seeking" using this monopoly or oligopoly. Entrepreneurship and innovative practices, which seek to reward risk are stifled, since the value-added is little by crony businesses as hardly anything of significant value is created by them, with transactions taking the form of "trading". Crony capitalism spills over into the government, the politics and the media,&lt;ref name="The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics: A Reappraisal of the Origins of Progressivism, 1981"&gt;''The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics: A Reappraisal of the Origins of Progressivism'', by McCormick, Richard. 1981. The American Historical Review, Vol. 86, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 247–74.&lt;/ref&gt; when this nexus distorts the economy and affects society to an extent it corrupts [[public good|public-serving]] economic, political and social ideals.

The term "crony capitalism" made a significant impact in the public as an explanation of the [[Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crony Capitalism: Corruption and Development in South Korea and the Philippines |first=David C. |last=Kang |year=2002 |url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/2001025806.pdf |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-00408-4
|quote=Focused only on explaining successful outcomes, the conventional model provided no analytic way to explain the 1997 crisis. Countries previously regarded as miracles now were nothing more than havens for crony capitalists (p. 3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to describe governmental decisions favoring "cronies" of governmental officials. In this context, the term is often used comparatively with [[corporate welfare]], a technical term often used to assess government bailouts and favoritistic monetary policy, as opposed to the economic theory, described by "crony capitalism". The extent of difference between these terms is whether a government action can be said to benefit the individuals rather than the industry.

==In practice==
Crony capitalism exists along a continuum.  In its lightest form, crony capitalism consists of [[collusion]] among market players which is officially tolerated or encouraged by the government. While perhaps lightly competing against each other, they will present a unified front (sometimes called a trade association or [[industry trade group]]) to the government in requesting subsidies or aid or regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/uber-vs-washington-dc-this-is-insane/259614/|title=Uber vs. Washington, D.C.: This Is Insane|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=July 11, 2012|quote=a fight over a new competitor to the District's (often horrible) taxi service offers something I haven't seen in a while. Not routine retail-level corruption, nor skillful top-level favor trading, but instead what appears to be a blatant attempt to legislate favors for one set of interests by hamstringing another.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newcomers to a market then need to surmount significant "barriers to entry"  for instance, in seeking loans, acquire shelf space, or receive official sanction. Some such systems are very formalized, such as sports leagues and the Medallion System of the [[taxicabs of New York City]], but often the process is more subtle, such as expanding training and certification exams to make it more expensive for new entrants to enter a market and thereby limit competition. In technological fields, there may evolve a system whereby new entrants may be accused of infringing on [[patent]]s that the established competitors never assert against each other. In spite of this, some competitors may succeed when the legal [[Barriers to entry|barriers]] are light. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The term crony capitalism is generally used when these practices come to dominate the economy as a whole or to dominate the most valuable industries in an economy.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327" /&gt; Intentionally ambiguous laws and regulations are common in such systems. Taken strictly, such laws would greatly impede practically all business; in practice, they are only erratically enforced. The specter of having such laws suddenly brought down upon a business provides incentive to stay in the good graces of political officials. Troublesome rivals who have overstepped their bounds can have the laws suddenly enforced against them, leading to fines or even jail time. Even in high-income democracies with well-established legal systems and freedom of the press in place, a larger state is associated with more political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander (2013), Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf], World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''crony capitalism'' was initially applied to states involved in the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] such as [[Thailand]] and [[Indonesia]]. In these cases, the term was used to point out how family members of the ruling leaders become extremely wealthy with no non-political justification.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Southeast Asian nations still score very poorly in rankings measuring this. [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vines|first=Stephen|title=Why Hong Kong’s latest No 1 ranking was greeted with silence|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/1462317/why-hong-kongs-latest-no-1-ranking-was-greeted-silence|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1213&amp;context=facultyworkingpapers&lt;/ref&gt; are perhaps most noted for this, and the term has also been applied to the system of [[Business oligarch|oligarchs]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/2668298?story_id=E1_NGGRNJR |title=Having it both ways |work=The Economist |date=May 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=The countries where politically connected businessmen are most likely to prosper|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21599041-countries-where-politically-connected-businessmen-are-most-likely-prosper-planet|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please do not list every country in the world, just the ones that are both corrupt AND capitalist enough.

Many prosperous nations have also had varying amounts of cronyism throughout their history including the [[United Kingdom]], especially in the 1600s and 1700s, United States,&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21599041-countries-where-politically-connected-businessmen-are-most-likely-prosper-planet |title=Planet Plutocrat: The countries where politically connected businessmen are most likely to prosper |work=The Economist |date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.

=== Crony capitalism index ===
''[[The Economist]]'' benchmarks countries based on a "[[crony-capitalism index]]" calculated via how much economic activity occurs in industries prone to cronyism.  Its 2014 Crony Capitalism Index ranking listed [[Hong Kong]], [[Russia]] and [[Malaysia]] in the top 3 spots.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

== In finance ==
Crony capitalism in finance was found in the [[Second Bank of the United States]].  It was a private company, but its largest stockholder was the federal government which owned 20%.   It was an early bank regulator and grew to be one being the most powerful organizations in the country due largely to being the depository of the government's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity.|last=Zingales|first=Luigi|publisher=Basic Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] in 1999 completely removed [[Glass-Steagall]]’s separation between commercial banks and investment banks.  After this repeal, commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies combined their [[lobbying]] efforts. Critics claim this was instrumental in the passage of the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity.|last=Zingales|first=Luigi|publisher=Basic Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sections of an economy==
{{POV section|date=November 2012}}
More direct government involvement in a specific sector can also lead to specific areas of crony capitalism, even if the economy as a whole may be competitive. This is most common in natural resource sectors through the granting of mining or drilling concessions, but it is also possible through a process known as [[regulatory capture]] where the government agencies in charge of regulating an industry come to be controlled by that industry. Governments will often, in good faith, establish [[regulatory agency|government agencies to regulate an industry]]. However, the members of an industry have a very strong interest in the actions of that regulatory body, while the rest of the citizenry are only lightly affected. As a result, it is not uncommon for current industry players to gain control of the "watchdog" and to use it against competitors. This typically takes the form of making it very expensive for a new entrant to enter the market. An [[Gibbons v. Ogden#Background|1824 landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling]] overturned a New York State-granted monopoly ("a veritable model of state munificence" facilitated by one of the [[Founding Fathers]], [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]]) for the then-revolutionary technology of [[North River Steamboat|steamboats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=T.J. |last=Styles |title=The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]|ISBN=978-0-375-41542-5|quote=Property requirements for suffrage under New York's constitution of 1777 hardened the culture of rank into law. Two distinct levels of wealth were required to vote, one for state assembly, and a second and higher level for the state senators and governor... [this [[suffrage]] scheme fostered] [[mercantilism]], which in the state empowered private parties to carry out activities thought to serve the public interest. The standard reward for such an undertaking was a [[monopoly]]—just what Chancellor Livingston sought when he offered to meet a most pressing public need, the need for steamboats...Livingston maneuvered...the monopoly through the legislature ("a veritable model of state munificence," as legal scholar Maurice G. Baxter writes—that gave him the right to seize steamboats the entered New York waters from other states. But Livingston had overreached. With so many inventors and investors interested in the steamboat, the monopoly on served to limit its adoption.  The new technology was simply too important for the monopoly to remain unchallenged. [pp. 39–42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leveraging the Supreme Court's establishment of Congressional supremacy over commerce, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] was established in 1887 with the intent of regulating railroad "[[robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]]".  President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed [[Thomas M. Cooley]], a railroad ally, as its first chairman and a permit system was used to deny access to new entrants and legalize [[price fixing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last=Lee |title=Entangling the Web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/opinion/03lee.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense industry in the United States is often described as an example of crony capitalism in an industry. Connections with [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]] and lobbyists in Washington are described by critics as more important than actual competition, due to the political and secretive nature of defense contracts. In the [[Transatlantic relations#Boeing and Airbus subsidies|Airbus-Boeing WTO dispute]], Airbus (which receives outright [[subsidy|subsidies]] from European governments) has stated Boeing receives similar subsidies, which are hidden as inefficient defense contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pulling Boeing Out of a Tailspin |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_50/b3862121_mz029.htm |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |quote=A national treasure, once No. 1 in commercial aviation, Boeing has become a risk-averse company stumbling to compete in the marketplace and dependent on political connections and chicanery to get government contracts.

Gerald P. O'Driscoll, former vice president at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]], stated that [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] became examples of crony capitalism. Government backing let Fannie and Freddie dominate [[mortgage underwriting]]. "The politicians created the mortgage giants, which then returned some of the profits to the pols—sometimes directly, as campaign funds; sometimes as "contributions" to favored constituents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09092008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/fannie_freddie_bailout_baloney_128135.htm |work=New York Post |title=Fannie/Freddie Bailout Baloney |first=Gerald P. |last=O'Driscoll Jr |date=September 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913195535/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09092008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/fannie_freddie_bailout_baloney_128135.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In developing economies==
In its worst form, crony capitalism can devolve into simple [[Political corruption|corruption]], where any pretense of a free market is dispensed with. Bribes to government officials are considered ''de rigueur'' and [[tax evasion]] is common; this is seen in many parts of Africa, for instance.  This is sometimes called [[plutocracy]] (rule by wealth) or [[kleptocracy]] (rule by theft).

Corrupt governments may favor one set of business owners who have close ties to the government over others. This may also be done with, religious, or ethnic favoritism; for instance, [[Alawites]] in [[Syria]] have a disproportionate share of power in the government and business there. ([[Bashar al-Assad|President Assad]] is an Alawite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/world/asia/01makhlouf.html Syrian Businessman Becomes Magnet for Anger and Dissent] "Like Mr. Ezz in Egypt, he has become a symbol of how economic reforms turned crony socialism into crony capitalism, making the poor poorer and the connected rich fantastically wealthier."&lt;/ref&gt;) This can be explained by considering personal relationships as a [[social network]]. As government and business leaders try to accomplish various things, they naturally turn to other powerful people for support in their endeavors. These people form hubs in the network. In a developing country those hubs may be very few, thus concentrating economic and political power in a small interlocking group.

Normally, this will be untenable to maintain in business; new entrants will affect the market. However, if business and government are entwined, then the government can maintain the small-hub network.

[[Raymond Vernon]], specialist in economics and international affairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url         = http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/09.23/vernon.html|title       = Raymond Vernon Dies at 85|date        = September 23, 1999|work        = The Harvard University Gazette|publisher   = President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate  = February 9, 2013|deadurl     = yes|archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120503203741/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/09.23/vernon.html|archivedate = May 3, 2012|df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote that the [[Industrial Revolution]] began in [[Great Britain]], because they were the first to successfully limit the power of veto groups (typically cronies of those with power in government) to block innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;  "Unlike most other national environments, the British environment of the early 19th century contained relatively few threats to those who improved and applied existing inventions, whether from business competitors, labor, or the government itself.  In other European countries, by contrast, the merchant guilds ... were a pervasive source of veto for many centuries.  This power was typically bestowed upon them by government".  For example, a Russian inventor produced a steam engine in 1766 and disappeared without a trace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  "[A] steam powered horseless carriage produced in France in 1769 was officially suppressed."  [[James Watt]] began experimenting with steam in 1763, got a patent in 1769, and began commercial production in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (1989, p. 8);  see also [[Watt steam engine]] and [[James Watt#Patents|James Watt]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raghuram Rajan]], former governor of the [[Reserve Bank of India]], has said "One of the greatest dangers to the growth of developing countries is the [[middle income trap]], where crony capitalism creates oligarchies that slow down growth. If the debate during the elections is any pointer, this is a very real concern of the public in India today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crony capitalism a big threat to countries like India, RBI chief Raghuram Rajan says|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Crony-capitalism-a-big-threat-to-countries-like-India-RBI-chief-Raghuram-Rajan-says/articleshow/40076743.cms|accessdate=6 November 2014|work=Times of India|date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tavleen Singh]], columnist for ''[[The Indian Express]]'' has disagreed. According to her, India's corporate success is not a product of crony capitalism, but because India is no longer under the influence of crony socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/no-crony-capitalism-in-india/821341/|title=No crony capitalism in India - Indian Express|author=|date=|website=archive.indianexpress.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political viewpoints==
{{misleading|date=May 2016}}
While the problem is generally accepted across the political spectrum, ideology shades the view of the problem's causes and therefore its solutions. Political views mostly fall into two camps which might be called the socialist and capitalist critique. The socialist position is that broadly democratic government must regulate economic, or wealthy, interests in order to restrict monopoly. The capitalist position is that "[[natural monopolies]]" are rare, therefore governmental regulations generally abet established wealthy interests by restricting competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gothamist.com/2014/11/29/uber_driving_down_price_of_taxi_med.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083819/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/29/uber_driving_down_price_of_taxi_med.php |archivedate=2015-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist critique===
Critics of crony capitalism including [[socialism|socialists]] and [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalists]] often assert that crony capitalism is the inevitable result of ''any'' strictly capitalist system. [[Jane Jacobs]] described it as a natural consequence of collusion between those managing [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[trade]], while [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that the word "crony" is superfluous when describing capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081114.htm "Black Faces in Limousines:" A Conversation with Noam Chomsky] from Chomsky.info accessed on June 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since businesses make money and money leads to political power, business will inevitably use their power to influence governments. Much of the impetus behind [[campaign finance reform in the United States]] and in other countries is an attempt to prevent economic power being used to take political power.

[[Ravi Batra]] argues that "all official economic measures adopted since 1981...have devastated the middle class" and that the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement should push for their repeal and thus end the influence of the super wealthy in the political process, which he considers a manifestation of crony capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/occupy-wall-street-movement-and-coming-demise-crony-capitalism/1318341474 |title=The Occupy Wall Street Movement and the Coming Demise of Crony Capitalism |first=Ravi |last=Batra |publisher=[[Truthout]] |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist economists, such as [[Robin Hahnel]], have criticized the term as an ideologically motivated attempt to cast what is in their view the fundamental problems of capitalism as avoidable irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Review |url=http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/bpn/znet/april08.txt |author=[[Robin Hahnel]] |quote=IMF officials Michel Camdessus and Stanley Fischer were quick to explain that the afflicted economies had only themselves to blame. Crony capitalism, lack of transparency, accounting procedures not up to international standards, and weak-kneed politicians too quick to spend and too afraid to tax were the problems according to IMF and US Treasury Department officials. The fact that the afflicted economies had been held up as paragons of virtue and IMF/World Bank success stories only a year before, the fact that neoliberalism’s only success story had been the Newly Industrialized Countries (NIC's) who were now in the tank, and the fact that the IMF and Treasury department story just didn’t fit the facts since the afflicted economies were no more rife with crony capitalism, lack of transparency, and weak-willed politicians than dozens of other economies untouched by the Asian financial crisis, simply did not matter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist economists dismiss the term as an [[apologetic]] for failures of [[neoliberal]] policy and, more fundamentally, their perception of the weaknesses of market allocation.

===Capitalist critique===
Supporters of capitalism generally oppose crony capitalism as well, and consider it an aberration brought on by governmental favors incompatible with [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crony Capitalism Comes Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/opinion/kristof-crony-capitalism-comes-homes.html|accessdate=Nov 27, 2011|quote=some financiers have chosen to live in a government-backed featherbed.

[[Burton W. Folsom, Jr.]] distinguishes those that engage in crony capitalism—designated by him "political entrepreneurs"—from those who compete in the marketplace without special aid from government, whom he calls "market entrepreneurs". The market entrepreneurs, such as Hill, Vanderbilt, and Rockefeller, succeeded by producing a quality product at a competitive price. The political entrepreneurs, for example, [[Edward Knight Collins|Edward Collins]] in steamships and the leaders of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in railroads, were men who used the power of government to succeed. They tried to gain subsidies or in some way use government to stop competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myth of the Robber Barons|url=http://www.burtfolsom.com/?page_id=29|accessdate=Nov 28, 2011|quote=The author, Burton Folsom, divides the entrepreneurs into two groups:  market entrepreneurs and political entrepreneurs.|last1=Folsom|first1=Burton|authorlink=Burton W.

is a [[European Union directive]] in the field of patent law, made under the [[Single European market|internal market]] 
provisions of the [[Treaty of Rome]]. It was intended to harmonise the laws of Member States regarding the [[patentability]] 
of [[Biotechnology|biotechnological]] [[invention]]s, including [[Plant variety (law)|plant varieties (as legally defined)]] and [[Human gene|human]] [[Gene patent|genes]].

== Content ==
The Directive is divided into the following five chapters:
  
* Patentability (Chapter I)
* Scope of Protection (Chapter II)
* Compulsory cross-licensing (Chapter III)
* Deposit, access and re-deposit of biological material (Chapter IV)
* Final Provisions (entering into force) (Chapter V)

==Timeline==
The original proposal was adopted by the [[European Commission]] in 1988. The procedure for its adoption was slowed down by primarily [[ethics|ethical]] issues regarding the patentability of living matter. The [[European Parliament]] eventually rejected the joint text from the final [[Conciliation]] meeting at 3rd reading on 1 March 1995 so the first directive process did not yield a directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier_real.cfm?CL=en&amp;DosId=100993 |title=EURLex – 100993 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 13 December 1995, the Commission adopted a new proposal was nearly identical to the rejected version, was changed again, but the Parliament put aside its ethical concerns on patenting of human genes in on 12 July 1998 in its second reading and adopted the Common Position of the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], so in the second legislative process, the directive was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/omk/omnsapir.so/calendar?APP=PDF&amp;TYPE=PV1&amp;FILE=19980512EN.pdf&amp;LANGUE=EN |title=Part 1 : Proceedings of the sitting |publisher=European Parliament |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier_real.cfm?CL=en&amp;DosId=11643 |title=EURLex – 11643 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drafts person of the Parliament for this second procedure was [[Willi Rothley]] and the vote with the most yes votes was Amendment 9 from the Greens which got 221 against 294 votes out of 532 members voting
with 17 abstentions but 314 yes votes would have been required to reach the required an absolute majority to adopt it.

On 6 July 1998, a final version was adopted. Its code is 98/44/EC.

The [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] brought Case C-377/98&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curia.europa.eu/en/actu/activites/act01/0125en.htm#ToC1]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819165356/http://www.curia.europa.eu/en/actu/activites/act01/0125en.htm#ToC1 |date=19 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[European Court of Justice]] against the adoption of the directive with six different pleas but the Court granted none of them.  

Nevertheless, the ECJ decision does not preclude a further test of the validity of the directive on the ground that it is inconsistent with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm0_e.htm |title=intellectual property (TRIPS) – agreement text – contents |publisher=WTO |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art. 27.1 TRIPS provides that patents are only to be granted with respect to 'inventions'.  The directive, however, provides that "biological material which is isolated from its natural environment ... may be the subject of an invention even if it previously occurred in nature."  It is clearly arguable that merely isolating a human gene or protein from its natural environment is not an activity that can come within the meaning of the word 'invention'.  The Danish Council of Bioethics in its Patenting Human Genes and Stem Cells Report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw475.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010131657/http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw475.asp |date=10 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "In the members' view, it cannot be said with any reasonableness that a sequence or partial sequence of a gene ceases to be part of the human body merely because an identical copy of the sequence is isolated from or produced outside of the human body."  TRIPS applies to the European Community as it is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in its own right and accordingly must ensure "the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with obligations as provided" by the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/04-wto_e.htm |title=legal texts – Marrakesh agreement |publisher=WTO |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 14 January 2002, the Commission submitted an assessment of the implications for basic genetic engineering research of failure to publish, or late publication of, papers on subjects which could be patentable as required under Article 16(b) of this directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier_real.cfm?CL=en&amp;DosId=170903 |title=EURLex – 170903 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=European Commission |date=14 January 2002 |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Campaigning and lobbying==
According to [[SmithKline Beecham]] lobbyist Simon Gentry, the company allocated 30 million [[European Currency Unit|ECU]] for a pro-Directive campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporateeurope.org/observer1/patents.html ''Industry and the EU Life Patent Directive''], Corporate Europe Observer, Issue 1, May 1998, citing ECOBP, "''The Big Mirage: The Misuse of the Patient with Hereditary Diseases Before the EP's Vote in 1997''" an ECOBP Background Paper, March 1998, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this campaign was direct support of patient charities and organisations. On the day of the July 1997 vote, a number of people in wheelchairs from these groups demonstrated outside the main hall in Strasbourg, chanting the pharmaceutical industry's slogan, "No Patents, No Cure" in an emotional appeal to Parliamentarians to vote for the Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson |first=Alan |url=http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/resource/no-patents-life#index-02-00-00-00 |title=No Patents on Life |publisher=The Corner House |date=1 September 1997 |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
As of 15 January 2007, all of the 27 EU member states had implemented the Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/invent/state-of-play_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=State of Play of the Implementation of Directive 98/44/EC |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic services delivery''' or '''ESD''' refers to providing government services through the [[Internet]] or other electronic means. It is related to [[e-services]] and [[e-government]].

==Defining e-service==
E-service (or eservice) is a highly generic term usually referring to ‘The provision of services via the Internet (the prefix 'e' standing for ‘electronic’, as it does in many other usages), thus e-Service may also include e-Commerce, although it may also include non-commercial services (online), which is usually provided by the government.’ (Alexei Pavlichev &amp; G. David Garson, 2004: 169-170; Muhammad Rais &amp; Nazariah, 2003: 59, 70-71).

‘An umbrella term for services available on the Internet, e-Service include e-Commerce transaction services for handling online orders, application hosting by application service providers (ASPs) and any processing capability that is obtainable on the Web.’ (Computer Desktop Encyclopedia, 2009)

E-Service or 'electronic service' constitutes the online services available on the Internet, whereby a valid transaction of buying and selling (procurement) is possible, as opposed to the traditional websites, whereby only descriptive information are available, and no online transaction is made possible.' (Jeong, 2007).

The '''Essential Commodities Act''' is an [[Act of Parliament|act]] of [[Parliament of India]] which was established to ensure the delivery of certain commodities or products, the supply of which if obstructed owing to [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding or blackmarketing]] would affect the normal life of the people. This includes foodstuff, drugs, fuel (petroleum products) etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcamin.nic.in/Events/EventDetails.asp?EventId=1507&amp;Section=Annual%20Report&amp;ParentID=0&amp;child_continue=1&amp;child_check=0 Ministry of Consumer Affairs of the Government of India. Official Website. Annual Report 2005 - 2006, Chapter IV, 'Essential Commodities Act 1955'.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECA, 1955"&gt;{{cite web|title=ECA, 1955|url=http://haryanafood.nic.in/Acts_1_Brown.html|accessdate=10 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925053555/http://haryanafood.nic.in/Acts_1_Brown.html|archivedate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECA was enacted way back in 1955. It has since been used by the Government to regulate the production, supply and distribution of a whole host of commodities it declares ‘essential’ in order to make them available to consumers at fair prices.

The list of items under the Act include drugs, fertilisers, pulses and edible oils, and petroleum and petroleum products. The Centre can include new commodities as and when the need arises, and take them off the list once the situation improves.

Here’s how it works. If the Centre finds that a certain commodity is in short supply and its price is spiking, it can notify stock-holding limits on it for a specified period. The States act on this notification to specify limits and take steps to ensure that these are adhered to. Anybody trading or dealing in the commodity, be it wholesalers, retailers or even importers are prevented from stockpiling it beyond a certain quantity.

A State can, however, choose not to impose any restrictions. But once it does, traders have to immediately sell into the market any stocks held beyond the mandated quantity. This improves supplies and brings down prices. As not all shopkeepers and traders comply, State agencies conduct raids to get everyone to toe the line and the errant are punished. The excess stocks are auctioned or sold through fair price shops.

== Personal life ==
Khan is the daughter, the third of five siblings, of a former diamond merchant and a lady who owned a Shanghainese-style fashion boutique called Le Bijou  in Singapore.  She learned the art of tailoring from her mother who made fashion dresses. Khan claims that she sees fashion as a form of self-expression and a means to display her creativity.&lt;ref name="star2"&gt;{{cite news |title= These women lead the way in Malaysia’s fashion and beauty industry  |url= http://www.star2.com/people/2017/03/12/these-women-lead-the-way-in-malaysias-fashion-and-beauty-industry/  |date= March 12, 2017 |newspaper=Star2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 27, Khan divorced her first husband and remarried with Singaporean business tycoon [[Akbar Khan (businessman)|Akbar Khan]] based in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. She adopted the [[Muslim name]] Farah Khan and joined her husband in the Malaysian capital. She stayed home for about a year and decided to resume her activities in the fashion industry.

Khan has three children: a 35-year-old son and a 33-year-old daughter from her first marriage. She also has another son, aged 23, from her second marriage. Khan has since been in a long-term relationship with Greek businessman Dimitri Pantazaras, 58, a real estate developer. She spends time with charity causes for children with special needs.

[[File:Florance C Broadhurst HOFWA.jpg|thumb|right|Florance C Broadhurst]]
'''Florance Constantine Broadhurst''' (1861–1909) was a 19th-century [[Western Australia]]n businessman who is most notable for successfully taking over the management of a number of business ventures of his notoriously unsuccessful, yet extremely creative and hard-working father, [[Charles Edward Broadhurst]], and turning a profit. The best known of these is the [[guano]] mining venture in the [[Houtman Abrolhos]].  While his entrepreneur father had recognised the potential of the industry and began mining, eventually to obtain a monopoly on the extraction of the guano, he proved unsuccessful in managing the concern. This situation continued until Florance, who had a mercantile education, joined the concern and began managing the venture under the name Broadhurst MacNeil and Company.  MacNeil was initially a backer and a partner, but he took no part in the management of the venture.  With his accountancy training F.C. Broadhurst proved enormously successful exporting to Europe and winning a gold medal at the Paris Exposition.  

While working the deposits on Gun Island, his labourers found a large number of artifacts that he believed to be relics of the 1629 ''[[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]]'' [[shipwreck]]. He developed an interest in the wreck, and eventually obtained a copy of [[Isaac Commelin]]'s 1647 ''[[Ongeluckige voyagie, van't schip Batavia]]'', the Dutch publication that first popularised the ''Batavia'' incident. He commissioned [[Willem Siebenhaar]] to translate it, and this resulted in what is still the only English translation, entitled ''[[The Abrolhos tragedy]]''. Broadhurst maintained a catalogue of his finds, which he donated to the state. These were eventually shown to be related not to the ''Batavia'', but  the VOC ship ''[[Zeewijk]]'', which was wrecked off [[Gun Island]] in 1727. A friend of his children, Henrietta Drake-Brockman, came to learn of the Dutch wrecks while around the family home, and she became an acknowledged force in the eventual location of the [[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]] wreck and its survivor's campsite. Though a great success, in 1904 Broadhurst lost the monopoly to the guano industry.

'''''Game Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]] focused on production of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/932120.asp|title=Game Tycoon - PC|publisher=gamerankings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been largely ridiculed, especially for some parts not translated from German to English.
&lt;!--
*Reception
[[X-Play]] gave the game a 1 out of 5, mentioning that parts of the game are still not translated from the original German. They also said that it was barely a game.--&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Game play is centered on the full production of video-game making; from production of an engine, concept design, physical design, packaging, licensing deals, market campaigns, and reviews.

The game starts off in 1982 with somewhat limited availability of features. Eventually, more options are made for engines and packaging, etc.

The '''Gershon Efficiency Review''' was a review of efficiency in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[public sector]] conducted in 2003-4 by [[Peter Gershon|Sir Peter Gershon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithbellerby.co.uk/glossary/page_5.html |title=Gershon Review |first= |last= |work=Smith Bellerby |year=2012 |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403212557/http://www.smithbellerby.co.uk/glossary/page_5.html |archivedate=April 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Brown]] and Tony Blair, then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Prime Minister]] respectively, appointed Peter Gershon, at that time the head of the [[Office of Government Commerce]], to review operations across all [[public services]] and make recommendations regarding expenditure and efficiency. His report recommended making savings for [[Financial Year]] 2005-6, to be achieved through dramatic changes to the organisation of each government department and automating their work patterns, in order to 'release' resources from the public sector budget that was then approximately £520bn. These gross savings of £21.5bn were reported to have been achieved by 2007 and agreed as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review in 2004 and subsequent budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.passport-offices.info/index.php?t=Gershon+Review |title=Gershon Review |first= |last= |work=Passport Office |year=2012 |accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of these objectives has been for all government departments to agree reductions on their long-term budgets, and then work out how to fulfill these challenging promises without crippling their existing obligations and service.

== Benefits ==
Certain functions were identified as offering good opportunities for savings through the use of ICT, such as tax collection and benefits payments. Aggregating and reorganising other functions offers the promise of savings in procurement, buildings and facilities. 
The approach encourages departments to meet the government's desire for 'Joined-up Government' that smooths out the delivery of services, and supports initiatives such as the use of a [[Common Systems Strategy]] as suggested in Sir [[David Varney]]'s Report and the [[Transformational Government strategy]].

== Problems ==
However, not all government functions present such clear opportunities; those with a large proportion of physical assets or customer-facing staff have great challenges to offer the equivalent level of savings without suffering damage to their level of service.

The timeframe also gives these organisations the challenge of investing in new services at a time when departmental headcount and budgets are being cut. In reality, the 'Gershon reviews' have been applied in waves across organisations.

In many instances the [[Treasury]] has interpreted this release of resources to be a cost saving for reallocation outside to other projects or departments.

Relocations recommended by Gershon have resulted in considerable loss of expertise, for example at the UK's Office For National Statistics, which has been criticized by the Chair of the Treasury Select committee. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/26/interestrates&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/08/andrew-tyrie-blasts-out-of-touch-office-for-national-statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jacksonville Riverwalks''' are a network of multi-use trails and open space developments along both the north and south banks of the [[St. Johns River]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]]. The roughly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Downtown Jacksonville|Downtown]] Northbank portion travels alongside the [[Hyatt Regency Jacksonville]], [[Jacksonville Landing]], [[Times-Union Center for the Performing Arts]], [[CSX Transportation Building]], and extends into the [[Brooklyn (Jacksonville)|Brooklyn]] district. The {{convert|1.25|mi|km|adj=on}} Southbank portion of the trail connects local landmarks such as [[Friendship Fountain]], [[Museum of Science and History]] and [[Riverplace Tower]].

==History==
[[Image:JAXRiverwalk1986.jpg|thumb|left|Southbank Riverwalk in 1986.]]
The first section of the Riverwalk opened on the Downtown Southbank on November 8, 1985. It was intended as a venue where tourists and local residents alike could view the beauty of the river and the skyline of the city. On a sunny day, the view from the walk includes shimmering water, shiny buildings, sailboats &amp; speedboats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jacksonville Riverwalk exposes Florida City's Good Side|newspaper=Charlotte Observer|date=February 15, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|1.2|mi|km|adj=on}} walk was designed by Perkins &amp; Perkins Architects to be a festive waterfront public space linking [[Friendship Fountain]] and Harbormasters Restaurant (now River City Brewing Co.) with hotels and office buildings east of the [[Main Street Bridge (Jacksonville)|Main Street Bridge]]. Friendship Park Fountain was built in 1965 and became one of the most recognizable landmarks in the city. A graphic system was developed and, included banners, kiosks and signage to provide visitors with clear and legible information, as well as reinforce the warm and lively image of the riverwalk.

A few of the project were built but scaled back. The St. Johns Wharf was a planned open-air marketplace to be built over the river adjacent to the Wyndham Hotel. A few shops were built along the riverwalk, but the wharf was never constructed. Four open air pavilions were planned and projected to include concessions and restroom facilities. only two were constructed. The Ship Museum, an attraction to emphasize the historic relationship between the city and the river; projected to include floating ship exhibits, was scaled back to the current [[Jacksonville Maritime Museum]], now closed. Multiple projects did not come to fruition. The Grove, a raised grass seating area shaded by a grove of palm trees; The Pyramid, an outdoor structure with terraced seating area for special events; An Aquarium located south of the maritime museum, facing Friendship Fountain, which would showcase local freshwater and saltwater marine life; A Great Lawn for recreation and relaxation; A sidewalk café under the bridge that would link both sides of riverwalk; A 3,000-seat open-air amphitheater with bandstand and theatrical lighting, built out into the river that would be used for public concerts, ballets, festivals and school graduations.

In January, 2005, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held to celebrate the opening of the latest extension of the Northbank Riverwalk. Construction took nearly two years for the {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}}, $8.7 million project. The landscaped brick walkway connects the existing Riverwalk at the CSX building to Riverside Avenue. Its features include historical lighting, water fountains, trash receptacles, bike racks, irrigated landscaping and over 100 benches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxkids.org/NR/exeres/D3297F35-4267-4813-9622-210FBB98139E.htm?NRMODE=Unpublished City of Jacksonville website: Jan 27, 2005-Mayor Cuts Ribbon to Open Northbank Riverwalk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 40 feet of Riverwalk was temporarily closed in late 2006 when corrosion caused steel pilings to fail and the supported walkway buckled. The city allocated $1.3 million to inspect the entire Riverwalk and make emergency repairs, and planned a multi-year capital improvement project eventually costing $25 million for upgrades split between both riverwalks. As part of that project, the city began installing 306 pile jackets in and around the area of the 2006 closure at a cost of $1.4 million.&lt;ref name=CAVE&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerr|first=Jessie-Lynn|title=Northbank Riverwalk cave-in causes closure|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2009-06-30/story/northbank_riverwalk_cave-in_causes_closure|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the January 31, 2008 meeting of the Downtown Development Review Board (DDRB) of the Jacksonville Economic Development Commission (JEDC), plans were tentatively approved for a 128-slip dockage facility to be named, ''The South Shore Marina &amp; Riverwalk at the Aetna Building''. The project would include a new section of southbank riverwalk on the {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[The Aetna Building (Jacksonville)|Aetna Building]] property, which has {{convert|1100|ft|m}} of riverfrontage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=49372 Jax Daily Record: February 4, 2008-Marina brings South Beach look to the Southbank by Max Marbut]&lt;/ref&gt; Permits from the [[Florida Department of Environmental Protection]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] had already been obtained, but financial conditions forced the project to be placed on hold.

[[Image:Northbankriverwalk.JPG|thumb|left|225px|New access from Fidelity land swap]]
The City of Jacksonville and [[Fidelity National Financial]] executed a land swap in 2008 that added {{convert|1.3|acre|m2}} in exchange for the parcel of land under Riverside Avenue's historic fire station. The city has the option to move the structure before it can be demolished, and funding for that purpose is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrojacksonville.com/content/view/798/122/ Metro Jacksonville: May 21, 2008-Public Access Improvements for Northbank Riverwalk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Riverside Arts Market (RAM)|''Riverside Arts Market'' (RAM)]] was begun in 2008 beneath the Fuller Warren Bridge around the Northbank Riverwalk. It is open on Saturdays, 10-4 from March to December&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scanlan|first=Dan|title=Jacksonville's longest-running art festival comes to Mandarin Easter weekend|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/arts/2012-04-05/story/jacksonvilles-longest-running-art-festival-comes-mandarin-easter#ixzz1rud1jLVS|accessdate=13 April 2012|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features an eclectic mix of vendors offering arts and crafts, food and drink, fruits and vegetables and live entertainment in a family-friendly environment. Eight of the market's vendors have subsequently opened brick &amp; mortar stores or restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patton|first=Charlie|title=Riverside Arts Market back in business for fourth season|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/arts/2012-03-04/story/riverside-arts-market-back-business-fourth-season|accessdate=13 April 2012|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2009, a 12-foot corner section of concrete walkway on the northbank collapsed due to erosion of the steel bulkhead. Another portion of the riverwalk was closed after bricks became loose when the walkway sank several inches. Repairs to both damaged areas were completed prior to the July 4th celebration and fireworks show.&lt;ref name=CAVE /&gt;

A meeting was held in January, 2010 between [[John Peyton (U.S. politician)|Mayor John Peyton]] and several city councilmen to discuss progress on three major downtown improvement projects, including Southbank Riverwalk replacement. Legislation was filed to fund these three projects with a price tag of $23 million. $11.9 million was allocated to replace the wooden structure with a more durable material with a 40-year life span, and upgrade lighting, railing and trash receptacles.&lt;ref name=KEY&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayor and City Council Members Discuss Implementation of Key Downtown Projects|url=http://www.coj.net/departments/central-operations/public-information/headlines/mayor-and-city-council-members-discuss-implementat.aspx|work=January 8, 2010|publisher=City of Jacksonville|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor Pitches Downtown Parks Overhaul|url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/Mayor-Pitches-Downtown-Parks-Overhaul/-/475880/2020776/-/22hr2xz/-/index.html|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=News4Jax|date=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2010 the city council passed the three bills without debate, providing final approval for all three projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Tia|title=Jacksonville council OKs downtown projects|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-02-09/story/jacksonville_council_oks_downtown_projects|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2011, the Northbank Riverwalk ran from the [[Fuller Warren Bridge]] to the former Shipyards property, owned by the city of Jacksonville. There are plans to extend it west to Riverside's Memorial Park, and east to [[Metropolitan Park]] across from the stadium. Free parking exists under the Fuller Warren Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Littlepage|first=Ron|title=Great Jacksonville Parks: The Northbank Riverwalk|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/florida/2011-11-03/story/great-jacksonville-parks-northbank-riverwalk|accessdate=13 April 2012|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
The center of the Northbank Riverwalk is the [[Jacksonville Landing|Landing]]. In 2002, the Jacksonville Track Club partnered with the city in commissioning ''The Runner'', a statue of a sprinting man on the riverwalk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/677a0/ba497/4/  Virtual Tourist--Exploring  Jacksonville's Downtown Riverfront]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Scott Biddle''' (1925–2008) was a foremost [[yachting]] [[cinematographer]] and lecturer, establishing a [[filmmaking|film-making]] career that spanned more than forty years.  His films captured not only the technical aspects of sailing but also the human story in events as tranquil as a [[Nova Scotia]] cruise and as grand as the [[America's Cup|America's Cup Races]].

==Early life==
Biddle was born on June 7, 1925, near [[Philadelphia]], the fourth of five children.  His parents, were both from prominent Philadelphia families.
His father was Brigadier General Nicholas Biddle (1893–1977), whose great-grandfather was [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]], President of the [[Second Bank of the United States]].
His mother was Sarah Lippincott Biddle (1894–1962), whose paternal grandfather Joshua Ballinger Lippincott  (1813–1886) founded [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|J. B. Lippincott Company]], and maternal grandfather [[Joseph Wharton]] (1826–1909) founded the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mrs. Biddle, 68 of Philadelphia: Clubwoman Dies Wife of Insurance Executive |date= July 18, 1962 |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50715F83C59137B93CAA8178CD85F468685F9 |accessdate= March 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His colorful family included cousins [[Livingston L. Biddle, Jr.]] and [[Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr.]]

Biddle’s father served a lifelong term with the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], was active in both [[World Wars]], and was a well-noted, [[big-game hunting|big-game hunter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Biddle Family Papers |work= University of Delaware Library Special collections |url= http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/biddle.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was commissioned to travel the world and bring back specimens; some of his ‘trophies’ still reside at Philadelphia’s [[Academy of Natural Sciences]]. During Nicholas’ travels, he would film the hunts, then return home and allow young John to experiment with his movie camera and all his unexposed film.{{citation needed |date= March 2011}}

John tinkered further with the camera at his family’s summer home in [[Jamestown, Rhode Island]], where he also mastered the idiosyncrasies of ocean sailing. Focusing on his brothers, sisters and twelve cousins as subjects on and around [[Narragansett Bay]], he refined his choice of angles, composition, containment of action within the frame and editing.&lt;ref name=Shope&gt;{{cite news |title=John Biddle: Film-maker to the sailing world |author= Roger Shope |work= Sailing Magazine |date=July 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School and military years==
Biddle, and his many cousins, attended Meadowbrook School, then went on to [[Kent School]] in Connecticut.  He turned 18 in 1943 and served in the infantry during [[World War II]].  A bad tooth sent him to the back of the lines during fighting in [[Belgium]]. There it was noticed that he could play piano and work a movie projector, so he was assigned to entertain the troops.  Shortly thereafter, he discovered two thirds of his platoon had been killed in a firefight.  His entertaining skills likely had spared his life. They also led to an unlikely occurrence: brother Nicholas Jr., who was fighting in the same region, learned that John was working at the back of the lines and flabbergasted him with a visit.&lt;ref&gt;Biddle, Nicholas, Jr. Flying Through the Years. Parkesburg, Pennsylvania: Treasured Legacies, 2001. pp. 79, 84. Printed for private circulation.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, John attended [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], then returned overseas to [[Germany]] with the [[First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry]] during the [[Korean War]].

==Yachting cinematographer==
In the 1950s, Biddle spent several years working as an engineer while snapping wedding and baby photos on the side.  His father would have liked him to enter the family insurance business, Biddle, Bishop and Smith (now named Biddle &amp; Company), but John saw a different path.  After watching a John Jay skiing film, he imagined himself doing the same thing with sailing.  The following June he embarked on the 1956 [[Bermuda Race]] aboard cousin Charles Wharton’s 51-foot [[cutter (boat)|cutter]], ''Souvenir'' with his film camera along.  He combined that footage with three other pieces he shot that summer, and booked himself into [[yacht clubs]] for his first lecture-show.&lt;ref name=Shope/&gt;

For over four decades, Biddle shot films of [[dinghy]] races, [[Tall Ships]] events and everything in between. Over seventy types of boats were shown in his documentary-style presentations. 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[Bell and Howell]] in hand, he filmed 130 feet off the deck of [[square rig|square-riggers]] and fifteen feet underwater.  He filmed from [[Greenland]] down to the Islands, from [[Greece]] to [[New Zealand]].  He shot ocean races like the [[Fastnet Race]], classic sailing [[regattas]] like the [[Friendship Sloop]] Regatta, [[cruise ship|cruises]], celebrations, native fishboat races, small boat races.  To capture viewable images on the rolling, bouncy seas, he used (and later marketed) what he called the Biddlestick – a monopod-like stick which he attached to his movie cameras, allowing him to hold onto deck stays while keeping the camera steady.

In addition to his annual show, Biddle made promotional films for boat manufacturers and sailboat classes, filmed a five-episode TV series for [[Mercury Marine]] called "Let’s Go Boating" narrated by [[Lloyd Bridges]], and occasionally filmed for private clients.&lt;ref name=Bigoney&gt;{{cite news |title= John Biddle: Cinematographer of the Seven Seas |author= Mag Bigoney |work= [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting Magazine]]|date=December 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lecturer==
Each year, Biddle would film three to four events in the summer months, edit the mile of film into a 90-minute presentation in the fall, write a script for same, have music pulled for the film and edit the music to fit.  In winter, he would begin a five-month tour of the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Bermuda]], the [[Caribbean]] (and occasionally [[Europe]] and [[Australia]]) where he would present his films in person as many as 100 times, primarily at [[yacht clubs]].  For many of Biddle's audience, his show presented the only opportunity to see the highlights of the past year's sailing events.  One of the great attractions was his ability to catch the amusing and exhilarating aspects of sailing, not only on film, but in his quick-witted, dry-humored delivery peppered with terms like "callapso flapitis", referring to frantic moments on the boat.&lt;ref name=Bigoney/&gt;  Biddle was his own [[production company]], performing the tasks of: contact agent, scheduler, [[publicist]], [[copywriter]], photo developer, poster designer, [[accountant]], [[cinematographer]], [[film editor]], [[screenwriter|scriptwriter]], [[music editor]], driver, porter, set-up man and performer.

==Family life==
Biddle married Mary McMichael in 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= John Biddle Fiance Of Mary McMichael |newspaper= [[new York Times]] |date= March 15, 1961 |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A1EFF385912738DDDAC0994DB405B818AF1D3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Jamestown, Rhode Island and they had two children, Sophie in 1964 and Scott in 1966.  Mary assisted John in filming the early [[America's Cup]] races.  She had a [[stroke]] shortly after the birth of Scott and died five years later.  Following this, Biddle managed to spend time at home with his children while continuing his career on the road and was able to include Sophie and Scott on trips to [[Bermuda]], a cruise to [[Maine]] and trips to various lecture dates.  In March 1977, he married Amy McKay van Roden in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]], Pennsylvania with three stepchildren: Winifred, Peter and Julie.  

==Career highlights==
Biddle filmed two races multiple times.  The [[Bermuda Race]] he sailed 11 times to capture the stories that this pre-eminent, [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] distance race delivered.  Despite the race’s long history and prestige, Biddle is the only [[filmmaker|film-maker]] to have focused on it.  He also filmed the international [[yacht racing]] event, the [[America's Cup]], all ten times when [[12-metre class]] boats were used, from 1958 to 1987.  For this, he took footage of the [[Sparkman &amp; Stephens]] test tanks, of the spring practices, the summer trials, the [[Newport, Rhode Island]] balls, the dock happenings and the September finals. He was invited to shoot on board the 12-metre yachts by mercurial skippers  including [[Ted Turner]], [[Dennis Conner]], [[Ted Hood]] and [[Intrepid (yacht)|Bus Mosbacher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= John Biddle inducted into the America's Cup Hall of Fame |author= Sue Maffei Plowden |newspaper= Jamestown Press |date= May 14, 2009 |url= http://www.jamestownpress.com/news/2009-05-14/News/John_Biddle_inducted_into_the_Americas_Cup_Hall_of.html |accessdate= March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rare invitations were granted because of his [[nautical]] proficiency and ability to get key shots while staying clear of onboard action.

==Final years==
After moving to [[Jamestown, Rhode Island|Jamestown]] in 1980, Biddle became active with the Jamestown Community Chorus and directed the town talent show for several years.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

During his career, Biddle created 140 sailing films which he placed into 41 annual [[lecture]] shows from 1956 to 1996.  He made over 3,000 presentations to audiences as large as 3,000 people.  In the summer of 2008, Biddle was nominated for induction into the [[America's Cup Hall of Fame]] at the [[Herreshoff Marine Museum]] in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= John Biddle, 2009 Inductee |work= America's Cup Hall of Fame |publisher= [[Herreshoff Marine Museum]] |url= http://www.herreshoff.org/achof/john_biddle.html  |accessdate= March 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He fell ill with [[cancer]] soon thereafter and died on October 1, 2008 at the age of 83 in [[Middletown, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |title= John Scott Biddle, 83 |date= October 9, 2008 |newspaper= The Jamestown Press |url= http://www.jamestownpress.com/news/2008-10-09/obituaries/024.html |accessdate= March 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal induction ceremony was held in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= America's Cup Hall of Fame 16th Annual Induction: Celebrating John Biddle the 2008 Inductee |work= News release |date= August 26, 2008 |location= Bristol, Rhode Island |url= http://forum.sailingscuttlebutt.com/cgi-bin/gforum.cgi?post=6298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gary Jobson]] said of Biddle’s film-making achievement, “His film archive is one of the most comprehensive and important yachting libraries in existence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Eight Bells: John Biddle |author= [[Gary Jobson]] |work= Sailing Scuttlebutt web site |date=October 1, 2008 |url= http://forum.sailingscuttlebutt.com/cgi-bin/gforum.cgi?post=6482 |accessdate= March 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Jacob "Jakey" Astor VI''' (August 14, 1912 – June 26, 1992) was an American socialite, shipping businessman, and member of the [[Astor family]]. He was dubbed the "''Titanic'' Baby" for his affiliation with the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]; Astor was born four months after his father, Colonel [[John Jacob Astor IV]], died in the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the ''Titanic'']]; his pregnant mother [[Madeleine Astor]] survived the sinking.&lt;ref name="TitanicBaby"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2270&amp;dat=19150603&amp;id=I2EmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=F0sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3991,2953356 | title=Jack Astor, the Titanic Baby | publisher=The Ellensburg Democrat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astor was known for his legal battles with the estate of his elder half-brother, [[Vincent Astor]], to inherit a larger portion of their father's $85 million fortune (approximately equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.085|1912|r=1}}}} billion in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US}}&lt;ref name="AstorEstate"/&gt; He was also known for his many engagements and four marriages to prominent society women.&lt;ref name="JJA5thObit1992"/&gt;

==Early life==
John Jacob Astor VI was born at [[Caroline Astor House|840 Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City]] on August 14, 1912. He was the son of Colonel [[John Jacob Astor IV|John Jacob "Jack" Astor IV]] (1864–1912) and socialite [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine Talmage Force]] (1893–1940). Jakey's parents' marriage, on September 9, 1911, had sparked much controversy both because of their 29-year age difference and since Colonel Astor had only previously been divorced from his first wife, socialite [[Ava Lowle Willing]] (1868–1958), one year earlier, on March 5, 1910.

The newlyweds were returning home aboard the ''Titanic'' after about three months of honeymooning in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Europe]]. Madeleine was five months pregnant with Jakey when her husband put her in one of the ship's lifeboats. She was rescued eight hours after her husband went down with the ship.

After Jack's death, Madeleine raised their son at the Astors' Newport, Rhode Island, mansion, [[Beechwood (Astor mansion)|Beechwood]], as part of the Astor family. She would later remarry to banker William Karl Dick (1888–1953) in June 1916, and boxer [[Enzo Fiermonte]] (1908–1993) in November 1933. Through Dick, she would have two more sons: William Force Dick (1917–1961) and John Henry Dick II (1919–1995).&lt;ref name="Dick dies"&gt;{{cite web|title=WILLIAM DICK DIES; AN INDUSTRIALIST|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/william-dick-dies-an-industrialist.html|work=encyclopedia titanica|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiermonte taught her sons boxing.

Jakey, who had become close to Dick, highly opposed the union with Fiermonte and repeatedly tried to convince his mother to end the relationship. He and his mother frequently argued over the union. This caused a rift between the two, though they later reconciled within several months of the marriage. When asked if his mother was marrying Fiermonte, he responded "Unfortunately, it's true".

Jakey graduated from [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]] in [[Middletown, Rhode Island]] and from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="MadeleineBio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.titanic-passengers.com/madeleineastor.htm | title=Madeleine Astor | publisher=titanic-passengers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inheritance==

Under the terms of Colonel Astor's will, Madeleine received relatively little from her husband's $85 million estate (approximately equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.085|1912|r=1}}}} billion in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US}}&lt;ref name="AstorEstate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Astor Bequests Have All Been Paid|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/astor-bequests-have-all-been-paid.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This value included his estate in Rhinebeck and his yacht, the ''[[USS Noma (SP-131)|Noma]]''. [[Vincent Astor|William Vincent Astor]] (1891–1959), the Colonel's son from his first marriage, received $69 million (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.069|1912|r=1}}}} billion in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), while the Colonel's daughter from his first marriage, [[Ava Alice Muriel Astor]] (1902–1956), received a $10 million trust fund (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10|1912|r=-1}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).

The Colonel's 19-year-old widow Madeleine received the annual income from a $5 million trust fund (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1912|r=-1}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), sweetened by an annual payment of $500,000 (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.5|1912|r=0}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), as well as use of his New York mansion 65th &amp; Fifth Avenue, all its furnishings, and his Newport mansion [[Beechwood (mansion)|Beechwood]] and all of its furnishings, the pick of whichever luxury limo she wanted from his collection, and five of his prized horses, provided that she did not remarry. While not listed by name, his father's will mentioned that any surviving child other than his children Vincent and Ava would receive a bequest of $3 million, to be held in trust until the child reached age 21.&lt;ref name="son"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/08/15/100374187.pdf| title=Son for Mrs. Astor; Named for Father| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=August 15, 1912| accessdate=2013-06-17| publisher=NYTimes.com| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MoneyForJakey&gt;{{cite web|title=Astor Estate Goes To Son|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QupgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u2MNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2415,1723472&amp;dq=madeleine+force+astor&amp;hl=en|publisher=The Evening News|date=7 May 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jakey inherited the $3 million on his 21st birthday, which by that point had grown to $5 million (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1933|r=0}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US}} When Madeleine died in late March 1940, she left him a diamond solitaire ring worth $50,000 (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1940|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) and a pearl necklace worth $1,525 (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1525|1940|r=-1}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).

Elder half-brother Vincent's contempt for Madeleine led him to believe that Jakey was not even a biological Astor. Having despised his younger half-brother since birth, Vincent left him nothing in his will.&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;{{cite web|title=Part II: Vincent, the Astor Who Gave Away the Money|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/node/317873/print|publisher=NewYorkSocialDaily|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jakey felt cheated and resentfully stated Vincent "had the legal, not the moral right to keep all the money".&lt;ref name=Survivors&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Andrew|title=Shadow of the Titanic: The Extraordinary Stories of Those Who Survived|year=2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Vincent died childless in early February 1959, Jakey sued Vincent's widow [[Brooke Astor|Roberta Brooke Russell]] (1902—2007) to inherit his money. He was convinced that Vincent was "mentally incompetent" when signing his last will in June 1958 due to alcoholism, though Brooke insisted Vincent was "fully competent". While Vincent was hospitalized, Brooke would often bring him liquor. Jakey accused her of using the liquor to influence the will in her favor. Jakey ended up settling for $250,000 (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.25|1959|r=1}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars). The rest of money remained with the Vincent Astor foundation and Brooke.&lt;ref name=BrookeMemoir&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Meryl|title=Mrs. Astor Regrets: The Hidden Betrayals of a Family Beyond Reproach|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Astor became engaged to Eileen Sherman Gillespie (1915–2008), the elder daughter of Lieutenant Lawrence Lewis Gillespie (1876–1940) and Irene Muriel Augusta Sherman (1887–1972), in early December 1933. Irene's parents were businessman [[William Watts Sherman]] (1842–1912) and Sophia Augusta Brown (1867–1947).&lt;ref name=EileenAncestors&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Deusen|first=Mary S.|title=Eileen Sherman Gillespie|url=http://www.iment.com/maida/friends/eileen/index.htm|publisher=iment.com|accessdate=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They planned to marry on February 6, 1934. However, she called off the wedding on January 22, 1934, after a bitter argument. Heartbroken, he went to [[Shanghai]] shortly afterwards to grieve, returning to America in early May 1934.  Astor blamed her parents for interfering with the relationship.  He once suggested they could potentially reconcile, stating "I was willing to marry her, and if I were to think about it, I might still be willing to marry her."&lt;ref name=Eileen&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Deborah|title=Gilded: How Newport Became America's Richest Resort|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eileen's daughter Marguerite "Margy" Slocum later said of him: "She felt that he had grown up lonely... He was a bit eccentric, and she felt he wasn't mature enough to get married."&lt;ref name=EileenHusband&gt;{{cite web|title=John Jermain Slocum|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98862260|publisher=Find a Grave|date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/us/01slocum.html | work=New York Times | title=Eileen G.

A few weeks after returning from Shanghai, he became engaged to Eileen's close friend socialite Ellen Tuck "Tucky" French (1915–1974), the elder daughter of Francis Ormond "Frank" French II (1888–1962) and Eleanor Livingston Burrill (1891–1974).&lt;ref name="Francis/Eleanor"&gt;{{cite web| title=Francis Ormond FRENCH/Eleanor Livingston BURRILL| url=http://www.pennock.ws/surnames/fam/fam40565.html| publisher=pennock}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married on June 30, 1934, at Trinity Church in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name=FirstWedding&gt;{{cite web|last=Porter|first=Russell B.|title=JOHN JACOB ASTOR WEDS ELLEN FRENCH|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/john-jacob-astor-weds-ellen-french.html|work=Encyclopedia Titanica|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tucky was a first cousin of Rhode Island Governor [[William Henry Vanderbilt III]] (1901–1981), and had previously been attracted to Jakey while he was engaged to Eileen.  Along with Eileen's sister Phyllis, Tucky was scheduled to be a bridesmaid at Jakey and Eileen's wedding. Together, the couple had one son before divorcing in May 1943.&lt;ref name="Dolly v.

On August 6, 1954, Astor married for the third time to Dolores Margaret "Dolly" Fullman (born c. 1928) in [[Arlington, Virginia]].  For the 26 year old Dolly, it was her second marriage.  They separated soon after returning from their honeymoon and divorced.&lt;ref name="oust"&gt;{{cite news| title=Astor's Name Taken from Social Register| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xU1UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zDoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5713,6171006&amp;dq=astor+social+register&amp;hl=en| work=[[St. Joseph News-Press]]| date=27 November 1954| page=2| agency=[[United Press International|United Press]]| accessdate=2013-06-17| location=Missouri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |title=Milestones: Married |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820052,00.html?iid=digg_share |quote=John Jacob Astor VI, 42, whose fortune, inherited from his great-great-grandfather, is estimated at $70 million; and Dolores Margaret "Dolly" Fullman, 26, blonde Miami divorcee; he for the third time, she for the second; in Arlington, Va. |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=Time.com |date=16 August 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astor married his fourth, and final wife, Sue Sandford in 1956. They remained married until her death in 1985.&lt;ref name="JJA5thObit1992"/&gt;

Astor died in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], in 1992 at the age of 79. His body was returned to New York for burial with his parents in the [[Trinity Church Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="trinity"&gt;{{cite web| title=Myth #3: There are a lot of Astors buried in the churchyard| url=http://www.trinitywallstreet.org/news/blogs/the-archivists-mailbag/myth-3-there-are-a-lot-of-astors-buried-in-the-churchyard| publisher=Trinity Wall Street| date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was survived by his son, daughter, three grandsons, and younger half-brother.&lt;ref name="JJA5thObit1992"&gt;{{cite news|title=John J.

===Descendants===
{{main|Astor family}}
Through his son, Astor was a grandfather to two boys, William Backhouse Astor IV (b. 1959) and Gregory Todd Astor (b. 1966) who portrayed Colonel Astor in ''Titanic the Musical'' in April 2012&lt;ref name=PlayRole&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallenbeck|first=Brent|title=Born to Play the Role|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20120202/ENT/120320026/|publisher=[[The Burlington Free Press]]|date=March 20, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131204042233/http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20120202/ENT/120320026/|archivedate=December 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory married Robin Rhodes, and together, they have three children: Alexandra Ellen "Allie" Astor (b. 1997), Rebecca Charlotte "Becca" Astor (b. 1998), and Stephen William Astor (b. 2002).&lt;ref name="BackhouseIIIObituary"&gt;{{cite news| title=William Backhouse Astor III | work=[[The Burlington Free Press]]| location=[[Vermont]]| date=20 September 2008| publisher=Scroggin(s) Obituaries &amp; News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his daughter, Astor was a grandfather to Nicholas Astor Drexel (b. 1988).&lt;ref name=Newport&gt;{{cite web|title=John R.

==In popular culture==
Astor's name is shown on one of the page buttons on an apartment building in [[Mel Brooks]]' 2005 [[movie musical]] ''[[The Producers (2005 film)|The Producers]]''.

===Name confusion===
Even though some sources refer to Jakey as John Jacob V, [[John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever]] (1886–1971) was born first and therefore is actually John Jacob Astor V. Jakie Astor (1918–2000), youngest brother of [[David Astor]], was [[Jakie Astor|John Jacob Astor VII]]; the 3rd Baron Astor of Hever is [[John Astor, 3rd Baron Astor of Hever|John Jacob Astor VIII]]. Jakey is sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as John Jacob III.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6745">The term "'''knowledge commons'''" refers to information, data, and content that is collectively owned and managed by a community of users, particularly over the Internet. What distinguishes a knowledge commons from a [[commons]] of shared physical resources is that digital resources are [[Rivalry (economics)|non-subtractible]]; that is, multiple users can access the same digital resources with no effect on their quantity or quality.&lt;ref name="ostrom"&gt;{{cite book |title= Understanding Knowledge as a Commons - From Theory to Practice |url=https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EQM07412.pdf|last= Hess |first= Charlotte |author2=Ostrom, Elinor  |year= 2007 |publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-262-08357-7 |pages= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual background ==

The term 'commons' is derived from the medieval economic system ''[[the commons]]''. Today, the knowledge commons act as a frame of reference for a number of domains, including [[open education|Open Educational]] resources such as the MIT [[OpenCourseware]], free digital media such as Wikipedia, [[Creative commons]]–licensed art, open-source research,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua M. Pearce, "[https://www.academia.edu/1861756/Open_Source_Research_in_Sustainability Open Source Research in Sustainability]", ''Sustainability: the Journal of Record'', '''5'''(4), pp. 238-243, 2012. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/sus.2012.9944 DOI] [https://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1867941/Open_Source_Research_in_Sustainability free and open access]&lt;/ref&gt; and open scientific collections such as the [[Public Library of Science]] or the [[Science Commons]], [[Free Software]] and [[Open Design]]. According to research by Charlotte Hess and [[Elinor Ostrom]],&lt;ref name="ostrom"/&gt; the conceptual background of the knowledge commons encompasses two intellectual histories: first, a European tradition of battling the enclosure of the "intangible commons of the mind",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyle |first1=James |year=2003 |title=The Second Enclosure Movement and the Construction of the Public Domain |journal=Law and Contemporary Problems |publisher= |volume=66 |issue=1-2 |pages=33–74 |url=http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/66LCPBoyle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123190230/http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/66LCPBoyle/ |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; threatened by expanding intellectual property rights and privatization of knowledge. Second, a tradition rooted in the United States, which sees the knowledge commons as a shared space allowing for free speech and democratic practices, and which is in the tradition of the town commons movement and commons-based production of scholarly work, [[open science]], open libraries, and collective action.&lt;ref name="ostrom"/&gt;

The production of works in the knowledge commons is often driven by [[collective intelligence]] respectively the wisdom of crowds and is related to knowledge communism as it was defined by [[Robert K. Merton]], according to whom scientists give up [[intellectual property rights]] in exchange for recognition and esteem.

Ferenc Gyuris argues, that it is important to distinguish "information" from "knowledge" in defining the term "knowledge commons". He argues that "knowledge as a shared resource" requires that both information must become accessible and potential recipients must become able and willing to internalize it as 'knowledge'. ''"Therefore, knowledge cannot become a shared resource without a complex set of institutions and practices that give the opportunity to potential recipients to gain the necessary abilities and willingness"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gyuris |first1= Ferenc |year= 2014 |title= Basic education in communist Hungary. A commons approach |journal= International Journal of the Commons |publisher= |volume= 8 |issue= 2 |pages= 531–553 |url= http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/article/view/458/401 |doi=10.18352/ijc.458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyleft ==

A main principle of the knowledge commons is that the traditional "[[copyright]]" is being replaced by "[[copyleft]]". Copyleft licenses grant licensees all necessary rights such as right to study, use, change and redistribute—under the condition that all future works building on the license are again kept in the commons.
The most popular applications of the 'copyleft' principle are the [[GNU]] Software Licenses (GPL, LGPL and GFDL by Free Software Foundation) and the [[share-alike]] licenses under [[creative commons]].

'''Live export''' is the commercial transport of [[livestock]] across national borders. The trade involves a number of countries with the [[Australian live export industry]] being one of the largest exporters in the global trade. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], exports of live sheep rose 21.4% and live calves increased 9.7% between March 2017 and March 2018. During 2017 alone, Australia exported 2.85 million living animals in shipping containers and airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='This one has heat stress': the shocking reality of live animal exports |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/30/this-one-has-heat-stress-the-shocking-reality-of-live-animal-exports}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the trade has been supported by the introduction of purpose-built ships which carry large numbers of animals. The amount of livestock exported from the [[European Union]] grew to nearly 586m kilograms between 2014 and 2017, a 62.5% increase during the time period. 

There has been strong criticism of the industry on animal rights grounds. [[New Zealand]] has effectively phased out live exports for slaughter purposes since 2007 due to concerns about animals.&lt;ref name="Is it true that New Zealand has banned live export?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banliveexport.com/facts/frequently-asked-questions.php|title=Is it true that New Zealand has banned live export?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union legislation==
The EU introduced new legislation in 2004, which was planned to come into force in 2007. Agriculture Ministers from individual states who make up the Council however, have deferred decisions on a package of reforms, including journey times, until 2011. They have adopted some reforms that offer more training and certification for drivers by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ciwf.org.uk/what_we_do/live_transport/european_campaign.aspx Compassion in World Farming - The Campaign in Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120083045/http://www.ciwf.org.uk/what_we_do/live_transport/european_campaign.aspx |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation was also written with the aim of covering better loading and unloading facilities.

==United Kingdom==
Between 15 July 2002 and January 2004, around 200,000 lambs and sheep were exported for slaughter or further fattening abroad, mainly to France and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwf.org.uk/publications/reports/live_exports_2000.pdf CIWF Report 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Animal and Plant Health Agency]] (APHA) is responsible for conducting inspections of animals at the point of loading and at ports. [[Trading Standards]] also has powers to inspect animals during transport, and is responsible for carrying out any prosecutions under the regulations.

The Port of [[Ramsgate]] temporarily halted live transport after an incident in 2012, when 40 sheep were euthanised after being badly injured during transit. The decision was overturned by the High Court on the grounds that the port could not ban live animal exports on the grounds of freedom of movement with the EU and UK legislation.

After his appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs, [[Michael Gove]] indicated in July 2017 that [[Brexit]] would offer the opportunity to ban live animal export for slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8031 Live Animal Exports within the European Union 4 Jul 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
{{Main article|Australian live export industry}}
Australia is one of the world's largest exporters of sheep and cattle. According to [[Meat and Livestock Australia]], 2.44 million sheep were exported to markets in Asia and the Middle East in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.com.au/Prices-and-markets/Trends-and-analysis/Sheepmeat-and-lamb/Forecasts/MLA-sheep-industry-projections-2013/11-live-sheep-exports MLA sheep industry projections - live sheep exports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513193601/http://www.mla.com.au/Prices-and-markets/Trends-and-analysis/Sheepmeat-and-lamb/Forecasts/MLA-sheep-industry-projections-2013/11-live-sheep-exports |date=2013-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced from 4.2 million in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livecorp.com.au/sheep-statistics LiveCorp - Sheep Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of cattle exported in 2012 was 617, 301, down 11% from the previous year. Indonesia accounted for 45% of total live cattle exports from Australia in 2012. Total cattle exports to Indonesia reduced by 33% from 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.com.au/Prices-and-markets/Trends-and-analysis/Beef/Live-exports Meat and Livestock Australia - Live Exports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511203652/http://www.mla.com.au/Prices-and-markets/Trends-and-analysis/Beef/Live-exports |date=2013-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction in cattle exports to Indonesia in 2012 was partly due to the newly imposed ESCAS (Exporter Supply Chain Assurance Scheme) from 2011, and partly due to Indonesia's move to become self-sufficient in beef production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/jakarta-fires-new-shots-in-cattle-war/story-fn59niix-1226477655995 The Australian "Jakarta fires new shots in cattle war" 20 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the livestock are for human consumption but there is also an active trade in breeding stock, including dairy cattle.

The [[Department of Agriculture and Water Resources]] controls the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock. The standards were amended in April 2011 (version 2.3).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/welfare/export-trade/livestock-export-standards Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (Version 2.3) April 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426170037/http://www.daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/welfare/export-trade/livestock-export-standards |date=2013-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department also introduced ESCAS (Exporter Supply Chain Assurance Scheme), in 2011 &amp;mdash; a system requiring exporters to provide evidence of compliance with internationally agreed animal welfare standards, and to demonstrate traceability and control through the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daff.gov.au/biosecurity/export/live-animals/livestock/escas#overview Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Australia) Overview of Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Department, ESCAS was developed in response to evidence of cruelty to Australian cattle in Indonesia, and then extended to all livestock exports for the purpose of slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daff.gov.au/biosecurity/export/live-animals/livestock/escas#general Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Australia) General information about ESCAS arrangements]&lt;/ref&gt; [[#In Australian live export|See Animal Welfare section]].

[[AQIS]] ([[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]]) manages quarantine controls to minimise the risk of exotic pests and diseases entering the country. [[AQIS]] also provides import and export inspection and certification to help retain Australia's highly favourable animal, plant and human health status and wide access to overseas export markets.

Other key markets include Israel, Malaysia, Japan, Mexico and China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/ED5DA007-A196-4283-B731-FB9B8F4EE204/0/FastfactsBeef2006.pdf MLA markets for Australian live exports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921025117/http://www.mla.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/ED5DA007-A196-4283-B731-FB9B8F4EE204/0/FastfactsBeef2006.pdf |date=2006-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The major markets for [[Australian sheep]] are Kuwait and Jordan. Other key markets are Bahrain, the UAE, Oman and Qatar. Australia's main market competitors are from China, South America and North Africa.

==New Zealand==
In 2005, New Zealand exported NZ$217 million worth of live animals, mainly for breeding purposes. Exports included cattle, sheep, horses, deer, goats and day-old chicks. Because New Zealand is free from most exotic diseases most livestock shipments are for breeding or finishing purposes. Cattle are not exported for slaughter and the last export of sheep for slaughter was in 2003.

In November 2007, the New Zealand Government introduced the new Customs Exports Prohibition (Livestock for Slaughter) Order. Although not a blanket ban, the new legal requirement restricts live animal exports for slaughter unless the risks to animals and New Zealand's trade reputation can be adequately managed. There has been no export of live animals for slaughter purposes since that date.&lt;ref name="Is it true that New Zealand has banned live export?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banliveexport.com/facts/frequently-asked-questions.php|title=Is it true that New Zealand has banned live export? |publisher=[[Animals Australia]] |work=Ban Live Export}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal welfare==
Live exports have been subject to scrutiny by animal welfare groups around the world.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, animal welfare group [[Compassion in World Farming]] has named live exports of sheep and cattle “cruel and unnecessary”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwf.org.uk/what_we_do/live_transport/live_exports_from_the_uk_must_stop.aspx CIWF - Live Exports From the UK Must Stop]&lt;/ref&gt; Most UK live animal exports currently ship out of the Port of Ramsgate. In June 2011 a Ramsgate Town Councillor, Ian Driver, spoke out in opposition to live exports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/transport_of_live_animals/great_turnout_for_ban_live_export_meeting_in_ramsgate.aspx CIWF - Media Release]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 2012, 46 sheep were euthanised after injuries inflicted due to transportation faults at the Port of Ramsgate. A temporary suspension on live exports from the Port was called by the Thanet Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://action.ciwf.org.uk/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=119&amp;ea.campaign.id=16369&amp;ea.tracking.id=1174f49c CIWF - Urgent: The End of UK Live Exports?]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===

New Zealand has partaken in no live animal exports for slaughter since 2003, after 4000 sheep died on a ship bound for [[Saudi Arabia]]. In 2012, the President of the [[Federated Farmers of New Zealand]] was quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{cquote|The worry we had is the repetitional risk of a very small number of sheep being transported live to other parts of the world was just too great against the very large processed export industry we have with sheep meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = NZ live sheep ban due to continued risk| publisher = ABC Rural| url = http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/201211/s3629051.htm | date =2012-09-11 |accessdate = 2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Animal welfare groups in New Zealand]] continue to call for a ban on live export of animals for breeding purposes. [[SAFE (organisation)|SAFE]] has stated that live exports pose “potential for serious suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Australia's live export industry has experienced significant scrutiny by animal welfare groups since 2003. The RSPCA is opposed to live export.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.au/campaigns/live-export |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923104024/http://www.rspca.org.au/campaigns/live-export |archivedate=2014-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 550,000 animals are reported to have died en route during live export journeys between 2000-2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/welfare/export-trade/mortalities Livestock Mortalities for Export by Sea - Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426170041/http://www.daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/welfare/export-trade/mortalities |date=2013-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 Freedom of Information report revealed sheep died on route due to several factors including heat stress, septicaemia and acute pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liveexport-indefensible.com/foi_reports.php Damning Live Export Reports Obtained Through Freedom of Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410005233/http://liveexport-indefensible.com/foi_reports.php |date=2013-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Lynn Simpson, a former on-board vet for the live export industry, made a submission to the Department of Agriculture in March 2013 condemning animal welfare conditions on live export ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vale.org.au/uploads/1/0/4/3/10438895/vale_press_release_130312.pdf VALE - Media Release | date =2013-12-03]&lt;/ref&gt; A group of former live export vets - Veterinarians Against Live Export (VALE) has formed to oppose the trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vale.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent former live export veterinarians who have spoken out against the conditions on ships include Dr Lloyd Reeve Johnson, who expressed his concern about the conflict of interest involved in live export companies paying for animal welfare advice,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/vet-worried-about-dodgy-inspections-of-live-exports/story-fn59niix-1226093400993&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Tony Hill, who was allegedly pressured to report 105 mortalities when in fact 2000 sheep had died,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vale.org.au/in-depth.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr Kerkenezov, who has urged an end to an industry he calls "cruel."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruralweekly.com.au/news/end-cruel-trade-vet-best-practice-in-australia/2365034/&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, [[Animals Australia]] investigators collected footage which showed Australian cattle being slaughtered at 11 abattoirs in Indonesia with practices that infringed upon [[OIE]] standards for animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banliveexport.com/videos/indonesia-report.php Indonesia 2011 - Investigation Report | date =2011-11-30]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animals Australia]] and [[RSPCA Australia]] jointly complained to the federal [[Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Australia)|Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry]], calling for a ban on live exports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banliveexport.com/ Ban Live Exports]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the footage, live exports to Indonesia were suspended by the Australian Minister for Agriculture from June 7, 2011 until July 6, 2011. The suspension was lifted with the new Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System in place, outlining mandatory compliance for all importing markets of Australian live animals for slaughter, with international standards for animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maff.gov.au/media_office/media_releases/media_releases/2011/july/government-lifts-live-cattle-export-suspension Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry - Media Release | date =2011-06-07] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421045313/http://www.maff.gov.au/media_office/media_releases/media_releases/2011/july/government-lifts-live-cattle-export-suspension |date=2013-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESCAS regulatory framework is applicable across all importing markets as of December 31, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/export/live-animals/livestock/escas Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427063659/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/export/live-animals/livestock/escas |date=2013-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The footage was the subject of a separate investigation conducted by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] program, [[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]], shown on 30 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = A Bloody Business| publisher = ABC| url = http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2011/s3228880.htm | date =2013-05-30 |accessdate = 2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report entitled “A Bloody Business” was the winner of a [[Logie Award]] for “Most Outstanding Public Affairs Report” as well as the 2011 [[Gold Walkley]] Award.

In November 2012, another widely reported investigation by [[Animals Australia]] brought attention to the slaughter of 22,000 Australian sheep in an ESCAS-approved feedlot in [[Pakistan]], after weeks at sea upon the initial consignment being rejected by [[Bahrain]] due to claimed fears of disease. The video footage of the cull, obtained by Animals Australia “shows absolute chaos with animals being dragged, beaten, having their throats sawn at with blunt knives and thrown into mass graves -- some of them still alive hours later."&lt;ref name=184animals&gt;[http://www.animalsaustralia.org/media/press_releases.php?release=184 Animals Australia - Media Release | date =2012-11-06]&lt;/ref&gt; Animals Australia's Campaign Director, Lyn White, stated of the incident:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{cquote|Exporters cannot deny responsibility - they put live animals on ships - knowing the scale of risks and factors outside their control. They cannot then say, 'it's not our fault' when the inevitable happens and something goes terribly wrong.&lt;ref name=184animals /&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 6 May 2013 a report aired on Australia's ''ABC 7.30'', revealing footage of cruelty to Australian cattle in at least one Egyptian abattoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Cattle cruelty footage suspends trade, sparks live export debate | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) ''7.30'' | url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2013/s3753039.htm | date =2013-05-06 |accessdate = 2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The footage, provided to the Australian Department of Agriculture by animal protection group Animals Australia, led to a suspension of live trade to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = 'Cruelty' stops live exports to Egypt | publisher = The Age | url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/cruelty-stops-live-exports-to-egypt-20130504-2j07k.html | date =2013-05-05 |accessdate = 2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig described the footage as "sickening", and the Australian Live Exporters' Council chief executive, Alison Penfold, said she was "distraught and disgusted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Live export row dogs Gillard | publisher = Sydney Morning Herald | url = http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/live-export-row-dogs-gillard-20130504-2izz1.html | date =2013-05-05 |accessdate = 2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, evidence was provided to the Department of Agriculture showing what is alleged to be Australian goats being roughly handled and sold outside of approved facilities in Malaysia. The footage also allegedly showed breaches of required animal welfare standards during slaughter of Australian cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = More animal cruelty claims in Malaysia | publisher = WA Today | url = http://www.watoday.com.au/opinion/political-news/more-animal-cruelty-claims-in-malaysia-20130508-2j7zx.html | date =2013-05-09 |accessdate = 2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department confirmed it had reviewed the footage and launched an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Investigators sent to Malaysia over goat abuse allegations | publisher = ABC Online | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-09/malaysia-goats/4678872l | date =2013-05-09 |accessdate = 2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animals Australia]] report to have conducted a total of 30 separate investigations into the live export industry between May 2003 and April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banliveexport.com/investigations/ Animals Australia - Live Export Investigations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Research into Australian live export ====

In 2009, the [[World Animal Protection]] live export campaign commissioned economic think tank ACIL Tasman to undertake economic research &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldanimalprotection.org.au/our-work/animals-in-farming/live-export Let's end the cruelty of live export], [[World Animal Protection]]. Accessed 18 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; into the live export trade. This research found that there are potential value adding opportunities being lost in Australia due to trade distortions in the live export trade. The report analysed the economics and policy settings of the live sheep export trade from Western Australia and demonstrated that a sheep processed domestically is worth 20% more to the Australian economy than one exported live.

In October 2012, [[World Animal Protection]] published a further piece of research into the live export trade. This research found that if a cattle processing facility was built in the Northern Territory or North-Western Australia, in conjunction with live export, there would potentially be an increase of 245% or more in gross earnings for Australian cattle producers, more than 1,300 jobs for unemployed Australians and gross regional product growth of $204 million per annum.

In August 2011, two bills were presented to [[Australian Parliament]] calling for an end to live exports on animal welfare grounds, by Independent Senator [[Nick Xenophon]] and the [[Australian Greens]] Party. Both bills were rejected by the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Major parties reject bills to ban live exports

===First competition in 1982===

The first Makridakis Competition, held in 1982, and known in the forecasting literature as the '''M-Competition''', used 1001 time series and 15 forecasting methods (with another nine variations of those methods included).&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;&lt;ref name=m&gt;{{cite journal|title = The accuracy of extrapolation (time series) methods: results of a forecasting competition|journal = Journal of Forecasting|volume = 1|issue = 2|date = April–June 1982|pages = 111–153|author = Spyros Makridakis|doi = 10.1002/for.3980010202|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a later paper by the authors, the following were the main conclusions of the M-Competition:&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

# Statistically sophisticated or complex methods do not necessarily provide more accurate forecasts than simpler ones.
# The relative ranking of the performance of the various methods varies according to the accuracy measure being used.
# The accuracy when various methods are combined outperforms, on average, the individual methods being combined and does very well in comparison to other methods.
# The accuracy of the various methods depends on the length of the forecasting horizon involved.

The findings of the study have been verified and replicated through the use of new methods by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Forecasting demand for special services|last = Geurts|first = M.

This is what [[Rob J. Hyndman]], in his blog about "A brief history of time series forecasting competitions", had to say about the first M Competition: “… anyone could submit forecasts, making this the first true forecasting competition as far as I am aware.”[https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecasting-competitions/]

Newbold (1983) was critical of the M-competition, and argued against the general idea of using a single competition to attempt to settle the complex issue.&lt;ref name=newbold&gt;{{cite journal|title = The competition to end all competitions|last = Newbold|first = Paul|year = 1983|publisher = [[Journal of Forecasting]]|volume = 2|pages = 276–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Before the first competition, the Makridakis–Hibon Study====

Before the first M-Competition, Makridakis and Hibon&lt;ref name=nm&gt;{{cite journal|title = Accuracy of Forecasting: An Empirical Investigation|publisher = [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]|volume = 142|date = 1979|pages = 97–145|jstor=2345077|author = Spyros Makridakis and Michele Hibon}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society (JRSS) an article showing that simple methods perform well in comparison to the more complex and statistically sophisticated ones. Statisticians at that time criticized the results claiming that they were not possible. Their criticism motivated the subsequent M, M2 and M3 Competitions that prove beyond the slightest doubt those of the Makridakis and Hibon Study.

===Second competition, published in 1993===

The second competition, called the M-2 Competition or M2-Competition, was conducted on a grander scale. A call to participate was published in the ''[[International Journal of Forecasting]]'', announcements were made in the [[International Symposium of Forecasting]], and a written invitation was sent to all known experts on the various time series methods. The M2-Competition was organized in collaboration with four companies and included six macroeconomic series, and was conducted on a real-time basis. Data was from the United States.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt; The results of the competition were published in a 1993 paper.&lt;ref name=m2&gt;{{cite journal|title = The M-2 Competition: a real-time judgmentally based forecasting study|journal = International Journal of Forecasting|author = Spyros Makridakis|date = April 1993|volume = 9|pages = 5–22|doi = 10.1016/0169-2070(93)90044-N|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were claimed to be statistically identical to those of the M-Competition.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

The M2-Competition used much fewer time series than the original M-competition. Whereas the original M-competition had used 1001 time series, the M2-Competition used only 29, including 23 from the four collaborating companies and 6 macroeconomic series.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; Data from the companies was obfuscated through the use of a constant multiplier in order to preserve proprietary privacy.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; The purpose of the M2-Competition was to simulate real-world forecasting better in the following respects:&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;

* Allow forecasters to combine their trend-based forecasting method with personal judgment.
* Allow forecasters to ask additional questions requesting data from the companies involved in order to make better forecasts.
* Allow forecasters to learn from one forecasting exercise and revise their forecasts for the next forecasting exercise based on the feedback.

The competition was organized as follows:&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;
* The first batch of data was sent to participating forecasters in summer 1987.
* Forecasters had the option of contacting the companies involved via an intermediary in order to gather additional information they considered relevant to making forecasts.
* In October 1987, forecasters were sent updated data.
* Forecasters were required to send in their forecasts by the end of November 1987.
* A year later, forecasters were sent an analysis of their forecasts and asked to submit their next forecast in November 1988.
* The final analysis and evaluation of the forecasts was done starting April 1991 when the actual, final values of the data including December 1990 were known to the collaborating companies.

In addition to the published results, many of the participants wrote short articles describing their experience participating in the competition and their reflections on what the competition demonstrated. Chris Chatfield praised the design of the competition, but said that despite the organizers' best efforts, he felt that forecasters still did not have enough access to the companies from the inside as he felt people would have in real-world forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = A personal view of the M2-competition|last = Chatfield|first = Chris|journal = [[International Journal of Forecasting]]|volume = 9|issue = 1|date = April 1993|pages = 23–24|doi = 10.1016/0169-2070(93)90045-O}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fildes and Makridakis (1995) argue that despite the evidence produced by these competitions, the implications continued to be ignored by theoretical statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The impact of empirical accuracy studies on time series analysis and forecasting|last = Fildes|first = R.|last2 = Makridakis|first2 = Spyros|authorlink2 = Spyros Makridakis|journal = [[International Statistical Review]]|year = 1995|volume = 63|issue = 3|pages = 289–308|url = http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/Inseadwp1993/93-29.pdf|doi=10.2307/1403481|jstor = 1403481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third competition, published in 2000===

The third competition, called the M-3 Competition or M3-Competition, was intended to both replicate ''and'' extend the features of the M-competition and M2-Competition, through the inclusion of more methods and researchers (particularly researchers in the area of [[neural network]]s) and more [[time series]].&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt; A total of 3003 time series was used. The paper documenting the results of the competition was published in the ''[[International Journal of Forecasting]]''&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt; in 2000 and the raw data was also made available on the [[International Institute of Forecasters]] website.&lt;ref name=m3-data/&gt; According to the authors, the conclusions from the M3-Competition were similar to those from the earlier competitions.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

The time series included yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, and other time series. In order to ensure that enough data was available to develop an accurate forecasting model, minimum thresholds were set for the number of observations: 14 for yearly series, 16 for quarterly series, 48 for monthly series, and 60 for other series.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

Time series were in the following domains: micro, industry, macro, finance, demographic, and other.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;&lt;ref name=m3-data/&gt; Below is the number of time series based on the time interval and the domain:&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;&lt;ref name=m3-data/&gt;

The five measures used to evaluate the accuracy of different forecasts were: [[symmetric mean absolute percentage error]] (also known as symmetric MAPE), average ranking, median symmetric absolute percentage error (also known as median symmetric APE), percentage better, and median RAE.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

A number of other papers have been published with different analyses of the data set from the M3-Competition.&lt;ref name=m3-1/&gt;&lt;ref name=m3-2/&gt; According to [[Rob J. Hyndman]], Editor-in-Chief of the [[International Journal of Forecasting]] (IJF), “The M3 data have continued to be used since 2000 for testing new time series forecasting methods. In fact, unless a proposed forecasting method is competitive against the original M3 participating methods, it is difficult to get published in the IJF.”

===Fourth competition, started in Jan 1 2018, ended in May 31 2018.===

The M-Competitions have attracted great interest in both the academic literature and among practitioners, providing objective evidence of the most appropriate way of forecasting various variables of interest. The fourth competition, M4, was announced in November 2017[https://www.unic.ac.cy/news/announcing-m4-makridakis-4-forecasting-competition/]. The competition started in Jan 1 2018 and ended in May 31 2018. Initial results were published in the [International Journal of Forecasting] on June 21, 2018. The paper can be downloaded at the [ScienceDirect website[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207018300785].

The M4 extended and replicated the results of the previous three competitions, using an extended and diverse set of time series to identify the most accurate forecasting method(s) for different types of predictions. It aimed to get answers on how to improve forecasting accuracy and identify the most appropriate methods for each case. To get precise and compelling answers, the M4 Competition utilized 100,000 real-life series, and incorporates all major forecasting methods, including those based on Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, ML), as well as traditional statistical ones.

In his blog, [[Rob J. Hyndman]] said about M4: “The “M” competitions organized by Spyros Makridakis have had an enormous influence on the field of forecasting. They focused attention on what models produced good forecasts, rather than on the mathematical properties of those models. For that, Spyros deserves congratulations for changing the landscape of forecasting research through this series of competitions."[https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/m4comp/]

In order to ensure that enough data are available to develop an accurate forecasting model, minimum thresholds were set for the number of observations: 13 for yearly, 16 for quarterly, 42 for monthly, 80 for weekly, 93 for daily and 700 for hourly series.

One of its major objectives was to compare the accuracy of ML methods versus that of statistical ones and empirically verify the claims of the superior performance of ML methods.

'''Below is a short description of the M4 Competition and its major findings and Conclusion:'''

The M4 Competition ended on May 31, 2018 and in addition to point forecasts, it included specifying Prediction Intervals (PI) too. M4 was an Open one, with its most important objective (the same with that of the previous three M Competitions): “to learn to improve forecasting accuracy and advance the field as much as possible”. This is in contrast to other ones, as those organized by Kaggle, where there is actually a “horse race” aimed at identifying the most accurate forecasting method(s) without attempting to discover the reasons involved in order to be able to improve forecasting performance in the future. 

'''The five major findings and the conclusion of M4:''' 

Below we outline what we consider to be the five major findings of the M4 Competition and advance a logical conclusion from these findings.

# The combination of methods was the king of the M4. Out of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were “combinations” of mostly statistical approaches. 
# The biggest surprise, however, was a “hybrid” approach utilizing both Statistical and ML features. This method, produced the most accurate forecasts as well as the most precise PIs and was submitted by Slawek Smyl, Data Scientist at Uber Technologies. According to sMAPE, it was close to 10% (a huge improvement) more accurate than the Combination (Comb) benchmark of the Competition (see below). It is noted that in the M3 Competition (Makridakis &amp; Hibon, 2000) the best method was 4% more accurate than the same Combination.
# The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one ML one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm, trained to minimize forecasting error through holdout tests. This method was jointly submitted by Spain’s University of A Coruña and Australia’s Monash University.
# The first and the second most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying correctly the 95% PIs. These are the first methods we know that have done so and do not underestimate uncertainty considerably.
# The six pure ML methods submitted in the M4 performed poorly, none of them being more accurate than Comb and only one being more accurate than Naïve2. These results are in agreement with those of a recent study we published in PLOS ONE (Makridakis, et al., 2018).

The conclusion from the above findings is that the accuracy of individual statistical or ML methods is low and that hybrid approaches and combination of methods is the way forward in order to improve forecasting accuracy and make forecasting more valuable.

The five Machine Learning (ML) methods submitted in the M4 performed poorly, none of them being more accurate than the statistical benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naïve 2, a finding consistent with a paper published in PLOS ONE at the end of March 2018

==Offshoots==

===NN3-Competition===

Although the organizers of the M3-Competition did contact researchers in the area of [[artificial neural network]]s to seek their participation in the competition, only one researcher participated, and that researcher's forecasts fared poorly. The reluctance of most ANN researchers to participate at the time was due to the computationally intensive nature of ANN-based forecasting and the huge time series used for the competition.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt; In 2005, Crone, Nikolopoulos and Hibon organized the NN-3 Competition, using 111 of the time series from the M3-Competition (not the same data, because it was shifted in time, but the same sources). The NN-3 Competition found that the best ANN-based forecasts performed comparably with the best known forecasting methods, but were far more computationally intensive. It was also noted that many ANN-based techniques fared considerably worse than simple forecasting methods, despite greater ''theoretical'' potential for good performance.&lt;ref name=n3&gt;{{cite web|url = http://forecasters.org/pdfs/IIF-SAS-Report-Apr2008.pdf|title = Automatic Modelling and Forecasting with Artificial Neural Networks– A forecasting competition evaluation|last = Crone|first = Sven F.|last2 = Nikolopoulos|first2 = Konstantinos|last3 = Hibon| first3 = Michele| date = 2005–06 &lt;!-- (published online April 2008) --&gt; | accessdate = April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===In books for mass audiences===

[[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], in his book ''[[The Black Swan (2007 book)|The Black Swan]]'', references the Makridakis Competitions as follows: "The most interesting test of how academic methods fare in the real world was provided by Spyros Makridakis, who spent part of his career managing competitions between forecasters who practice a "scientific method" called econometrics -- an approach that combines economic theory with statistical measurements. Simply put, he made people forecast ''in real life'' and then he judged their accuracy. This led to a series of "M-Competitions" he ran, with assistance from Michele Hibon, of which M3 was the third and most recent one, completed in 1999. Makridakis and Hibon reached the sad conclusion that "statistically sophisticated and complex methods do not necessarily provide more accurate forecasts than simpler ones.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Fooled by Randomness|isbn = 978-0-8129-7521-5|author = Nassim Nicholas Taleb|year = 2005}}, Page 154, available for online viewing at [https://books.google.com/books?id=gWW4SkJjM08C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=tetlock+makridakis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v_AQFYPHkt&amp;sig=5Pd5x5rxiZrFaBjhrhBSPz1RiE0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pzRlU5XYI4vJoATBlQE&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tetlock%20makridakis&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Everything is Obvious'', Duncan Watts cites the work of Makridakis and Hibon as showing that "simple models are about as good as complex models in forecasting economic time series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Everything is Obvious|author = Duncan Watts|isbn = 978-0307951793|year = 2011}}, Page 315&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary French Rockefeller''' (May 1, 1910 – April 17, 1997) was an heiress, socialite, philanthropist, and a member of the extensive [[Rockefeller family]]. She was married to [[Laurance Rockefeller]], son of [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.|John Davison Rockefeller Jr.]] and [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]]. She was the mother of [[Laura Rockefeller Chasin]], [[Marion Rockefeller Weber]], [[Lucy Rockefeller Waletzky]], and [[Laurance Spelman Rockefeller Jr.]]

==Early life==
Mary Billings French was born to John French (b. December 4, 1863) and [[Mary Billings French|Mary Montagu Billings French]] (1869–1951), daughter of financier [[Frederick Billings]]. Her mother was an heiress while her father was a lawyer, and the couple married in 1907. John was the son of Warren Converse French and Sarah Ann Steele.&lt;ref name =Winks1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winks|first1=Robin W.|title=Frederick Billings: A Life|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press | isbn =978-0-52021497-2|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =Cutter1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cutter|first1=William Richard|title = New England Families, Genealogical and Memorial: A Record of the Achievements of Her People in the Making of Commonwealths and the Founding of a Nation | volume = 2|date= 1913| publisher= Lewis historical publishing |page=643|accessdate= 6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's mother (the elder Mary) was a society figure and maintained an apartment with her sister on [[Madison Avenue]] in [[New York City]] before she married.&lt;ref name=SocialRA1&gt;{{cite book|title= Social Register, New York|date=1894|publisher=Social Register Association | page = 6|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary (the younger) had two siblings, being her older brother John (1909–1984) and her younger sister Elizabeth, who went by "Liz" (1912–1976).&lt;ref name=Cultural1&gt;{{cite web| title= Cultural Landscape Report For the Mansion Grounds | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url= http://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/mabi/mansion_grounds_clr1.pdf | website = National Park Service – U.S. Department of the Interior | accessdate= 7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John had been a roommate of [[Nelson Rockefeller]] while both attended [[Dartmouth College]]. The French children were born into "wealth and privilege", though Mary tried to live an unostentatious lifestyle as an adult.&lt;ref name=Administration1 /&gt;  Through her mother, the younger Mary was a tenth generation descendant of [[Simon Willard (first generation)|Major Simon Willard]], a Massachusetts historical figure.&lt;ref name=thesociety1&gt;{{cite book | title = Register of the National Society of Colonial Dames in the State of New York|date=1913|publisher=National Society of Colonial Dames in the State of New York|pages =256–8|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mary met Laurance S. Rockefeller in 1927. On August 15, 1934, Mary married Laurance at the [[First Congregational Church of Woodstock, Vermont]], located on Elm Street. The ceremony was officiated by Reverend Herbert Hines and was attended by approximately 300 guests, followed by a reception at "[[Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park|The Hills]]", Mary's estate at the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller compound.&lt;ref name=Administration1&gt;{{cite web|title=Laurance S.

*[[Marion Rockefeller Weber]] (born 1938)
*[[Lucy Rockefeller Waletzky]] (born 1941)
*[[Laurance Spelman Rockefeller Jr.|Laurance "Larry" Spelman Rockefeller Jr.]] (born 1944)

On April 17, 1997, she fell in her apartment in Manhattan and died later the same day at the [[New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center]]. Mary was 86 years old at the time of her death, and according to a Rockefeller family spokesman, she was in "failing health" for several years before her death.&lt;ref name=Nemy1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nemy|first1=Enid|title=Mary Rockefeller, Women's Advocate, Dies at 86|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/19/nyregion/mary-rockefeller-women-s-advocate-dies-at-86.html|accessdate=7 January 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=19 Apr 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
{{Main|Laurance Rockefeller#Conservation and death|l1=Philanthropy of Mary and Laurance Rockefeller}}

Mary worked closely with her husband on a number of philanthropic projects, mostly focused on conservationism and donation of their money, estates and time.

At the age of 41, Mary inherited what is now known as the [[Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park]] from her parents when her mother died in 1951, who had inherited it from her father Frederick. The estate included a mansion, dairy farm, and extensive grounds. In 1992, Mary and Laurance donated the property to the state and it was made into a National Historic Park. [[Lady Bird Johnson]] dedicated the house in a special ceremony.&lt;ref name=Duffy1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duffy|first1=John J.|title=The Vermont Encyclopedia|date=2003|publisher=UPNE|isbn=9781584650867|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary was an ardent supporter of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA), carrying on the tradition from her mother who was also involved with the organization. In 1951 she joined the YWCA National Board, then was vice-chairman and then chairman of the YWCA's international division from 1955 to 1973. From 1958 to 1964, she was chairman of the YWCA's World Service Council, followed by being elected to the YWCA Board of Trustees in 1988. Together with her husband, Mary flew over 50,000 miles for YWCA activities around the world.&lt;ref name=YWCA1&gt;{{cite news|title=Women's Rights Advocate Mary Rockefeller, 86|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-04-20/news/9704200361_1_ywca-laurance-s-rockefeller-mary-french-rockefeller|accessdate=7 January 2015|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=23 Apr 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6459">'''Milo Duçi''' (1870–1933) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] publisher, playwright, and entrepreneur. Born in [[Korçë]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), he lived for most of his life in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Elsie1"&gt;{{citation|pages=125–126|author=Robert Elsie|series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe| volume=75|title =Historical Dictionary of Albania|edition=2|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his uncle [[Loni Logori]] he succeeded as an entrepreneur and distinguished activist of the [[Albanians in Egypt|Albanian community in Egypt]].

Duçi, son of a powerful [[Cotton|cotton merchant]] from Korçë,&lt;ref name="Blumi2"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTKaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg= |page=84| author=Isa Blumi|title=Ottoman Refugees, 1878-1939: Migration in a Post-Imperial World|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic| year=2013 | location=London | isbn=9781472515360  |oclc=830369887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; settled in Egypt at the age of 23&lt;ref name="Asllani"&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.albeu.com/opinion/shqiptaret-e-egjiptit-dhe-veprimtaria-atdhetare-e-tyre/1538/| language=Albanian|title=Shqiptarët e egjiptit dhe veprimtaria atdhetare e tyre|trans-title=Albanians of Egypt and their patriotic activity|author=Uran Asllani|publisher=Gazeta Metropol| date=2006-06-05| quote=&lt;br&gt;Po në atë vit, Thoma Avrami dhe Milo Duçi, botuan gazetën e dytë shqiptare, me titull «Besa- besë».&lt;br&gt;Atdhetari tjetër Milo Duçi, rilindas i kolonisë së Egjiptit, shkrimtar, publicist, linguist, kishte lindur me 1870 dhe shumë i ri, 23 vjeçar u vendos në Egjipt...&lt;br&gt;Më vonë në vitet 1925-1926, ai botoi të përjavëshmen « Bisedimet ».}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a merchant himself.&lt;ref name="Skendi152153"/&gt; He was one of the founders of  "Vëllazëria" (Brotherhood) society, established in 1910 in [[Cairo]], and the [[Beni Suef]] branch of it with the support of the [[Khedive]] office.&lt;ref name="Blumi2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi152153"/&gt;

Duçi also started and directed several press organs of the Albanian diaspora in Egypt, mostly short-lived. These included the magazines ''Toska'' (The [[Tosks|Tosk]]) during 1901–02, ''Besa-Besë'' (Pledge for a pledge) during 1904–05 together with [[Thoma Avrami]], ''Besa'' ([[Besa (Albanian culture)|Besa]]) of 1905 which lasted for 6 issues and was printed by Al-Tawfik in Cairo,&lt;ref name="Blumi3"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2-sAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq= | pages=131–132| author=Isa Blumi|title=Foundations of Modernity: Human Agency and the Imperial State|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2012|series= Routledge studies in modern history|number=9|isbn=9780415884648 |oclc=607983304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and newspapers ''Shqipëria'' (Albania) from October 1906 to February 1907, a daily of Cairo with the last two issues coming out in [[Maghagha]],&lt;ref name="Blumi3"/&gt; and the weekly ''Bisedimet'' (The discussions) of 1925–26 with 60 issues in total, which would be the last Albanian-language newspaper in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi152153"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq= |isbn=9781400847761|pages=152–153.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several articles regarding the necessity for a unified literary [[Albanian language]] and the cultural-literary development of the Albanian society. In 1922 he established the [[publishing company]] ''Shtëpia botonjëse shqiptare/Société Albanaise d'édition'' (Albanian Publishing House).&lt;ref name="Blumi1"&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NatgAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT236&amp;lpg= | title=Reinstating the Ottomans: Alternative Balkan Modernities, 1800-1912| author=Isa Blumi|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York| year=2011|isbn=9780230110182 |oclc=669751242}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also left his footprint as a playwright; some of his [[comedy|comedies]] were ''E Thëna'' (The saying), ''Gjaku'' (The blood), ''I biri i Begut'' ([[Bey]]'s son). He also wrote short stories and poetry in the local press in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| language= Albanian| url=http://www.gazetadita.al/kush-ishte-milo-duci/|title=Kush ishte Milo Duçi?|trans-title=Who was Milo Duçi?| publisher=Gazeta Dita| date=2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Albanian patriotic activity, Duçi was a successful entrepreneur. His family emerged as an important player in the economic development of Egypt's Delta region directed by [[Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]'s office. By 1901, he started working with his well-connected uncle Loni Logori on projects that explicitly tied the commercial interest of the [[UK|British]] administration and the local landowners.&lt;ref name="Blumi2"/&gt; Beside British, he openly solicited [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] support, despite of the distrust that many [[Eastern Orthodox]] south-Albanians had for the Austrian Geo-politics. ''Toska'''s initial failure did not dissuade the Austrian authorities to support him; in 1902 they sent him 120 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|krone]] for the subscription, ordering the newspaper to be shipped to [[Vienna]] from where it would get distributed to [[Ottoman Albania]].&lt;ref name="Blumi3"/&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;Through his uncle, Duçi would also get in touch with the Albanian [[émigré]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Italy]], [[Istanbul]], and [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Blumi2"/&gt; The French consul in [[Shkodër]] reported that Duçi collaborated with a defrocked [[Roman Catholicism in Albania|Catholic]] priest named Gaspar Jakova Merturi who secured funds from a claimant for the Albanian throne, Prince [[Albert Ghica]] of [[Romania]]. He also collaborated closely with the [[Arberesh]] journalist [[Anselmo Lorecchio]], editor of ''[[La Nazione Albanese]]''.&lt;ref name="Blumi3"/&gt;

'''Mohamed Al-Fayed''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|f|aɪ|ˈ|ɛ|d}}; {{lang-arz|محمد أنور شاكر عبد السيد الفايد}} {{IPA-arz|mahamad el fajed|}}; born Mohamed Fayed on 27 January 1929) is an [[Egypt]]ian business magnate. Fayed's business interests include ownership of [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]] and formerly [[Harrods Department Store]], [[Knightsbridge]]. Al-Fayed sold his ownership of [[Fulham F.C.]] to [[Shahid Khan]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Fulham Sold"/&gt; 

Fayed had a son, [[Dodi Fayed|Dodi]], from his first marriage to [[Samira Khashoggi|Samira Khashoggi]] from 1954 to 1956. Dodi [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|died in a car crash in Paris with Diana, Princess of Wales]] on 31 August 1997. Fayed later remarried to Finnish [[socialite]] and former model Heini Wathén in 1985, with whom he has four children: Jasmine, Karim, Camilla, and [[Omar Fayed|Omar]]. In 2013, Fayed's wealth was estimated at [[US$]]1.4 billion, making him the 1,031st-richest person in the world in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=The World's Millionaires|url=https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/||publisher=Forbes| accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born '''Mohamed Fayed''' on 27 January 1929, in [[Bakos]], [[Alexandria]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Who's Who]] 2008: London, [[A &amp; C Black]], 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-7136-8555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of an Egyptian primary school teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mohamed Al Fayed — the outsider with a taste for confrontation|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/moversshakers/article2506457.ece|accessdate=9 November 2015|newspaper=The Times|date=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed has five siblings: Ali, Ashraf, Salah, Soaad, and Safia.{{fact|date=April 2018}}&lt;!-- A brother called Ashraf cannot be confirmed online; his 2 sisters are indicated in marginally applicable sources or non-RS. --&gt; Ali and Salah have been his business colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wild|first=Abigail|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12518304.Beset_by_secrets_and_lies_Profile__Mohamed_al_Fayed_A_high_profile_bid_to_become_a_British_citizen_and_the_death_of_his_son__Dodi__have_thrust_the_Egyptian_tycoon_into_the_spotlight__but_who_is_the_real_Mohamed_al_Fayed__By_Abigail_Wild/|title=Beset by secrets and lies Profile: Mohamed al Fayed|work=Sunday Herald|location=Glasgow|date=&lt;!-- Sunday --&gt;10 January 2004|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was married for two years, from 1954 to 1956, to [[Samira Khashoggi]]. Fayed worked for his wife's brother, Saudi Arabian arms dealer and businessman [[Adnan Khashoggi]].&lt;ref name="Independent20071006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vallely|first=Paul|title=Mohamed al-Fayed: The outsider|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/mohamed-alfayed-the-outsider-396133.html|accessdate=26 February 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time in the early 1970s, he began using "Al-Fayed" rather than "Fayed". His brothers Ali and Salah began to follow suit at the time of their acquisition of the [[House of Fraser]] in the 1980s, though by the late 1980s, both had reverted to calling themselves simply "Fayed".&lt;ref name="Brooke Aldous, 1988, 619" &gt;{{harvnb|Brooke Aldous|1988a|p=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have assumed that Fayed's addition of "Al-" to his name was to imply aristocratic origins, like "de" in French or "von" in German, though ''Al-'' does not have the same social connotations in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mohamed al-Fayed: The outsider|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/mohamed-al-fayed-the-outsider-396133.html|accessdate=6 March 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|date=5 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption led to ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' nicknaming him the "Phoney Pharaoh".&lt;ref name='TelegJun13'&gt;{{cite web|title=£1.5bn change in store at Harrods|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7697397/1.5bn-change-in-store-at-Harrods.html|author=Richard Tyler and Robert Mendick|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early business dealings===
Fayed and his brothers founded a shipping company in Egypt before moving its headquarters to Genoa, Italy with additional offices in [[London]]. Around 1964 Fayed entered a close relationship with Haitian leader [[François Duvalier]], known as 'Papa Doc' Duvalier, and became interested in the construction of a Fayed-Duvalier oil refinery in [[Haiti]]. He also associated with the geologist [[George de Mohrenschildt]]. Fayed terminated his stay in Haiti six months later when a sample of "crude oil" provided by Haitian associates proved to be low-grade molasses.&lt;ref name=tunzelmann&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Tunzelmann|title=[[Red Heat. Conspiracy, Murder, and the Cold War in the Caribbean]]|publisher=Henry Holt and Co., 2011|page=330f|isbn=978-0-8050-9067-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was then that Fayed moved to [[England]] where he lived in [[central London]].&lt;ref name="Times20100510"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mohamed-al-fayed-the-outsider-with-a-taste-for-confrontation-n9tsq2qp8z0 |title=Mohamed Al Fayed — the outsider with a taste for confrontation |last=Lindsay |first=Robert |date=10 May 2010 |work=The Times |access-date=25 January 2018 |language=en |issn=0140-0460}} {{Registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1960s, Fayed met the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] who entrusted Fayed with helping transform [[Dubai]], where he set up IMS (International Marine Services) in 1968.&lt;ref name="Salihovic2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salihovic|first=Elnur|title=Major Players in the Muslim Business World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSa1DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=5 October 2015|publisher=[[Universal Publishers (United States)|Universal Publishers]]|isbn=9781627340526|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed introduced British companies like the [[Costain Group]] (of which he became a director and 30 percent [[shareholder]]&lt;ref name="Independent20071006"/&gt;), [[Bernard Sunley &amp; Sons]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]] to the Emirate to carry out the required construction work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/08/business/harrod-s-new-owner-mohamed-al-fayed-a-quiet-acquisitor-is-caught-in-a-cross-fire.html |title=Harrod's New Owner: Mohamed Al-Fayed; a Quiet Acquisitor Is Caught in a Cross Fire |last=Feder |first=Barnaby J. |date=8 September 1985 |work=The New York Times |access-date=25 January 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times20100510"/&gt; He also became a financial adviser to the then [[Sultan of Brunei]] [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]], in 1966.&lt;ref name="Independent20071006"/&gt;

He briefly joined the board of the mining conglomerate [[Lonrho]] in 1975 but left after a disagreement. In 1979, Fayed bought [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|The Ritz]] hotel in [[Paris]], [[France]] for US$30 million.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ritz Paris" ''Mark Boxer'', ''Thames and Hudson'' 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Fayed and his brothers purchased a 30 percent stake in [[House of Fraser]], a group that included the famous London store [[Harrods]], from [[Tiny Rowland|Roland 'Tiny' Rowland]], the head of Lonrho. In 1985, he and his brothers bought the remaining 70 percent of House of Fraser for £615m. Rowland claimed the Fayed brothers had lied about their background and wealth and put pressure on the government to investigate them. A [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) inquiry into the Fayeds was launched. The DTI's subsequent report was critical, but no action was taken against the Fayeds, and while many believed the contents of the report, others felt it was politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;"The Guardian" ''Finance: DTI inquiries under attack'', by ''Lisa Buckingham'', 5 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Rowland accused Fayed of stealing papers and jewels from his Harrods [[safe deposit box]]. Fayed was arrested, but the charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/136111.stm|title= Harrods Box Charges Dropped|publisher=BBC| date=20 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowland died in 1998. Fayed settled the dispute with a payment to his widow; he also sued the [[Metropolitan Police]] for false arrest in 2002, but lost the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/14/jamiewilson?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Fayed loses High Court Action Against Met|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 August 2002|first=Jamie|last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, House of Fraser went public, but Fayed retained private ownership of Harrods. He relaunched the humour publication ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' in 1996 but it folded again in 2002. Al Fayed unsuccessfully applied for [[British citizenship]] twice – once in 1994 and once in 1999.&lt;ref name="Al Fayed Story"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/55867.stm|title=Al Fayed: A Unique Story of Rags to Riches|publisher=BBC|date=12 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/law-report-minister-acted-unfairly-towards-the-fayeds-1353132.html|newspaper=The Independent|title=Law Report|date=19 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that the feud with Rowland contributed to Fayed's being refused British citizenship the first time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7248639.stm BBC News] Retrieved 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cash-for-questions===
In 1994, in what became known as the [[cash-for-questions affair]], Fayed revealed the names of MPs he had paid to ask questions in parliament on his behalf, but who had failed to declare their fees. It saw the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] and [[Tim Smith (UK politician)|Tim Smith]] leave the government in disgrace, and a Committee on Standards in Public Life established to prevent such corruption occurring again. Fayed also revealed that the cabinet minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] had stayed for free at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz Hotel in Paris]] at the same time as a group of Saudi arms dealers leading to Aitken's subsequent unsuccessful libel case and imprisonment for perjury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/196466.stm|title=UK Politics: Talking Politics, Neil Hamilton – A chronology|publisher=BBC|date=19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, from 1988 to February 1998,  Al-Fayed's spokesman was [[Michael Cole (public relations)|Michael Cole]], a former BBC journalist,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Boggan [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/conspiracies-abound-as-cole-quits-toughest-job-in-pr-1145917.html "Conspiracies abound as Cole quits `toughest job in PR '"], ''The Independent'', 21 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt; although Cole's PR work for Al-Fayed did not cease in 1998.

Hamilton lost a subsequent libel action against Al-Fayed in December 1999&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;Matt Wells, et al [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/22/hamiltonvalfayed.conservatives "A greedy, corrupt liar"], ''The Guardian'', 22 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and a subsequent appeal against the verdict in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/21/hamiltonvalfayed "Neil Hamilton loses libel appeal"], theguardian.com. 21 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The former MP has always denied that he was paid by Al-Fayed for asking questions in parliament. Hamilton's libel action related to a [[Channel 4]] ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' documentary broadcast on 16 January 1997&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmstnprv/030ii/sp0157.htm "Appendix 33 – continued: Appendix 1 Channel 4 and Fourth Estate Press Releases"], Select Committee on Standards and Privileges First Report, House of Commons, January 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in which Al-Fayed made claims that the MP had received up to £110,000 in cash and received other gratuities for asking parliamentary questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/573630.stm "Hamilton loses libel case"], BBC News, 21 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's basis for his appeal was that the original verdict was invalid because Al-Fayed had paid £10,000 for documents stolen from the dustbins of Hamilton's legal representatives by [[Benjamin Pell]],&lt;ref&gt;Steven Moss [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/12/hamiltonvalfayed.stevenmorris "Fayed 'paid for stolen papers'"], ''The Guardian'', 12 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; also known as 'Benjy the Binman'.

In 2003, Fayed moved from [[Surrey]], UK to [[Switzerland]], alleging a breach in an agreement with [[Inland Revenue]]. In 2005, he moved back to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], saying that he "regards Britain as home".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; He moored a yacht in [[Monaco]] called the ''[[Sokar (yacht)|Sokar]]'' prior to selling it in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holiday.monacoeye.com/monaco_yacht_show.php|title=Monaco Yacht Show |publisher=Holiday|accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of Harrods===
After previously denying that Harrods was for sale, Harrods was sold to [[Qatar Investment Authority|Qatar Holdings]], the [[sovereign wealth fund]] of the emirate of [[Qatar]], on 10 May 2010. A fortnight previously, Fayed had stated that "People approach us from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. Fair enough. But I put two fingers up to them. It is not for sale. This is not Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. It is a special place that gives people pleasure. There is only one Mecca."&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/qatar-the-tiny-gulf-state-that-bought-the-world-1970551.html |title=Qatar, the tiny gulf state that bought the world|newspaper=The Independent|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrods was sold for £1.5 billion. Fayed later revealed in an interview that he decided to sell Harrods following the difficulty in getting his [[dividend]] approved by the trustee of the Harrods pension fund. Fayed said "I'm here every day, I can't take my profit because I have to take a permission of those bloody idiots. I say is this right? Is this logic? Somebody like me? I run a business and I need to take bloody fucking trustee's permission to take my profit".&lt;ref name="The Evening Standard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23838358-a-four-letter-farewell-from-mohammed-fayed.do|title=Mohammed Fayed: Why I Sold Harrods|publisher=London Evening Standard|date=26 May 2010|accessdate=22 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701144627/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23838358-a-four-letter-farewell-from-mohammed-fayed.do|archivedate=1 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods, a position he was scheduled to hold for at least six months.&lt;ref name="The Evening Standard"/&gt;

===Scotland===
In 1972, Fayed purchased the Balnagown estate in [[Easter Ross]], Northern [[Scotland]]. From an initial twelve acres, Al-Fayed has since built the estate up to sixty-five thousand acres.&lt;ref name="highland-jetset"&gt;{{Cite news|date=4 July 2005|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/alfayed-to-fill-highland-estate-with-jetset-homes-497551.html|title=Al-Fayed to fill Highland estate with jet-set homes|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|first=Paul|last=Kelbie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Fayed has invested more than £20 million in the estate, restored the 14th century pink [[Balnagown Castle]], and created a tourist accommodation business.&lt;ref name="highland-jetset"/&gt; The Highlands of Scotland tourist board awarded Al-Fayed the "Freedom of the Highlands" in 2002, in recognition of his "outstanding contribution and commitment to the highlands."

As an Egyptian with links to Scotland, Al-Fayed was intrigued enough to fund a 2008 reprint of the 15th-century chronicle ''[[Scotichronicon]]'' by [[Walter Bower]]. The ''Scotichronicon'' describes how Scota, a sister of the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Tutankhamen]], fled her family and landed in Scotland, bringing with her the [[Stone of Scone]]. According to the chronicle, Scotland was later named in her honour. The tale is disputed by modern historians.&lt;ref name="fayed-princess"&gt;{{Cite news|date=19 May 2008|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article3965279.ece|title=Al Fayed, a Princess and another theory the establishment denies|newspaper=The Times|location=London|first=Mike|last=Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Fayed later declared that "The Scots are originally Egyptians and that's the truth."&lt;ref name="make-ruler"&gt;{{Cite news|date=25 October 2009|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6889088.ece|title=Forget Salmond: Make me your ruler|newspaper=The Times|location=London|first=Marc|last=Horne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Al-Fayed revealed that he was a supporter of [[Scottish independence]] from the United Kingdom, announcing to the Scots that "It's time for you to waken up and detach yourselves from the English and their terrible politicians...whatever help is needed for Scotland to regain its independence, I will provide it...when you Scots regain your freedom, I am ready to be your president."&lt;ref name="make-ruler"/&gt;

===Charity===
Fayed set up the Al Fayed Charitable Foundation in 1987 aiming to help children with life-limiting conditions and children living in poverty. The charity works mainly with charities and hospices for disabled and neglected children in the UK, Thailand and Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-acf.com/who-we-are.aspx|title=Who we are - The AlFayed Charitable Foundation - ACF|website=www.the-acf.com|access-date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the charities with which it works include Francis House Hospice in Manchester, Great Ormond Street Hospital and ChildLine. In 1998, Al Fayed bought [[Princess Diana]]'s old boarding school in Kent and helped found the New School at West Heath for traumatised children there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/620770/charitable-side-Mohamed-Al-Fayed/?HAYILC=RELATED |title=The charitable side of ...

In 2011, Mohamed Al-Fayed's daughter Camilla, who has worked as an ambassador for the charity for eight years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/heiress-camilla-al-fayed-liverpool-3010791 |title=Heiress Camilla Al Fayed on why Liverpool babies’ hospice Zoe’s Place is an inspiration|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened the newly refurbished Zoe’s Place baby hospice in West Derby, Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2011/09/09/camilla-al-fayed-opens-newly-refurbished-zoe-s-place-baby-hospice-in-west-derby-99623-29389925/ |title=Camilla Al Fayed opens newly refurbished Zoe’s Place baby hospice in West Derby |publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fulham F.C.===
{{Main|Fulham F.C.#1997–2001: Al Fayed takeover}}

Al-Fayed bought the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] of West London professional football club [[Fulham F.C.]] for £6.25 million in 1997.&lt;ref name="fulham-pushed"&gt;{{Cite news|date=7 February 2003|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2395783/Fulham-pushed-out-Hill.html|title=Fulham pushed out Hill|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Mihir|last=Bose}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was purchased via Bill Muddyman's Muddyman Group.&lt;ref name="fulham-pushed"/&gt; His long-term aim was that Fulham would become a [[FA Premier League]] side within five years. In 2001, Fulham took the First Division (now [[Football League Championship]]) under manager [[Jean Tigana]], winning 100 points and scoring over 100 goals in the season. This meant that Al-Fayed had achieved his objective of Fulham becoming a Premier League club a year ahead of schedule. By 2002, Fulham were competing in European football, winning the [[Intertoto Cup]] and challenging in the [[UEFA Cup]]. Fulham reached the final of the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League]] and continued to play in the Premier League throughout Al-Fayed's tenure as owner (which ended in 2013).

Fulham temporarily left [[Craven Cottage]] while it was being upgraded to meet modern safety standards. There were fears that Fulham would not return to the Cottage after it was revealed that Al-Fayed had sold the first right to build on the ground to a property development firm.&lt;ref name="future-hangs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham's future hangs in balance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/3084328.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=15 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulham lost a legal case against former manager Tigana in 2004 after Al-Fayed had wrongly alleged that Tigana had overpaid more than £7m for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret.&lt;ref name="fulham-lose"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham lose Tigana court battle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/4005735.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=12 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Al-Fayed said that he was in favour of a wage cap for footballers, and criticised the management of [[The Football Association]] and [[Premier League]] as "run by donkeys who don't understand business, who are dazzled by money."&lt;ref name="sport-quotes"&gt;{{Cite news|date=29 April 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/8024421.stm|title=Sport quotes of the week|work=BBC Sport|first=Chris|last=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of the American entertainer [[Michael Jackson]] was unveiled by Al-Fayed in April 2011 at Craven Cottage In 1999 Jackson had attended a league game against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at the stadium. Following criticisms of the statue, Al-Fayed said "If some stupid fans don't understand and appreciate such a gift this guy gave to the world they can go to hell. I don't want them to be fans."&lt;ref name="jackson-fulham"&gt;{{Cite news|date=3 April 2011

Al-Fayed then donated the statue to the National Football Museum.&lt;ref name="jJackson statue moves to National Football Museum"&gt;{{Cite news|date=6 May 2014

Under Al-Fayed Fulham F.C. was owned by Mafco Holdings, based in the [[tax haven]] of [[Bermuda]]. Mafco Holdings is owned by Al-Fayed and his family. By 2011, Al-Fayed had loaned Fulham F.C. £187 million in interest free loans.&lt;ref name="record-losses"&gt;{{Cite news|date=19 May 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/19/premier-league-finances-black-hole?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Record income but record losses for Premier League|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|first=David|last=Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, it was announced that Al-Fayed had sold the club to Pakistani American businessman [[Shahid Khan]], who owns the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].&lt;ref name="Fulham Sold"&gt;{{cite news|title=Al-Fayed sells Fulham to Shahid Khan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23297785|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana and Charles divorced in 1996. Diana was hosted by Al-Fayed in the south of France in the summer of 1997, with her two sons, the Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry|Harry]].&lt;ref name = HighBeam2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13112834.html|title=Coroner at Diana inquest dismisses all the conspiracy theories over fatal car crash Mohamed al-Fayed expresses surprise over the tone and content of remarks he says should be left to the jury to consider |author=Stephen McGinty |publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]'' |date=3 October 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2013}} ([[HighBeam Research]] subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; For the holiday, Fayed bought a 195&amp;nbsp;ft yacht, the ''Jonikal'' (later renamed the ''[[Sokar (yacht)|Sokar]]'').&lt;ref name="vanfair"&gt;{{cite web|date=19 May 2010 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/05/dunne200805|title=Two Ladies, Two Yachts, and a Billionaire|newspaper=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)]]''|location=New York|author=[[Dominick Dunne]]|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dodi and Diana later began a private cruise on the ''Jonikal'' and [[paparazzi]] photographs of the couple in an embrace were published. Diana's friend, the journalist Richard Kay, confirmed that Diana was involved in "her first serious romance" since her divorce.&lt;ref name = HighBeam3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4409051.html|title=Di and Dodi's short summer |publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |date=7 September 1997 |accessdate=11 October 2013}} ([[HighBeam Research]] subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodi and Diana went on a second private cruise on the ''Jonikal'' in the third week of August, and returned from Sardinia to Paris on 30 August. The couple privately dined at the Ritz later that day, after the behaviour of the press caused them to cancel a restaurant reservation, they then planned to spend the night at Dodi's apartment near the [[Arc de Triomphe]].&lt;ref name="bbc-final"&gt;{{Cite news|date=14 December 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6219252.stm|title=Diana and Dodi: Their final hours|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to deceive the paparazzi, a decoy car left the front of the hotel, while Diana and Dodi departed at speed in a [[Mercedes-Benz W140]] driven by chauffeur [[Henri Paul]] from the rear of the hotel.&lt;ref name="bbc-final"/&gt; Five minutes later, the car crashed in the [[Pont de l'Alma]] tunnel, killing Paul and Dodi. Diana died later in hospital. Fayed arrived in Paris the next day and viewed Dodi's body, which was returned to Britain for an [[Islamic funeral]].&lt;ref name="bbc-final"/&gt;&lt;ref name = HighBeam5&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64636402.html|title=Fayed Is Buried After Quiet Islamic Tribute |publisher=''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' |date=1 September 1997 |accessdate=11 October 2013}} ([[HighBeam Research]] subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conspiracy theories===
From February 1998, Al-Fayed maintained that the crash was a result of a conspiracy,&lt;ref name="diana-crash"&gt;{{Cite news|date=12 February 1998|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/55800.stm|title=Diana crash was a conspiracy – Al Fayed|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] on the instructions of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="point-claims"&gt;{{Cite news|date=19 February 1998|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/55800.stm|title=Point-by-point: Al Fayed's claims|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; His claims that the crash was a result of a conspiracy were dismissed by a French judicial investigation, but Fayed appealed against this verdict. A libel action was brought against Al-Fayed by Neil Hamilton (see above). During the questioning of one day of the hearing, which referred to Al-Fayed's conspiracy theories, writer Martyn Gregory and a journalist from [[ITN]] counted 70 instances of Al-Fayed saying "I don't know" or "I can't remember" to questions relating to the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Gregory "How Fayed is Paying For His Diana Lies", ''The Spectator'', 8 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Operation Paget]], a [[Metropolitan police]] inquiry that concluded in 2006, also found no evidence of a conspiracy.&lt;ref name="diana-tragic"&gt;{{Cite news|date=14 December 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6179275.stm|title=Diana death a 'tragic accident'|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Operation Paget, Al-Fayed made 175 "conspiracy claims".&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Gregory [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/martyn-gregory-alfayed-cant-rewrite-the-death-of-diana-394391.html "Al-Fayed can't rewrite the death of Diana"], ''The Independent'', 7 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquest headed by [[Scott Baker (judge)|Lord Justice Scott Baker]] into the deaths of Diana and Dodi began at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], London, on 2 October 2007 and lasted for six months. It was a continuation of the original inquest that had begun in 2004.&lt;ref name="inquests"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/faq/index.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080521144222/http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/faq/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 May 2008 |title=Inquests into the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr Dodi Al Fayed: FAQs |accessdate=4 June 2010 |year=2008 |work=Coroner's Inquests into the Deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr Dodi Al Fayed |publisher=Judicial Communications Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Scott Baker inquest Fayed accused the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale]], her sister, and numerous others, of plotting to kill the Princess of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bates [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/19/diana.monarchy "They're all guilty? 'Definitely.' Fayed gets his day in court"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Their motive, he claimed, was that they could not tolerate the idea of the Princess marrying a Muslim.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;Angela Balakrishnan [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/07/diana.monarchy1 "Pregnancy rumours, MI6 plots and Henri Paul"], theguardian.com, 7 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Fayed first claimed that the Princess was pregnant to the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in May 2001,&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; and that he was the only person who had been told of this news. Witnesses at the inquest who said the Princess was not pregnant, and could not have been, were part of the conspiracy according to Al-Fayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7250002.stm "Diana murdered, Al Fayed claims"], BBC News, 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed's testimony at the inquest was roundly condemned in the press as being farcical. Members of the British Government's [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] accused Fayed of turning the inquest into a 'circus' and called for it to be ended maturely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7256665.stm|work=BBC News|title=Coroner warning in Diana inquest|date=21 February 2008| accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers representing Al-Fayed later accepted at the inquest that there was no direct evidence that either the Duke of Edinburgh or MI6 had been involved in any murder conspiracy involving Diana or Dodi.&lt;ref name="fayed-collapses"&gt;{{Cite news|date=7 April 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7326311.stm|title=Fayed conspiracy claim collapses|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before Al-Fayed's appearance, John Macnamara, a former senior detective at Scotland Yard and Al-Fayed's investigator for five years from 1997, was forced to admit on 14 February 2008 that he had no evidence to suggest foul play, except for the assertions Al-Fayed had made to him.&lt;ref name="Bates1502"&gt;Stephen Bates [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/15/monarchy "Diana conspiracy theory unravels as Fayed's investigator tells of lies and lack of evidence"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His admissions also related to the lack of evidence for Al-Fayed's claims about the alleged pregnancy of the Princess and the couple's supposed engagement.&lt;ref name="Bates1502"/&gt;

The jury verdict, given on 7 April 2008, was that Diana and Dodi had been "[[unlawful killing|unlawfully killed]]" through the [[Gross negligence|grossly negligent]] driving of chauffeur [[Henri Paul]],&lt;ref name=verdict&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/hearing_transcripts/verdict.htm | archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080521144222/http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/hearing_transcripts/verdict.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=21 May 2008 |title=Hearing transcripts: 7&amp;nbsp;April 2008 – Verdict of the jury|publisher=Judicial Communications Office|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]], and the pursuing vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Diana jury blames paparazzi and Henri Paul for her 'unlawful killing' | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1584160/Diana-jury-blames-paparazzi-and-Henri-Paul-for-her-unlawful-killing.html | accessdate=12 October 2013 | work=Daily Telegraph | date=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyers for Al-Fayed also accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion that Diana was illegally embalmed in order to cover up a pregnancy, a "pregnancy" that they accepted, could not be established by any medical evidence.&lt;ref name="fayed-collapses"/&gt; They also accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion the French emergency and medical services had played any role in a conspiracy to harm Diana.&lt;ref name="fayed-collapses"/&gt; Following the Baker inquest, Al-Fayed said that he was abandoning his campaign to prove that Diana and Dodi were murdered in a conspiracy, and said that he would accept the verdict of the jury.&lt;ref name="fayed-abandons"&gt;{{Cite news|date=8 April 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7337789.stm|title=Al Fayed abandons Diana campaign|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Fayed financially supported ''[[Unlawful Killing (film)|Unlawful Killing]]'' (2011), a documentary film accused of presenting his version of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/cannes-film-festival/8513112/Unlawful-Killing-film-about-the-death-of-Diana-likens-Prince-Philip-to-Fred-West.html |title=Unlawful Killing: film about the death of Diana likens Prince Philip to Fred West|accessdate=11 May 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London |first=Anita|last=Singh|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film was not formally released as a result of legal problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Child [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/05/princess-diana-documentary-unlawful-killing "Princess Diana documentary Unlawful Killing is shelved"], ''The Guardian'' (London), 5 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* After the death of [[Wallis Simpson]], Fayed took over the lease of the [[Villa Windsor]] in Paris, the former home of the Duchess of Windsor and her husband, the Duke of Windsor, previously [[Edward VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1 January 1990|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116503,00.html|title=Egypt's Al Fayed Restores the House Fit for a Former King |newspaper=[[People (American magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual harassment allegations==
Al-Fayed has been accused by multiple women of [[sexual harassment]] and assault.&lt;ref name="crossing-swords"&gt;{{Cite news |date=24 October 1998|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1998/oct/24/hamiltonvalfayed|title=Crossing swords with Mohamed|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Henry|last=Porter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boggan"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Boggan|first=Steve|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/al-fayed-accused-harrods-boss-rejects-charges-of-lechery-and-bugging-1289749.html|title=Al Fayed Accused: Harrods boss rejects charges of lechery and bugging|work=The Independent|location=London |date=20 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young women applying for employment at Harrods were often submitted to [[HIV test]]s and gynaecological examinations.&lt;ref name="Bower271–72"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bower|first=Tom |title=Fayed: The Unauthorized Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygLDIAAACAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-74554-0|page=271–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women were then selected to spend the weekend with Al-Fayed in Paris.&lt;ref name="Bower271–72"/&gt; In her profile of Al-Fayed for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', [[Maureen Orth]] described how according to former employees "Fayed regularly walked the store on the lookout for young, attractive women to work in his office. Those who rebuffed him would often be subjected to crude, humiliating comments about their appearance or dress...A dozen ex-employees I spoke with said that
Fayed would chase secretaries around the office and sometimes try to stuff money down women's blouses".&lt;ref name="maureen-orth"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://maureenorth.com/2010/09/holy-war-at-harrods-mohamed-al-fayed/|title=Holy War at Harrods|work=Vanity Fair|date=1 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Hermina Da Silva quit her job as a nanny at Al-Fayed's home in [[Oxted]]. Da Silva had prepared accusations that she was sexually harassed by Al-Fayed,&lt;ref name="crossing-swords"/&gt; and she was subsequently arrested by detectives and held overnight in cells following a complaint of theft by an employee of Al-Fayeds. She was later released without charge after officers concluded she had not stolen anything. Al-Fayed eventually settled with her out of court, and she was awarded £12,000.&lt;ref name="crossing-swords"/&gt;

Al-Fayed was interviewed under caution by the [[Metropolitan Police]] after an allegation of sexual assault against a 15-year-old schoolgirl in October 2008. The case was dropped by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], after they found that there was no realistic chance of conviction due to conflicting statements.&lt;ref name="no-charges"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7894870.stm|title=No Sex Charges for Harrods Owner|work=BBC News|date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1997, the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] current affairs programme, ''The Big Story'' broadcast testimonies from a number of former Harrods employees who spoke of how women were routinely sexually harassed by Al-Fayed.&lt;ref name="Boggan"/&gt;

A December 2017 episode of Channel 4's ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' programme alleged that Al-Fayed had sexually harassed three Harrods employees, and attempted to "groom" them. One of the women was aged 17 at the time. Cheska Hill-Wood, now in her 40s, waived her right to anonymity to be interviewed for the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendick|first=Robert|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/08/mohamed-al-fayed-accused-harassing-17-year-old-harrods-employee/|title=Mohamed Al-Fayed accused of harassing 17-year-old Harrods' employee|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme alleged al-Fayed targeted young employees over a 13 year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=David|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mohamed-al-fayed-accused-of-sexually-harassing-young-staff-688twtk2v|title=Mohamed Al Fayed accused of sexually harassing young staff|work=The Times|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vineyards and wineries==

Cinzano took over her father's [[vermouth]] business after his death in 1990, and in 1992 she bought the [[Tenuta di Argiano]], a 16th-century 120 acre (50ha) vineyard, in a {{Convert|100|ha}} estate; produced 337,000 bottles of wine which included 109,000 [[Brunello di Montalcino]] wine. Exporting to the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], Brazil, [[Denmark]] and [[Japan]], Tenuta di Argiano is one of the top ten largest producers, by volume, of Brunnello Montalcino and [[Rosso di Montalcino]] wine.&lt;ref name="Decanter 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wine Spectator"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/48032 |newspaper=Wine Spectator |title=Montalcino's Argiano Has New Owners |date=February 11, 2013 |last=Sanderson |first=Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wine&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.winenews.it/news/30077/argiano-una-delle-pi-antiche-tenute-di-montalcino-con-oltre-100-ettari-di-terreno-53-a-vigneto-e-la-splendida-villa-rinascimentale-venduta-da-noemi-marone-cinzano-stando-ai-rumors-affare-da-40-50-milioni-di-euro-e-compratori-brasiliani|title=Argiano, Una Delle Più Antiche Tenute Di Montalcino, Con Oltre 100 Ettari Di Terreno (53 A Vigneto), E La Splendida Villa Rinascimentale, Venduta Da Noemi Marone Cinzano.

During Cinzano's ownership, Tenuta di Argiano was one of the Brunello di Montalcino estates that was investigated during the ''[[Brunellopoli]]'' scandal for suspicion of [[wine fraud|adulterating]] the wines with other [[grape varieties]] which, under ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita]]'' (DOCG) regulations are supposed to be made from 100% [[Sangiovese]]. In 2008, the suspected [[vintage]]s were impounded by government officials and eventually Tenuta di Argiano declassified the wines, selling them as "[[Super Tuscans]]" under the ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) designation instead of as Brunello di Montalcinos.&lt;ref name="Wine Spectator"/&gt; In February 2013 Cinzano sold the Tenuta di Argiano estate to an undisclosed "group of international investors" for reportedly near 50 million euros. Production of the estate is said to be around 120,000 bottles.&lt;ref name="Decanter 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2013/02/montalcino-accused-of-selling-out-to-foreign-investors |title=Montalcino Accused of Selling Out To Foreign Investors |last=Gobb |first=Rebecca |date=February 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4841">In [[economics]] and [[engineering]], the '''price–performance ratio''' refers to a product's ability to deliver performance, of any sort, for its price. Generally speaking, products with a lower price/performance ratio are more desirable, excluding other factors.

Price–performance is often written as '''cost–performance''' or '''cost–benefit'''.  Even though this term would seem to be a straightforward ratio, when price performance is improved, better, or increased, it actually refers to the performance divided by the price, in other words exactly the opposite ratio (i.e. an inverse ratio) to rank a product as having an increased price/performance.  

==Examples==

===Consumer and medical products===
According to futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil]], products start out as highly ineffective and highly expensive.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"/&gt;

Gradually, products become more effective and cheaper until they are highly effective and almost free to buy.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"/&gt; Some of the products that have followed this example include [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] medications (which are now affordable to the majority of AIDS sufferers{{which|date=September 2014}}), [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] programs, and [[digital camera]]s.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Kurzweil
  |first = Raymond
  |authorlink = Raymond Kurzweil
  |title = The Singularity is Near
  |publisher = [[Penguin Books]]
  |year = 2005
  |isbn = 0-14-303788-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, products that rely primarily on paper (e.g., newspapers and toilet paper) and/or fossil fuels (e.g., electricity in most countries and petroleum gasoline for automobiles) have only increased in price.  

This directly contradicts the trend of electronic gadgets like [[netbook]]s, [[desktop computer]]s, and [[laptop]] computers that also have been decreasing in price. However, the prevailing [[inflation rate]] of a country or province/state may negate the plummeting costs of software, AIDS medications, and/or digital cameras in certain regions along with certain governmental policies. This has the effect of keeping costs high in certain areas while they are dramatically reduced in others. 

In theory, this means that the rich people have earlier access to highly inefficient technologies, medical treatments, and [[Therapy|therapies]] (that are prototypical in nature) while the poor get access to these same products when they become more efficient and easier to manufacture several years down the road.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"/&gt;

===Business world===
During the latter 1990s, the cost–performance ratios of the larger [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller [[microcomputer]]s handling the same load. As a result, many of the older computer companies were shut down and people were [[unemployment|put out of work]]. However, most of them were able to be re-hired at the newer corporations after undergoing a series of re-training involving the newer technologies.

In the business world, there is usually a value associated with a typical cost–performance ratio analysis. This value can either be positive, neutral, or negative depending on the amount of money spent versus the results achieved by the spending of the available [[Financial capital|capital]]. A cost-performance ratio with a positive value (i.e. greater than 1) indicates that costs are running under budget.&lt;ref name="wideman"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.maxwideman.com/pmglossary/PMG_C11.htm#Cost%20Performance%20Indicator | title = Cost–performance ratio indicator | publisher = Max Wideman| date = | accessdate = 2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A negative value (i.e. less than 1) indicates that costs are running over budget.&lt;ref name="wideman"/&gt; However, a neutral cost-performance ratio (between 1.0 and 1.9) could suggest a certain degree of stagnation in the budget. [[Business trip]]s can also be factored into the cost–performance ratio because spending $50 to do a journey spanning {{convert|100|mi|km}} in two hours is a better cost–performance ratio than spending $105 to do the journey in one hour.

===Computer technology===
The term tends to be used quite a bit when comparing computer hardware. During the latter 1990s, the price–performance ratios of midrange and large [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller [[microcomputer]]s handling the same load. Many companies were forced out of the industry as this happened, including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Data General]] and many [[multiprocessor]] vendors such as [[Sequent Computer Systems]] and [[Pyramid Technology]].

'''Yosuán Crespo''' (born November 24, 1984 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]) is a Cuban businessman and [[computer scientist]]. Crespo cofounded EspacioCuba, one of the first Cuban real estate offices after the buying and selling of properties was authorized in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.time.com/2013/07/24/as-communist-cuba-slowly-reforms-capitalism-takes-hold-of-its-real-estate-market/ |title=As Communist Cuba Reforms, Capitalism Slowly Takes Hold of Its Real Estate Market |accessdate=December 18, 2015 |date=July 24, 2013 |publisher=Time }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has developed several software to manage [[Medical Genetics]] information and commercial websites.

==Early life and education==
Crespo was born in Havana, son of Marta García, accountant and Juan Francisco Crespo, Mechanical Engineer.

Crespo's passion for [[computing]] began when he had his first personal computer while studying in high school, it was a gift from his grandfather Arístides who also inspired him to study English language from an early age. He attended V. I. Lenin Exact Sciences Vocational Institute in Havana where earned a [[Bachelor degree]] in 2002. Later on he graduated with honors in [[Computer Sciences Engineering]] at the [[University of Information Science]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encuentrodesarrolladores.com/all-esd-events/esd-02 |title=Encuentro Social de Desarrolladores |accessdate=December 19, 2015 |date=May 30, 2015 |language=Spanish |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170203161237/http://esdcuba.co/all-esd-events/esd-02 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To carry out his university dissertation, Crespo developed the website for the Cuban Registry of [[Intellectual disability|Mentally Challenged Patients]] which contained the genetic characteristics of those people, allowing geneticists to manage information and visualize different reports to raise the quality of life and well-being of such patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcim.sld.cu/revista_19/articulo_htm/informaticagestion.htm |title=La Informática aplicada a la gestión de la información de los pacientes con discapacidad intelectual en Cuba |accessdate=December 19, 2015 |publisher=Revista Cubana de Informática Médica |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of labor life ==
Before finishing university Crespo participated in the development team of the Medical Genetics Computer System, a computer application that allows managing all the information associated with a medical genetics consultation and the studies this branch carries out. After graduating he ended up being the leader of that software development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://informatica2009.sld.cu/Members/aclaro/sistema-informatico-de-genetica-medica/ |title=Sistema Informático de Genética Médica |accessdate=December 18, 2015 |publisher=Informática 2009 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also participated in the computer processing of data collected in the clinical-genetic, psycho-pedagogical and social study of people with disability in the Republic of Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bvs.sld.cu/revistas/rcgc/v5n2-3/rcgc190111.html |title=Procesamiento informático de los datos del estudio clínico-genético, psicopedagógico y social de las personas con discapacidad en la República del Ecuador. Resultados y experiencias de trabajo |accessdate=December 18, 2015 |publisher=Revista Cubana de Genética Comunitaria |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his work in software development, Yosuán was an English professor at the University of Computer Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistaorbita.rimed.cu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=63 |title=Ejercicios para mejorar la comunicación oral en inglés de los estudiantes de la asignatura Idioma Extranjero 3 en la UCI. |accessdate=December 22, 2015 |publisher=Revista Órbita Científica |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businesses==
Crespo cofounded EspacioCuba in 2012, a real estate office and real estate portal, after the Cuban government authorized the buying and selling of properties in Cuba in November 2011 which opened an emergent [[real estate market]]. At the beginning he had to use computer programmer and photographer licenses to take pictures of the properties for sale and listing them in the real estate portal because [[real estate agent]]s weren't authorized in the island at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/cuba-real-estate-market_n_3185714.html |title=Cuba's Real Estate Market Grows Despite Hurdles |accessdate=December 18, 2015 |date=April 30, 2013 |work=Huffington Post |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129082934/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/cuba-real-estate-market_n_3185714.html |archivedate=January 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, in September 2013, the licenses to exercise as real estate agents were authorized and from that moment on this business became one of the first [[Real estate agency|real estate agencies]] in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aimgroup.com/2014/03/24/espaciocuba-com-debuts-after-cuba-legalizes-real-estate-sales/ |title=EspacioCuba.com debuts after Cuba legalizes real estate sales |accessdate=December 18, 2015 |date=March 24, 2014 |publisher=AIM Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to be involved in the Cuban real estate market he has offered advising to other businessmen interested in investing in Cuba.
